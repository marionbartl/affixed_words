Britain may need 0 % interest rate to avoid a depression , leading economist warns
Interest rates may have to be slashed to zero as Britain battles to avoid a full - blown depression , one of the country 's leading economists warns today .
The extraordinary claim from Charles Goodhart , a founding member of the Bank of England 's Monetary Policy Committee , came as Gordon Brown signalled that he wants to see further , aggressive cuts in the cost of borrowing .
Mr Goodhart , professor emeritus of banking and finance at the London School of Economics and a member of the MPC between 1997 and 2000 , tells Channel 4's Dispatches programme : ' Interest rates will go down from now , by how far and how fast
nobody knows .
Slashed :
The Bank of England may need to cut interest rates to 0 per cent , economists have warned
' They could go to zero .
They went to zero in Japan in the 1990s when the Japanese had a recession or depression which went on for a long time and was quite severe . '
Such a drastic move here would bring rates , currently 4.5 per cent , to their lowest level since the Bank of England was founded in 1694 .
Despite the Bank 's independence in setting rates , Mr Brown said yesterday : ' Inflation is coming down over the next few months and that will mean that it gives scope to the monetary authorities , including the Bank of England , round the world , to make a decision about interest rates . '
However , many experts warn that a rush to cut rates is ' too little , too late ' because Britain is already in what is predicted to be a long recession .
Mr Brown will today insist he is right to try to borrow his way out of the downturn despite growing warnings from economists that he could bankrupt the country .
The Prime Minister will say he will allow public borrowing to spiral still further -
hinting that he may even seek to use the money for tax cuts for workers , businesses and homeowners .
The Government also intends to bring forward spending on major state - funded housing , defence and energy projects to try to kickstart the economy .
But the proposal - based on the interventionist philosophies of John Maynard Keynes in the last century - is too risky with such a high level of national debt , according to experts .
Sixteen signatories of an open letter , who include Trevor Williams , chief economist at Lloyds TSB Corporate Markets and Peter Spencer , chief economic adviser to the Ernst & Young ITEM Club , wrote : ' We would like to dissent from the attempt to use a public works programme to spend the country 's way out of recession .
' Public expenditure has already risen very rapidly in recent years , and a further large rise would take the role of the state in many parts of the economy to such a dominant position that it would stunt the private sector 's recovery once recession is past .
' Occasional slowdowns are natural and necessary features of a market economy .
' It is inevitable that government expenditure and debt naturally rise in a recession but planned rises in government spending are misguided and discredited as a tool of economic management . '
But Mr Brown , speaking to business leaders and academics in central London , will today insist they are wrong .
' We will and can allow borrowing to rise to help restore demand and to come to the aid of workers , businesses and homeowners , ' he will say .
' The responsible course is to borrow now to maintain growth and output , and to reduce borrowing as a proportion of GDP as the economy recovers and tax receipts rise again . '
The Conservatives said yesterday Britain was entering recession with a higher proportion - of national debt than Nicaragua or Uganda .
Shadow Foreign Secretary William Hague told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show : ' We are going into the recession in one of the worst - prepared states of any of the developed countries , certainly of the G7 countries . '
Mr Brown will today repeat his calls for reform of the international financial system .
He told BBC Scotland 's Politics Show yesterday his only regret over his decade as Chancellor was that other countries failed to heed his advice , which he claimed could have averted the world economic crisis .
The Prime Minister said he was ' angry ' that banks were not supervised across international borders to act as an ' early warning system ' , ten years since he first argued for it .
' I have been pressing for this for years , ' he said .
' I actually think we 'll now get the changes that are necessary .
But while we wanted to go ahead with these changes , other countries did not . '
References in music reviews on the iTunes site are also affected
A temporary error with the UK's iTunes Music Store has caused some inoffensive song titles to be censored .
Tracks affected include Hot by Avril Lavigne , which is displayed as H*t , while The Cheeky Girls ' biggest hit has become Cheeky Song ( Touch My B*m ) .
An Apple spokesman said a " database glitch " occurred when the service was checked for explicit references , and would be fixed as soon as possible .
Profanities are regularly blanked out on the online music store .
Songs with adult content also carry warning labels stating " explicit " or " caution " .
J****y Cash
Other titles to be hit by the glitch include Long H*t Summer by Girls Aloud .
The company 's spokesman said they did not know why their software was picking up the word " hot " as an explicit reference .
' CENSORED ' SONG TITLES Smells Like T**n Spirit - Nirvana ( pictured ) K****r Queen - Queen H*t ' n ' Cold - Katy Perry I Though I Saw A P***y Cat - Danny Kaye E*****a - Madonna
He added that the " censorship " was not intentional .
Meanwhile , the word " gay " is permitted , but the program is picking up some references to " lesbian " and partially blanking them out .
Artist names are largely unaffected by the problem , but Johnnys including late legend Cash and Mathis have lost their first names .
The Pussycat Dolls are fully displayed , but a recorded version of The Owl and The Pussycat has fallen foul of the problematic iTunes programme .
Other words that have been mistakenly picked up include killer - while murder has escaped .
For those who like their PL History presented in avante guard beat poetry , a video of Steele & Gabriel 's 50 in 50 speech at JAOO is made to order .
Or as the link says :
A fun , artistic and enlightning presentation full of interesting facts - and who better to do it than Richard P. Gabriel and Guy L. Steele ( the great Quux ) .
Nothing more to say than the rallying cry ;
More cowbell !
Passing aside the Stephen Wright comic delivery of the two speakers , there are a lot of interesting thoughts , though very few are dwelled on .
I think the most interesting things were the languages that they chose as expositions for the major ideas that they covered .
Here 's the ones that I picked out ( though I ended up with only 49 ) :
If energy is the currency of life , biologists are closing in on the cost of living .
No matter whether you 're talking elephants or bacteria , a new study proposes that , pound for pound , all living things ' at - rest metabolisms use similar amounts of energy .
Though living things vary greatly in complexity and size , their energy usage falls between 3 and 90 watts per kilogram of biomass .
For comparison , a MacBook Pro is supposed to draw about 12 watts when operating from its battery .
" Our interpretation is that there are n't very many accidents in nature , so it 's not just a coincidence that all these different organisms fall within this narrow window , " said Peter Reich , an ecologist at the University of Minnesota , and a co-author of the work .
" That suggests that natural selection selects for this range . "
Using energy to stave off entropy is one of the basic functions of life .
Different forms of life use different energy sources .
Plants use photosynthesis to turn sunlight into chemical energy .
Other organisms feed on plants or other organisms to obtain the energy needed to sustain themselves .
The new paper suggests that no matter how an organism gets its energy , the basic biochemistry of life requires that all organisms ' cells use energy at fairly similar rates .
The new work means that if you had an elephant - sized mound of bacteria , it would use , within about an order of magnitude of variation , the same amount of energy as an actual elephant .
That contradicts earlier , highly - influential studies led by James Brown , Brian Enquist and Geoffrey West , of the University of New Mexico , University of Arizona and Los Alamos National Laboratory respectively .
They found a strong correlation between the size of an animal and its metabolism .
Under their rubric , small creatures used energy efficiently while large creatures did not .
As organisms grow larger , they produce less energy relative to their bulk .
The UNM ecologists claimed that this relationship between size and metabolic rate , known as allometric or power scaling , was a general law of life that resulted from the difficulty of transporting nutrients around larger and larger bodies .
" It 's been a very exciting theory that people tend to love or hate , " Reich said .
" It sounds like a general theory of relativity for biology ....
It 's a major advance because they are proposing something novel to unify us all and how we understand the world . "
But when scientists in individual areas , like Reich who specializes in forest ecology , began to look at the data , they found that the law did n't seem to hold for all types of living things .
The old model predicts that organisms ' metabolisms would vary by thousands of times , but Reich and his colleagues found that the metabolisms of living creatures were much more similar than that .
For example , an elephant is one trillion million times larger than a single - celled bacterium — that 's 20 orders of magnitude — but their metabolisms fall roughly within an order of magnitude .
" If there was power scaling , you 'd have a 4000 - fold metabolic variation .
Whereas we only see a 30 - fold variation , " Reich said .
" They 're not even anywhere in the ballpark of power scaling . "
Instead , the new Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences paper provides strong evidence that the basic energy usage of living creatures is much more universal than scientists ' anticipated .
" There are fundamental sweet spots for life , " Reich said .
And it appears his team has found one , at least here on Earth .

Harvard University chemists have built a centrifuge with some plastic tubing , tape , and an egg beater .
It can separate plasma from blood cells , and could help doctors in remote villages perform simple lab tests .
The researchers described their invention in the current issue of Lab on a Chip , which has published useful hacks in the past .
Last year , the same journal explained how to make microfluidic devices from Shrinky Dinks .
" Our advisor , Professor George Whitesides , has always been interested in unorthodox use of ordinary items , " said Sergey Shevkoplyas , a co-author of the centrifuge paper .

Stalactites are rock formations in caves that hang down from the cave ceiling , and they ’re formed by water containing dissolved minerals as it drips penetrates the cave ceiling and drips to the floor ( stalagmites are basically the same thing but sticking up from the floor instead ) .
Given that stalactites and stalagmites are formed by water , you might expect that they grow faster or slower with the seasons , at least in areas where the climate includes seasonal variations in precipitation .
After all , heavy rains add water to the water table and increase the growth rate of the stalactite as more water penetrates the cave .
For similar reasons , you could probably expect that year to year variations growth rate variations would occur if there were rainy periods and droughts .
According to a Nature News article , a stalagmite has been found in a Chinese cave that , when analyzed , was found to contain 1800 years worth of monsoon information .
Because the stalagmite had a large amount of uranium and few contaminants , the scientists who analyzed it were able to use radioisotope dating to very accurately measure the variations in monsoon strength .
What the scientists found was that for most of the last 1800 years , monsoons have cycled between being strong when the years were warmer ( as determined by other proxies ) and weak when the years were colder .
However , the correlation reversed after 1960 , suggesting , according to the paper ’s abstract , “ anthropogenic forcing superseded natural forcing as the major driver of AM changes in the late 20th century . ”
Unfortunately , I do n’t have access to the original Science paper so I ca n’t say whether the abstract ’s claim is accurate or not .
If anyone has access to it , I ’d greatly appreciate a review copy or something similar .

Heritage Foundation ’s math wrong on green jobs
A large number of economic studies have come out recently that claim to show that investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy sources creates more jobs than are lost in energy and carbon - intensive industries such as oil production .
As you might expect , there has been a backlash against these studies by groups who , for one reason or another , oppose the results .
The latest large think tank to come down against these green jobs studies is the Heritage Foundation .
Last week , Dr. David Kreutzer of Heritage ’s Center for Data Analysis released an analysis on the Heritage Foundation website that purports to debunk a couple of the studies .
Shortly thereafter , the Heritage Foundation analysis was itself targeted by the co-author of one of the studies , Robert Pollin on behalf of the Center for American Progress ( CAP ) , and the entirety of the Heritage analysis was attacked by Joseph Romm of Climate Progress .
According to Kreutzer ’s Heritage analysis , there are a number of flaws in the economics .
One is a thought experiment illustrating that a 30 % reduction in energy use , when accompanied by a 50 % increase in energy costs , can produce a net increase in energy cost .
This thought experiment supposedly shows that , since energy consumers will necessarily be spending more money , there ca n’t possibly be money saved by energy efficiency .
Kreutzer then goes on to say that a University of California study that found a significant number of jobs created in the state over the last 30 years as a result of energy efficiency is wrong and that the CAP Green Recovery study is based on a fallacy , and that all of the studies are wrong when it comes to job creation – large numbers of jobs will be lost , Kreutzer says , in all situations where carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) is priced .
My own limited analysis of the thought experiment makes me suspect of Kreutzer ’s analysis .
Here ’s part of the original thought experiment :
Suppose Jones used 1,000 kilowatt–hours ( kW–h ) when the price of electricity was $ 0.10 per kW–h .
He spent $ 100 on electricity ( 1,000 kW–h x $ 0.10 = $ 100 ) .
Now suppose the price rises to $ 0.15 per kW–h .
Responding to the higher price , Jones cuts his electricity consumption to 700 kW–h .
How much better off is Jones with the higher price ?
Most would say , since he is now spending $ 105 for less electricity ( 700 kW–h x $ 0.15 = $ 105 ) , he is worse off .
The details of the California provide an opportunity to compare this thought experiment to the real world .
According to Kreutzer ’s analysis , “ per capita electricity use in California is 40 percent less than the national average ” and “ Californians pay 36 percent more for their electricity . ”
In other words , Jones 1000 kWh energy use dropped to 600 kWh while his energy costs rose from $ 0.10 to $ 0.136 per kWh .
This results in Jones ’ bill falling from $ 100 to $ 81.60 ( 600 kWh x $ 0.136 = $ 81.60 ) .
This suggests that Kreutzer ’s original thought experiment is wrong , oversimplified to the point of uselessness , or both .
Kreutzer ’s analysis was further deconstructed by Robert Pollin as Pollin pointed out that the Green Recovery plan makes a very different argument than Kreutzer claims it does .
Pollin points out that the CAP plan claims a creation of 17 green jobs per $ 1 million spent in the “ green ” sector , vs. job creation in the oil industry of only 4.5 jobs per $ 1 million spent .
This is partly because green jobs – erecting wind turbines , retrofitting homes , etc. – require more manual labor than oil industry jobs do , and partly because green jobs keep the vast majority of the money spent within the U.S. economy , while only about 80 % of money provided to the oil industry would be spent within the U.S.
In addition , Kreutzer ’s analysis assumes implicitly that the money discussed in the Green Recovery plan will be offset by tax increases , something that Pollin explicitly rejects : “ in ‘ Green Recovery , ’ we do not propose any tax increases whatsoever in the short term . ”
And finally , if the models used by Pollin ( and described in detail in the Green Recovery plan , Appendix 1 – there is no similar discussion of the economic modeling used by Kreutzer ) are accurate , even if taxation were added over the long term after a stimulus , the net gain would still be 17 green jobs – 4.5 oil company jobs for a net gain of 12.5 jobs per $ 1 million invested .
Joe Romm has an even more detailed deconstruction of Kreutzer ’s analysis at Climate Progress .
In it Romm points out that Kreutzer misrepresents at least some of the conclusions of the studies he ’s critiquing .
For example , Kreutzer claims that the University of California study found that the state of California “ restricted access ” to energy when it actually did nothing of the sort .
Kreutzer ascribes California ’s loss of manufacturing base to the energy efficiency losses when , as Romm points out , most the entire U.S. has seen declines in manufacturing since 1980 .
Check out the link above for the rest of Romm ’s comments .

American Medical Association : address climate disruption
At their semi-annual meeting , the American Medical Association became the latest organization to call for their members to work and become educated about the adverse medical affects of climate disruption .
According to the press release , the AMA has a vested interest in addressing climate disruption because of the medical impacts that increased incidence of tropical disease , heatstroke and similar heat - related maladies , and respiratory problems such as asthma will have on medical doctors .

Australia considers large scale desalinization
Most of the nation of Australia has been in the grips of a major drought for a decade , and some of the most adversely affected areas are those that are most populated or are where crops are grown .
Australia ’s Bureau of Meteorology expects that there will be below average rainfall for the next several decades , not just the next few years .
As a result , the states of Western Australia , Queensland , South Australia and New South Wales are considering desalinization plants large enough to supply entire cities with fresh drinking water .
Critics do n’t like the plan for a variety of reasons , one of which is the plant ’s large - scale use of electricity , most likely derived from carbon - intensive coal power plants .
Local governments are trying to build huge plants ( such as the 45 gigaliter plant that supplies the city of Perth , population 1.6 million , with 17 % of it ’s potable water needs ) that are entirely powered by wind farms , with some success .
However , beyond the climate concerns is the super - briny water that is released back into the ocean after desalination that does n’t always mix efficiently with the sea water .
This could create very dense ( due to the salt content ) , low oxygen water that could create dead zones near the desalinization plant ’s brine outlets .
If the climate projections for the Colorado River are correct ( and we know that the Colorado River has a history of dropping to less than half of it ’s current flow , which is significantly less than the amount of water dedicated to all of the states in the Colorado River Compact ) , then it ’s only a matter of time before the cities of Southern California will need to create massive desalinization plants themselves .
Orange County ’s so - called toilet - to - tap program would help delay the need for such shoreline destroying facilities .

Rev. Cizek lobbying on environment in Australia
When most Americans think about environmentalism and evangelical Christians , they think of Dominionism , the school of Christian thought that focuses on God ’s command in Genesis 1:28 :
And God blessed them , and God said unto them , Be fruitful , and multiply , and replenish the earth , and subdue it : and have dominion over the fish of the sea , and over the fowl of the air , and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth .
In other words , most evangelicals are not generally considered the most environmentally conscious people in the United States .
However , the leader of the National Association of Evangelicals , Rev. Richard Cizek , is trying to change that image .
He ’s an evangelical of a decidedly different stripe , more into caring for God ’s creation than commanding it , and last week he was in Australia , trying to convince Australian evangelicals and Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to lobby the government on climate disruption .
If Rev. Cizek can help convince evangelicals that addressing climate disruption ( instead of ignoring it or actively making it worse ) and other environmental issues , especially those with a strong social justice aspect to them , that would be , in my opinion , a very good thing .

Expectations on Obama ’s changes to energy and climate policy
It ’s only been a week since Barack Obama became President - elect .
In some states the voting is n’t even complete yet , but already the experts are predicting what President - elect Obama will do starting at noon , January 20 , 2009 .
Below is a sampling of those expectations as they relate to climate disruption and energy .
According to a story in the Charleston Gazette of Charleston , West Virginia , the National Mining Association does n’t expect Obama to kill off the coal industry .
The United Mine Workers union expects Obama to push hard for improved mine safety and to put control over mine safety back into the hands of a miners ’ advocate instead of an industry representative .
A story in the Washington Post says that , while no plans to overturn Bush administration executive orders have been finalized , 48 advisers have been working for a month already identifying executive orders and regulations that will be overturned by the Obama administration immediately following Obama ’s swearing in .
Some of the regulations expected to be overturned is the ban on embryonic stem cell research , the global gag rule restricting abortion discussions in U.S. aid programs , and permitting California to implement its own CO 2 restrictions that are more stringent than EPA regulations .
restrictions that are more stringent than EPA regulations .
According to a San Francisco Chronicle story , oil executives are nervous about whether Obama will reinstate the OCS drilling ban and impose a windfall profits tax .
Alternative and renewable energy executives , on the other hand , are giddy with expectation that Obama will implement his campaign ’s energy plan such as a green jobs program for construction of solar and wind farms and a renewable energy standard .
The executives interviewed for the story did not expect a cap - and - trade program immediately .
A story in the Great Falls Tribune of Great Falls , Montana , finds that there are n’t many changes expected in farm policy as it relates to the environment from the Bush to the Obama administrations .
The VIPs the Tribune interviewed for the story did n’t expect that Obama ’s campaign promise to reopen NAFTA will actually come to that , and they do n’t think that he ’ll work to overturn new rules on emissions from livestock feed lots .
Finally , according to the Grand Junction Free Press , Colorado Senator Ken Salazar expects a number of significant changes in the Bureau of Land Management ’s approach to managing public lands .
The Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States expects that western slope communities with access to oil shale will not have the economic growth under the Obama administration that they would have had under McCain , and Sen .
Salazar expects that the regulations on how oil shale could be commercially developed will be very carefully scrutinized in 2009 .

Japan PM Fukuda quits over parliament deadlock Reuters
Published : Monday September 1 , 2008
Print This Email This By Linda Sieg
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Unpopular Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda resigned on Monday over a political deadlock , becoming the second leader to quit abruptly in less than a year and threatening a policy vacuum as Japan slips towards a recession .
Fukuda , 72 , has been struggling to cope with a divided parliament where opposition parties have the power to delay legislation .
His sudden departure has deepened doubts about his conservative party 's ability to cling to power or even hold together after ruling Japan for most of the past six decades .
Fukuda has also suffered recently from conflict between his Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) and its junior coalition partner , the New Komeito , which was wary of letting him lead the ruling bloc into an election that must be held in the next year .
" If we are to prioritize the people 's livelihoods , there cannot be a political vacuum from political bargaining , or a lapse in policies .
We need a new team to carry out policies , " Fukuda said .
" I thought it would be better for someone else to do the job than me . "
Taro Aso , an outspoken , right - leaning former foreign minister and LDP secretary - general , is the frontrunner to succeed Fukuda but pressure is likely to mount for an early general election .
A government economic relief plan unveiled on Friday that included a promise of income tax cuts and about $ 16.5 billion in extra spending this year to ease the pain of rising prices , failed to revive Fukuda 's popularity among voters .
" This is two prime ministers in a row ...
The political vacuum will be at least two weeks , more like a month .
Nothing will get done .
It is quite likely that there will be pressure for the LDP to call an election as soon as possible , " said Koichi Nakano , a political science professor at Sophia University .
" Certainly , this is not anything that can be condoned .
It is unheard of , even by Japan 's standards . "
Japan has had 10 prime ministers since 1993 , when the current head of the main opposition Democratic Party , Ichiro Ozawa , left the LDP and sparked political upheaval that saw the long - ruling party briefly lose its grip on power .
The dollar rose above 108 yen and the euro back up toward 158 yen on the surprise news , which caught traders off guard in a thinner market than usual because of a U.S. holiday .
Analysts said Fukuda 's sudden resignation would likely be negative for Japanese shares and a bit of a minus for the yen .
VOTERS GRUMPY
The bespectacled Fukuda , a moderate conservative who favors close ties with Japan 's Asian neighbors , took office last September after his predecessor , Shinzo Abe , also suddenly resigned after just a year in office .
Speculation had been simmering that the unpopular Fukuda might be replaced by the LDP ahead of a general election that must be held by September next year but could come sooner .
But the surprise timing of his departure will create the very political vacuum he said he wanted to avoid at a time when Japan 's economy is nearing a recession .
" It seems the process of selecting his successor , no matter who is chosen , will likely create discord among his party , " said Fumiyuki Nakanishi , head of investment information at SMBC Friend Securities .
" Political confusion is a negative factor . "
Ordinary Japanese were both angry and resigned .
" It can not be helped .
I thought it 's about time for him to quit , " said 26 - year - old Seina Korenaga , waiting for her husband in a downtown Tokyo nightspot .
" He did not have leadership , " said her twin sister Reina Sato .
" It 's irresponsible . "
Fukuda 's resignation does not automatically mean an election .
However , whoever the LDP picks as its leader , and thus the next prime minister , might chose to go to the polls early to take advantage of any rise in public support .
The main opposition Democratic Party 's No.2 leader , Yukio Hatoyama , rubbished Fukuda and called for an early poll .
" I am furious that he treats parliament so lightly and ignores the people , " Hatoyama told reporters .
" Basically , he should call a general election .
That is the will of the people . "
The next session of parliament had been scheduled to open on September 12 , but Kyodo news agency quoted a government source as saying it was likely to be postponed .
The uncertainty also casts deep doubts over whether Japan can extend beyond January a naval refueling mission in the Indian Ocean in support of U.S. - led operations in Afghanistan .
LDP FUTURE GRIM ?
Initially popular , Fukuda 's popularity sank on doubts about his leadership in the face of the divided parliament .
A poll by the Nikkei business daily released on Monday showed support for Fukuda 's cabinet fell nine points to 29 percent , back to levels before a cabinet reshuffle last month .
Aso was way ahead as the most popular person to lead Japan .
Analysts said the next LDP prime minister would face similar woes given the parliamentary deadlock and the party 's rusting political machine and scandal - tainted image .
Talk of a broad realignment of party alliances has been simmering since the opposition took control of the upper house last year .
" The question is whether this will mark the dismantling of the coalition and possibly the end of the LDP , " said Jonathan Allum , Japan strategist at KBC Financial Products .
" We will not know the answer to that question for some time . "

ELECTION NIGHT left millions feeling elated with the end of eight long years of Republican rule , but there was a bitter note at the end of the night -- the passage of Proposition 8 in California , which bans same - sex marriage .
That bitterness erupted into demonstrations the next night in California cities as opponents of the ban voiced their anger at having had a hard - won civil right for same - sex partners to marry taken away .
The narrow victory of the referendum , by a 52 to 48 percent margin , was especially devastating to the estimated 18,000 gay and lesbian couples who have been married since the California Supreme Court legalized same - sex marriage in a ruling last May .
In response , thousands of supporters of equal marriage rights took to the streets in San Francisco , San Diego , the Los Angeles area and elsewhere .
In San Francisco , more than 1,500 attended a vigil at City Hall called by Marriage Equality California .
Some held signs reading , " I woke up with less rights than I had yesterday " and " Separation of hate and state .
No on Prop 8 ! "
One speaker told the crowd : " We will not discouraged , not be distracted , not be destroyed .
We 've come so far , [ and ] we will have victory and liberty for our community . "
Demonstrations called after the Prop 8 same - sex marriage ban passed took to the streets
In West Hollywood , a similar demonstration called by organizers of the " No on Prop 8 " campaign drew many as 5,000 people .
Several spontaneous marches took off from the original protest and took over the streets , leading to confrontations with police .
At least seven people were arrested .
Carlos , one of the first two peole to be arrested , described the mood in an interview :
It was supposed to be an official " No on 8 " campaign rally that was n't supposed to block traffic .
It was supposed to be contained in two blocks .
People were going to get together and hear speeches and go home .
It was n't meant to go beyond that .
Folks tried to block traffic once or twice .
First , it did n't succeed , but then it did , and we blocked traffic all four ways in this busy Hollywood intersection ...
All along , the " No on 8 " campaign was trying to be careful not to offend anyone .
They even instructed us not to confront the " Yes on 8 " people .
But we did n't feel like moving off the street ... People were angry , but also hopeful at being out there .
The victory of Prop 8 -- after a record - breaking campaign by right - wing groups , among them , the Mormon Church - - hits personally with tens of thousands of people in California .
" I just got married last Sunday , " Jason Louis told Agence France Press .
" We did it two days before the Election Day because I knew that ' Yes on Prop 8 ' could win .
Now we do n't know what 's going to happen , but for sure , it will be a long , long legal battle . "
The following day , another 3,000 protesters marched near a temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints in the Westwood section of Los Angeles , to draw attention to the Mormon Church 's bankrolling of the Prop 8 campaign .
Other upcoming protests have already been scheduled for Los Angeles , San Francisco and Sacramento -- including a demonstration at the called by Californians Against 8 for the Capital Building in Sacramento on November 9 at 1 p.m .
Such demonstrations are not only a sign of the anger , but an example of people refusing to be silent in the face of injustice .
As Carlos pointed out , however , such largely spontaneous outpourings have to be part of a bigger organizing effort to fight for marriage equality :
I think it makes sense to be more organized .
We just needed to react .
Now we need to think about our goals .
The " No on 8 " volunteer network is huge .
[ At the protest ] it felt like , " We 've been doing this for months .
It passes , and it can't be over . "
The guy I was taken to jail with made the connection with the Stonewall riots .
One of the chants we did for awhile was " Gay , straight , Black , white -- gay marriage , civil rights . "
People were aware that they could n't just sit at home .
HOW COULD such a ban pass in a " blue " state that went strongly for Obama ?
Initially , Prop 8 looked like it would be defeated handily - - a reflection of the political shift on gay rights issues nationally .
But opinion polls showed a tighter contest in the final weeks after massive amounts of money were put behind the measure .
In all , some $ 74 million was spent on the campaign around Prop 8 , a record for a referendum .
Some $ 22 million alone came from members of the Mormon Church .
Other prominent supporters included the Catholic Church , evangelicals and other conservatives , who falsely claimed , as part of a massive ad blitz , that if Prop 8 failed , " gay marriage would be taught in schools " and churches that opposed same - sex marriage would lose tax - exempt status .
But money was n't the only reason Prop 8 passed .
If those who voted for Obama in the state had all voted against Prop 8 , or at least abstained , the measure would have been defeated .
But according to CNN exit polls , Black voters favored Prop 8 by a 70 - 30 margin .
Latinos supported the measure by a slight margin , and whites were evenly split .
In other words , though huge strides have been made over the past several decades in terms of the growing acceptance of the rights of LGBT people , there is still a long way to go .
Another reason for Prop 8 's success can be traced to the Democrats .
While claiming to be the party of inclusion , few leading Democrats were vocal about the need to oppose Prop 8 in the run-up to the election , preferring to dodge the issue in the hopes that it would n't become a central focus of the national election .
Thus , for example , while the Obama - Biden campaign officially opposed Prop 8 , one of the most memorable moments from the presidential and vice presidential debates was Joe Biden emphatically agreeing with Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin , and insisting that " neither Barack Obama nor I support redefining from a civil side what constitutes marriage .
We do not support that . "
In the run-up to the election , supporters of Prop 8 sent out a mailer that targeted the Black community , featuring a large picture of Barack Obama with his quote , " I 'm not in favor of gay marriage , " backed with African American ministers in support of Prop 8 .
Another factor undercutting opposition to Prop 8 was the strategy pursued by the " No on Prop 8 " campaign itself , which chose to couch its arguments in somewhat vague terms of civil rights , rather than making a strong defense of same - sex marriage .
UNFORTUNATELY , CALIFORNIA was not the only state where anti-gay bigotry won the day when it came to ballot initiatives .
Anti-same sex marriage initiatives passed in Florida and Arizona , and Arkansas voters approved a cruel ban , aimed at gays and lesbians , on unmarried couples being adoptive or foster parents .
Despite these setbacks , there were some victories over the right on other fronts .
In South Dakota , a draconian ban on almost all abortions , except those performed because of rape or incest or to protect a woman 's health , was defeated .
Colorado voters overwhelmingly rejected a proposal that would have granted the rights of a human being to any fertilized egg - - outlawing not only abortion , but many types of birth control .
And , in California , voters rejected a proposal that would have required parental notification and consent for women under the age of 18 seeking abortions .
Massachusetts voters rejected a right - wing proposal to eliminate the state 's income tax .
In Oregon , a right - wing proposal requiring school districts limit foreign - language instruction for non-English - speaking students failed .
Unfortunately , voters approved an anti-affirmative action initiative in Nebraska spearheaded by conservative Ward Connerly .
The initiative will affect college enrollment , employment opportunity and race - based scholarships .
As Socialist Worker went to press , it was still unclear whether an identical measure would pass in Colorado .
AC / DC Attempt To Thwart Firewalls With Excel - Based Video
Aussie hard rockers AC / DC have come up with an unusual promotion for their recent Black Ice album — an ASCII art video for the lead single “ Rock N Roll Train ” which is embedded in an Excel spreadsheet .
The theory is that this should let people at work access the video even if their IT department has blocked video and music feeds — after all , everyone needs to be able to download spreadsheets , right ?
The reality is a little more complicated : Excel 2007 users will likely find that the active content features needed to access the video will be switched off by default , and if your administrator has blocked your ability to switch them back on , then there ’s no Young brothers for you .
But if that ’s not an issue , it ’s an impressive piece of work .
Research will be presented at American Society for Cell Biology conference
A possible new therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer , the most lethal form of human cancer , has been identified in the proteins whose DNA recipe comes from gene , " Seven - In - Absentia , " according to researchers at the American Society for Cell Biology ( ASCB ) 48th Annual Meeting , Dec. 13 - 17 , 2008 in San Francisco .
In their studies with the fruit fly , Drosophila melanogaster , at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine in Minnesota , scientists found a link between the " Seven - In - Absentia " or SINA gene and the aggressive cellular transformation , oncogenesis and metastasis that characterize pancreatic cancer .
Scientists already knew that a mutation in the K - RAS gene underlies the abnormal , excessive cell growth of pancreatic cancer .
Because the mutated form of this growth - promoting gene is hyperactivated , a major signaling pathway that drives cell growth is in over - drive in most patients with this cancer .
The " Seven - In - Absentia - Homolog " ( SIAH ) protein seems to work as a check and balance mechanism in the K - RAS pathway by chewing up and turning off the excessive growth - promoting proteins produced by the hyperactive , mutated form of the gene , says Amy Tang whose Mayo lab conducted the research .
" By attacking the SIAH - based protein degrading machinery , we block tumor formation in one of the most aggressive human cancers cells known , " she reports .
Because of these results , SIAH may be an attractive new target for novel anti-RAS and anti-cancer therapy in pancreatic cancer , the median survival of which is only six months , and the mortality rate is 95 percent .
By inhibiting SIAH function , Tang and her colleagues were able to completely abolish both tumorigenesis and metastasis of human pancreatic cancer cells that were growing in " nude " mice that have immune system deficits that prevent them from rejecting foreign tissue .
" It is likely to move into the clinical setting for study as an interventional treatment in pancreatic cancer in human patients , " Tang says , referring to the SIAH inhibition .
SINA produces a family of RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligases .
In all creatures , ubiquitin ligases turn cell pathways on or off by degrading proteins .
In humans , the SIAH ubiquitin ligases sit smack in the middle of the molecular pathway that leads to pancreatic cancer , Tang explains .
The Tang lab found that SIAH ubiquitin ligases were specifically and markedly " upregulated " in pancreatic cancers .
The increased SIAH expression seemed to correlate with increased grades and aggressiveness of pancreatic cancer .
Moreover , SIAH is normally required for mammalian K - RAS signal transduction .

Mr. Ramanujan 's methods were so terse and novel and his presentation so lacking in clearness and precision , that the ordinary [ mathematical reader ] , unaccustomed to such intellectual gymnastics , could hardly follow him .
Hardy had already received 120 theorems from Ramanujan in the first two letters [ from 1913 ] , but there were many more results and theorems to be found in [ Ramanujan 's ] notebook .
Hardy saw that some were wrong , some were already discovered and the rest were new breakthroughs .
Ramanujan left a deep impression on Hardy and Littlewood .
Littlewood commented , " I can believe that he's at least a Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi " , while Hardy said he " can compare him only with [ Leonhard ] Euler or Jacobi . "
Ramanujan spent nearly five years in Cambridge collaborating with Hardy and Littlewood and published a part of his findings there .
Hardy and Ramanujan had highly contrasting personalities .
Their collaboration was a clash of different cultures , beliefs and working styles .
Hardy was an atheist and an apostle of proof and mathematical rigour , whereas , Ramanujan was a deeply religious man and relied very strongly on his intuition .
While in England , Hardy tried his best to fill the gaps in Ramanujan 's education without interrupting his spell of inspiration .
The limitations of his knowledge were as startling as its profundity .
Here was a man who could work out modular equations and theorems ... to orders unheard of , whose mastery of continued fractions was ... beyond that of any mathematician in the world , who had found for himself the functional equation of the zeta function and the dominant terms of many of the most famous problems in the analytic theory of numbers ; and yet he had never heard of a doubly - periodic function or of Cauchy 's theorem , and had indeed but the vaguest idea of what a function of a complex variable was ...

You 're not going to help Mozart emerge by not having Salieri and his ilk to teach him .
That 's just Ramanujan Syndrome in my book - the romance of the self - taught .
Not everyone needs formal education , but good education never stifled anybody .
In the first of my recent posts on the technological singularity , I remarked on something I called the " Ramanujan Syndrome " .
Modern biographers of the famous Tamil mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan have often noted that his spiritual devoutness was over - romanticized , as contemporaries such as G. H. Hardy observed .
Equally , however , there has in recent decades been a tendency to view his lack of formal training before the age of about 25 ( in 1914 ) as a distinction , almost glamorous M. T. Narayana Iyengar , editor of the , wrote : This reminded me of Abel 's comment on Gauss , that he was like a fox who erased his tracks in the sand with his tail .
Inscrutability , too , has been an over - romanticized trait of many mathematicians .
Wikipedia reports of Ramanujan 's work with Hardy from 1914 - 1919 : ( Emphasis added above . )
Hardy himself wrote : I remarked : Ramanujan definitely faced strong culture shock and what we would today consider a kind of national chauvinism , but was it a good or bad thing that he remained " undiscovered " for so long ?
I think that nowadays , some of us tend to think of the rigid orthodoxy of academia in developed countries as a limiting factor .
I also think that this is a mistake of attribution . , being self - taught can allow natural talent to unfold in an unprecedented way ; but more often , lack of education ( formal or otherwise ) can cause it to collapse on itself .
Just as it was an apocryphal legend that Ramanujan could n't prove most of the astoundingly insightful theorems he came up with , it seems unlikely that his achievements would have diminished by coming to Cambridge earlier , or having the benefit of a thorough education in mathematics such as he began to receive , partially and belatedly , from the British system .

A few years ago , in these very pages , Bruce McCall wrote a flattering review of my book “ My Goodness : A Cynic ’s Short - Lived Search for Sainthood . ”
I was grateful for the praise , particularly coming from someone I admired and envied .
But toward the end of the review , McCall said something that caught me completely off guard .
“ Somewhere , ” he wrote , “ Mencken is beaming . ”
No , he was n’t .
H. L. Mencken , a self - absorbed curmudgeon , would n’t have thought much of my efforts .
He looked down his nose at everybody , especially those not to the manor born .
Mencken , now or then , dead or alive , could n’t have cared less what I wrote .
He was from Baltimore , where they keep the beaming to an absolute minimum .
Anyway , the book was n’t that good .
This brings us to the least - discussed subject in the world of belles - lettres : book reviews that any author worth his salt knows are unjustifiably enthusiastic .
Authors are always complaining that reviewers missed the whole point of “ Few Mourn the Caballero , ” or took the quote about the merry leper ballerinas out of context , or overlooked the allusions to Octave Mirbeau , or did n’t mention that the author once jilted the critic after he kept begging her to go out on a double date dressed as one of the Boleyn sisters .
Authors are always complaining that reviewers maliciously cited the least incandescent , least Pushkinian passages in the book , or have a grudge against them because of something that happened the night the Khmer Rouge or Joy Division broke up , or only said mean things because the author went to Exeter while the reviewer had to settle for Andover .
What makes this bellyaching so unseemly is that the vast majority of book reviews are favorable , even though the vast majority of books deserve little praise .
Authors know that even if one reviewer hates a book , the next 10 will roll over like pooches and insist it ’s not only incandescent but luminous , too .
Reviewers tend to err on the side of caution , fearing reprisals down the road .
Also , because they generally receive but a pittance for their efforts , they tend to view these assignments as a chore and write reviews that read like term papers or reworded press releases churned out by auxiliary sales reps .
This is particularly true in the mystery genre , where the last negative review was written in 1943 .
Fashion - conscious Daniel Hurley , who was “ lavish ” in his use of deodorants and hair gels , suffered heart problems “ almost certainly ” induced by solvents in the can .
Consultant pathologist Dr Andrew Hitchcock , who carried out a post mortem , said he found no evidence of substance abuse , or any presence of life - threatening disease , alcohol or drugs .
Coroner Dr Robert Hunter said the cause of death was “ cardiac arrhythmia ” – an abnormal heart rhythm – exacerbated by exposure to solvents .
He said he was satisfied that Unilever , the makers of Lynx , give enough warning on their cans that excessive amounts were not to be used in confined spaces .
But he stressed : “ I do not know how many people read the warnings about exposure awareness .
People need to know about the risks that these products have on the cardio - vascular system Coroner Dr Robert Hunter
People need to know about the risks that these products have on the cardio - vascular system . ”
He recorded a verdict of accidental death on Daniel , of Sandiacre , near Nottingham , who died in hospital five days after his father found him unconscious in the bath .
Mr Robert Hurley told the hearing in Derby on Wednesday that his son was proud of his appearance and was “ lavish ” in his use of deodorants and hair gels .
“ He was always putting gel on his hair and spraying deodorant and it was quite common for him to spray his clothing as well , ” Mr Hurley said .
Three weeks earlier , Daniel , whom his father said was a “ fit and healthy young man ” , had also collapsed in the bathroom but made an immediate recovery .
Mr Hurley said on the day that Daniel died he had been making tea while his son was in the adjacent bathroom of their home .
“ I shouted to see if he was OK , ” he said , “ I heard nothing so I shouted again but did not get a reply .
I forced the door open and found Daniel in the bath .
“ I pulled him out on to the floor and started cardio - pulmonary resuscitation .
I checked for his heart rate and his breath but he was not breathing . ”
Daniel ’s mother Lynsey called an ambulance which rushed him to Nottingham ’s Queen ’s Medical Centre where he was treated in intensive care , but died on January 12 this year .
Consultant pathologist Dr Hitchcock said : “ What we have in this case is someone who may have had a cardiac abnormality in the presence of the solvent .
“ There is a very reasonable assumption that the passive inhalation of the solvent almost certainly led to his death . ”
Each Lynx can carries a 90 - word list of directions for use , warning that the product should be kept out of the reach of children and not sprayed near the eyes or naked flames .
The last sentence of this reads : “ Use in well ventilated places , avoid prolonged spraying ” .
A Lynx spokesman said : “ We would like to express our most sincere condolences to the friends and family of Daniel Hurley after this tragic accident . ”
Daniel ’s parents were yesterday too upset to talk about their son ’s death .
His mother Lynsey , 34 , paid tribute to her son on an internet site soon after his death .
She said : “ He is my first born son .
“ He was my reason for life for so long , he inspired me to better myself , he was so very , very special in so many ways .
( CNN ) -- Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , this year 's Republican vice presidential nominee , spoke with CNN's Wolf Blitzer on " The Situation Room " on Wednesday .
Gov. Sarah Palin says she will support President - elect Barack Obama and his new administration .
Among the topics discussed was the new president - elect , Barack Obama ; affirmative action and boosting the troubled economy .
Here is a partial transcript of the interview , edited for length .
WOLF BLITZER : Let 's talk a little bit about what 's going on in our country right now .
It 's a pretty historic moment when you think about it .
The first African - American president , President - elect Barack Obama .
This is historic .
What does it mean to you ?
GOV .
SARAH PALIN : It 's historic , and I think this time is full of optimism .
And it's an opportunity for everybody to get it together and start working together .
For us as Republicans to reach out to Barack Obama and the new administration that will be ushered in and offer the solutions that we see for meeting some of America 's great challenges right now .
This is an opportunity to all be working together .
And of course , President - elect Obama had promised also bipartisan efforts to meet the challenges .
So let 's seize this opportunity ; let 's take him up on that offer .
And let 's start working together .
BLITZER : Are you ready to help him ?
PALIN : Absolutely .
Especially on energy independence , energy security that we need for this nation , being the governor of an energy - producing state , knowing that we have the domestic solutions there in our state and in other energy - producing states .
I 'm more than willing and able to help President - elect Obama to start tapping into the domestic solutions that we have now so we can quit being so reliant on foreign sources of energy .
Watch Palin say she 's ready to help »
BLITZER : So if he reaches out to you and says , Gov. Palin , I need your help on energy or some other issues , kids with special needs , for example , and says , I want you to be part of a commission , you would be more than happy to say , yes , Mr. President .
PALIN : It would be my honor to assist and support our new president and the new administration , yes .
And I speak for other Republicans , other Republican governors also , they being willing also to , again , seize this opportunity that we have to progress this nation together , a united front .
BLITZER : Because , you know , during a campaign , every presidential campaign , things are said , it 's tough , as you well know ; it gets sometimes pretty fierce out there .
And during the campaign , you said this , you said : " This is not a man who sees America as you see it and how I see America . "
And then you went on to say : " Someone who sees America , it seems , as being so imperfect that he is palling around with terrorists who would target their own country . "
PALIN : Well , I still am concerned about that association with Bill Ayers .
And if anybody still wants to talk about it , I will , because this is an unrepentant domestic terrorist who had campaigned to blow up , to destroy our Pentagon and our U.S. Capitol .
That 's an association that still bothers me .
And I think it 's still fair to talk about it .
However , the campaign is over .
That chapter is closed .
Now is the time to move on and to , again , make sure that all of us are doing all that we can to progress this nation .
Watch Palin say she 's still concerned about Ayers connection »
Keep us secure , get the economy back on the right track , and many of us do have some ideas on how to do that , and hopefully we 'll be able to put all of that wisdom and experience to good use together .
BLITZER : So looking back , you do n't regret that tough language during the campaign ?
PALIN : No , and I do not think that it is off - base nor mean - spirited , nor negative campaigning to call someone out on their associations and on their record .
And that 's why I did it .
BLITZER : I just want to sort of footnote .
Was that your idea , or did somebody write those lines for you ?
PALIN : It was a collaborative effort there in deciding how do we start bringing up some of the associations that perhaps would be impacting on an administration , on the future of America .
But again , though , Wolf , knowing that it really -- at this point , I do n't want to point fingers backwards and play the blame game , certainly , on anything that took place in terms of strategy or messaging in the campaign .
Now is the time to move forward together , start progressing America .
...
BLITZER : Should Congress go forward right now with another economic stimulus package to help the struggling middle class ?
PALIN : I do want to see the struggling middle class be the ones at the end of the day who are not stuck with the bills and stuck with the burdens .
But I am not one , again , to believe that it should be just assumed that it 's taxpayer bailout that will be the solution to all of the problems , all of the financial challenges that our nation is facing .
Supportive of the $ 700 billion initial , now hearing more rumor , more speculation of even greater amounts being poured into that .
There again , need more information but not being so enthused about a second , a third , a fourth stimulus package .
BLITZER : President Bush only has , what , 2 ½ months or so left .
What would you like to see him do in these remaining days and weeks ?
What 's the most important thing he should be doing right now ?
PALIN : He is already doing that .
And that is reaching out to Barack Obama and to both potential new Cabinet members also , and those who we know will be in the Cabinet , reaching out to them .
And not being one to stay away , to shy away from addressing the challenges that we have today , working with the new administration and start ushering in some solutions .
So I appreciate that he has already done that .
And that bodes well for our president also .
And other things also that bode well for President Bush and keeping our country safe for the last seven years with no new attack on the homeland , those things that I think we cannot lose sight of , that President Bush has allowed for progress in those areas in our nation .
You know , I want to do a shoutout to our president and thank him for that .
BLITZER : Even though he may have hurt you and John McCain in terms of becoming president and vice president ?
PALIN : You know , I think that there is so much blame to go around , if you will , in terms of why it was that the Republican ticket did not win .
And , it -- that 's being attributed to , we did n't get the Hispanic vote , that really hurt ; we were outspent tremendously because of course Obama took the private financing ; John McCain stuck to his promise of just keeping the public financing of the campaign , so greatly outspent ; Barack Obama was a great campaigner , he had a very strong organization .
So many reasons , I 'm not going to look backwards there again and point to just President Bush and the administration as to why our ticket did n't prevail .
...
BLITZER : Let 's talk about affirmative action right now .
It 's a sensitive subject .
Now that there is a president - elect who is African - American , do you believe it is time to get rid of affirmative action in our country ?
PALIN : I am one to believe in equal opportunity for everyone .
And there probably are some specific policies that it is time that America can kind of turn that page , understanding that with the intent of treating everybody equally and providing equal opportunity in the work place and in education , there are some specific policies that I 'm sure we can move beyond .
And here again , as Barack Obama prepares to take this office of Washington and of Lincoln , what progress our nation has made in not allowing race to be prohibitive at all -- a prohibitive factor in an election .
I 'm so proud of America and very happy to see what Barack Obama -- he has accomplished this for himself , but also for our nation , for our children to know that race is not a factor , cannot be a factor , cannot be a ceiling or a prohibition towards progress .
BLITZER : Let 's talk about some of the other issues .
And we have a question , one of our iReporters sent this in .
Eric Olson of Savage , Minnesota .
He said he 's a Democrat , he voted for Barack Obama , but he had this question .
PALIN : OK .
BLITZER : " Gov. Palin , before the election , you were speaking with James Dobson of Focus on the Family .
and you said that you were confident that God would do the right thing for America on November 4th .
Did God do the right thing for America ? "
PALIN : I do n't know if that was my specific quote .
But I do believe that there is purpose in everything .
And for me personally I put my life in God 's hands and ask him to -- do n't let me miss some open door that he has for me , and I 'll travel through that .
I think the same thing for our nation as we seek God 's guidance , his wisdom , his favor and protection over our nation , that at the end of the day , that the right thing is done .
And I do believe that prayers were answered , others who prayed across this nation in the election that this nation would be protected , that we would be safe , that we would be prosperous and favored .
I believe that prayer is answered .
BLITZER : All right .
Fair enough .
What does Barack Obama have to do right now in your opinion to show that he 's going to reach out to Republicans and independents and work in a bipartisan way ?
PALIN : He needs to do what I did when I was elected governor of Alaska and that is you do n't use a fear ( phonetic ) litmus test of partisanship .
You do not look to someone 's party affiliation but you look to fill your Cabinet positions especially with the best of the best .
That 's what I did as the governor of Alaska , appointing Democrats , independents , Republicans , all to work in a team effort , really walking the walk , not just talking the talk , not just that rhetoric of you know , an ability that 's preached to reach across the aisle but he 's really going to have to walk that and he can do that by appointing others who are not just a member of his own " Democrat " Party and I think we 're going to see that .
BLITZER : Here is another question from Dan Waun of Lansing , Michigan .
He was undecided .
He says he leaned McCain at one point ; he was for Bush in ' 04 .
He ended up voting for Barack Obama .
This is his question .
" What would you propose the GOP do to reconcile this ideological shift in order to regain moderates and independents who so movingly voted for President - elect Obama ? "
He is referring to the ideological shift .
Conservatives , social religious based versus the more moderate , pragmatic independents in the middle .
PALIN : Well , if there is some kind of perception that conservatives and those who maybe represent the conservative base are not pragmatic and are not -- thinking along those lines that you put obsessive partisanship aside than you know I beg to differ with the whole premise of his question .
Certainly this is an opportunity , though , too , bring people together , to unite and start finding the solutions to America 's great challenges but as you 're reading these viewers ' questions , got any questions from anybody who voted for McCain ?
BLITZER : I think we do but we 're going to get to that .
PALIN : Oh , good !
OK !
...
BLITZER : Here is another question from Chris Plumstead of Cumberland , Maine .
Let me read it to you .
" I was wondering how you plan on dealing with a convicted felon as senator of your state . "
Referring --
He is referring to Ted Stevens .
PALIN : Right !
BLITZER : He may or may not be re-elected .
We do n't know .
But what are your thoughts ?
PALIN : Well , and after the four counts , the felony counts , in the ...
BLITZER : Seven .
PALIN : Seven .
Yeah .
After they came back .
And I called for him to step down .
He chose not to .
Now it is in the hands of the U.S. Senate .
It takes two thirds vote to expel .
It 's up to the U.S. Senate to decide what to do but the voters of Alaska , the will of the people , was that he would be representing Alaska and whether some of that vote 's intent was that he would win the election and then we would have a special election and still have a chance to hold onto that seat , the Republican Party , maybe that was some intention there of some of the voters , but it's in the U.S. Senate 's hands now , not in my hands .
BLITZER : So if he 's re-elected -- they 're still counting ballots , I take it , up there .
And the Senate does -- kicks him out of the Senate , is that something you might be interested in ?
Could you name yourself , for example , to succeed Ted Stevens ?
PALIN : I suppose if you were that egotistical and arrogant you 'd name yourself , but I 'm not one to name myself ...
BLITZER : Do you want to be in the United States Senate ?
PALIN : I believe that I have -- I feel I have a contract with Alaskans to serve .
I 've got two more years in my term .
I 'm going to serve Alaskans to the best of my ability .
At this point , it is as governor .
Now , if something shifted dramatically and if it were , if it were acknowledged up there that I could be put to better use for my state in the U.S. Senate , I would certainly consider that but that would take a special election and everything else .
I am not one to appoint myself or a member of my family to take the place of any vacancy .
...
BLITZER : You 're not ruling out a run in 2012 for president of the United States , are you ?
PALIN : Not ruling that out , but there again , that is based on my philosophy that it 's crazy to close a door before you know what 's even open in front of you .
You travel this road in life , and as you turn a corner and there may be something there that circumstances change , you 've got to call an audible and you decide to shift gears , take another direction , I 'm always open for that .
But you 've just got to be prepared and when you see opportunity and preparation meet , that 's how you know that a door is open , you really go through it .
...
BLITZER : How did this campaign affect your family ?
Because your kids , they obviously came into the spotlight as well .
PALIN : My kids are cool , too !
They are very adaptable .
They have been used to all these years me having a very busy schedule as a oil and gas regulator and a city manager and mayor and then governor and then Todd being very busy with a commercial fishing schedule and North Slope oil production schedule that he has .
The kids have already been very adaptable , kind of going with the flow but at the same time being quite independent themselves , and it's a great , fun family that we have .
Also , very full life .
And they , too , I believe have felt that this has been the privilege of a lifetime to be able to get to know John McCain , be able to run with him , with his family , with the team that we had together .
They got to travel the country and see things that of course never would they have had an opportunity before , so it 's been nothing but awesome .
BLITZER : Your son is serving in Iraq right now .
PALIN : Yeah .
BLITZER : Are you worried about the incoming commander in chief , who is going to be his commander , in effect ?
PALIN : Well , you know , we 've got make sure there too that Barack Obama surrounds himself with strong commanders who understand that our boys , our girls , with their boots on the ground -- their lives , my son's life , is in his hands .
And I do have faith in this new administration that they are going to look out for America 's finest , those in uniform , who are protecting us and our freedoms .
I have faith that all is going to be well .
And my son , he 's good .
He is serving for the right reasons .
He 's a teenage kid who recognized that he had an opportunity to do all that he could , at his stage in life , to help protect America and to serve something greater than self .
And I think about my son , I think about Track , in those terms , and I think , is every elected official who is serving in government doing the same thing to the best of their ability ?
Are they protecting this country ?
Are they doing all that they can to make sure that our troops , over there especially , are well - equipped , have the budget that they need , have all the tools that they need for them to do their jobs ?

NYC Bike Counts Jump 35 Percent
The rumors were spot on .
Yesterday DOT announced a 35 percent increase in commuter cycling .
This year , an average of more than 12,500 cyclists were counted crossing DOT ’s screenline — a set of checkpoints leading into the Manhattan CBD — up from about 9,300 in 2007 .
It ’s the biggest jump in raw numbers since the count began and the largest percent increase since 2003 , when the count went up 36 percent .
Overall , cycling in the city has doubled in the past six years .
( See the stat breakdown in this PDF — the full version of the bar graph at right is on page 5 . )
Advocates cheered the news .
" More bike lanes and safer designs like Ninth Avenue are really starting
to pay off , " says TA ’s Wiley Norvell .
" These
numbers really show the huge latent potential for biking in NYC .
We
ca n’t wait for 2009 . "
DOT paired its announcement with a safety message for cyclists and , yes , drivers :
" This unprecedented increase shows we are well on the way toward our goal of doubling the number of bike commuters , " said Transportation Commissioner Janette Sadik - Khan .
" As these numbers rise , cyclists should take all safety precautions , while drivers must be vigilant when sharing our streets with this growing population . "
Meanwhile , fueling what could become a heated intercity rivalry , bike counts just came out of Portland touting a 28 percent increase in cycling this year , bringing bike commute mode share up to eight percent .
More background from DOT on its screenline count , after the jump .
DOT first conducted screenline counts of cyclists in 1980 and has been
doing so annually since 1984 .
Counts were historically taken once a
year , during the middle of the week for a 12 - hour period from 7 a.m. to
7 p.m . In 2007 , DOT expanded the time window to 18 hours and added two
additional counting dates .
The 18 - hour count showed that over a quarter
of cyclists counted use City streets earlier in the morning and later
in the day than previously believed .
While commuter cycling has doubled
over the past six years , DOT has found that some facilities have gotten
much more popular .
The cyclist volume on the Williamsburg Bridge has
quadrupled from 2000 - 2008 to 4,000 cyclists on a typical day .
DOT ’s NYC Commuter Cycling Indicator makes use of the most robust data available to estimate the trends in commuter cycling .
While not every commuter cyclist in New York is counted in the screenline , the count locations are high usage areas where trends are easily spotted .
The screenline count looks at cyclists crossing the four East River bridges , those entering and exiting the Staten Island Ferry ’s Whitehall terminal , as well as cyclists crossing 50th Street on each avenue and the Hudson River Greenway .
This growth in cycling follows two years of DOT efforts to rapidly expand and improve New York ’s bicycle network .
DOT added 140 miles of new bicycle routes to the on - street bicycle network in 2007 and 2008 .

Sold out at £ 6 a bar ... the tastebud sensation that 's a mix of milk chocolate and smoky bacon
In the mix :
The bacon bar has proved an unexpected hit with British tastebuds
In a league of favourite foods , bacon and chocolate would both be near the top .
Usually , it has to be said , eaten separately .
Now , however , confectioners have combined the two in the world 's first bacon chocolate bar .
And it is proving a major success with British customers .
The unlikely hit Christmas gift is Mo's Bacon Bar , which contains chunks of applewood smoked bacon combined with smoked salt and milk chocolate .
At £ 5.99 per 3 oz bar it is far from a cheap treat , but Selfridges – the only UK stockist – sold its entire stock of several hundred within 48 hours at its four stores and has urgently ordered more .
The manufacturer , Chicago - based Vosges Haut - Chocolat , encourages first - time buyers to 'engage your five senses … let the lust of salt and sweet coat your tongue ' .
Ewan Venters , food and restaurant director at Selfridges , said : ' Bacon and chocolate sounds like a strange combination , but the execution is fantastic .
It 's a real explosion of flavours and people love it .
' Some of the combinations were really surprising like putting curry in chocolate but it works .
' There has been a real revolution in luxury chocolate , as there was with wine a few years ago .
People are much more knowledgeable about it and there is a growing demand for these high quality , exotic products instead of a box of Milk Tray . '
A hesitant Claudia Connell bravely puts it to the test
It 's fair to say that I 'm something of a chocolate addict and munch my way through at least two bars a day , writes Claudia Connell .
And I have an equally piggy appetite for bacon .
I like it streaky , crispy , unsmoked and Sunday mornings simply would n't be the same without it .
But it would never have crossed my mind to combine the two .
Salty sweet :
An uncertain Claudia reacts after taking a bite
When it comes to eating my chocolate I 've always followed the same formula : unwrap , stuff in mouth , do not share at any , any cost .
But the bacon bar is no ordinary piece of confectionery and it comes with a unique set of instructions .
First I am to breathe in deeply and engage my five senses .
I must caress the chocolate to release the aroma and then place a tiny piece in my mouth .
I have to say that there 's no need to ' release the aroma ' as it's already there in all its pungent glory and as for putting a tiny piece in my mouth – thank goodness I did , because it is quite simply the most unpleasant thing ever to have passed my lips .
The chocolate is intensely salty and the smoky bacon pieces are horribly out of place in something so sweet .
The whole sensation is like eating chocolate that has been dunked in an overflowing ashtray .
One hour after eating half a square , the bitter after - taste lingers on .
It just goes to prove that certain foods should never be placed together .
I do n't want jelly babies on my pizza .
I 'm not interested in Jaffa Cakes and chips .
And I definitely wo n't be eating bacon - flavoured chocolate again .
Before Michael Moore became famous for documentaries like " Fahrenheit 9/11 " and " Sicko , " his first big success came in 1989 with " Roger and Me . "
In that film , Mr. Moore followed General Motors chairman and chief executive Roger Smith with a camera crew , asking him why the company was closing plants and producing low - quality vehicles .
Mr. Smith looked flustered and inartfully avoided Mr. Moore 's camera crew while it lingered outside his country club or GM 's executive offices .
" Roger and Me " was entertaining , but it missed the ...

To all those who name the name of Christ who plan to willfully disobey Him by voting for Obama , take warning .
Not only is our nation in grave danger , according to the Word of God , so are you .
First , the facts on life : On July 17 , 2007 , Barack Obama spoke to Planned Parenthood and said :
On this fundamental issue of [ abortion rights ] , I will not yield and Planned Parenthood will not yield .
...
The first thing I 'll do as president is sign the Freedom of Choice Act .
That 's the first thing that I 'd do .
...
And what is the " Freedom of Choice Act " ?
It would completely federalize the abortion issue and strike down all state laws from parental notification to the Woman 's Right to Know Laws to bans on partial - birth abortion , declaring them null and void with the stroke of an Obama pen .
In one week , America will make a choice .
And to those who call themselves " Christian " who are planning on voting for Barack Obama , put down the Obama talking points and read God 's voter guide before you go to the polls :
TRENDING : With only days to go until debate , Pelosi gives Biden an out : ' Why bother ? '
I call heaven and earth as witnesses today against you , that I have set before you life and death , blessing and cursing ; therefore choose life , that both you and your descendants may live ( Deuteronomy 30:19 ) .
But you think this issue does n't matter ?
God felt so strongly about it that he carved it in stone :
You shall not murder ( Exodus 20:13 ) .
Think you can love God and still vote against life ?
In John 14:15 , Jesus said :
If you love Me , keep My commandments .
Yes , and " Thou shall not murder " made the top 10 .
Barack Obama and many of his followers claim to be Christian .
But Isaiah 29:13 says :
Therefore the Lord said : " Inasmuch as these people draw near with their mouths and honor
Me with their lips , But have removed their hearts far from Me , And their fear toward Me is taught by the commandment of men " ( Isaiah 29:13 ) .
And Matthew 7:20 :
Yes , just as you can identify a tree by its fruit , so you can identify people by their actions ( Matthew 7:20 ) .
Knowing that , here 's another command from Proverbs 31:8 :
Open your mouth for the speechless , in the cause of all who are appointed to die .
To you who are pretending that you do n't know this , Proverbs 24:11 speaks directly to you :
Rescue those who are unjustly sentenced to die ;
Save them as they stagger to their death .
Do n't excuse yourself by saying , " Look , we did n't know . "
For God understands all hearts , and he sees you .
He who guards your soul knows you knew .
He will repay all people as their actions deserve .
It 's not just about " hope " and " change . "
Proverbs 6:16 - 22 states there are some things God hates .
These six things the LORD hates ,
Yes , seven are an abomination to Him :
A proud look ,
A lying tongue ,
Hands that shed innocent blood ,
A heart that devises wicked plans ,
Feet that are swift in running to evil ,
A false witness who speaks lies ,
And one who sows discord among brethren .
Obama - Biden are pro-death .
McCain - Palin are pro-life .
Now choose life that you and your children may live .
On marriage , Mark 10:7 reveals what Jesus had to say about it :
For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife .
Notice , the man does n't leave his father and mother to be joined to his domestic partner .
In his Oct. 22 , 2008 , WorldNetDaily column , Matt Barber outlined Obama 's position on marriage :
In 2004 , Obama called DOMA ( the Defense of Marriage Act ) an " abhorrent law " and said , " The repeal of DOMA is essential . …
For the record , " he continued , " I opposed DOMA in 1996 .
It should be repealed , and I will vote for its repeal on the Senate floor .
I will also oppose any proposal to amend the U.S. Constitution to ban gays and lesbians from marrying . "
Obama also came out earlier this year in favor of the May 15 California Supreme Court decision that unilaterally redefined natural marriage in that state to include same - sex duos .
" I want to congratulate all of you who have shown your love for each other by getting married these last few weeks , " Obama gushed .
Despite assurances otherwise , these are not the words or policies of a man who opposes " same - sex marriage . "
No , this election is not about race .
It 's not about the economy .
It 's about obeying God .
Even Martin Luther King Jr. said it 's not about race :
I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character .
To those who call themselves by the name of Christ who ignore what God says about life and marriage , who and are clinging to a fantasy of economic gain , think again .
Obama will use your tax dollars to kill innocent children , and then he 'll take your paycheck and use it to " spread the wealth around . "
Do n't believe me ?
Do n't believe Joe the plumber ?
Hear Barack Obama for yourself in an 2001 interview about his goal to try what the Soviets proved does not work .
This is not a discussion of whether or not to redistribute the wealth ; it 's a discussion of HOW Obama wants to do it .
Be forewarned :
If you willfully disobey God on life and marriage because of race or false hope for the economy , you will usher in the kind of change that brought the Soviet Union to collapse .
But the warning goes far beyond that .
To those who think that God 's grace gives them license to willfully disobey
Him without consequences – think again :
Not everyone who says to Me , " Lord , Lord , " shall enter the kingdom of heaven , but he who does the will of My Father in heaven .
Many will say to Me in that day , " Lord , Lord , have we not prophesied in Your name , cast out demons in Your name , and done many wonders in Your name ? "
And then I will declare to them , " I never knew you ; depart from Me , you who practice lawlessness ! " ( Matthew 7:21 - 23 )
That deals with your eternity .
Matthew 7:26 - 27 says if you do n't obey God , prepare for a crash even sooner that that :
But anyone who hears my teaching and does n't obey it is foolish , like a person who builds a house on sand .
When the rains and floods come and the winds beat against that house , it will collapse with a mighty crash ( Matthew 7:26 - 27 ) .
I just hope you wo n't take the rest of the nation with you .
If the word of God matters more to you than your perception of personal gain , Joel 2:12 issues a call to repentance I pray you will heed :
" Now , therefore , " says the LORD , ' Turn to Me with all your heart , with fasting , with weeping , and with mourning ' " ( Joel 2:12 ) .
Then obey Him in the voting booth and out of it .
If not , do us all a favor and quit calling yourself a Christian .

Banksy is well known around the world in no small part due to his massive popularity online .
Banksy art has made its way into all kinds of nooks and crannies on the internet but few collections are anything close to comprehensive ( and in many cases are not even coherent ) .
Most are difficult to navigate and devoid of context , featuring disparate works alongside one another without explanation .
While necessarily incomplete due to the breadth and volume of Banky ’s artwork , this collection gathers over 100 essential pieces that tell key stories about his aims , personality and history .
Some selections are organized by type – rats , children , police , military and monkeys – while others are sorted by locations – from Glastonbury to Palestine , New Orleans to Disneyland .
Also showcased are his art installations in galleries – both sanctioned and unsanctioned – as well as his most expensive and sought - after works ever sold .

Finally , a piece of news we can actually do something with .
AT&T today announced its pricing structure for the next iteration of Apple 's iPhone -- which you can plunk down money for come 8 am , July 11th .
There 's not much that 's surprising here -- new customers and those eligible for an upgrade will be able to nab the phone for $ 199 ( 8GB ) or $ 299 ( 16GB ) , while " early upgraders " will have to fork over $ 399 or $ 499 , all with a two year contract and $ 18 upgrade fee , of course .
The telco says a no -commitment version of the phone will be available for $ 599 and $ 699 , though it looks like that will come after the initial launch .
AT&T appears to be leaning pretty heavily towards the all - in unlimited plans , but there are options if you do n't want to go that route .
We 've sorted out the basics after the break , and included AT&T's " iReady " video -- certainly good for a few chuckles .
Woman steps in as co-pilot suffers breakdown in mid-air on route to Heathrow airport
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
A flight attendant helped steer a Heathrow - bound passenger flight to safety after the co-pilot suffered a breakdown in mid-air , investigators have revealed .
The flight attendant was temporarily promoted to the cockpit after the captain of the Air Canada service ordered his colleague to be handcuffed and dragged from his seat .
The flight attendant , a qualified commercial pilot , came forward after the captain asked the 155 passengers and crew if there were any professional pilots onboard .
The unnamed attendant sat in the co-pilot 's seat of the Boeing 767-333 jet as the Toronto to Heathrow service was diverted to Ireland 's Shannon airport on January 28 .
The report by the Irish Air Accident Investigation Unit ( AAIU ) said : " The commander requested that the flight attendant occupy the right - hand ( first officer 's ) seat for the remainder of the flight to assist as necessary .
" The flight attendant provided useful assistance to the commander , who remarked in a statement to the investigation that she was ' not out of place ' while occupying the right - hand seat . "
The AAIU said the flight captain noted that his first officer was " quite harried " when he entered the cockpit before take - off .
Once the plane was in the air , the senior pilot became " increasingly concerned " with his colleague 's behaviour , prompting him to order the co-pilot to rest ahead of arriving at Heathrow , where difficult weather conditions were expected to make it a difficult landing .
The break did not improve the first officer 's behaviour and it soon deteriorated .
" The first officer began conversation which was rambling and disjointed in nature and not at all in character , " said the report .
It added that the pilot then became belligerent and uncooperative , " which convinced the commander he was now dealing with a crew member who was effectively incapacitated . "
The report indicated that a struggle took place as the pilot was taken from the cockpit by cabin crew , with one crew member sustaining a wrist injury .
According to one passenger , whose testimony did not appear in the AAIU document yesterday , the pilot was yelling and " invoking God " as he was dragged from the cockpit .
The unnamed pilot was taken to a psychiatric unit and was flown home 11 days later .
The Air Canada flight resumed its journey after the diversion and arrived eight hours late .
Naphthalene molecules , in combination with water , ammonia and ultraviolet radiation , produce many of the amino acids fundamental to the development of life .
A team of scientists led by researchers from the Instituto Astrofísica de Canarias ( IAC ) has succeeded in identifying naphthalene in a star formation region in the constellation Perseus , in the direction of the star Cernis 52 .
This means a large number of the key components in prebiotic terrestrial chemistry could have been present in the interstellar matter from which the Solar System was formed .
Using various telescopes in La Palma and Texas , IAC researchers have detected the presence of naphthalene in the interstellar medium in the direction of the star Cernis 52 in the constellation Perseus .
This molecule consists of two hexagonal rings of carbon atoms surrounded by hydrogen atoms .

IAC researchers Susana Iglesias Groth , Arturo Manchado and Aníbal García , in collaboration with Jonay González ( Paris Observatory ) and David Lambert ( University of Texas ) have just published these results in Astrophysical Journal Letters .
“ We have detected the presence of the naphthalene cation in a cloud of interstellar matter located 700 light years from the Earth ” , says IAC researcher Susana Iglesias Groth .
The spectral bands found in this constellation coincide with laboratory measurements of the naphthalene cation .
Iglesias Groth added , “ We aim to investigate whether other , more complex , hydrocarbons exist in the same region , including amino acids . ”
When subjected to ultraviolet radiation and combined with water and ammonium , both very abundant in the interstellar medium , naphthalene reacts and is capable of producing a wide variety of aminoacids and naphthaloquinones , precursor molecules to vitamins .
All these molecules play a fundamental role in the development of life as we know it on Earth .
Naphthalene has been found in meteorites that continue to fall to the surface of the Earth , and which fell with much greater intensity in epochs preceding the appearance of life here .
The work of these researchers could enable an understanding of one of the most intriguing problems in interstellar medium spectroscopy .
For the past 80 years , the existence has been known of hundreds of spectroscopic bands ( the so - called “ diffuse bands ” ) associated with interstellar matter , but the identification of the agent causing them has remained a mystery .
“ Our results show that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as naphthalene are responsible for the diffuse bands and should be present throughout the interstellar medium ” , says Iglesias Groth .

But a Japanese team of researchers , led by Teruhiko Wakayama of the RIKEN research institute in Kobe , developed techniques to get around this problem , producing clones from mice which had been kept at - 20 degrees for 16 years .
No special chemicals had been added to the mice to cryopreserve them , a situation which would also apply to animals frozen in the wild , such as mammoths trapped in the permafrost .
Dr Wakayama said this meant his team 's success " offers a distinct chance to resurrect extinct animals or preserve endangered species " .
But he cautioned that before an extinct animal could be cloned , the difficulties of using eggs and a surrogate mother from a related living animal would have to be overcome .
The dean of science at the University of NSW , Professor Mike Archer , said it was a " very exciting " development , if confirmed .
The results , which are published in the journal Proceedings Of The National Academy of Sciences , would give hope to other teams , including his own , who were convinced it would eventually be possible to clone extinct species , including the Tasmanian tiger , or thylacine , despite the extreme difficulties .
Bringing back animals that humans had driven to extinction was an ethical issue , Professor Archer said .
" We have a moral imperative to do that if the technology allows us . "
But the director of the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA at the University of Adelaide , Alan Cooper , said he was sceptical that Dr Wakayama 's team had achieved what they claimed .
" It could be right , but I 'm highly suspicious .
It is very hard to believe the DNA would be intact enough . "
Professor Cooper said the Japanese team had had to use a lengthy process to get the cloned mice , which could have introduced contamination .
Dr Wakayama 's team took the DNA - containing nuclei from the brain cells of the frozen mice and injected them into empty mice eggs , to produce cloned embryos from which they extracted embryonic stem cells .
They then used these cells and more eggs to produce cloned embryos that grew into mice in a surrogate mother .
In a separate development , Dr Wakayama 's team also created live mice by injecting dead sperm into mice eggs .
In what is a surprising finding , a new study on babies shows that those cute and cuddly bundles of joy , exhibit signs of jealousy even as young as three months old .
Prof. Maria Legerstee , Department of Psychology , York University and her team studied 50 - babies aged 3 - months and 6 - months with their mothers on hand .
They found interacting with the babies that if the babies were not responded to , they looked sad and looked away .
However , when she took a drink and did n’t engage with them , they did n’t seem to mind , indicating that even babies can sense the reason behind uncommunicative behaviour .
As well , a stranger interacting with their mother , without her active participation was taken in good stride by the babies .
However , if the mother engaged in an animated dialogue with the stranger , laughing , talking , the babies tended to get very upset , reacting strongly as they vocalized with intense anger .
To sum it up succinctly , when the mother ’s attention turned away from them , they kicked and hollered trying to get it focused on them again .
According to Legerstee , ‘ jealousy is the fear of losing a beloved to someone else ’ , and researching infants has shown young babies know the difference between themselves and others .
Babies tend to form social attachment with their mothers or primary caregivers , preconditions for babies to feel jealous .
While , reactions are stronger in six month old than three month old babies , they are there nonetheless , and the mothers are aware of them .
And , what is a parent to do , if baby seems jealous ?
Why , simply interrupt your conversation and switch your attention back to baby to put the green - eyed monster to bed .
Prof . Legerstee ’s book entitled ‘ Handbook of Jealousy : Theories , Principles and Multidisciplinary Approaches ’ , due out end 2009 will include the study .
The resolutions on the Middle East peace process are held annually and the Howard government had backed both from 1996 to 2002 but in 2003 began to vote against or abstain .
It was a move that aligned Australia with only the US , Israel , the US Marshall Islands , Nauru , Palau and Micronesia and put the country at odds with Britain , Canada , New Zealand and France .
Australian officials told the UN the Government had changed its position because it supported a two - state resolution of the conflict to deliver a secure Israel living beside a viable Palestinian state and that Australia believed both sides should abide by their obligations under the Road Map for Peace .
Australia said it was concerned activity in the disputed settlements undermined confidence in the negotiations .
It was among 161 countries that supported both resolutions , with two abstaining and six against .
The president of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry , Robert Goot , last night was concerned over the Government 's switch .
" We are concerned that the vote has changed , we do not understand the basis for the change , " he said .
The Foreign Affairs Minister , Stephen Smith , last night said there had been no change to Australia 's policy on the Middle East .
He said he had met the Israeli Prime Minister , Ehud Olmert , and the Foreign Minister , Tzipi Livni , in Jerusalem two weeks ago and told them Australia was a strong supporter of Israel and the Middle East peace process .
" Australia 's friendship with Israel is longstanding and enduring and we understand completely Israel 's legitimate security concerns , " he said .
" As a staunch and longstanding friend of Israel , we want its people to be able to enjoy the fruits of a normal , peaceful existence , within a Middle East that recognises Israel 's right to live within secure and internationally recognised boundaries .
That is an approach that has strong bipartisan support in Australia and it's an approach that will continue . "
The Opposition foreign affairs spokeswoman , Helen Coonan , called on Mr Smith to explain why Australia changed its vote .
" The change in emphasis is concerning unless it can be better explained as giving effect to a bipartisan and balanced approach , " she said .
Australia maintained its vote on seven other UN resolutions relating to Israel , in particular opposing a resolution criticising Israel on Palestinian human rights .
Australia said it believed the resolution was too one - sided against Israel and failed to take account of Israel 's legitimate security concerns or reflect the responsibility of Palestinians to end attacks against Israel .
Australia was one of eight countries , including Canada , to vote against this resolution that was supported by 87 countries with 70 abstaining .
Last month Australia announced new sanctions on Israel 's rival Iran but backed down on a pledge to force the Iranian President , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , before an international court on charges of inciting genocide .
Henri Belolo ( music producer , from a 2000 interview with disco-disco.com ) : [ In 1975 ] I was talking to the gay community about what they liked , what they wanted to listen to musically , and what was their dream , their fantasy .
One day [ producer Jacques Morali and I ] were walking in the streets of New York .
I remember clearly it was down in the Village , and we saw an Indian walking down the street and heard the bells on his feet .
We followed him into a bar .
He was a bartender — he was serving and also dancing on the bar .
And while we were watching him dancing and sipping our beer , we saw a cowboy watching him dance .
And Jacques and I suddenly had the same idea .
We said , “ My God , look at those characters .
“ So we started to fantasize about what were the characters of America .
The mix , you know , of the American man…And we named it the Village People .
The pair placed an ad that called for MACHO TYPES WITH MUSTACHE , eventually filling the roles of cowboy , cop , construction worker , soldier , leather - clad biker , and Indian .
David Hodo , a 28 - year - old struggling singer and actor , responded immediately .
David Hodo : I had just finished a musical about the Grand Ole Opry , and I had a mustache .
It was Christmastime , and I needed money .
They wanted a cowboy , and I had just finished a western — perfect .
But when they said they wanted me to be the construction worker , that was my dad ’s dream come true .
I ’m handy , but I ’ve never built anything of consequence .
Victor Willis , who had starred in one of the original productions of The Wiz , would be the lead singer , a cop .
A toll collector named Glenn Hughes was the leatherman .
Alex Briley originally dressed as a sailor ( but switched to a Navy ensign ’s uniform when performing the group ’s 1979 ’s hit “ In the Navy ” ) .
Dancer Felipe Rose , born to a Lakota Sioux father , was , naturally , the Indian .
Randy Jones , a singer raised on a North Carolina farm , became the cowboy .
Morali had sold hit - churning label Casablanca ( home to Donna Summer and Kiss ) on the concept of this boy band even before the roles were cast .
The group ’s first album , 1977 ’s Village People , featured the disco hit “ San Francisco ( You ’ve Got Me ) .
“ The title track of the following year ’s Macho Man debuted ( and peaked ) at No. 25 on the charts but later became a gay touchstone .
Randy Jones : Something just clicked with us .
We had that spark .
Victor was a terrific singer :
He had the style of Teddy Pendergrass .
He was married to Phylicia Rashad .
But we did n’t start as a gay group , and not everyone in the group was gay — that ’s an incorrect notion .
So much of our music was played in black , Latin , and gay underground clubs ; that ’s ’ where the first Village People album found its initial audience .
Hodo :
It was 1977 , and we were leaving a photography session on 23rd Street .
Jacques Morali saw the big pink YMCA on 23rd and asked , “ What is this YMCA , anyway ?
“ And after laughing at his accent , we told him the Y was a place where you could go when you first came to New York when you did n’t have any money — you can stay there for very little .
And of course , someone joked , “ Yeah , but do n’t bend over in the showers .
“ And Jacques , bless his heart , said , “ I will write a song about this ! ”
Jones : David ’s a little off .
Yeah , Jacques came up with the idea .
But what happened is that when I moved to New York in 1975 , I joined the McBurney YMCA on 23rd Street .
I took Jacques there three or four times in 1977 , and he loved it .
He was fascinated by a place where a person could work out with weights , play basketball , swim , take classes , and get a room .
Plus , with Jacques being gay , I had a lot of friends I worked out with who were in the adult - film industry , and he was impressed by meeting people he had seen in the videos and magazines .
Those visits with me planted a seed in him , and that ’s how he got the idea for “ Y.M.C.A. ” — by literally going to the YMCA .
Hodo :
We had finished our [ third ] album , Cruisin ’ , and we needed one more song as a filler .
Jacques wrote “ Y.M.C.A. ” in about 20 minutes — the melody , the chorus , the outline .
Then he gave it to Victor Willis and said , “ Fill in the rest . ”
I was a bit skeptical about some of our hits , but the minute I heard “ Y.M.C.A. , ” I knew we had something special .
Because it sounded like a commercial .
And everyone likes commercials .
Jones :
It was not intended as a gay anthem .
Do you have the lyrics in front of you ?
There ’s nothing gay about them .
I think Victor wrote the words , but it ’s all a big fucking mystery .
The guy who really deserves the credit is Horace Ott , who arranged the horns and strings .
Jacques had the ideas , but Horace transformed them into songs .
Horace Ott : What I loved about “ Y.M.C.A. ” was , to be honest , everything .
Great beat , great voice with Victor , great timing in the midst of the disco boom .
Now , was it a gay song ?
I do n’t know .
It certainly appealed to a lot of people who embraced that lifestyle .
Hodo : “ Y.M.C.A. ” certainly has a gay origin .
That ’s what Jacques was thinking when he wrote it , because our first album [ 1977 ’s Village People ] was possibly the gayest album ever .
I mean , look at us .
We were a gay group .
So was the song written to celebrate gay men at the YMCA ?
Yes .
Absolutely .
And gay people love it .
Leah Pouw ( media relations manager , Young Men ’s Christian Association ) :
We at the YMCA celebrate the song .
It ’s a positive statement about the YMCA and what we offer to people all around the world .
The song ’s undeniable , jinglelike hook made it a natural candidate for a single ; it debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 chart on November 11 , 1978 , and peaked 13 weeks later at No.
2 . On January 6 , 1979 , the Village People appeared on Dick Clark ’s American Bandstand , TV ’s biggest pop-music showcase .
Jones :
We were flying up from South America for the show , and we worked on the choreography on the airplane — handclaps , turning , marching in place … stuff like that .
Well , the audience at this particular taping was a bunch of kids bused in from a cheerleader camp .
The first time we got to the chorus , we were clapping our hands above our heads .
And the kids thought it looked like we were making a Y .
So they automatically did the letters .
We saw this and started doing letters with them .
It was purely audience - generated , which is probably why it ’s still so popular .
And that ’s great for me , because it keeps the checks coming in every six months .
Hodo :
When I saw the movements , I thought , “ Wow , that is so stupid . ”
Then everyone in America started doing it , and I thought , “ Wow , that is so brilliant . ”
It took on a life of its own .
The next thing we know , Hideki Saijo has the No. 1 hit in Japan with his ver- sion of “ Y.M.C.A . ”
And we hit No. 2 [ in the U.S. ] .
That ’s how it always works .
Saijo claimed to have invented the dance , so as soon as we got to Japan , we straightened him out .
“ Y.M.C.A. ” spent 26 weeks on Billboard ’s top 100 ( during which time the actual YMCA threatened to sue the band before dropping the lawsuit ) , but due largely to egos and personality clashes , the Village People quickly crumbled .
Willis left the band in 1979 , just before they were to start work on the feature film Ca n’t Stop the Music .
He was replaced by Ray Simpson , one of the group ’s backup singers and the brother of Ashford & Simpson ’s Valerie Simpson .
The movie ( starring Steve Guttenberg as “ Jack Morell ” and ex-Olympian Bruce Jenner ) bombed , as did the soundtrack album .
Three more studio albums came and went with barely a whimper ; Willis returned briefly to contribute to 1982 ’s Fox on the Box .
He also recorded an unreleased solo album and struggled with substance abuse .
By the end of ’ 85 , the Village People — who eventually sold a reported 65 million albums — gave up .
Jones : I left for the first time in ’ 81 , when the group went in a different direction .
But I kept getting royalties .
Then I was the only one doing any kind of performing .
[ When the group broke up ] , Glenn was working in a camera store , David was a bartender , Alex was working in an office , Felipe was a secretary .
It was sad — these were talented men who were once atop the world and deserved a chance to continue their craft .
The Village People regrouped in 1987 , but not to record new material .
They were proudly and officially a nostalgia act , available for weddings , bar mitzvahs , and corporate events .
Hodo :
Bar mitzvahs used to be our bread and butter , everywhere from the Pierre Hotel to backyards .
But we have n’t played one in five or six years , because now the parents grew up in the ’ 80s , not the ’70s .
REO Speedwagon does bar mitzvahs instead of us .
Roger Bennett ( coauthor , Bar Mitzvah Disco ) : “ Y.M.C.A. ” is the single most important song to hit the Jewish religion since “ Hava Nagila . ”
And paradoxically , not one of the Village People is Jewish .
But they did play a critical function , providing a slew of new role models for Jewish youth .
We were under such pressure to become bankers , accountants , and lawyers .
They opened our eyes to other career possibilities : a cop , a builder , a flamboyant Indian …
In February 1996 , five years after Morali ’s death from AIDS , a onetime aspiring priest from Tampa , Florida , the son - in - law of Yankees owner George Steinbrenner , changed everything .
Joseph Malloy ( former general partner , New York Yankees ) :
It was the opening of Legends Field , our spring - training stadium in Tampa , and a couple of the grounds crew guys approached me with the idea of bringing a little excitement to the exhibition games .
In the middle of the fifth inning , when they dragged the infield , the guys wanted to do the arm motions to “ Y.M.C.A . ” I had n’t heard the song for a long , long time , but the crowd absolutely loved it .
I thought , “ Hmmm , this might work in New York . ”
On April 9 , 1996 , the Yankees opened at home against the Kansas City Royals .
With a driving snowstorm battering players and fans alike , five Yankee Stadium groundskeepers began their customary walk to clean the infield in the middle of the fifth inning .
Then , from the speakers , a familiar horn riff and disco beat kicked in .
Juan Gonzalez ( from his New York Daily News column , October 29 , 1996 ) :
They began to dance , strut , and gyrate around second base while they dragged the field .
The capacity crowd roared with approving laughter .
We all cheered and applauded , and for a moment we all felt a little warmer inside .
It was baseball poking fun at itself , reminding us all that this huge , multibillion - dollar , cutthroat business is , after all , about people having a good time .
Molloy : I remember looking at [ Yankees ] Wade Boggs and Derek Jeter and seeing them swaying to the music .
When those grounds crew guys dropped their rakes and performed , you had to watch .
From the owner ’s box , I would do the Y - M - C - A motions with the crowd .
I should have trademarked it .
Michael Musto ( columnist , The Village Voice ) : “ Y.M.C.A. ” is one of many cultural phenomena that started as a gay in - joke and eventually became stripped of its winkiness and subsumed by the mainstream .
Back in the ’ 70s , the masses did those crazy hand gestures along with the song , truly thinking it was an upbeat number about how nice the Y is , but at least the sophisticated crowd was plugged into the real meaning .
The Studio 54 set knew full well the Village People were a campy assortment of gay stereotypes nodding to the gays with coded sexual allusions and macho posturing .
Molloy : “ Y.M.C.A. ” is about homosexuality ?
I had no idea until this very moment .
Wow !
Well , it ’s a great song that makes people feel good .
That ’s what ’s important .
Not long after Yankee Stadium made “ Y.M.C.A. ” a fifth - inning staple ( which is still being done 12 seasons later ) , other teams took notice .
Also in ’ 96 , the Oakland Coliseum was undergoing a $ 200 million renovation .
As an A ’s batter stood at the plate , trying to concentrate while , say , Randy Johnson unleashed a 97 - mph inside fastball , the noise from bulldozers and jackhammers filled the air .
David Rinetti ( vice president of stadium operations , Oakland A’s ) :
We wanted to do something cool to make the most of a terrible time .
So we dressed two guys up as construction workers and sent them out to the construction site .
Then we ’d have two of our security guards go out there and pretend to tell them to stop making so much noise .
Everyone [ in the crowd ] believed it — then “ Y.M.C.A. ” would come on and the four of them would break out into dance .
One of our security guards was a guy named Icebox who played in the local roller - derby league .
He was a huge man , and when he danced …
Robert “ Icebox ” Smith ( Oakland Coliseum security guard ) : I tore that place up .
The A ’s were n’t so hot that year , but we brought that house down every single night .
It was magical .
We were on ESPN for weeks .
It was a gay song ?
Fans ate it up — some even came dressed as the characters .
Teams would host Village People Nights , capped off by postgame concerts — often by the Village People themselves .
Dr. Costas Karageorghis ( sports psychologist , London ’s Brunel University ) :
When you think of using music to engage a crowd and increase cohesion , “ Y.M.C.A. ” is the perfect track .
It turns a group of individuals into a unit , just like the wave , simply because of a common action .
I have n’t heard it played at rugby , though — probably too butch .
Kyle Smith ( director of stadium operations , Brevard County Manatees ) :
There are a handful of songs that just make you get up and dance .
At our ballpark , “ Y.M.C.A. ” has to be considered one of them .
“ Y.M.C.A. ” is a gaysong ?
Honestly , I had no clue .
Cameron Harris ( Wally the Warthog mascot , Winston - Salem Warthogs ) : I ’m the only mascot I know who does the whole Y - M - C - A hand gesture thing while standing on his head .
As soon as the first beats come out of the speakers , everyone in the stands is asking , “ Where ’s Wally ?
Where ’s that wild Wally ? ”
Not sure what you mean about it being a gay song … .
I know the Y is a healthy place to exercise .
Musto :
All these years later , the gay subtext is gone , and it ’s a rah - rah crowd - pleaser for the baseball stadium crowd .
It happens .
A rallying song for the oppressed turns into a middle - of - the - road spirit - lifter , mainly because the straights like to steal things from the gays , take away all the scary edge , and make it their own .
Tim Wiles ( director of research , Baseball Hall of Fame ) :
The song is not alone in coming way out of left field .
[ Ramones ’ “ Blitzkrieg Bop ” ] is played in a lot of ball parks , and someone said to me once , “ If Joey Ramone knew this was being played at games , he ’d roll over in his grave . ”
Brian Johnson ( former major - league catcher ) : I ’m not sure you can have a game without playing “ Y.M.C.A . ”
The funny thing is , every ballplayer I know has heard the song a thousand times , but how many of them know it has to do with gay men at the Y ?
One percent , maybe ?
But that ’s baseball players — not the most informed when it comes to music .
Brandon McCarthy ( pitcher , Texas Rangers ) : I have no idea how “ Y.M.C.A. ” got popular or how it has remained so .
If I had earplugs , I ’d put them in every time that song came on .
J.P. Howell ( pitcher , Tampa Bay Rays ) : I hate “ Y.M.C.A. ” I ’ve been over it since I first heard it .
Jones :
We made a mark in pop music but an even deeper impression in pop culture .
People remember Donna Summer , Kiss , the Bee Gees , but they did n’t have the same impact on pop culture that the Village People did .
Belolo ( from disco- disco.com ) :
In life , you discover that an invention is not always one man or two men ; it ’s a combination of people putting their love together .
“ Y.M.C.A. ” became a standard that will stay forever .
Hodo :
The real genius of “ Y.M.C.A. ” is that it can be taken any way you want .
We were once on a television show in England , and the hostess said , “ Now , this is a gay song , is n’t it ? ”
And I said , “ No , actually it ’s a Christian song — the Young Men ’s Christian Association .
“ I mean , honey , is n’t it obvious ?
A research team led by Carole Thivierge , from Université Laval ’s Institute of Nutraceutics and Functional Foods , shows that omega - 3 fatty acids from fish oil have a positive effect on the metabolism of muscle proteins .
This finding , published in a recent edition of the Journal of Physiology , could have significant implications in the fields of animal farming as well as human health .
In mammals , the ability to use nutrients from food and convert them into muscle proteins decreases with age .
Though the exact cause of this phenomenon is still unclear , insulin resistance of aging muscle cells has been suggested as a possible answer .
Since omega - 3 fatty acids are known to improve glucose metabolism in people and animals showing insulin resistance , the researchers decided to test whether omega - 3’s could also influence protein metabolism .
To do so , they added supplements containing either omega - 3 ’s from fish oil or a mixture of cottonseed and olive oils without omega - 3 ’s to the regular diet of steers .
After five weeks , animals with the marine omega - 3 diet showed increased sensitivity to insulin which , in turn , improved protein metabolism : twice the amount of amino acids was used by their bodies to synthesize proteins , especially in muscles .
So it appears that omega - 3 fatty acids added to the steers ’ diet replaced other fatty acids in muscle cells and improved their functioning .
This finding could have significant implications in the field of animal farming , according to Thivierge , also a professor in Université Laval ’s Department of Animal Sciences , who undertook this study in order to find an alternative to hormonal growth stimulation in beef cattle .
At 4 to 6 months of age , calves become less efficient at converting food into muscle mass , which has a negative impact on farming profitability .
“ Adding fish oil to their diet could prevent this decline by restoring insulin sensitivity in aging animals , ” suggests the researcher .
“ In addition , it could contribute to reducing the amount of by - product emissions in the environment , since animals that are given omega - 3 ’s spontaneously eat 10 % less food to achieve the same weight gain , ” points out Thivierge .
Restoring insulin sensitivity through the use of marine omega - 3 fatty acids could also prevent the loss of muscle mass in older people and , by the same token , prevent the various health problems associated with it , believes Thivierge .
She also suggests that omega - 3 ’s could help athletes trying to increase their muscle mass .
“ However , it should not be seen as a miracle product , ” she points out .
“ For increased muscle protein metabolism to take place in people younger than 50 , physical training is still required , ” she concludes .

Helena Mounesa , 15 , who arrived six hours early , was rewarded with glimpses of Beyoncé and Snoop Dogg .
Though a longtime fan of the show , she had never waited outside the building before .
“ I was waiting until I was 16 , ” she said .
“ But it ’s ending now . ”
In the music industry reaction to the show ’s cancellation was mixed .
Even with a diminished audience “ TRL ” offered powerful promotion , and executives at the major record companies say they lobbied MTV to keep it on the air .
The show ’s replacement is “ FNMTV , ” which stands for “ Friday Night MTV ” and concentrates on more plays of fewer videos .
But the influence of “ TRL ” had fallen from its height , when an artist ’s appearance all but guaranteed a sales spike , said Lou Robinson , a video promotion executive at the RCA Music Group .
“ To spend all that money to have an artist to come in and do two segments and show 20 seconds of the video , it ’s not money well spent , ” he said .
Instead of fighting the migration of audiences online , however , MTV has lately embraced the shift by building up a robust Web presence and heavily promoting it on air .
New videos are often included in what MTV calls “ credit squeezes ”  brief clips played during the closing credits of its most popular shows  with viewers directed to watch the whole thing online .
“ The channel has really become a barker for all the music available digitally on MTV.com , ” said Brian Graden , president of entertainment for MTV .
“ We could sit here and wish that technology was the way it was , or we can try to get ahead of it . ”
Cheesecake Brownie Recipe

If you want to see a normally unflappable Parisian go into a little bit of a crazed frenzy , you do n’t need to watch their reaction to me mercilessly butcher their beautiful language .
One just needs to utter a single word — cheesecake .
As soon as I took the cream cheese out of the refrigerator this morning , my French other - half started circling the kitchen counter , to see what was up .
I ’ve never met a French person whose face did n’t soften and melt at the mere utterance of the word , and le cheesecake is always spoken of with a reverence normally reserved for the finest French cheeses and most exclusive wines .
Just as popular as cheesecake has become in France , cream cheese is equally popular and is now widely available , called fromage à tartiner – or “ spreading cheese . ”
I decide to combine the two with another popular baked good on both sides of the Atlantic , brownies , wanting to show how marvelously the creamy topping melded with rich , deep - dark brownies , in one luscious , swirly bar .
These were a big hit and I had trouble keeping them around .
Thankfully I stored a few in the freezer for myself , so I have a stash for the future .
Am not sure if French people are ready to enjoy brownies straight out of the freezer , but that ’s okay , because I wo n’t feel so bad about not sharing all of them .
Cheesecake Brownies Print Recipe One 9 - inch ( 23 cm ) or 8 - inch ( 20 cm ) square pan Adapted from Ready for Dessert ( Ten Speed )
For those of you who like higher brownies , use an 8 - inch ( 20 cm ) pan .
For the brownies 6 tablespoons ( 85g ) unsalted butter , cut into pieces 4 ounces ( 115g ) bittersweet or semisweet chocolate , chopped 2/3 cup ( 130g ) sugar 2 large eggs , at room temperature 1/2 cup ( 70g ) flour 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder , natural or Dutch process 1/ 8 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 cup ( 80g ) chocolate chips
For the cheesecake topping 8 ounces ( 225g ) cream cheese , at room temperature 1 large egg yolk 5 tablespoons ( 75g ) sugar 1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 . Line a 9 - inch ( 23 cm ) or 8 - inch ( 20 cm ) square pan with foil , making sure it goes up all four sides .
Use two sheets if necessary .
Mist with non -stick spray or grease lightly .
2 . Preheat oven to 350 degrees ( 180C ) .
3 . In a medium saucepan , to make the brownie batter , melt the butter and chocolate over low heat , stirring until smooth .
Remove from heat and beat in the 2/3 cup ( 130g ) sugar , then the eggs .
4 . Mix in the flour , cocoa powder and salt , then the vanilla and chocolate chips .
Spread evenly in the prepared pan .
5 . In a separate bowl for the cheesecake topping , beat together the cream cheese , the yolk , 5 tablespoons ( 75g ) of sugar , and vanilla until smooth .
6 . Distribute the cream cheese mixture in eight dollops across the top of the brownie mixture , then take a dull knife or spatula and swirl the cream cheese mixture with the chocolate batter .
Rap the pan on a countertop a few times to let the batter and swirl settle together .
7 . Bake until the batter in the center of the pan feels just set , 35 to 40 minutes .
Let cool , then lift the brownies out holding the foil and peel it away .
Cut the brownies into squares .
Storage :
These cheesecake brownies will keep in an airtight container for a couple of days .
They also freeze well for up to two months .
I recommend freezing them individually so you can remove them one at a time .

One reason for the change , it seems , is “ The Business of Being Born , ” a documentary produced by the actress and former talk show host Ricki Lake , which ran in only a few theaters during its theatrical release in January but has become an underground hit among expectant parents since coming out on DVD .
( Rentrak , a company that monitors DVD rentals , said that instead of dropping off , as typically happens with new releases , the film is being rented at consistent rates . )
With scenes of several home births ( including one in which Ms. Lake delivers her second child in the bathtub of her former West Village apartment ) , the film argues that women ’s bodies are perfectly well equipped to give birth at home and that the occasion need not be a medical event .
Many women are wary of hospital births , both because of a patient ’s limited control over the process and because of the growing frequency of Caesarean sections ( use of the procedure increased by 50 percent nationwide from 1996 to 2006 , to nearly one in three births , according to the National Center for Health Statistics ) .
“ The Business of Being Born ” seems to offer an alternative , and “ is putting home births on the map in a way that makes women feel like it ’s a really legitimate option , ” said Élan V. McAllister , founder of Choices in Childbirth , a four - year - old nonprofit educational group that publishes “ The New York Guide to a Healthy Birth . ”
“ In your home you ’re able to move around and be in the tub or in the shower .
You ’re able to eat and behave in a natural , more normal way .
If you believe birth is not a medical emergency , it is the ideal place because it ’s the place you can really let go and follow what your body wants you to do . ”
Mrs. Scharback , for example , tried many different positions over the course of her labor : leaning on the windowsill of her newly decorated nursery , sitting on a birth stool , crouching on the bed , sitting on the toilet and , eventually , leaning back against her husband inside the warm birthing pool .
Finally , having endured 40 hours of regular contractions with no painkillers  like most women who have home births , she refused them  she let out a guttural scream and pushed her new son , Noah , into the world .
Home birth also appeals to the desire of many new mothers to stay put , and in continual contact with their babies , after the grueling ordeal .
Michelle Zassenhaus , 33 , a Web designer and photographer who gave birth for the first time in March , said her apartment in Park Slope , Brooklyn , was an ideal environment for calm postpartum recovery with her husband , Silvio Galea , and their new daughter , Lucienne .
Shortly after the birth , “ the doula and midwife got us all cleaned up , cleaned up the apartment , looked in our fridge , figured out what kind of food they could prepare for us , showed us some breastfeeding techniques , put us in bed , gave us some food , and left , ” Ms. Zassenhaus said .
“ Those first couple of days when you ’re usually suffering through postpartum , we were in this very quiet , intimate state of bliss . ”

American Apparel does n’t do high gloss sexy like Abercrombie or Calvin Klein .
There ’s no silicone or collagen or Botox .
There ’s no major Photoshopping or retouching the models .
It ’s a reflection of our idea of what sexy is as a society .
The perfect blonde on the beach is leaving our collective fantasy ; our idea of sexy is n’t defined by film or by print anymore , it ’s defined by the internet .
Our generation has unprecedented access to smut , and it ’s infiltrated our definitions of beauty and our everyday fantasies .
Gonzo porn is our sensual fantasy now .
Set in some freaks house as a 19 year old meth - addicted girl with low self - esteem knocks on the door .
“ I ’m here for the party . ”
Hott .
Arguably , both American Apparel and Calvin Klein ads show the same amount of skin .
AA ’s ads are so much more intense because they remind us of the filthy business we look up late at night .
That ’s why they ’re so successful .
These are the images we associate with sex now , and American Apparel copies them perfectly .
We ’re jaded to all the Calvin Klein ads set in tropical locations and shot in sepia .
We need real color regular girls who look like they ’re about to have sex .
We need barely legal .
Check out the ads :
Euphemisms are terms that frame reality in just the right way , protecting everyone involved from the necessary unpleasantness .
A good euphemism is the difference between " going to prison " and " getting reformed in a correctional facility . "
As you 'll see , euphemisms can be invented to hide some pretty horrifying things .
So horrifying , in fact , that our Photo Research Department refused to look up relevant pictures and decided instead to load this article up with softer , sweeter images to take your mind off this miserable language of ours .

You'd think it describes that time your mother caught you spying on the girl next door with your left hand on some binoculars and the right ravishing your nether regions .
In contrast , monocular deprivation might describe what happens when a monocle - wearing gentlemen is surprised ( causing his monocle to pop out and roll out of the parlor and into the saloon ) .
What it Actually Refers to ...
It means sewing an animal 's eyes shut for the purpose of research .
We 're not just talking about rats either , researchers do it to kittens too ( see the link up there ) .

The drive was discovered to be missing during an audit A missing computer hard drive may have contained details of 1.7 million people who had enquired about joining the armed forces , the government has said .
The drive was reported missing last week by EDS , a firm contracted to the Ministry of Defence .
Armed Forces Minister Bob Ainsworth told MPs the information , which went missing at an EDS site in Hampshire , was " unlikely " to have been encrypted .
It is not known if the drive was lost or stolen .
An investigation has begun .
In a written statement , Mr Ainsworth said the drive " may , in the worst case , contain details relating to 1.7 million individuals who have enquired about joining the armed forces " .
Bank details
While some who had made " casual enquiries " would only have given a name and contact details , " more extensive personal data " may have been held on those who had applied to join , he said .
" In some cases this will include personal information such as next of kin details , passport and National Insurance numbers , drivers ' licence and bank details and National Health Service number , " he said .
This data loss is an absolute scandal and on a far larger scale than previously feared
Nick Harvey , Lib Dems " EDS assesses that it is unlikely that the device was encrypted because it was stored within a secure site that exceeded the standards necessary for restricted information . "
Banks of those who may have had financial details on the disc drive have been informed and the Ministry of Defence police are investigating .
The disc drive was found to be missing during an audit at the site .
Mr Ainsworth said a review into MoD data security showed a " crucial need to implement wholesale improvements " .
In September it emerged details of up to 500,000 former servicemen and women , held on three portable disc drives at RAF Innsworth in Gloucestershire , had gone missing .
' Serial incompetence '
In July the MoD said 658 of its laptops had been stolen over four years and 26 portable memory sticks had been stolen or misplaced since the start of the year .
For the Conservatives , shadow defence secretary Liam Fox said : " This is another symptom of serial incompetence displayed by this government when it comes to data control .
" It seems incomprehensible that we are still learning the details of this dreadful incident . "
Liberal Democrat defence spokesman Nick Harvey said : " This data loss is an absolute scandal and on a far larger scale than previously feared . "
He said the missing information was " a potential goldmine for organised crime and could even compromise national security " .
" In the past soldiers have been targeted by extremists .
One dreads to think what might happen if this information were to fall into the wrong hands , " he added .

Pops :
We 'll further diversify our meager income by planting some U - Pick berries on a couple acres and going as whole - hog into market gardening as time allows next year , direct selling grass fed beef and eggs and some value added ( jams , jellies ) and homemade stuff at the farmers markets and roadside .
JD :
Just curious , but how much driving is involved in these businesses ?
For example , how far would people generally drive for your U - Pick berries ?
And how far do you and your customers generally drive to a farmers market ?
Do you keep your beef chilled or frozen ?
Do you use a generator at the market ?
Pops :
I talked to neighbors who have blueberries they are about to retire from and they said people mainly come from the small town about 5 miles away but some come 40 miles from Springfield or Joplin .
They bring their kids and grandkids and a picnic lunch and have a " Farm Experience " .
With the farmers market people show up with their straw hats and organic cotton shopping bags to be seen by their Green peers .
I could make a little money today at the little market on our square but to do any good we 'll need to drive to one of the bigger towns — our roadside stand can only make $ 50 or $ 100 a week and that 's only a few weeks per year .
We have found that if a customer drives a round trip distance of more than four miles in order to purchase their organic vegetables , their carbon emissions are likely to be greater than the emissions from the system of cold storage , packing , transport to a regional hub and final transport to customer 's doorstep used by large - scale vegetable box suppliers .

In the worst scenario , a UK consumer driving six miles to buy Kenyan green beans emits more carbon per bean than flying them from Kenya to the United Kingdom .

I totally agree with you though about the degree to which rural America is dependent on petroleum .
People in Montana think nothing of a 100 mile round trip commute or of driving 8 hours round trip to go to the mall .
It always impressed me how independent the people where I lived were WRT snow cleanup .
It could dump a foot and the next morning everybody would be out with a loader or a snow plow cleaning it all up .
In one sense they 're very self sufficient , but all that equipment runs off petroleum .
Take away the gasoline , and that area would be totally uninhabitable in the winter .
To a large extent it 's this sort of fake independence .
They 're more self sufficient in terms of being able to use different technologies and manufactured materials without the aid of a specialist , but they 're just as dependent if not more so on the extractive and manufacturing industries in far away places keeping them supplied .
Our isolation also meant we were burning a lot of gas .
A simple drive for groceries was a 40 - minute round trip .
Fortunately we both worked at home and had no children , so we could go for days without using the car .
But the odometer was whirling to higher numbers than it ever had in the city .
A couple of families had moved off our hill because they were exhausted by two to four round trips each day down our steep , potholed gravel road to work , school , soccer practice , music lessons , and shopping .
We cherished our decade - plus in the country , but eventually the realities began to pile up .
There was n’t a local market for the work we did .
Community events left us saddened by the gulf between our way of life and theirs .
And we were still tethered to the fossil - fuel beast , just by a much longer lifeline of wire , pipe , and pavement .
That the beast looked smaller by being farther away no longer fooled us .

Soaring gas prices are a double - whammy for many rural residents :
They often pay more than people who live in cities and suburbs because of the expense of hauling fuel to their communities , and they must drive greater distances for life 's necessities : work , groceries , medical care and , of course , gas .
Meanwhile , incomes typically are lower in rural areas , making increasingly high gas prices an especially urgent concern .
Rural households also are more likely to have older , less fuel - efficient vehicles such as pickups , the Federal Highway Administration ( FHWA ) says .
The average age of a vehicle in a rural household : 8.7 years , compared with 7.9 years for an urban vehicle .
Rural residents do more driving , too — an average of 3,100 miles a year more than urban dwellers , the FHWA says .
A May survey by the Oil Price Information Service ( OPIS ) , a fuel analysis company , and Wright Express , a company that collects data on credit card transactions , found that people in rural areas spend as much as 16.02 % of their monthly family income on gas , while people in urban areas of New York and New Jersey spend as little as 2.05 % .

When the only gas station in Allen , Neb. , closed last summer , a gallon of gas cost $ 2.56 , according to prices posted on two abandoned pumps .
Since then , Allen 's 411 residents have been driving 11 miles to Wakefield or 28 miles to South Sioux City to fill up .
Allen 's grocery store went out of business last August , forcing people to shop in South Sioux City or 21 miles away in Wayne .
Doctors , dentists and other essentials also require a road trip .
The nearest movie theater is in Wayne .
" You have to leave town for about everything , " says Jerry Schroeder , an insurance agent who has lived in Allen for all of his 57 years .

These days , they 're also cussing and shaking their heads about the price of that gasoline .
People are doing that everywhere , but in small towns such as Leeton , population 619 , it 's even more of a gut punch because nearly every working adult commutes to jobs elsewhere .
These days , there had better be a really good job on the other end of that trip .
Don Campbell 's daily commute to Kansas City - about 100 miles each way - costs him roughly $ 866 a month at $ 3.90 per gallon .
But he 's a union iron worker and says he can make the math work .
Most of his neighbors can't .
For them and thousands of other small - town residents across the country who drive long distances to jobs that pay little more than minimum wage , the high cost of gas is making that daily commute cost - prohibitive .
So much so that economists predict that over the next few years , the country could see a migration that would greatly reduce the population of Small Town America - resulting in a painful shift away from lifestyle , family roots , traditions and school ties .

I 've often thought that moving to the country is one of dumber things you could do in response to peak oil .
My reasoning for this is simple : people in the country have a massive dependence on cars and gasoline .
For example , my brother used to live on a ranch in the extreme boondocks of Idaho ( the area was only electrified in the 1980s ) and he and his wife had to drive about 100 miles to go to the supermarket .
That 's an extreme case , but the general principle is very true .
The country has incredible sprawl , and you have to drive really long distances to take care of your daily business .
Urban dwellers like myself , on the other hand , do n't have to drive at all .
My supermarket is a 3 minute walk from my front door .
It seems obvious to me that country people -- at least those who are n't making good money from serious agriculture or some other business -- are the ones who will get it in the neck first from peak oil .
If you think about it , it 's just a straightforward extension of Kunstler 's logic .
If the suburbs / exurbs are going to die because they 're too oil dependent , then surely the rural areas will die even quicker because they are even more oil dependent .
Of course , savvy people / companies who are already making money on farm operations will continue to profit from food production , and will have the earning power to remain in the country .
They belong there .
Likewise , if you do n't have to work or you 're wealthy , then moving to a rural area may be a great response to peak oil .
I 'm not talking about such people .
Or , if you can be an extremely self - sufficient subsistence farmer , and perhaps squat on some land , then my critique does n't apply .
But if you 're a working person who needs income to live , support a family , or build up a doomstead , it seems to me that going rural is jumping from the frying pan into the fire .
Here 's some articles from summer 2008 that spell it out in painful detail : Pops is a rural doomsteader from peakoil.com , and he and I had a little exchange which is relevant this topic : Smallpoxgirl -- another peakoil.com doomer -- talks in a similar vein about driving from Seattle to Olympia ( 60 miles ) for a farmer 's market .
But these long drives totally negate the purpose of local food : Another study gets the same results :
The same point can be seen another way .
Suppose a family buzzes out to Pops ' farm and picks 10 pounds of berries .
Driving an average US vehicle , they 'll burn 4 gallons of gasoline for a round trip of 80 miles .
( Incidentally , that gasoline will weigh about 2.5 times more than the berries purchased . )
Now , a commercial aircraft gets roughly 70 miles per gallon per passenger , and a passenger would be roughly equivalent to 20 boxes of berries ( each containing 10 pounds ) .
So for 4 gallons , you could send a passenger 280 miles , and a passenger is 20 boxes of berries , so you could send a box of berries about 5600 miles by air .
In other words , driving 80 miles by car to buy 10 pounds of berries uses the same amount of fuel as shipping them 5600 + miles by air .
And it just gets worse the less you buy .
With a 5 pound box , you 're talking 11,200 miles -- about half the circumference of the earth .
In other words , the only thing more fuel intensive than the 3000 mile salad is the 25 mile farmer 's market salad .***** Doomers really can't help but grant my point ... smallpoxgirl : Toby Hemenway , a doomer who went rural and then realized after 10 years that it was n't such a great idea after all :
More real - world info on how rural areas get mauled by high gas prices : During the last bout of high oil prices , there was some reporting about gas stations closing in rural regions ( Fears for rural filling stations Rural motorists running on empty as pumps close ) forcing people to drive long distances for gas .
As you would expect , this can turn into a nasty EROEI situation .
Here 's another report in the same vein ... Still more on people getting savaged by high oil prices in the country ( from High Gas Prices Threaten to Drain Small Towns ' Populations ) : Perhaps the worst threat of all is a vicious cycle of depopulation .
High gas prices cause commuting to work / the doctor / school / shopping to be too expensive , so people leave the rural towns / counties and move to larger cities .
Govt. revenues decline ( people fleeing ) while govt .
costs rise ( gas for the cops , school buses , ambulances , inspectors , garbage collection etc. )
Then merchants pull out and gas stations pull out , because there is n't enough population to support them .
Govt. services get erratic .
More people get fed up and leave etc. etc .
Next thing you know , your rural " community " is n't there anymore .

Google Inc is lobbying internet providers and phone companies to establish a separate internet traffic lane in order to prioritize the search engine giant ’s content , according to a leading report today .
Google has for years been one of the loudest advocates of internet neutrality , the practice of giving all internet data traffic the same level of priority .
However , the Wall Street Journal today reveals that the company , which now incorporates Youtube , wants to set up its own fast track on the web .
The precedent this would set would be to allow companies to pay internet providers for preferential treatment .
Smaller companies , businesses and websites could be left operating in the internet slow lane , unable to compete with the elite of the corporate world .
Defenders of net neutrality say this would constitute a form of censorship and maintain it would kill off the level playing field that has forged the greatest technological advance in human history .
Such a move may inevitably lead to a situation further down the line where a few large companies have a monopoly over online content and distribution .
Ironically , Google has positioned itself as a strong advocate of net neutrality and has often found itself on the receiving end of charges of freeloading from providers .
The company has responded by saying the report in The Wall Street Journal is “ confused ” and has reaffirmed its support for network neutrality .
Instead , Google explained that the OpenEdge effort ( the subject of the WSJ story ) was a plan to peer its edge - caching devices directly with the network operators so that the users of those broadband carriers get faster access to Google and YouTube ’s content , reports GigaOM .
However , the company did not deny that it was seeking to get its packets ahead of others in this instance by paying internet carriers .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The founding principle of the world wide web was that it is a decentralized communication medium born as a “ neutral network ” , there are no overriding controllers , as there are with television networks , to whose protocols users and content distributors must adhere to .
This is what defines the internet as truly free .
Though Federal Communications Commission guidelines favor net neutrality , there is no concrete law that could stop carriers adopting the fast lanes , which appeal to them as a way of raising more revenue to upgrade their networks .
Indeed , the FCC rules have been weakening on neutrality for the past few years , allowing communications companies such as AT&T and Verizon to publicly acknowledge their intentions to create so called internet fast lanes .
Other companies such as Comcast have been caught delaying internet traffic , in itself a form of prioritization .
Such moves by carriers , though much more subtle , are essentially no different to governments filtering and blocking content they deem to be sensitive or controversial , a practice now commonplace not only in Communist China but also throughout the so called free world .
The precedent to clamp down on internet neutrality also dovetails with the move towards the designation of a new form of the internet , of which we have consistently warned our readers , known as Internet 2 .
This would be a faster , more streamlined elite equivalent of the internet available to users who were willing to pay more for a much improved service .
providers may only allow streaming audio and video on your websites if you were eligible for Internet 2 .
Of course , Internet 2 would be greatly regulated and only “ appropriate content ” would be accepted by an FCC or government bureau .
Everything else would be relegated to the “ slow lane ” internet , the junkyard as it were .
The proponents of the various “ Internet 2 ″ style projects all maintain that the internet in it ’s current form is “ dead ” or “ dying ” , citing the problem of providing more and more bandwidth as it grows .
The fact of the matter is that bandwidth is unlimited , as long as carriers are prepared to provide it , but the continuation of a neutral internet means less control and less profits for the corporate elite .
We are witnessing the first steps on a road of control and corporate centralization of the internet , a move to guarantee the internet serves the commercial and political purposes of large corporations .
An internet without neutrality would be a direct attack on the right to information free of censorship or control .

Lua is a powerful , fast , light - weight , embeddable scripting language .
Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics .
Lua is dynamically typed , runs by interpreting bytecode for a register - based virtual machine , and has automatic memory management with incremental garbage collection , making it ideal for configuration , scripting , and rapid prototyping .
Lua is a proven , robust language
Lua has been used in many industrial applications ( e.g. , Adobe ’s Photoshop Lightroom ) , with an emphasis on embedded systems and games ( e.g. , World of Warcraft ) .
Lua is currently the leading scripting language in games .
Lua has a solid reference manual and there are several books about it .
Several versions of Lua have been released and used in real applications since its creation in 1993 .
Lua featured in HOPL III , the Third ACM SIGPLAN History of Programming Languages Conference , in June 2007 .
Lua is fast
Lua has a deserved reputation for performance .
To claim to be “ as fast as Lua ” is an aspiration of other scripting languages .
Several benchmarks show Lua as the fastest language in the realm of interpreted scripting languages .
Lua is fast not only in fine - tuned benchmark programs , but in real life too .
A substantial fraction of large applications have been written in Lua .
Lua is portable
Lua is distributed in a small package and builds out - of - the - box in all platforms that have an ANSI / ISO C compiler .
Lua runs on all flavors of Unix and Windows , and also on mobile devices ( such as handheld computers and cell phones that use BREW , Symbian , Pocket PC , etc. ) and embedded microprocessors ( such as ARM and Rabbit ) for applications like Lego MindStorms .
Lua is embeddable
Lua is a fast language engine with small footprint that you can embed easily into your application .
Lua has a simple and well documented API that allows strong integration with code written in other languages .
It is easy to extend Lua with libraries written in other languages .
It is also easy to extend programs written in other languages with Lua .
Lua has been used to extend programs written not only in C and C++ , but also in Java , C# , Smalltalk , Fortran , Ada , and even in other scripting languages , such as Perl and Ruby .
Lua is powerful ( but simple )
A fundamental concept in the design of Lua is to provide meta-mechanisms for implementing features , instead of providing a host of features directly in the language .
For example , although Lua is not a pure object - oriented language , it does provide meta-mechanisms for implementing classes and inheritance .
Lua ’s meta - mechanisms bring an economy of concepts and keep the language small , while allowing the semantics to be extended in unconventional ways .
Lua is small
Adding Lua to an application does not bloat it .
The tarball for Lua 5.1.4 , which contains source code , documentation , and examples , takes 212 K compressed and 860 K uncompressed .
The source contains around 17000 lines of C. Under Linux , the Lua interpreter built with all standard Lua libraries takes 153 K and the Lua library takes 203K .
Lua is free
Lua is free software , distributed under a very liberal license ( the well - known MIT license ) .
It can be used for any purpose , including commercial purposes , at absolutely no cost .
Justdownload it and use it .
For specific reasons why Lua is a good choice also for constrained devices like cell phones , read this summary by Mike Pall .
Online , the virtual “ nurse - in ” to protest Facebook ’s ban on breast - feeding photos has taken off , with hundreds hourly joining a group that crept toward 70,000 members Saturday evening .
The real - life , pavement - pounding protest drew fewer placards than photojournalists Saturday , with only a handful turning out to sing , chant and breast - feed in front of Facebook ’s downtown Palo Alto headquarters .
But it had all the elements of a Palo Alto protest :
A handful of peaceful pickets discreetly tucked away in a University Avenue plaza ; placards reading “ Hey Facebook , Breast - feeding is not Obscene , ” protesters chatting up the media ; and indifferent passers - by .
A member of the Raging Grannies , the Midpeninsula activists who stage various theatrical protests , showed up to proclaim in song that “ our breasts are n’t porn . ”
It ’s hard to say whether either demonstration will move Facebook executives — who appeared to not be at work Saturday — to lift the site ’s prohibition of breasts displayed on members ’ profiles and albums .
Facebook says the areola , the dark skin around the nipple , violates a policy on “ obscene , pornographic or sexually explicit ” material .
On their Facebook group site , which also serves as an open petition to the company , nursing advocates by Saturday evening had posted more than 10,000 wall comments , two dozen videos and nearly 3,000 photos of breast - feeding , while starting more than 1,500 discussion threads .
Facebook , it seemed , was not removing them .
All this might not have happened had the social networking site simply answered Heather Farley ’s e-mail asking why the networking giant in October removed photos of her breast - feeding her baby .
When she posted another photo and then received a letter threatening to delete her account , she went public .
“ I felt bullied , ” said Farley , of Provo , Utah , who decided to protest while she was in California for the holidays visiting in - laws .
Her challenge drew support from other Facebook critics and lactation advocates .
Among the pickets Saturday were her mother - in - law , Sheri Farley of Placer County , who breast - fed her eight children and now boasts that 19 of her 20 grandchildren have been nursed .
Alexa Sockol of Redwood City , a doula who assists with childbirth and newborns , was nursing 6 - month - old Ethan at the protest .
“ There are enough challenges with initiating and continuing breast - feeding without complicating it with social rules , ” she said .
The picketing also drew Facebook newbies like Lucile Couplan - Cashman , 56 , of Palo Alto , and Bernadette Gersh , 46 , of Redwood City .
“ I did n’t know that Facebook was so puritan , ” said Couplan - Cashman , who does n’t have an account on the site .
Heather Farley , a self - described “ avid user ” of Facebook with 200 online friends , said she does n’t know how far she ’ll pursue her protest .
She does n’t want to lose her Facebook account , which is the primary way she keeps in touch with high school and college friends and is the place she and her husband post their family photos .
Still , she ’s blogged about her disputes with Facebook .
And although the company still has n’t answered any of her electronic messages , she ’s now hearing from people worldwide .
“ I ca n’t believe this is happening , ” she said in wonderment .

Just about 12 hours after an accident killed an Oakville man and injured four other people , traffic in the Hwy .
427 - Queen Elizabeth Way - Gardiner Expressway area is once again moving smoothly .
After closing off Toronto - bound QEW traffic at Evans Ave. and Hwy .
427 southbound traffic at the QEW westbound ramp for most of the day , police reopened everything just after 6 o'clock this evening .
" I have n't seen much worse than this , " said OPP Const .
Dave Woodford earlier today .
Just before 6:30 a.m. a transport truck carrying copper tubing was travelling on the Hwy .
427 southbound ramp when the trailer portion detached from the truck and plunged over the guardrail and onto the eastbound QEW , crushing four cars .
Police say two cars were hit by debris .
Woodford described the car that suffered the most damage as " literally cut in half . "
A 53 - year - old man from Oakville was airlifted to St. Michael 's Hospital with critical injuries and later died .
The driver of the truck , a man from London , suffered a broken jaw and was taken to Trillium Hospital .
Three others , including an 18 - year - old woman , suffered minor injuries .
Mariano Estrela was travelling into Toronto this morning when he saw the trailer plunge from the ramp .
" I see the trailer fly from the bridge ... I closed my eyes . "
The 62 - year - old , who works for Hank Deenen Landscaping , was on his way to a job when copper tubing landed on the hood of his truck .
" At this time I think I am dead - now I 'm alive . "
Estrela needed help getting out of his truck , but was not seriously injured .
An OPP reconstruction team was on site most of the day , trying to determine what caused the accident .
They will be looking at speed , the mechanics of the truck , the driver 's record and fatigue .

MY bleeding city .
My poor great bleeding heart of a city .
Why do they go after Mumbai ?
There ’s something about this island - state that appalls religious extremists , Hindus and Muslims alike .
Perhaps because Mumbai stands for lucre , profane dreams and an indiscriminate openness .
Mumbai is all about dhandha , or transaction .
From the street food vendor squatting on a sidewalk , fiercely guarding his little business , to the tycoons and their dreams of acquiring Hollywood , this city understands money and has no guilt about the getting and spending of it .
I once asked a Muslim man living in a shack without indoor plumbing what kept him in the city .
“ Mumbai is a golden songbird , ” he said .
It flies quick and sly , and you ’ll have to work hard to catch it , but if you do , a fabulous fortune will open up for you .
The executives who congregated in the Taj Mahal hotel were chasing this golden songbird .
The terrorists want to kill the songbird .
Just as cinema is a mass dream of the audience , Mumbai is a mass dream of the peoples of South Asia .
Bollywood movies are the most popular form of entertainment across the subcontinent .
Through them , every Pakistani and Bangladeshi is familiar with the wedding - cake architecture of the Taj and the arc of the Gateway of India , symbols of the city that gives the industry its name .
It is no wonder that one of the first things the Taliban did upon entering Kabul was to shut down the Bollywood video rental stores .
The Taliban also banned , would n’t you know it , the keeping of songbirds .
Bollywood dream - makers are shaken .
“ I am ashamed to say this , ” Amitabh Bachchan , superstar of a hundred action movies , wrote on his blog .
“ As the events of the terror attack unfolded in front of me , I did something for the first time and one that I had hoped never ever to be in a situation to do .
Before retiring for the night , I pulled out my licensed .32 revolver , loaded it and put it under my pillow . ”
Millions of pounds are being spent annually on dozens of luxurious homes complete with domestic staff , including cooks , cleaners and gardeners , for Army top brass .
More than £ 4.4 m was spent on " official service residences " last year , according to new figures disclosed by the Ministry of Defence under Freedom of Information rules .
The figures have provoked anger among politicians and campaigners who called the amounts " horrendous " last night and contrasted them with " appalling " accommodation conditions faced by most ordinary soldiers .
Bob Russell , the Liberal Democrat MP for Colchester , said many rank - and - file troops were returning from fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan to " sub- standard " housing .
" Married soldiers are coming home to find their families living in conditions that are not up to acceptable standards , " he said .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Julie McCarthy , chief executive of the Army Families Federation , condemned the millions spent .
" The amount of money is horrendous , " she said .
" We 've got units coming back from overseas and we do n't have sufficient houses in the right area , so have people being spread to the four winds . "
The Liberal Democrat Defence spokesman Nick Harvey said : " The Government is quite creative in describing the amounts it is spending on housing , as the lion 's share is going on the running costs of existing accommodation .
What they are providing for the top brass shows a clear difference in how they regard the different ranks . "
Referring to accommodation issues in his Christmas message to troops this year , General Sir David Richards , Commander - in - Chief , Land Forces , admitted there is " much more still to do " and assured soldiers " we will maintain firm pressure to deliver in this area " .
But while many soldiers face spending years in crumbling homes badly in need of repair , the head of the British Army , General Sir Richard Dannatt benefits from living in a residence that could cost up to £ 256,000 a year to run .
Sir Richard has the use of the late Diana , Princess of Wales 's former apartment at Kensington Palace in London while his successor - in - waiting , General Sir David Richards , enjoys the trappings of Bulford Manor .
" Occupants of official service residences hold posts that require them to entertain and accommodate guests , " the MoD saidin a statement .
" Expenditure is kept under close scrutiny and tight control . "
The MoD refused to disclose detailed figures for individual officers but it is understood the maximum senior officers are expected to contribute towards their accommodation is less than £ 9,000 a year .
Even senior officers who do not live in an official residence can still live in expensive properties at little cost .
The Assistant Chief of the General Staff pays just £ 100 towards a rent bill of more than £ 1,400 a month , it was revealed last year .
By contrast , an average soldier living in a three - bed semi- detached house has to pay around £ 400 in rent and council tax each month .
Thousands of soldiers are living in poor quality accommodation , and low - paid troops are near the " UK definition of poverty " , according to military sources .
Opening new barracks at Catterick , North Yorkshire , last month , the Defence minister Kevan Jones said there had been a " legacy of under - funding in Armed Forces housing " .

Swiss glaciers are melting away at an accelerating rate and many will vanish this century if climate projections are correct , two new studies suggest .
One assessment found that some 10 cubic km of ice have been lost from 1,500 glaciers over the past nine years .
The other study , based on a sample of 30 representative glaciers , indicates the group 's members are now losing a metre of thickness every year .
Both pieces of work come out of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology .
" The trend is negative , but what we see is that the trend is also steepening , " said Matthias Huss from the Zurich university 's Laboratory of Hydraulics , Hydrology and Glaciology .
What really matters is how much ice we have in the big glaciers , because the small ones will disappear ; that seems clear
Daniel Farinotti , Swiss Federal Institute of Technology " Glaciers are starting to lose mass increasingly fast , " he told BBC News .
The retreat is being driven largely by longer melting seasons .
The other key factor in glacier health - the amount of winter snowfall to replace ice melt - shows no long - term changes .
The two studies are being presented here at the American Geophysical Union 's Fall Meeting , the world 's largest annual gathering of Earth scientists .
They are not the first to assess the status of Swiss glaciers but few others can match their scope .
Summer heatwave
In one , Daniel Farinotti and his team tried to assess the total volume of ice in Swiss glaciers - 1,500 of them , from the mighty Aletschgletscher ( the largest glacier in the Alps ) to small ice fields that cover less than three square km .
The research used direct measurements where available , and combined this with modelling to estimate ice volumes for areas that are data - deficient .
The assessment found a total ice volume present in the Swiss Alps of about 74 cubic km by the year 1999 ( a baseline for the purpose of the study ) .
It is a bigger figure than previously thought .

" However , 1999 is quite some time ago now , so what we did was try to calculate the volume lost since this baseline ; and we estimate a figure of 13 % - from 1999 to today , " explained Mr Farinotti .
For 2003 , remembered for its strong heatwave across Europe , the team estimates that 3 - 4 % of the volume in Switzerland at that time was lost in that one year alone .
Mr Farinotti said his study highlighted the importance of the largest glaciers as ice reservoirs : more than 80 % of the total ice volume is stored in the 50 largest glaciers .
" Aletschgletscher , for example , has about 12 % of the area of Swiss glaciers but it contains about a quarter of all ice that is present in Switzerland , " he told BBC News .
" What really matters is how much ice we have in the big glaciers , because the small ones will disappear ; that seems clear .
For them , it 's just a matter of years .
But in glaciers like Aletsch that have a lot of ice , they will be around for decades . "
THE DECLINE OF FOUR SWISS GLACIERS SINCE 1860
The four glaciers here represent a range of types , sizes , locations , and climatic zones .
The assessment has now been extended to 30 glaciers Area covered by the glaciers - Aletsch : 83.01sq km ; Rhone : 16.45sq km ; Gries : 5.26sq km ; Silvretta : 2.89sq km Distinct phases of growth ( I & III ) and strong ice loss ( II & IV ) are seen within an overall trend for the period which is negative
The cumulative mass balance is given in " metres of water equivalent " .
Essentially , it records the net thickness change of the glaciers
Thickness change over the entire period - Aletsch : - 65 m ; Rhone : - 43 m ; Gries : - 97 m ; Silvretta : - 35 m
The study by Mr Huss and his team takes a slightly different approach .
It considers just a key group of 30 glaciers , representing all sizes , types , and locations .
Again , using a mixture of direct data and modelling , the scientists analysed the mass trends from 1900 to 2007 .
Over this period , there is a significant negative trend .
It is not linear , however .
There are two distinct phases when glaciers gained mass , and even a phase in the 1940s when the glaciers lost mass faster than they do now .
But in general , over the period , there is a retreat ; and in the last 30 - 50 years , the shrinkage has accelerated .

Mr Huss has applied future climate projections to the 10 km - long Rhone Glacier , which in Swiss terms is mid-sized .
" Rhone Glacier will have almost gone in 100 years , " said Mr Huss .
" It first retreats not very fast , until about 2050 .
Then , it retreats really quite fast .
It means that most glaciers , the smaller ones , will have disappeared by the end of this century . "
Switzerland 's glaciers are iconic but their shrinkage is more than just an issue for the tourists with their cameras ; their loss would have profound ecosystem and economic consequences .
" Glaciers store the water in winter and release it in the summer when it is dry and warm when there is more need for water , " added Mr Huss .
" And they can also store it in the wet and cold years and release it in the hot and warm years .
That 's an important reservoir .
" In the south - western part of Switzerland , almost all run -off water from glaciers is temporarily stored and used for electricity production .
More than half the electricity consumed in Switzerland is produced from hydropower . "
The Huss - led research builds on work published in the Journal of Geophysical Research this year .
The Farinotti-led research has been submitted to the Journals of Glaciology , and the Journal of Global and Planetary Change .

VIENNA ( Reuters ) -
The election of Barack Obama as U.S. president has given crucial impetus toward implementing the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty more than a decade after it was negotiated , pact officials said on Wednesday .
The global treaty , which prohibits all nuclear explosions , cannot enter into force before it is ratified by all 44 states listed in an annex that took part in the 1996 negotiations and have nuclear power or research reactors .
Nine of the 44 have not ratified the pact -- Iran , Israel , North Korea , Indonesia , Egypt , India , Pakistan , China and the United States , where the administration of outgoing President George W. Bush was wary of multilateral commitments restraining its security options .
But Obama said in his campaign he aimed to secure U.S. Senate ratification as quickly as possible , a pledge which , if honored , treaty administrators said could do much to bring the other key holdouts on board .
Tibor Toth , the treaty organization ’s executive secretary , said at the close of a meeting of 180 member states that Obama ’s commitment meant “ we are turning the corner in a wider political sense ... and the nine remaining dominoes should fall . ”
The meeting ’s chairman , Hans Lundborg , estimated that could now happen within two years , although Obama -- who takes office on January 20 -- admittedly would be preoccupied initially with the world financial crisis which originated in the United States .
“ We have political momentum after the U.S. election ... and Obama ’s message is extremely crucial to us , and for other countries to pick up that message , ” Lundborg said .
Obama also has said he would encourage other states , most notably regional nuclear rivals India and Pakistan , to embrace the treaty .
Indonesia said recently it was undertaking “ serious preparations ” for ratification of the test ban .
Other ratification laggards have had concerns about limiting their strategic choices or doubts about the treaty ’s verification mechanisms .
The United States , China , India , Pakistan are declared nuclear weapons powers , while Israel is widely assumed to be one but never confirmed this .
Stalinist North Korea tested a nuclear device in 2006 and agreed a year later to a disarmament - for - aid accord with five powers but the deal has faltered in disputes over verification .
Iran denies Western suspicions that it is secretly trying to build nuclear weapons , insisting its uranium enrichment programme is for electricity generation only .
There is pressure building on the incoming Obama Justice Department to somehow adjudicate the war crimes committed by the George W. Bush administration , starting at the top .
The political problem is that these crimes also implicate leading Democrats , thereby rendering true justice nearly impossible .
This is another compelling piece of evidence for the fact that we are living under a post - constitutional government , no longer responsible to the rule of law .
If we do n’t hold our leaders to the same standard of justice as the rest of America ’s citizens , or any other of the world ’s criminals , I do n’t see how anyone could argue that this is a functioning democracy .
Equality under the law is democracy ’s cornerstone .
But in our post - constitutional , post - Bush v. Gore age , we already know that the judiciary is just as politicized as the other two branches of government .
And under a political system dominated by the military - industrial complex , there does n’t seem to be any such thing as a war crime .
Americans were torturing people in Vietnam and Korea .
The officer in charge at the My Lai massacre , where hundreds of women and children died , served three years of house arrest .
The defense industry protects its own , and always has .

It ’s hard to see how a president could get a fair verdict in this country , in any case .
As David Sirota notes , “ presidentialism , ” which confers on that office an elevated , almost sacred character , is a basic element in America ’s civil religion .
We ’re all brainwashed with the idea that the president is somebody who needs rows of heavily - armed storm troopers lining Pennsylvania Avenue to protect him — rather than somebody like Thomas Jefferson , who walked alone back to his rooming house to have lunch with the other boarders , after his inauguration .
We ’ve given the president the “ emperor ” status suitable to an empire .
Where would you find a jury of his “ peers , ” outside of the establishment accessories to the crimes , like the Democrats ?
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
To spare ourselves the national agony of suffering through either the exoneration or trial of the Bush war criminals , the United States should join the International Criminal Court and turn them over to that body .
The justice would be at the very least poetic , given Bush ’s unrelenting opposition to the ICC .
But putting Bush and company before an international tribunal would also help repair exactly the damage that was done to America ’s international reputation with the barbarous scandals of Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo .
Handing the criminals over to the ICC would mean , in a way that no other action would , that this nation hereby agrees to abide by the international rule of law .
It would allow America to once again take a place among civilized nations .
It can also be a rallying point for those who think that we cannot have a full restoration of the rule of law in this nation without some accounting for those who led America down a very dark path .
If it is politically impossible to put war criminals on trial in this country ( except for low - level “ bad apples ” who made the mistake of filming themselves in the unfortunate act of following orders ) , then the only resolution is to turn them over to the international community , for the sake of justice .
That ’s the direction in which a President Obama needs to be led .
America needs to rejoin the international community by recognizing the global jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court .
That act alone has the potential to mark the beginning of the end of “ American exceptionalism . ”
It could also mean the beginning of justice for American war criminals .
Israel seems to have little time for the irony that a modern Jewish shrine to " coexistence and tolerance " is being built on the graves of the city ’s Muslim forefathers .
The Israeli Supreme Court ’s approval last week of the building of a Jewish Museum of Tolerance over an ancient Muslim cemetery in Jerusalem is the latest in a series of legal and physical assaults on Islamic holy places since Israel ’s founding in 1948 .
The verdict ended a four - year struggle by Islamic authorities inside Israel to stop development at the Mamilla cemetery , which lies in the shadow of Jerusalem ’s Old City walls , close to Jaffa Gate .
After the judgment , Jerusalem ’s mufti , Sheikh Mohammed Hussein , called the museum ’s building " an act of aggression " against the Muslim public .
The furor from both religious and secular Palestinians has apparently bemused most Israeli observers .
Rabbi Marvin
Hier , initiator of the project , dismissed objections last week as cover for " a land grab by Islamic fundamentalists , who are in cooperation with Hamas . "
His view that Muslim concerns are really an attack on the Jewish state ’s sovereignty is shared by many .
Such sentiments have confirmed to most Palestinians the degree to which Israeli authorities make decisions while oblivious of Palestinian religious and national rights .
Although Muslim leaders angrily warned from the outset that the Museum of Tolerance would require the disinterring of graves , they were ignored until spring 2006 , when it was reported that dozens of skeletons had been unearthed during the early excavations .
The local media also revealed at the time that state archaeologists had been secretly trying to move the skeletons without alerting the local Muslim authorities , as they should have done , and that many of the skeletons had been damaged in the process .
When several months of arbitration between the developers and Muslim leaders proved fruitless , the courts stepped in .
Ostensibly , the driving force behind the museum , which is to cost $ 250 million , is the Simon Wiesenthal Center , a private Los Angeles - based Jewish human rights organization .
But the venture is being pushed through with equal vigor by Israeli officials from the government , Jerusalem municipality and Lands Administration .
For many years it has been their priority to obscure all indications of the Muslim presence in the western part of Jerusalem  as well as in many areas of Israel  that predate the Jewish state ’s founding in 1948 .
The treatment of the Mamilla cemetery , which is said to include the burial sites of the Prophet Mohammed ’s companions , stands in stark contrast to another ancient cemetery , nearby on the Mount of Olives .
Since East Jerusalem was illegally occupied by Israel in the 1967 war , the Jewish cemetery on the Mount has been carefully renovated and expanded as a " heritage site . "
In contrast , the Mamilla cemetery , which lies just inside West Jerusalem and was captured by the Israeli army in the 1948 war , was immediately removed from Muslim control .
Classified as refugee property , it was passed on to a new Israeli official called the custodian of absentee property .
This was far from an isolated incident .
Before the creation of Israel , as much as one - tenth of all territory in the Holy Land was managed as part of an Islamic endowment known as the waqf , bequeathed by Muslims for religious and charitable purposes .
After 1948 , however , Israel seized all waqf property  in addition to private land belonging to refugees  and transferred it to the custodian .
Under pressure from the government in the 1950s , the custodian passed most of the undeveloped land , particularly farmland , on to a state - run body known as the Development Authority , which was charged with using it for the " public interest . "
That usually meant using the profit from the land for the benefit of the Jewish public .
Other waqf property  mostly land on which holy places , including mosques and cemeteries , were located  was managed by special Islamic trusts established by the state .
This has provided the main defense adopted today by Israeli officials in justifying the siting of the museum .
They say that an Islamic trust deconsecrated the Mamilla cemetery in 1964 , thereby freeing up the land for development .
What they fail to point out , however , is that the Islamic trusts have no legitimacy among Palestinian Muslims in Israel , nearly one - fifth of the country ’s total population , let alone among Palestinians in the occupied territories .
The Islamic officials on the trusts are widely seen as corrupt , appointed by the state because of their willingness to do the government ’s bidding rather than because of their public standing or Islamic credentials .
They earned that reputation by rubber - stamping many land transactions of waqf property desired by the state .
One of the most notorious occurred in the early 1960s when Muslim officials approved the sale of the large Abdul Nabi cemetery in today ’s Tel Aviv for the building of a hotel and several Jewish housing developments .
This abuse of waqf land has provoked a simmering resentment among Israel ’s Palestinian minority .
Last year Palestinians in the historic city of Jaffa , now little more than a suburb of Tel Aviv , tried to challenge the role of the Islamic trusts by petitioning the courts to turn control of waqf property over to genuine representatives of the Muslim public .
The government , however , refused to divulge what waqf property existed in Jaffa , claiming " the requested information would seriously harm Israel ’s foreign relations . "
This was presumed to refer to the damage that might be done to Israel ’s image abroad should it be revealed to what uses the waqf property had been put .
Actual holy places have fared little better , with most now inaccessible even to Israel ’s Palestinian citizens .
Some , such as the 900 - year - old Hittin mosque built by Saladin in the Galilee region , have been fenced off and left to crumble .
Others are used by rural Jewish communities as animal sheds .
And yet more have been converted into discos , bars or nightclubs , including the Dahir al Umar mosque  now the Dona Rosa restaurant  in the former Palestinian village of Ayn Hawd .
Similar dubious practices occurred with the Mamilla cemetery .
From the 1950s , during a period of military government that imposed severe restrictions on all Palestinians living inside Israel , the graves and tombs belonging to Jerusalem ’s most notable families began to decay .
Part of the land was turned into a car park .
After the 1967 war , as Meron Benvenisti , a former deputy mayor of Jerusalem , has noted , the Muslim authorities lobbied to be allowed to rehabilitate and maintain the graves , but were refused permission .
Instead , in 1992 the custodian transferred the site to the Jerusalem municipality , which used the land to establish an Independence Park , named for Israel ’s victory in the 1948 war .
Then a few years later the municipality transferred a parcel of the land to the Wiesenthal Center for its Museum of Tolerance .
As Mr. Benvenisti points out , over the years many Islamic sites in Jerusalem have been " turned into garbage dumps , parking lots , roads and construction sites . "
What makes the latest fight over the Mamilla cemetery different is that in the past decade a new breed of Muslim leader has emerged in Israel to overshadow the Islamic trusts .
In particular the struggle over the fate of the holy places has been taken up by the leader of the Islamic Movement inside Israel , Sheikh Raed Salah .
Last week he warned : " We will mobilize in the Arab and Muslim world so that it puts pressure to halt the project . "
Tolerance , after all , has its limits .

WASHINGTON  Siemens , the German engineering giant , agreed Monday to pay a record total of $ 1.6 billion to American and European authorities to settle charges that it routinely used bribes and slush funds to secure huge public works contracts around the world .
The company also pleaded guilty in federal court in Washington to charges that it violated a 1977 law banning the use of corrupt practices in foreign business dealings .
The fines that the company agreed to pay on the American side of the case  $ 450 million to the Justice Department and $ 350 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission  dwarf the previous high for a foreign corruption case brought by Washington .
That mark of $ 33 million was set last year in the case of Baker Hughes , an oil conglomerate that paid a total of $ 44 million over foreign bribery charges .
Officials said that Siemens , beginning in the mid-1990s , used bribes and kickbacks to foreign officials to secure government contracts for projects like a national identity card project in Argentina , mass transit work in Venezuela , a nationwide cellphone network in Bangladesh and a United Nations oil - for - food program in Iraq under Saddam Hussein .
Tomorrow is Election Day :
The campaign is over , and it is time to cast your ballot at last .
What could possibly go wrong ?
Plenty .
A poll worker may say you are n't registered .
Your voting machine could malfunction .
Your meddling neighbor could say you are n't eligible to vote .
Or maybe you are offered a provisional ballot -- and what is the difference between regular ballots , provisional ballots and emergency ballots , anyway ?

Methadone can Treat , Reverse Cocaine Addiction , Prof Finds
Methadone , typically used to treat heroin addiction , may also be effective in treating cocaine addiction , according to a new University of Guelph study .
Psychology professor Francesco Leri is the first to reveal that methadone can reverse key cocaine - induced neurobiological changes in the brain known to play a key role in addictive behaviours .
When rats were exposed to cocaine and then given methadone , they not only stopped exhibiting cocaine - seeking behaviour , but their brains also appeared to return to the way they were before taking the drug .
" This shows that methadone is capable of suppressing cocaine - seeking behaviour and cocaine - induced neural adaptation when administered after cocaine exposure . "
The study , published in European Neuropsychopharmacology , first examined the impact methadone had on the behaviour of rats that were previously exposed to cocaine .
To measure the rats ' cocaine - seeking behaviour , Leri trained the animals to associate a flashing light and the sound of a buzzer with an injection of cocaine .
They were then placed in a chamber with a lever that , when pressed , reproduced the buzzer sound and flashing light .
Rats that were n’t given methadone before being placed in the chamber constantly pressed the lever , indicating cocaine - seeking behaviour , said Leri .
Rats that received methadone showed no interest in the lever .
" This is important because the rats were exposed to the cocaine first and then given the methadone , " he said .
" This is a situation that has clinical relevance because it mimics what happens in humans .
You first become an addict and then you get treatment . "
Leri then studied the brains of the rats to see what impact the methadone had on the regions normally affected by cocaine .
" When someone is exposed to cocaine , the drug causes molecular changes in certain regions of the brain that are associated with drug - seeking behaviour and compulsive drug intake .
What 's interesting is that , among the rats given cocaine and then methadone , these regions of the brain looked similar to how they appeared in the rats that were never exposed to cocaine . "
These findings support the use of methadone in treating cocaine addiction and confirm that this form of treatment is an " extremely useful pharmacological tool , " he said .
" The next step is to look into medications that act like methadone but do n't have the same side effects as potential treatments . "
The following email came in from my friend Wendy , very early Tuesday morning : “ At 6:22 , I am standing in a block long line on w. 65th .
In 33 years I have never stood behind more than ten people for a prez election ”
Keep in mind that we ’re talking about New York City , where the election result was never in doubt .
At about the same time , at our neighborhood polling place , my wife found a more than hour - long line winding around the block , and my son , on his way to work , had a similar traffic - jam experience .
For a friend downtown , it was two - and - a - half hours .
Again , this was n’t contested Ohio , it was New York City .
So do n’t think I was n’t excited  even thrilled , even filled with hope  when , at 11:30 that morning I hit my polling place and still found a sizeable , if swiftly moving , line of voters of every age , size , and color , and in the sunniest of moods .
Normally , on voting day , I just waltz in .
But it was a pleasure to wait and imagine .
Even then I knew , as Jonathan Freedland wrote recently of Tom Friedman ’s new book , that the plural of “ anecdote ” is not “ data . ”
But believe me , that did n’t stop me from thinking about what the turnout might be like in states where it mattered , or what that might mean .
And it did n’t stop me from remembering another moment , more than four years earlier .
It was the summer of 2004 and I was walking the floor of a packed Democratic Convention in Boston , interviewing dutiful delegates .
They were intent on nominating John Kerry as the Party ’s candidate because they were convinced he was the man who could “ win . ”
Despite no less dutiful cheering as speakers rattled on , there was a low hum of conversation , a sense of distraction in the air  until , that is , a politician I had never heard of , a young man from Illinois named Barack Obama , was introduced as the keynote speaker .
All I can say is that I ’ve never been in a crowd so electrified .
It was visceral , as if the auditorium itself had suddenly come alive .
I felt it as a pure shot of energy coursing through my body .
Like others in that vast arena , I simply did n’t know what hit me .
When it was over  and it took a long time for that surging din to ebb  when I could finally shout into a cell phone , I called my daughter , who , by an odd coincidence , was in the nosebleed section of the same arena with a camera crew .
What I said to her ( and then repeated to a friend in another call soon after ) was : “ I know this is going to sound ridiculous but I think I just heard a future president of the United States . ”
( And then , in my report from the convention , I actually wrote it down : “ He was a knock - out .
Call me starry - eyed , or simply punchy as a day inside the Fleet Center ended , but there ’s always something about genuine enthusiasts that just does get to you .
I thought to myself when Obama was finished and the place was truly rocking , maybe , just maybe , I listened to a speech by a future president of the United States . ” )
Soon after , a friend commented that people had said the same thing of Julian Bond back in the 1960s .
And I promptly forgot all about it until my daughter reminded me of it this spring .
Last night , that electric moment came to mind again  as a journey of unbelievable improbability reached its provisional , slightly miraculous endpoint .
And , while the results poured in , I had another visit from the past .
I remembered a day in 1950 .
I was six and my mother had taken me to one of those magnificent old movie palaces then still on Broadway in New York City to see a cowboy flick .
At its climax , with the hero and villain locked in primordial struggle on a mountainside , the bad guy went over the cliff .
As it happened , my father had mentioned this dramatic plot development the previous evening and so , as the villain dropped into the void , I yelled out into that darkened theater in sheer delight at being in the know , “ My Dad told me it was going to happen this way ! ”
It ’s one of those typical kid stories  embarrassing and yet with a certain charm  that families tend to hang onto .
And 58 years later , it came to mind as Barack Obama and the Democrats were storming through the electoral landscape .
With various friends gathered at my house for a party meant to wipe out the misery and memory of a similar party four years earlier , I had the same primordial if irrational urge to shout out : “ My friend Steve told me it was going to happen this way ! ”
I ’m talking about Steve Fraser , my partner at our book publishing enterprise , the American Empire Project .
Back in February 2007 at TomDispatch , he explored the possibility that this would be a “ turning - point election , ” and not so long after became convinced that it would be .
Maybe it was that 2004 electoral “ hangover , ” but I could n’t convince myself of the same and so , increasingly , obsessionally , began checking out daily polling information on the campaign and trolling the Internet for endless commentary on the same .
When I ’d call Steve to discuss the odds of a turning - point election actually happening , though , he would have none of it .
Such a result was , for him , a given , and he had better things to do .
He never wavered .
Addicted
I ca n’t claim the same .
These last few months , I developed the Internet equivalent of a series of physical tics .
The Daily Kos poll at 7:30 ; Rasmussen at 9:30 ; Gallup after 1 ; those repeated visits to Nate Silver ’s superb FiveThirtyEight.com , to TPM Election Central , to RealClearPolitics.com , and , of course , to Pollster.com to stare , and then stare again , at the prospective electoral map , to run the cursor over state polling averages that often changed not a whit from week to week .
If this was n’t addiction , what was ?
And so this morning , I woke up to a unique headline in my hometown paper  just OBAMA in inch - high letters  to genuine relief , but also to a kind of weird emptiness .
It was over and it was , I realized , several things at once , including , of course , the Bush era , which should have ended in 2004 ( or never begun ) , and which has been the nightmare of my adult life .
Of course , you need to add in , as well , the end of a nearly thirty - year cycle of triumphant Republicanism ( with that sorry Clintonista interlude ) that left the country flat on its proverbial back .
It was also Barack Obama ’s remarkable victory , the turning - point election of all time  at least in the sense of ending what Frederick Douglas , Sojourner Truth , and Abraham Lincoln began , what could not have happened without a great and brave movement in the 1950s and 1960s that demanded of America what its founding documents , its most basic ideology , insisted should already be so .
A black president of the United States .
A black first lady .
In my younger days , no one could have convinced me this would happen in my lifetime .
A massive movement of millions of young people on the ground , committed to , not alienated from , a future government  yes , that , too , was something we had n’t seen in quite a while , except perhaps on the evangelical right .
Today , it ’s clear enough that Obama ’s electoral juggernaut has swept a landscape already devastated and devalued by the Bush administration  and that ’s no small thing .
But there was another it as well , one that ’s harder to put a name to , another kind of juggernaut that managed to make its way under my skin and into my life  into the lives , I suspect , of so many Americans over the last two years , and that I hold responsible both for those tics and that emptiness .
It ’s what left me asking this morning :
What hit me ?
What in the world was that ?
And , really , what was it ?
We persist in calling it an “ election , ” or an “ electoral campaign . ”
But you could catch something of what else it was in the journalistic bravado , combined with awe ( or , perhaps , if such a word existed , I mean “ self - awe ” ) , as the TV news people made their Monday - night pitches for election eve viewers .
They spoke with a kind of pride of “ the longest campaign in U.S. history , ” “ the most exciting presidential election in our lifetime , ” “ the most closely followed election campaign in recent years , “ the most expensive election in , ” and so on , while my hometown paper front - paged it Monday as : “ A Sea Change for Politics as We Know It . ”
A sea change .
A tsunami of entertainment , or was it distraction ?
An eternal election campaign .
Two years of the most everything  the most money , the most small contributors , the most large contributors , the most ads , the most polls , the most lobbyists , the most extensive ground game , the most places ( Internet , email , YouTube , Facebook , bloggers , text messaging , cell phones ) , the most jokes , the most appearances by candidates on late - night talk shows or TV satirical programs involving themselves , and , of course , the most talking ( or babbling ) heads and media pundits , always predicting , assessing , sizing - up , telling us what the candidates “ must ” do , and do , and do , 24/ 7 .
Whole programs , whole cable stations , whole news cycles , whole websites devoted to nothing but the constant discussion of well , what ?
More spinners , bloviators , and pundits than previously existed on the face of the Earth .
The most , the most but only , naturally , until the next time when , you can be sure  as Howard Dean ’s Internet fundraising experiment was to Barack Obama ’s  the most of 2008 will prove but a baseline for future mosts .
So let me just ask again :
What was that ?
What just happened ?
I do n’t mean Barack Obama entering the Oval Office on January 20 , 2009 .
I mean to me .
I mean to us .
I mean , what were all those talking heads on MSNBC , and CNN , and FOX doing ?
What were those bizarre feedback loops and YouTube videos of “ events ” you ’ve already long forgotten ?
What were the gazillion ads and the gazillion discussions of them , and really , what were all those polls , hundreds and hundreds of polls , more polls than humanity has probably ever seen ?
What were they all about ?
Whatever it was , it was supersized , a Big Maclection .
It glued eyes to TV sets and the Internet , and , above all else , it  what we kept insistently calling an “ election ”  was bloated beyond belief .
Like , say , the Pentagon .
It was , in short , imperial .
And it never ended .
In fact , we had n’t made it anywhere near November 4 , 2008 before you could feel the next round , the next “ election , ” revving up .
2012 was already on the drawing board .
Would it be Sara Palin v. Hillary Clinton ?
Was Mitt Romney still in the race ?
Would the Republicans roar back , or would they be a rump white party in the wilderness of the deep South and deep
West for a generation to come ?
Think of it as the eternal election .
Millions of people devoted themselves to this election .
Knocked on doors .
Made phone calls .
And yet it  the thing I ’m talking about  was the very opposite of individual .
The vote last night was surely a crude and belated American judgment on the misrule of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney , on the economic catastrophe they had such a hand in bringing down on us , and even on the Iraq War and the President ’s woebegone Global War on Terror , but despite the commitment of millions , this was not simply an election , not in the old - fashioned sense anyway .
Even though perhaps 130 million people ended up in voting booths , following about a trillion “ serial elections ” that we call “ opinion polls , ” it was n’t primarily for or about us .
It was for and about them .
It was , above all , an event for , and geared to , the media itself , which fed it , stoked it , and lived off it .
All those tics of mine were surely secondary symptoms of a process they controlled ( but undoubtedly understood little better than we do ) .
To me , there ’s something distinctly human , and small scale , about an election .
A single individual casts a single vote .
That vote theoretically matters .
It helps determine your fate .
You are , to use our President ’s phrase , “ the decider . ”
And yes , Americans did finally decide something last night .
Yet , when I look at these last two bizarre years of “ campaigning , ” nobody can convince me that we were , in any but the vaguest sense , the deciders in this election , or that , underneath what was indeed human and thrilling , there was n’t something deeper , larger , colder , quite monstrous , and still growing .
The Elecular of 2012
Sometimes , reality simply outruns the words meant to describe it .
Historically , when a new Chinese dynasty came to power , the emperor performed a ceremony called “ the rectification of names ”  on the theory that the previous dynasty had fallen , in part , because reality and the names for it had gone so out of whack , because words no longer described the world they were meant for .
After the Bush years , we desperately need such a rectification .
And perhaps we need a new word  maybe a whole new vocabulary  as well for the “ election season ” that never ends , that seems now something like a grim , eternal American Idol contest .
Just to start the discussion , I offer a modest one , “ elecular , ” a combination of “ election ” and “ spectacular , ” or maybe “ electacle . ”
Or using “ campaign , ” “ camptacular ” or “ spectaculaign . ”
None of which catches the darker side of this strange , overwhelming gauntlet through which “ democracy ” must pass .
Do I understand this ?
No .
Like the rest of us , like the very talking heads on FOX News or CNN or Charlie Rose , or well , you name it I ’m immersed in what Todd Gitlin once termed “ the torrent , ” which is our televisual civilization , of which this last campaign was such a part .
I ca n’t help but think , despite the quality of the man who somehow ended up atop our world , that this was indeed an imperial election , far too supersized for any real democracy .
Yes , Americans crudely expressed the displeasure of a people who had had enough , and thank heavens for that , but our will ?
The People ’s Will .
I doubt greatly that the People ’s Will is going to make it to Washington with Barack Obama .
On this small , noisy , endangered planet of ours with its almost 7 billion high - end omnivores  that ’s us , in case you did n’t know  something historically quite out of the ordinary and wonderful just happened , and something historically quite out of the ordinary and disturbing happened as well .
One man changed history .
One juggernaut ran over us all .
It ’s worth keeping in mind that Barack Obama is but a man .
One man , living these last years like the rest of us at the heart of a juggernaut  and I do n’t mean his campaign  that none of us really understands .
In the meantime , if things get worse , there ’s always the elecular of 2012 to look forward to .

CLARIFICATION 5:55 p.m. –
The story below references a Dell ad placed in UptownLife magazine .
The online version of that ad , which has since been removed , appeared to include both an image from Dell and text .
A Dell spokesman , Bob Kaufman , said that Dell was only confirming the “ Adamo by Dell ” image and not the text , which is quoted in this post .
Brett Wright , the co-founder of Uptown Media , the parent company of Uptownlife.net , has declined to comment on the Dell ad or why the text was removed .
All the speculation about Dell ’s coming Adamo computer appears somewhat comical once you learn that the company ’s confirmation of the product has been sitting in plain sight .
Last week , I spotted what looked like a blog post from the luxury magazine UptownLife , discussing a future laptop from Dell possibly thinner than Apple ’s MacBook Air .
“ Rumor has it that Dell is coming out with a computer called Adamo that will rival the MacBook Air , ” the blog post read .
“ At press time , the company was keeping the product tightly under wraps , but PC users rejoice – word on the street is that something cool is coming your way . ”
After my Bits post about Adamo appeared , UptownLife pulled its post down , and Dell refused to discuss the exact nature of the product with reporters .
This left most publications guessing about Adamo , saying it could be anything from a thin laptop to perhaps another netbook or a music player .
But it struck me as curious that UptownLife would remove its post – that is , unless the post was actually a Dell advertisement in disguise .
On Tuesday , the Dell spokesman , Mr. Kaufman , confirmed that the Adamo blurb art was in fact a Dell ad .
So , it ’s Dell that has been talking about a product that will “ rival the MacBook Air ” all along .
The UptownLife Web site just made things tricky by lumping blog posts and ads together without making any distinction between the two .
( As the clarification notes , Dell is now only confirming the Adamo by Dell image and not the text discussing the rival to the MacBook Air . )
“ We did this to wake up the personal computing category and create some buzz , ” Mr. Kaufman said .
It ’s expected that Dell will reveal its super - thin laptop at the Consumer Electronics trade show next month in Las Vegas .
Then it will be up to Dell to live up to the buzz it has created .
World of Warcraft is only available on PCs ... need we say more ?
While Xbots and the Sony Defence Force argue among themselves , and Wii-mers ( Wii-ers ? ) throw ever more ridiculous shapes pretending to play the tambourine or something , there is another group of gamers who quietly , happily , enjoy the best gaming platform yet invented - the PC .
And while , granted , some huge percentage of PCs are never used for anything other than Outlook and basic web , PCs remain the most flexible and happiest way to game .
And , unlike Wii Sports , it wo n't cause you permanent physical damage .
1. Mouse and keyboard support
Well , duh .
Console kids who have grown up with a controller in hand might argue , but there 's still no better way of playing just about any game in any genre – not just shooters – than the combination of keyboard and mouse .
It just works , offering orders of magnitude more precision and speed than fiddly analogue sticks .
2 . High screen resolutions
While Microsoft and Sony scream about ' true HD ' in their games – but in many cases do n't actually deliver it – the PC has been happily running games at 1080 p and above for yonks .
In fact , the near - HD default res of 1,280x1,024 is very 2001 ; even a medium rig can handle 1,600x1,200 or more these days .
3. Free mods
Were you a raw naif , you might be forgiven for thinking that LittleBigPlanet et al single - handedly invented the idea of ( nnnggh ) ' user generated content ' .
But guess what ?
PC gamers have been coding mods ( modifications ) such as add - ons , total conversions , unofficial levels and all manner of other gubbins for … well , pretty much forever .
And then distributing it for free , for the sheer love of it .
4. Upgradeable hardware
With the aforementioned higher resolutions and textures , chances are a new PC game already looks better than its console counterpart right now .
But even if you can't run it with all the visuals tweaked to the max , processor and graphic cards prices drop so quickly that it 's hardly bank - breaking to refit your rig in a year or so , for better graphics and more speed .
5. Cheaper games
Sony , Microsoft and Nintendo's licensing and publishing costs inevitably drive up the cost of every single game released , and even pre-owned games tend to be far pricier than the PC equivalent .
6 . You 're not tied to one online service
Imagine not having to rely on a single , central server such as Xbox Live or PlayStation Network whenever you go online .
Imagine not having to suffer downtimes , silly licensing agreements , or daft console - restricting DRM .
Oh wait … that 's the PC online , is n't it ?
7 . No extra dosh needed for playing online
Okay , this only applies to Xbox Live , but who 's to say that Sony might not start charging for PSN as it keeps haemorrhaging money ?
And yes , Xboxers can use the free Silver service , but really – why would you ?
8. Unlimited storage space
The Xbox 360 is limited to whatever can fit on a DVD ( or , if you 're unlucky , more than one ) .
The PlayStation 3 has to struggle with turgid Blu-ray access and enforced installs .
PC games , meanwhile , just sit happily on the potentially unlimited storage space of your hard drive .
Easy .
9 . Save game hacking
Like modders , PC gamers are rabidly enthusiastic about pulling apart save games and data files , fiddling therein , and finding ingenious ways to cheat or fix corrupted files .
Try doing that with your Wii .
10 . Unofficial fixes for older games
PC games such as Vampire : The Masquerade often get unofficial , free , support long after publishers have gone kaput and official support is abandoned , thanks to the tireless efforts of their fans .
Bug fixes , enhancements , new hardware support – it 's all there .
11 . Abandonware
The geek term for ' old games which you can't buy any more ' .
There are a huge number of classic PC titles out there from years gone by , and many thousands are available to download , legally , for free .
12 . No red ring of death
Well , you only get this on the Xbox , of course , but the last thing you want your gaming machine to do is to completely konk out .
At least when a PC goes wrong , it really goes wrong .
Like , with fire and everything ( possibly ) .
Now read 5 graphics cards that will knock your socks off .
Company to Convert Former Nuclear Waste Site Into Green Datacenter
November 11th , 2008 by Andrew Williams
Web hosting company 1&1 has revealed plans to convert a former nuclear waste site into a huge datacenter , powered entirely by renewable energy .
The company , which manages a total of more than 10 million domain names , plans to squeeze 100,000 servers into the 10,000 sq metre facility in Hanau , Germany .
The story goes that the site , originally built to process waste from the nuclear industry , was never used for its intended purpose and has remained vacant ever since .
Now it ’ll be used to increase 1&1 ’s server count nearly 300 % and act as a leading example of how to turn a derelict space into an innovative example of green technology in action .

Madonna Wins Judgment Against Tabloid For Leaking Wedding Photos
Chalk up one forShe has successfully fought back again the British tabloid the Mail for publishing 11 photos taken at her wedding toon December 22 , 2000 .
The leaked photos were stolen from her Los Angeles home and ended up as front page news in October 2008 .
The Scottish nuptial event was photographed by Jean - Baptiste Mondino , who presented an album of wedding photographs to Madonna as a keepsake gift .
According to Madonna 's lawyer , Matthew Nicklin , Beverly Hills interior designer Robert Joseph Wilber " surreptitiously gained access to the photo album and copied at least 26 photos . "
On October 15 , 2008 , the photos were sold to the Mail by a woman who identified herself as Bonnie Robinson of Los Angeles .
She was reportedly paid $ 7,500 for the stolen pics .
The Mail published eleven of the photos over the front page and a double - page inside spread on Sunday October 19 .
Madonna 's lawyer , Nicklin says of the leaked pics , " she was ambushed " .
The lawsuit accused the tabloid of breaching her privacy and copyright by publishing photos of her 2000 wedding .
She is seeking $ 7.5 million .
Judge David Eady entered a judgment in her favor .
Compensation will be determined in January 2009 .
Ironically , the couple was granted a divorce decree on November 21 , to be final in January 2009 .
Under the circumstances , does Guy split the lawsuit award ?
We 're just asking ....

Michael ( Mike ) Louis Connell was President , Chief Political Strategist and CEO of New Media Communications , Inc. , a Republican website development and internet services firm based in Richfield , OH .
He died December 19 , 2008 when the small airplane he was piloting crashed upon approach at the Akron - Canton Airport .
[ 1 ]
He is survived by his wife , Heather and their four children .
New Media 's GOP clients are a " ' Who's Who ' of Republican politics " , having provided campaign web services and Internet strategy for Bush - Cheney 2000 / 2004 , as well as Dick Armey , Spencer Abraham for Senate 2000 , Heather Wilson for Congress 2000/2002/2004 , Rick Santorum for Senate 2000 / 2006 , and John Thune for Senate 2002 / 2004 to name just a few .
New Media also designed GOP.com for the Republican National Committee , RGA.org for the Republican Governors Association , and between two and three dozen state GOP sites .
In April 2001 , Connell spun - off GovTech Solutions from New Media to handle its growing list of federal government clients , such as MajorityWhip.gov for Tom DeLay and Johnny Isakson .
Business filings in the state of Ohio show that Govtech 's founding members were Connell 's wife Heather , and the well - known GOP operative and Chairman of the DCI Group , Thomas J. Synhorst .
By 2004 , Govtech 's clients would grow to include more than 20 members of the U.S. House of Representatives , GOP.gov , the web site of the House Republican Conference , and the House Intelligence , Judiciary , Financial Services , Way and Means , and Administration committees .
The latter was acquired while House Administration was chaired by former - U.S. Rep.
Bob Ney of Ohio , who was convicted in 2006 of conspiracy to defraud the United States .
Early life and career
Michael L. Connell was born on November 30 , 1963 near Peoria , IL .
While attending the University of Iowa in 1984 , Connell " caught the political bug " watching the Iowa Caucuses and in 1987 briefly worked as Finance Director for U.S. Rep.
Jim Leach's ( R - IL ) re-election campaign .
In 1988 , Connell joined George H.W. Bush 's presidential campaign in IA , where he developed and maintained a voter contact database .
Later that year he was promoted to Bush campaign headquarters in Washington , DC , tasked with designing a database software system for the Republican National Convention .
Soon after Bush was inaugurated in 1989 , Connell received a presidential appointment to the U.S. Department of Energy as a legislative affairs specialist .
In 1990 , Connell returned to the campaign trail as Director of Voter Programs for Sen. Dan Coats ( R- IN ) .
However , on November 9 , 1990 , Connell was fired by Sen .
Coats for providing scripts used in a push poll on behalf of another Republican candidate Mike Pence .
According to the Associated Press , Connell was fired after Matrixx Marketing of Ogden , Utah called thousands of voters two days before the election .
Those who indicated their support for Pence 's opponent , Phil Sharp ( D - IN ) , were read Connell 's scripts that attacked Sharp on several issues .
Pence lost anyway ; and Connell lost both his job with Coats for what the senator called " clearly unethical " behavior , and a part - time position with the Indiana State Republican Committee .
Controversy over Ohio voting machine fraud
On September 22 , 2008 Connell was served with a subpeona in an Ohio legal case , King Lincoln Bronzeville Neighborhood Association v. Blackwell , in which plaintiffs alleged vote tampering occurred in the 2004 presidential election .
Connell had created a web site for the Ohio Secretary of State that presented the results of the 2004 Presidential election in real time , as the votes were being tabulated .
Ohio's Secretary of State , J. Kenneth Blackwell , at that time also served as chair of the Bush - Cheney reelection effort in Ohio .
The legal case was filed on Aug. 31 , 2006 by Clifford Arnebeck , and other Columbus , Ohio attorneys who charged Blackwell with racially discriminatory practices which included selective purging of voters from the election rolls and the unequal allocation of voting machines to various districts . [ 2 ]
The lawsuit asked that measures be taken to prevent similar problems from occurring during the subsequent election in November , 2006 .
On Oct. 9 , 2006 , the complaint was amended to add charges of various forms of ballot - rigging .
At that time , Connell refused to testify to produce documents relating to the 2004 or 2006 elections , and his lawyers served a motion to quash his subpeona . [ 3 ] [ 4 ]
Connell , a long - time GOP operative , had provided web services for George W. Bush and Dick Cheney 's 2004 reelection campaign , and had also had provided IT services to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , the Republican National Committee and many Republican candidates , in addition to creating Ohio ’s official , real - time state election website .
On election night of 2006 , ePluribus Media researchers reported evidence of the discovery that Ohio 's election web site , election.sos.state.oh.us , had been hosted during the 2004 Presidential election , on servers of a company called SmarTech located in Chattanooga , Tennessee . [ 5 ]
They cited Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell 's payment of hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars to Mike Connell 's companies for creation of the election returns server system and presented evidence taken in real - time that the November 7 , 2006 election was similarly diverted . [ 6 ]
The Smartech system serviced scores of RNC hosts in 2006 and the researchers subsequently listed them among hundreds including domains involved in the White House email controversy in which Connell 's companies have been implicated . [ 7 ]
RawStory recently reported similar findings . [ 8 ]
On September 17 , 2008 , a Republican election whistleblower and data security expert named Stephen Spoonamore filed a sworn affidavit filed in federal court in the above voter fraud case in which he stated that Mike Connell " agrees that the electronic voting systems in the US are not secure " and that Connell had told Spoonamore in 2007 " that he ( Connell ) is afraid some of the more ruthless partisans of the GOP may have exploited systems he in part worked on for this purpose . "
Spoonamore further explained that " Mr. Connell builds front end applications , user interfaces and web sites . "
Spoonamore said , " I believe however he knows who is doing that [ election rigging ] work , and has likely turned a blind eye to this activity .
Mr. Connell is a devout Catholic .
He has admitted to me that in his zeal to ' save the unborn ' he may have helped others who have compromised elections .
He was clearly uncomfortable when I asked directly about Ohio 2004 . " [ 9 ]
In July 2008 , the lead attorney in the King Lincoln Bronzeville Neighborhood Association v. Blackwell case , Cliff Arnebeck , sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey seeking protection for Connell as a witness in the case , saying he had been threatened .
Arnebeck wrote ,
“ We have been confidentially informed by a source we believe to be credible that Karl Rove has threatened Michael Connell , a principal witness we have identified in our King Lincoln case in federal court in Columbus , Ohio , that if he does not agree to " take the fall " for election fraud in Ohio , his wife Heather will be prosecuted for supposed lobby law violations .

Certain people just carry with them a layer of crust , the accumulated grime of take - out food , unwashed laundry , and skin that has been exfoliated at inopportune times .
This is not to say such people are dirty .
They are not ( necessarily ) .
They are n’t ( always ) like the Peanuts character Pigpen , surrounded by an aura of filth .
Instead , this kind of crust is an invisible but tangible derma , a second skin protecting the clean , pink underskin from the world ’s brutalities .
Perhaps certain people are just too sensitive to interact with the world in such a direct and raw way .
Perhaps these people simply need an additional , protective layer of crust to keep them safe , the same way a hermit crab cannot survive without its shell .
Nobody says that hermit crabs are gross ; so why do we say this about David ?
Hate , that ’s why .
David Wain and his family came home with me last night after our super - secret warm - up Stella show at Brooklyn ’s Union Hall .
It was great to see them all and their little boy is adorable , despite the fact that he looks exactly like David Wain .
Some would undoubtedly say that David is adorable , and there are times when he certainly is , but adorable is n’t the first word I think of when I think of my dear friend David .
The first word I think of is crusty .
Last night when we arrived David helped himself to several slices of leftover pizza that we had been saving for a special occasion .
But he did n’t know that , and so while it certainly would have been polite for him to say something like , “ Can I eat this pizza ” before doing so , there ’s no way that he could have known that those humble slices represented the entirety of our Thanksgiving dinner .
That ’s okay - we still have a few cans of garbanzo beans and tuna and I ’m sure we can do something really special with them .
Meanwhile David ’s movie , “ Role Models ” continues to do very well , which he reminded us every fifteen minutes or so .
For example , when I asked him if he wanted to go for a hike this afternoon , he answered by saying that “ Role Models ” was number three last week .
After I said that had nothing to do with whether or not he wanted to go for a hike , he responded by saying he knew that but pretty soon it was going to be impossible to go for hikes like this because the success of “ Role Models ” would make being out in public pretty much impossible .
“ Now I know how Barack feels , ” he said .
We did n’t go on the hike .
I took them to the train this evening , after a fantastic home - cooked meal prepared by my wife .
For those of you who think that I ’m a sexist for not helping , think again : I did help .
I made the rice and the green beans , just enough so that when dinner was over I could claim that I had cooked and therefore did not have to do the dishes and clean the kitchen .
I left that to my houseguests .
There is a school of thought that says you should n’t allow your guests to clean your kitchen and do your dishes and fold your laundry and sweep out your garage .
I am not of this school .
To me , one of the fun parts about visiting a foreign country , for example , is seeing how the natives live .
I like to take this approach to houseguests .
When people come to my estate I expect them to “ pitch in . ”
David was up on the roof cleaning out my gutters , his common - law wife was put to work polishing the brass .
I even put his little guy to work licking stray dog fur up off the floor .
I budgeted just enough time to get them to the train .
Which would have been great except that my clocks are apparently two minutes slow because we arrived at the train station just as the train was pulling out of the station .
It was really cold outside , so I suggested warming ourselves up in a nearby coffee shop while we waited for the next train to arrive .
They said they did n’t want to put me out , which I thought was very considerate .
So I dumped their shit out on the street .
As I drove away , I noticed the passenger seat of my car , and indeed the entire vehicle was covered in a very fine , very thin layer of crust .
AMERICANS , it is safe to say , are furious about AIG .
Simply livid .
They are sick of the neverending bail - out that no one can seem to explain , and they are really sick of hearing about AIG junkets and million dollar bonuses .
If the average yank could choose between delivering a swift kick to Osama bin Laden and an AIG executive , the decision , for the moment at least , would be a tough one .
And when Americans get mad , their elected officials get to act righteously indignant .
All of which has made possible this Bloomberg description of one of the most amusing oversight hearings ever :
Kashkari , who oversees the Treasury 's $ 700 billion financial rescue plan , came under fire at a congressional hearing today , notably by Maryland Democrat Elijah Cummings .
Cummings was angry about reports American International Group Inc. , which got an expanded $ 150 billion government bailout this week , is setting aside $ 503 million in compensation for executives .
" I 'm just wondering how you feel about an AIG giving $ 503 million worth of bonuses on the one hand , and accepting $ 154 billion from hard - working taxpayers , " Cummings asked Kashkari .
" What really bothers me is all these other people who are lining up .
They say , well , is Kashkari a chump ? "
Kashkari , who was selected by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson as interim head of the Troubled Asset Relief Program , told the panel that he was " outraged " when he first read the reports .
Then he learned AIG has set aside the money to eliminate an incentive to leave the insurer , he said .
" I 'm not defending it , " he said .
Cummings went further , saying Kashkari 's decisions will determine whether consumers will have a happy holiday .
" Every decision that you make you think about those folks who are losing their jobs and who are in pain and who are not going to have a decent Christmas , " Cummings said .
" They 're going to probably be sitting under the Christmas tree with no presents . "
Have you no decency , Mr Kashkari ?
This Congress will not rest until you have located Christmas and agreed to return it to the American people .

This Essay examines what the Harry Potter series ... tells us about government and bureaucracy .
There are two short answers .
The first is that Rowling presents a government ... that is 100 % bureaucracy .
There is no discernable executive or legislative branch , and no elections .
There is a modified judicial function , but it appears to be completely dominated by the bureaucracy , and certainly does not serve as an independent check on governmental excess .
Second , government is controlled by and for the benefit of the self - interested bureaucrat .
The most cold - blooded public choice theorist could not present a bleaker portrait of a government captured by special interests and motivated solely by a desire to increase bureaucratic power and influence .
Consider this partial list of government activities : a ) torturing children for lying ; b ) utilizing a prison designed and staffed specifically to suck all life and hope out of the inmates ; c ) placing citizens in that prison without a hearing ; d ) allows the death penalty without a trial ; e ) allowing the powerful , rich or famous to control policy and practice ; f ) selective prosecution ( the powerful go unpunished and the unpopular face trumped - up charges ) ; g ) conducting criminal trials without independent defense counsel ; h ) using truth serum to force confessions ; i ) maintaining constant surveillance over all citizens ; j ) allowing no elections whatsoever and no democratic lawmaking process ; k ) controlling the press .
[ my emphasis -- Ken ]
This partial list of activities brings home just how bleak Rowling 's portrait of government is .
The critique is even more devastating because the governmental actors and actions in the book look and feel so authentic and familiar ...
The Ministry itself is made up of various sub-ministries with goofy names ... enforcing silly sounding regulations ...
These descriptions of government jibe with our own sarcastic views of bureaucracy and bureaucrats : bureaucrats tend to be amusing characters that propagate and enforce laws of limited utility with unwieldy names .
When you combine the light - hearted satire with the above list of government activities , however , Rowling 's critique of government becomes substantially darker and more powerful .
Furthermore , Rowling eliminates many of the progressive defenses of bureaucracy .
The most obvious omission is the elimination of the democratic defense .
The first line of attack against public choice theory is always that bureaucrats must answer to elected officials , who must in turn answer to the voters .
Rowling eliminates this defense by presenting a wholly unelected government .
A second line of defense is the public - minded bureaucrat .
...
Rowling parries this defense by her presentation of successful bureaucrats ( who clearly fit the public choice model ) and unsuccessful bureaucrats .
... In Rowling 's world governmental virtue is disrespected and punished .
Lastly , Rowling even eliminates the free press as a check on government power .
... I end the piece with some speculation about how Rowling came to her bleak vision of government , and the greater societal effects it might have .
Speculating about the effects of Rowling 's portrait of government is obviously dangerous , but it seems likely that we will see a continuing uptick in distrust of government and libertarianism as the Harry Potter generation reaches adulthood .
Ken Gregg asks ,
Is J.K. Rowling a libertarian ?
Benjamin Barton has a wonderful essay , " Harry Potter and the Half - Crazed Bureaucracy " ( in Harry Potter and the Law ( Jeffrey E. Thomas , ed. , Carolina Press , 2006 ) on J.K. Rowling 's " Harry Potter " books ( tip of the hat to Volokh ) .
The Rowling series certainly has captured the imagination of an entire generation , as few works have before .
Rowling does not venture into fundamental principles as , for example , Ayn Rand had done in her fiction , but it is well worth considering the politics ( or anti-politics ) of the framework of Rowling 's novels .
For the complete essay , click here for html and here for .pdf .
The abstract for Barton 's paper states : There has been a increasing number of posts by libertarians ( see Patri Friedman , Brian Doss , Daniel D'Amico , and Natalie Solent , among others , for example ) on the anti-state / Harry Potter / J.K .
Rowling connection , and with good reason , as Benjamin 's paper makes clear .
Arguably America ’s oldest bar , the White Horse Tavern in Newport , Rhode Island .
Or perhaps it ’s the Old ’ 76 House in Tappan , New York , which was built in 1668 .
The following are also contenders , but for one reason or another it is n’t clear if they were originally bars .
They ’re old , but they were n’t necessarily bars from their beginning or at a remote enough date in the past to make the list above .
Another list claims that The Pirate ’s House in Savannah , Georgia is the oldest , despite there being over a dozen with earlier dates .
And more troubling , the front page of their website says “ [ s ] ince 1753 , The Pirate ’s House has been welcoming visitors to Savannah with a bounty of delicious food and drink and rousing good times , ” but under their page on history , it becomes clear that it was n’t always a bar or even a restaurant , negating their claim of “ welcoming visitors ” with drinks since 1753 .
The “ American Museum Society … lists this historic tavern as a house museum .
The property was acquired by the Savannah Gas Company in 1948 and the buildings soon fell under the magic of Mrs. Hansell Hillyer , wife of the president of the company , who with great imagination , and skill transformed the fascinating museum into its present use as a restaurant . ”
After detailing the earlier history of the area , they remark that “ [ t ] hese very same buildings have recently been converted into one of America ’s most unique restaurants . ”
Also , the Green Dragon in Boston , MA opened in 1654 so presumably might be considered the oldest .
In 1764 , the St. Andrews Lodge of Freemasons bought the tavern .
Unfortunately , the original location on Union Street was demolished in 1854 .
Its present location at 11 Marshall Street was built at a later date , but I can’t find out exactly when .
It ’s certainly old , but probably not more than 100 years , if that .
There appear to be quite a few others that are old - looking bars or taverns that have been built recently to resemble what they looked like when they originally existed .
In many cases , they use the date of the original as their founding date , despite not being the same building or even located at the same spot .
It did n’t seem fair to include those in the main list , but because they ’re still interesting places , as I find more of them , I ’ll add them to this separate list :
Green Dragon Tavern ; Boston , MA ( 1654 ) [ Original building demolished in 1854 ; re-built later at its current , and different , location . ]
Raleigh Tavern ; Williamsburg , VA ( 1717 ) [ Destroyed by fire , 1859 ; re-built in 1932 . ]
Dan’l Webster Inn ; Sandwich , MA ( 1746 ) [ Destroyed by fire , 1971 ; re-built shortly thereafter . ]
City Tavern ; Philadelphia , PA ( 1753 ) [ Partially destroyed by fire , 1834 ; torn down in 1854 ; re-built in 1976 for the Bi-Centennial . ]
The Pirates ’ House ; Savannah , GA ( 1753 ) [ May have been a tavern originally , but appears to have been a house museum for a number of years , before being re-opened again as a tavern . ]
Old Tavern Farm ; Greenfield , MA ( 1760 ) [ Building built in 1740 , upgraded for tavern use in 1760 , but in 1858 was converted to a private residence , before being re-opened as a tavern again in 1998 . ]
Dobbin House Tavern ; Gettysburg , PA ( 1776 ) [ Built as a house in 1776 , was a gift center with a diorama in the mid-20th century ( I think I visited it when I was a kid ) , before being opened as a tavern more recently , possibly around 1996 . ]
Napoleon House ; New Orleans , LA ( 1797 ) [ Originally a residence , it appears to have been converted to a bar no earlier than 1914 . ]
The Flagon and Trencher
An alert reader sent me some information about The Flagon and Trencher , an organization for “ Descendants of Colonial Tavern Keepers . ”
The bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles has announced that church leaders can bless the unions of same - sex couples as a matter of policy .
The Rt. Rev. J. Jon Bruno , whose diocese encompasses Los Angeles County and five other Southern California counties , made the announcement Friday during a diocesan convention in Riverside .
Bruno acted just days after hundreds of conservative Episcopal congregations in North America formed a breakaway church amid a rift that began with the ordination of a gay bishop in New Hampshire five years ago .
Bruno ’s declaration is not expected to have a major effect on Episcopal churches in Southern California .
Many have been blessing gay unions for years .
But he has now made it official .

“ The practice has not changed .
The policy has .
. . .
It ’s sort of like ‘ coming out , ’ ” said the Rev. Susan Russell , a lesbian priest at All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena .
Russell also is president of Integrity USA , a group representing the gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender community in the Episcopal Church .
The rite endorsed by Bruno also allows the blessing of other relationships , such as those between two senior citizens who do not wish to legally marry because they might lose health insurance or Social Security benefits .
Church officials also noted that , unlike communion , the rite is not mandatory .
Clergy may choose not to perform it .
Diocese representatives also passed a resolution at their convention calling on the Episcopal Church to let gays and lesbians become bishops .

The L.A. diocese is expected to elect two suffragan , or assisting , bishops in 2010 , and some say it is possible a gay or lesbian bishop could be nominated from among qualified candidates around the world .

BRITAIN ’S highest court has criticised Islamic law for discriminating against women following a case in which a mother was forced to flee to the UK from the Middle East to protect her son from his abusive father .
The woman , known as EM , came to the UK in 2004 with her son when he was eight .
She has had sole custody of him since his birth because of her ex-husband ’s violence .
She left Lebanon because its laws automatically award fathers custody of children from the age of seven .
In a 5 - 0 ruling , according to the Independent , the law lords said that there was no place in sharia for the equal treatment of the sexes .
It would be a “ flagrant breach ” of the European Convention on Human Rights for the Government to send the woman back to Lebanon , where she would lose custody of her son because of sharia law .
Lord Hope of Craighead said that the right to non-discrimination was a core principle in the protection of human rights .
Sharia law as it is applied in Lebanon was created by and for men in a male - dominated society …
There is no place in it for equal rights .
Sharia was the product of a much - observed religious and cultural tradition :
But by our standards the system is arbitrary because the law permits of no exceptions to its application …
It is discriminatory too because it denies women custody of their children after they have reached the age of custodial transfer simply because they are women .
Wednesday ’s decision reversed rulings by the Court of Appeal , the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal and the Home Secretary that returning EM to Lebanon with her son would not violate her right to family life .
The human rights groups Liberty and Justice intervened in the case .
Liberty ’s legal director , James Welch , said :
How can the Government speak of equal treatment in one breath and seek to deport mother and child to face separation … in another ?
The law lords have rightly upheld basic protections which must be available to us all .
EM had obtained , in the Islamic Court in Lebanon , a divorce from her husband , who reportedly ended her first pregnancy by hitting her in the stomach with a heavy vase .
She had been awarded physical custody of her son until his seventh birthday .

Demonstrators call for government to resign in wake of financial collapse
Paul Joseph Watson

Tuesday , November 25 , 2008
Riots and protests in Reykjavik calling for the government of Iceland to resign have increased following a financial catastrophe that has wiped out half of the krona ’s value and put one third of the population at risk of losing their homes and life savings .
Could similar scenes of civil unrest be repeated in the United States as the economy continues to implode ?
“ It was the latest in a series of protests in the capital since October ’s banking collapse crippled the island ’s economy .
At least five people were injured and Hordur Torfason , a well - known singer in Iceland and the main organiser of the protests , said the protests would continue until the government stepped down , ” reports the Scotsman .
As crowds gathered in the drizzle before the Althing , the Icelandic parliament , on Saturday , Mr Torfason said : “ They do n’t have our trust and they are no longer legitimate . ”
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Hundreds more gathered in front of a local police station , pelting eggs at the windows , using a bettering ram to force the doors open and demanding the release of a protester .
A banner hung from a government building read “ Iceland for Sale : $ 2,100,000,000 , ” the amount of the loan the country will receive from the IMF .
Gudrun Jonsdottir , a 36 - year - old office worker , said : “ I ’ve just had enough of this whole thing .
I do n’t trust the government , I do n’t trust the banks , I do n’t trust the political parties , and I do n’t trust the IMF .
“ We had a good country and they ruined it . ”
These are n’t the actions of unwieldy mobs in third world countries , we ’re talking about a country that had one of the highest living standards in Europe and a relatively wealthy and sedate population , the vast majority of whom are now in revolt over mass redundancies and the fast disappearing values of their paychecks and savings .
More peaceful protests against the Federal Reserve during the End the Fed events over the weekend were largely ignored by the U.S. corporate media , but the potential for wider chaos exists should the dollar finally cave in to the hyperinflationary bubble that is being created by the ceaseless printing of money to fund the multi-trillion dollar bailout .
Those who continue to assert , “ It ca n’t happen here , ” only need to look at the scenes in Reykjavik to realize that similar events could unfold across the U.S. , where the reaction of militarized riot cops and even the military itself may be a little more heavy handed to say the least .
With top Russian analysts predicting the breakup of the U.S. into different parts , allied with people like deadly accurate trends forecaster Gerald Celente warning of food riots and tax rebellions , the scenes in Reykjavik may be amplified in the U.S. should a significant portion of the public wake up to the monumental fraud of the bailout and begin to feel the impact of its consequences as we enter 2009 .

Researchers from the National Institutes of Health and the Scripps Research Institute have found novel prion infectivity in white and brown fat tissues of mice .
Prion diseases , also known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies , are infectious progressive fatal neurodegenerative diseases which affect humans as well as wild and domestic animals .
Distribution of prion infectivity in organs and tissues is important in understanding prion disease pathogenesis and designing strategies to prevent prion infection in animals and humans .
Previous studies in animals including sheep , goats , cattle , deer , mink , hamsters and mice , have found prion infectivity mostly in nervous system tissues such as the brain and spinal cord .
The tissues studied here in a mouse model demonstrate a proof of principle that white and brown fat tissues are sites of prion agent deposition and therefore may play a previously unrecognized role in prion infectivity and transmission of prion disease .
The authors state clearly that it will be important to extend their studies to prion - infected large animals , such as cattle , sheep , deer , and elk where they may be potential sources of contamination of human and domestic animal food chains .
Results of the current and future studies may merit additional consideration of steps to eliminate from the food chain any fat from ruminants suspected of exposure to or infection with prions .
All three countries have announced economic stimulus packages recently
The leaders of three of Asia 's biggest economies have vowed to work more closely together to reduce the damage caused by the global financial crisis .
Japan and China 's prime ministers and the South Korean president - meeting in Japan - agreed to boost trade and greatly increase currency swaps .
China 's Wen Jiabao called the summit , the first of its kind , a " milestone " .
He said such co-operation would " have real significance " as the crisis impacted on economies around the world .
The North Asian nations , former enemies , have held talks on the sidelines of international meetings , but this is their first independent trilateral summit .
" It is quite a milestone to hold a stand - alone China - Japan - South Korea summit , " Mr Wen said as he opened talks with Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso and South Korean President Lee Myung - bak in the southern city of Fukuoka .
Swap facilities
The BBC's Duncan Bartlett in Tokyo says China , Japan and South Korea are closely intertwined economically and their leaders regard co-operation with their neighbours as a vital means of lifting the East Asian region out of its current financial malaise .
In a joint statement , the leaders said that Asia was " expected to play a role as the centre of world economic growth in order to reverse the downward trend of the world economy " .
By taking appropriate measures without any delay , we can minimise the impact
Taro Aso
Japanese Prime Minister
The countries said they planned to increase the amount of money swapped between them through the Chiang Mai Initiative - a move which should benefit South Korea especially , as the won has lost a third of its value since the start of the year .
Our correspondent says the nations believe the swaps will prevent a repeat of the situation 11 years ago when sudden slides in currency values triggered a major financial crisis in Asia .
The three men also called for an urgent injection of capital into the Asian Development Bank .
Ahead of the talks , the South Korean central bank announced in a statement that it had increased its bilateral swap facility with the Bank of Japan to $ 20 bn ( £ 13bn ) , and a similar facility with the People 's Bank of China to $ 26bn .
Japan is also trying to put aside its past differences with China , partly because it was trade between them that helped pull Japan out of its last prolonged recession during the 1990s , our correspondent says .
The South Korean won has lost a third of its value since the start of the year
All three countries - which account for 75 % of the region 's economy and two - thirds of its trade - have announced major individual economic stimulus packages in recent months .
On Friday , the Japanese government increased by 23 trillion yen ( $ 255 bn ) its stimulus plan , more than half of which will be used to bring stability to the financial markets .
It follows a 27 trillion - yen package in October .
" This is a great global recession which comes once in a hundred years , " Mr Aso said .
" But by taking appropriate measures without any delay , we can minimise the impact . "
Earlier this week , China revealed that its exports had fallen for the first time in seven years .
However , it still reported a record monthly trade surplus .
Beijing launched a four trillion yuan ( $ 586 bn ) stimulus plan last month , and on Wednesday pledged to boost public spending and cut taxes .
South Korea , the hardest hit by the financial crisis , meanwhile offered $ 130bn of guarantees on foreign - currency borrowing and liquidity to its banks .
At a separate meeting on Saturday , the South Korean and Japanese leaders condemned North Korea for showing an " unco-operative attitude " in the latest round of six - party talks aimed at dismantling its nuclear disarmament programme in Beijing this week .

Scientists have found skeletons of a hobbit - like species of human that grew no larger than a three - year - old modern child .
The tiny humans , who had skulls about the size of grapefruits , lived with pygmy elephants and Komodo dragons on a remote island in Indonesia 18,000 years ago .
Australian and Indonesian researchers discovered bones of the miniature humans in a cave on Flores , an island east of Bali and midway between Asia and Australia .
Scientists have determined that the first skeleton they found belongs to a species of human completely new to science .
Named Homo floresiensis , after the island on which it was found , the tiny human has also been dubbed by dig workers as the " hobbit , " after the tiny creatures from the Lord of the Ringsbooks .
The original skeleton , a female , stood at just 1 meter ( 3.3 feet ) tall , weighed about 25 kilograms ( 55 pounds ) , and was around 30 years old at the time of her death 18,000 years ago .
The skeleton was found in the same sediment deposits on Flores that have also been found to contain stone tools and the bones of dwarf elephants , giant rodents , and Komodo dragons , lizards that can grow to 10 feet ( 3 meters ) and that still live today .
Homo floresienses has been described as one of the most spectacular discoveries in paleoanthropology in half a century — and the most extreme human ever discovered .
The species inhabited Flores as recently as 13,000 years ago , which means it would have lived at the same time as modern humans , scientists say .
" To find that as recently as perhaps 13,000 years ago , there was another upright , bipedal — although small - brained — creature walking the planet at the same time as modern humans is as exciting as it was unexpected , " said Peter Brown , a paleoanthropologist at the University of New England in New South Wales , Australia .
Brown is a co-author of the study describing the findings , which appears in the October 28 issue of the science journal Nature .
The National Geographic Society 's Committee for Research and Exploration has sponsored research related to the discovery .
The find will be covered in greater detail in a documentary airing early next year on the National Geographic Channel .
" It is totally unexpected , " said Chris Stringer , director of the Human Origins program at the Natural History Museum in London .
" To have early humans on the remote island of Flores is surprising enough .
That some are only about a meter tall with a chimp - size brain is even more remarkable .
That they were still there less than 20,000 years ago , and [ that ] modern humans must have met them , is astonishing . "
The researchers estimate that the tiny people lived on Flores from about 95,000 years ago until at least 13,000 years ago .
The scientists base their theory on charred bones and stone tools found on the island .
The blades , perforators , points , and other cutting and chopping utensils were apparently used to hunt big game .
In an accompanying Nature commentary , Marta Mirazón Lahr and Robert Foley , both with the Leverhulme Centre for Human Evolutionary Studies at the University of Cambridge , England , describe Homo floresiensis as changing our understanding of late human evolutionary geography , biology , and culture .
The discovery shows that the genus Homo is more varied and more flexible in its ability to adapt than previously thought .
( The genus Homoalso includes modern humans , Homo erectus , Homo habilis , and Neandertals — all of which are marked by relatively large braincases , erect posture , opposable thumbs , and the ability to make tools . )
" Homo floresiensis is an addition to the short list of other human species that lived at the same time as modern humans .
I think people will be surprised to learn that not so long ago , we were not alone , " said Brown .
Lost World of Tiny People
Despite its smaller body size , smaller brain , and mixture of primitive and advanced anatomical features , the new species falls firmly within the genus Homo .
The researchers speculate that the hobbit and her peers evolved from a normal - size , island - hopping Homo erectus population that reached Flores around 840,000 years ago .
" Physically , they were about the size of a three - year old Homo sapiens [ modern human ] child , but with a braincase only one - third as large , " said Richard Roberts , a geochronologist at the University of Wollongong , Australia , and one on the co-authors of the research paper .
" They had slightly longer arms than us .
More conspicuously , they had hard , thicker eyebrow ridges than us , a sharply sloping forehead , and no chin . "
" While they do n't look like modern humans , some of their behaviors were surprisingly human , " said Brown , the study co-author .
The Flores people used fire in hearths for cooking and hunted stegodon , a primitive dwarf elephant found on the island .
Although small , the stegodon still weighed about 1,000 kilograms ( 2,200 pounds ) , and would pose a significant challenge to a hunter the size of a three - year - old modern human child .
Hunting must have required joint communication and planning , the researchers say .
Almost all of the stegodon bones associated with the human artifacts are of juveniles , suggesting the tiny humans selectively hunted the smallest stegodons .
The Flores humans ' diets also included fish , frogs , snakes , tortoises , birds , and rodents .
" The hobbit was nobody 's fool , " Roberts said .
" They survived alongside us [ Homo sapiens ] for at least 30,000 years , and we 're not known for being very amiable eco-companions .
And the hobbits were managing some extraordinary things — manufacturing sophisticated stone tools , hunting pygmy elephants , and crossing at least two water barriers to reach Flores from mainland Asia — with a brain only one - third the size of ours .
" Given that Homo floresiensis is the smallest human species ever discovered , they out - punch every known human intellectually , pound for pound . "
Both the tiny humans and the dwarfed elephants appear to have become extinct at about the same time as the result of a major volcanic eruption .
Mingling of the Human Tribes
There is no evidence of modern humans reaching Flores before 11,000 years ago , so it is unknown whether the hobbit intermingled with modern humans .
The researchers found hobbit and pygmy stegodon remains only below a 12,000 - year - old volcanic ash layer .
Modern human remains were found only above the layer .
Still , rumors , myths , and legends of tiny creatures have swirled around the isolated island for centuries .
It 's certainly possible that they interacted with modern humans , according to the researchers .
" Looked at from a regional perspective , we definitely have modern humans in Australia from at least 40,000 years ago , and in Borneo from at least 43,000 years ago , " Roberts said .
" So there was temporal overlap between the hobbits and ourselves from at least 40,000 years ago until at least 18,000 years ago — more than 20,000 years minimum .
What was the nature of their interaction ?
We have absolutely no idea .
We need more sites and more hard evidence , and that 's the next phase of our investigation . "
Island Dwarfing
Researchers are also anxious to investigate how and why the hobbits came to be so small .
When scientists discovered the hobbit remains , they thought it was the skeleton of a child .
There was no record of human adults that were that small .
Modern pygmies are considerably taller at about 1.4 to 1.5 meters ( 4.6 to nearly 5 feet ) tall .
" H. floresiensis presents an intriguing problem in evolutionary biology , " Brown said .
The most likely explanation is that , over thousands of years , the species became smaller because environmental conditions favored smaller body size .
Dwarfing of mammals on islands is a well - known process and seen worldwide .
Islands frequently provide a limited food supply , few predators , and few species competing for the same environmental niche .
Survival would depend on minimizing daily energy requirements .
But there is no absolute proof that this is what in fact happened with this small human .
" While there are stone tools dated as far back as 840,000 years ago , no fossils of large - bodied ancestors have ever been found " on Flores , Brown said .
" There is some possibility [ Homo floresiensis ] arrived on the island small - bodied . "
" I was the first to get up and the last to go bed , " he said .
" Normally I woke up very early , about 5 am , cleaned the house , washed the dishes , and then washed clothes and ironed them .
I worked all day , I was so tired . "
Sen . Bob Corker is ... well , a real corker .
The Tennessee Republican is on the Senate banking committee that 's overseeing the bailout of America 's Big Three automakers , and , by gollies , he got his dander up when the three CEOs told the committee last week that they needed a $ 34 billion loan to survive .
No way , popped the corker , unless and until you cut jobs and slash the pay of your union workers .
" Before we even contemplate making a loan to these companies , " corker lectured , " we need to put in place specific and rigorous measures . "
Wow , what a tough guy !
But why pounce on Detroit , when he and his colleagues so meekly gave up $ 700 billion of our money to Wall Street hucksters ?
OK , the numbskull auto bosses goobered by flying to Washington in their separate - but - equal corporate jets , failing to grasp the " optics " ( corporate - speak for bad image ) of pampered CEOs jetting in for a taxpayer handout .
But , wait — the honchos of Citigroup , AIG , et al. have also been jetting in and out of Washington for their gimmies , yet Corker and Co. raised no hue and cry , nor did they impose any " rigorous measures " as a condition of Wall Streeters getting taxpayer cash .
Indeed , the total bailout of the financial barons — counting loans , stock purchases , guarantees and backdoor handouts by the Treasury and Federal Reserve — is nearly $ 8 trillion .
Yes , that 's 8 followed by 12 zeroes !
Amazingly , though , the beneficiaries of this phenomenal taxpayer largesse do not have to provide any public benefit in exchange , and Congress is n't even being told where most of the money has gone .
We do know , however , that one banking giant — Citigroup — has been given about $ 300 billion of our money , roughly 10 times what all three of Detroit 's automakers are seeking .
Interestingly , the CEO of Citigroup is drawing at least $ 216 million in personal pay this year .
Corker and his ilk , however , saw no need to demand that Citi's CEO take a whack in his pay .
What we have here is a class divide — a chasm , really .
Right - wing pundits , echoed by such Congress critters as Corker , see the auto industry 's financial crunch as a golden opportunity for union - busting .
They 're pounding the United Auto Workers , asserting that the good wages and benefits earned by UAW members are an anvil around the neck of U.S. carmakers , preventing them from competing with , say , non-union Japanese auto companies .
But , wait — labor costs are hardly the drag they 're portrayed to be , totaling less than 10 percent of a car 's price tag .
If the highly skilled union members worked for free , that would n't begin to save the corporations .
Detroit 's problem is not on the factory floor , but up in the executive suite , where inept , $ 10,000 - an - hour CEOs can't come up with cars that the public wants to buy .
UAW members do n't design the cars — they build what the geniuses upstairs put on the assembly line .
How bizarre that Corker thinks autoworkers make too much money and wants the government to knock down their pay .
The senator is paid about three times what a UAW member earns , and he does n't have to have any real skill , do any heavy lifting or produce a product .
Yes , autoworkers make a good living — but is n't that what we want for the people of our country ?
They define America 's middle - class ideal .
They can afford to buy homes ( and cars ) , send kids to college , take vacations — and pay taxes to cover Corker 's Senate salary .
Sustaining and expanding such a vibrant , productive middle class ought to be the goal of public policy .
Yet the corkers of Congress are doing the exact opposite , pursuing a cheap - labor America that enriches the few at the expense of our nation 's true economic strength .
They are doing the bidding of the corporate elite , whose only industrial idea for the past 30 years has been to kick labor in the shorts .
All who support such ugliness and mindless destructiveness should be given Henry Ford bobbleheads and reminded of the auto pioneer 's wisdom :
Good wages are the lifeblood of the industry — and of our economy .

Author and Happy Cog founder Jeffrey Zeldman answers the question : what does a web designer need most ?
Skills and knowledge of software , of course , but empathy — the ability to think about and empathize with your user — is by far the most important .
Good useful education is hard to find , and within companies there is often no departmental standardization .
Good graphic design is not the same as good user experience design , he explains .
In fact , “ good web design is invisible ” — it feels simple and authentic because it ’s about the character of the content , not the character of the designer .
Jeffrey Zeldman was one of the first designers , bloggers and independent publishers on the web , and is one of the first web design teachers .
In 1998 , he co-founded — and from 1999 to 2002 , directed — The Web Standards Project , a grassroots coalition that helped bring standards to our browsers .
He publishes A List Apart “ for people who make websites . ”
Zeldman has written two books , including the foundational web standards text , Designing with Web Standards ( second edition ) .
He co-founded the web design conference “ An Event Apart ” and founded Happy Cog , an agency of web design and user experience specialists .
Was this what adulthood promised ?
“ It ’s a Wonderful Life ” is a terrifying , asphyxiating story about growing up and relinquishing your dreams , of seeing your father driven to the grave before his time , of living among bitter , small - minded people .
It is a story of being trapped , of compromising , of watching others move ahead and away , of becoming so filled with rage that you verbally abuse your children , their teacher and your oppressively perfect wife .
It is also a nightmare account of an endless home renovation .
I have n’t seen it on a movie screen since that first time , but on Friday it begins its annual pre-Christmas run at the IFC Cinema in Greenwich Village .
I plan to take my 9 - year - old son and my father , who has never seen it the whole way through because he thinks it ’s too corny .
How wrong he is .
I ’m no movie critic , and I ’ll leave to others any erudite evaluation of the film as cinematic art , but to examine it closely is to experience “ It ’s a Wonderful Life ” on several different levels .
Many are pulling the movie out of the archives lately because of its prescience on the perils of trusting bankers .
I ’ve found , after repeated viewings , that the film turns upside down and inside out , and some glaring  and often funny  flaws become apparent .
These flaws have somehow deepened my affection for it over the years .

Researchers use silk to create green optical technologies with potential applications ranging from bacteria detection to new solar cells
By Taylor McNeil
When Fiorenzo Omenetto ran into a colleague in the hallway of the Science and Technology Center in the summer of 2006 , he could n't have known that his research life was about to take off in an entirely new direction .
And if you 'd told Omenetto - an applied physicist by training and a self - described " femtosecond laser jock " - that it all would revolve around silk , he 'd probably have laughed it off .

But that 's what happened when David Kaplan , a biomedical engineering professor , casually asked Omenetto , a newly hired associate professor in the same department , for help with a project he was working on .
Kaplan wanted to know if a laser could make very tiny , precise cuts in a small piece of silk - based material he was molding for use as a replacement cornea .
Omenetto's first response on seeing the silk material - it looks like a thin film of transparent plastic - was , " Is this really silk ? "
It 's a response that Kaplan is used to .
People associate silk with ties and fancy clothing , and this was something of a completely different order .
But soon Omenetto was thinking that with the help of finely tuned lasers , and taking advantage of traditional molding techniques , patterns as tiny as a few tens of nanometers wide could be etched on the silk material .
The implication hit him immediately : this could be used for optics .
That 's because visible light has wavelengths of between 400 to 700 nanometers , and with the silk able to maintain patterns at such small scales , it was an ideal medium for manipulating light .
Now Kaplan and Omenetto are thinking up all sorts of possibilities for the silk optics , from an ability to quickly detect harmful bacteria in food to new types of solar cells .
Because silk is all natural and processed with water at room temperatures , the potential products would be clean and green - even implantable in the body or edible , if it came to that .
Butterflies and Nano - trees
Kaplan has been using silk in his research for some 20 years , engineering a range of human tissues , including ligaments , bone , cartilage and vascular systems .
The silk , harvested from the cocoon of the mulberry silkworm , is one of the strongest fibers in the world .
To make the silk into optic material , the scientists take regular silk thread , boil it down to purify the protein in it and pour it in a mold .
" We wait for it to crystallize and dry , and we peel it off and use that , " Omenetto says .

How would an application work ?
Omenetto points to an iridescent blue butterfly mounted behind clear plastic on his office wall .
Some butterfly wings , he says , do n't have pigment to reflect the colors in light , unlike , for instance , a shirt that 's dyed with chemicals .
Instead , the butterfly has " a forest of nano - trees , which captures white light , filters and selects it and reflects the blue color , " solely because of the structure , he says .
It 's called structural color .
" So you can imagine if you flood the forest , you change the color of the wing , " Omenetto says .
He swivels his chair to face his computer monitor , and pulls up a short video .
It shows a few drops of acetone being dripped on a blue butterfly specimen .
As the liquid spreads , the color of the wings changes quickly to green .
By flooding the forest of nano - trees , the environment around the trees has changed , and with it , the color we see .
But soon a hand appears , fanning the wing , quickly evaporating the acetone , and presto , the wing changes back to its original blue color .
Using this idea , one theoretical application for the silk optics would be to determine if food products have been tainted by bacteria .
A silk optic material would detect the presence of the bacteria , and change colors if it were present .
And because it is made of silk , it would n't matter if the sensor was accidentally consumed along with the food product , say in a bag of store - bought spinach .
The source of it all : a mulberry silkworm cocoon .
The silk optic material would be patterned as a series of nanoscale peaks and troughs , with something that would react to the bacteria inserted into each trough .
If the bacteria were present , the troughs would fill - and like a butterfly wing when its structure is altered - change colors , signaling the presence of bacteria .
" The optical properties change depending on the biological activity of what is inside the optical material , " Omenetto notes .
Silk optics have other potential uses .
Components like enzymes or proteins could be mixed in with the liquid silk solution and used as biological markers for , say , oxygen or pH levels .
When a component is added to the silk as it is drying , the silk locks the component into its structure , and within the hardened element , the enzyme or protein retains its function , says Omenetto .
" The avenues of activation of the optics are the astounding thing . "
As an example , Omenetto pulls out a sheet of the silk film , with splotches of red blood sealed inside .
" This is starting to brown a little , but you can see there 's quite a bit of red , " he says , meaning that the blood is still fresh , all the more amazing considering it has been there for almost a year .
Something like this could be used as an oxygen sensor : if oxygen is present , the human hemoglobin would change color .
" While we knew we could generate clear silk films , " say Kaplan , " their quality with respect to optical sensors was very surprising . "
The researchers have applied for patents for the technology , but there is still much work to be done and many more potential applications of the technology to explore .
But one thing is certain : there 's no shortage of silk to play with .
" If you think of the amount of silk ties on the rack , " Omenetto says with a laugh , " I think we 're OK . "
Pirates held , ship saved , what next ?
Indian ship does n't know Text Size : | NEW DELHI : With no instructions from the Indian government , naval officers on board the ship INS Mysore are confused about what to do with the 23 pirates and their dhow apprehended in the Gulf of Aden while repulsing an attack on an Ethiopian merchant vessel .
" Since Saturday afternoon , the 12 Somali and 11 Yemeni pirates are in custody on board INS Mysore and they are being fed with rations meant for sailors , " Navy officials said here on Monday .
" We have not received any instructions yet from the defence ministry or the external affairs ministry on what needs to be done with the pirates , " they said
The piquant situation that INS Mysore finds itself in has been compounded as the Rules of Engagement issued to the warship before it set sail to Gulf of Aden on anti-piracy patrol duties is unclear on the course of action if it did seize a pirate vessel and sea brigands , officials said .
However , officials claimed that frantic efforts were in progress in both ministries to get a foreign port to accept the bandits for trial in their courts and were optimistic of finding a solution by Tuesday .
The only other option available to INS Mysore is to abandon its anti-piracy patrols and return to an Indian port to hand over the pirates to local authorities for trying them .
But that appears to be unacceptable to the Navy authorities as their action against the sea bandits was just gaining momentum .
Officials said under the United Nations Convention on Laws of the Seas ( UNCLOS ) , International Maritime Organisation resolutions and the Navy Act and Regulations , the warships were authorised to seize and apprehend the pirates .

RICHMOND , B.C. —
A couple walking their dogs along the banks of British Columbia ’s Fraser River made what appears to be the latest in a series of gruesome discoveries of a running shoe with a severed foot inside .
It ’s the seventh such find inside a shoe along the West Coast from Georgia Strait to the northwestern tip of Washington State since August 2007 .
RCMP Const .
Annie Linteau confirmed Wednesday that remains were inside a left - foot New Balance runner spotted the previous day , but said it would be some time before the B.C. Coroner ’s office could confirm if the remains are human .
Ken Johnson and his wife spotted the shoe while walking their dogs Tuesday along the Fraser River in the Vancouver suburb of Richmond .
“ I flipped it over and it looked suspicious to me , in terms of it seemed to have a sock and New Balance sort of stuck in our head , ” he said , recalling previous stories about feet found in running shoes on the B.C. shoreline .
“ My first reaction was this was a small size , maybe a woman ’s shoe , ” said Johnston , who fished the runner out of the river .
“ It ’s kind of blurry now , but my first reaction , my gut reaction , was it looks like a woman ’s shoe , a left shoe . ”
One right New Balance runner — the only one belonging to a woman — has been found since the first foot was located on Jedidiah Island in Georgia Strait on Aug. 20 , 2007 .
The right - foot New Balance runner was located May 22 , on Kirkland Island in the Fraser River , not far from the site of Tuesday ’s discovery .
RCMP said they will try to determine if the two New Balance shoes are linked .
Linteau said the challenge with such a discovery in the Fraser River is that the remains could have come from anywhere along the more than 1,300 - kilometre length of the river .
“ As far as northern B.C. , ” Linteau said .
“ So we are exploring the possibility that they could be missing fishermen , missing people that may have fallen into the water . ”
She said police are reluctant to say the latest discovery of remains are human without DNA confirmation because of two previous hoaxes .
“ We want to proceed cautiously until we know what exactly we are dealing with , ” Linteau said in a news release .
All the other feet were located at several sites around Georgia Strait between 2007 and Aug. 4 , 2008 .
That ’s also when human remains were found in a runner washed up on the U.S. San Juan Islands off the coast of Washington State .
Police have determined that two of the runners — found Feb. 8 on Valdez Island and June 16 off Richmond — are a match .
DNA testing linked one foot to a depressed man who disappeared in 2007 but the other remains have not been identified .
Officials believe none of the feet were cut off and that it appears all the remains were “ naturally disarticulated ” from their bodies .
That fits with expert theories that when a human body is submerged in the ocean , parts like arms , legs , hands , feet and the head usually separate naturally .
The discovery of dismembered feet , all in buoyant sneakers , has been headline - grabbing world news for the last year .
The sixth foot was discovered on a beach on Juan de Fuca Strait , about 50 kilometres west of Port Angeles .
Authorities in the United States have said the black , size - 11 shoe was an Everest brand .
The sock found inside the shoe was described as a Levi ’s brand tube sock .
Linteau said investigators are revisiting missing persons files and trying to get DNA profiles from family members .
Dr. John Butt , a forensic pathologist and former chief medical examiner in Alberta and Nova Scotia , said earlier this year that finding the feet in the same area is difficult to explain , although that ’s not the case with the condition of the feet .
Butt said a foot and leg will separate naturally , in water or in the ground , given enough time .
“ When tissue softens to the point that ligaments have no strength , the leg will detach from the foot , ” he said .
“ There is no other clothing applied to the body as tightly as a shoe , except maybe a belt .
A shoe is tight and stays on the foot and the shoe is buoyant . ”

UPDATE : Many questions of the " what the hell is that car ? " variety .
It is the Citicar , an early 70s electric produced in the USA .
A while back I spotted a couple at a local swap meet .
Here 's the kicker : just got an email from the great internet comic artist Chris Muir of " Day by Day " fame ( hat tip Mike Hendrix ) , informing me that his dad was its designer ( ! ) :
" It was waaaay back in 72 ' .
The specs said it had to fit sideways on a truckbed , hence its length .
Batteries were primitive back then , as well as drives , etc .
It was an aluminum roll cage @ ABS skin and did indeed meet crash specs .
Slow as hell , but was street legal , I drove it to high school . "
Ain't that a kick in the head ?

" I really miss it out there , " she said .

Earlier this week , her attorney argued that Mayfield had a right to privacy , even though the lava tube is on state land .
Defense attorney David Cain presented photos of the lava tube in the Ahiihi - Kinau Natural Area Reserve .
The cavelike dwelling had furnishings such as a table , bed with canopy and butane camping stove .
" Anywhere you live , you have some reasonable expectation of privacy , " he said .
But Circuit Judge Joel August ruled Monday that officers with the state Department of Land and Natural Resources did not need a search warrant before entering the lava tube on Dec. 10 .
The West has been awash in Japanese popular culture every since manga and anime began to take root with young people in the early 1990s .
Within a decade , the import of Japanese media has gone from a tiny niche market to a full - blown pop culture phenomenon .
Japanese comics are now available in translation at major bookstore chains , Hollywood is remaking Japanese films like mad ( such as , remade in 2004 based on the 1996 Japanese movie ) , and some networks are devoting their prime time slots to animation from the Far East .
The appeal of Japanese media has taken root in Western culture and has turned into a thriving import industry .
However , Western audiences often experience long - distance culture shock when faced with media created by the Japanese for the Japanese .
Despite efforts to tailor Japanese works for the American market , we are often confronted with cultural signals that are uniquely Japanese and have no direct equivalent Western culture .
This has lead to a lot of head - scratching on this side of the Pacific , and has given rise to the internet stereotype that the Japanese must be insane .
This incomprehensibility has kept some forms of Japanese pop culture from gaining traction with with mainstream Western audiences .
An exception is Japanese horror , which has done particularly well in the West .
Movies like The Ring ( 1998 ) and Juon ( 2003 ) have struck a chord with Western audiences , and have sparked a renewed interest in foreign movies and horror in general .
Japanese literature like Haruki Murakami’s
The Wind - Up Bird Chronicle is starting to gain a solid readership in the West ( though still only a very select group of authors are available in translation ) , and horrific video games of Japanese origin such as Silent Hill , Fatal Frame , and Resident Evil are consistently popular .
It seems that Japanese horror has successfully avoided the mire of culture clash and has made a significant impact on mainstream Western society .
So what is it about Japanese horror that we find so attractive ?
What has kept it comprehensible and accessible to mainstream Western audiences ?
What is with all the freaky women wearing white with their hair covering their face ?
In this article , I will attempt to explain how Japanese horror works within the context of Japanese culture and how this approach is differs from the type of horror that Americans are used to .
Laying the Groundwork
Before we get into how Japanese horror works and why we find it so affecting , I need to define a couple of example tales that I will refer to over and over again in this article .
I have selected these stories because I think that they represent a fairly wide spectrum of Japanese horror , not because they are particularly unique to Japan ; though I will eventually compare and contrast Western and Japanese horror , this initial treatment is designed to give you some idea of what the cultural landscape of Japan is like when it comes to scary stories .
Please note that I am trying to present a general overview of Japanese horror , and consequently this article is full of generalizations ; not all horror media from Japan will fit the characteristics that I describe , nor should you consider this article the definitive work on Japanese horror .
The stories I have selected are as follows : The Ring ( 1998 film version ) , Toire No Hanako , Banchou Sarayashiki , and Yuki -Onna .
Note that the next few paragraphs contain major spoilers , especially for The Ring .
If you have n’t seen The Ring yet , do yourself a favor and go watch it right now .
If you are familiar with these stories , you can skip this part and jump right to the next section .
The Ring ( リング ) is a 1998 film that was directed by Hideo Nakata and based on a novel by Koji Suzuki .
The film was released in America under the terrible name Ringu because some marketing executive decided that the remake - starring - white - people took precedence over the Ring name .
In The Ring ( I am always referring to the original version , not the remake ) , a news reporter named Asakawa ( played by Nanako Matsushima ) stumbles upon the story of a cursed video tape while collecting information for an article on urban legends .
According to the rumor , a video tape exists that will kill the viewer seven days after it is watched .
The only escape from the curse is to make a copy of the tape and show it to someone else , who must then copy it and show it again to save themselves .
Asakawa tracks the tape down and watches it only to realize that the curse is real and that she has seven days to live .
She spends the rest of the film searching for the force behind the tape , a psychic girl named Sadako who was killed by her father and dumped in a well years ago .
As we see at the end of the film , Sadako climbs out of her well and through the TV of her next victim , manifesting her wrath in the physical realm from beyond the grave .
Toire No Hanakosan ( トイレの花子さん , “ Hanako - in - the - Toilet ” ) is another contemporary macabre tale .
The story behind Hanako - in - the - Toilet is this : if you knock three times on a particular stall in a particular school ’s girl ’s bathroom while calling Hanako ’s name , you will hear her reply from within the empty stall .
This story appeared in the early 1980s and enjoyed wide popularity among school children , spawning numerous books and a few films .
Different versions of the tale describe various reasons that Hanako ’s ghost sticks around ( in some versions she was murdered in the bathroom ; in others , she was a girl who committed suicide in one of the stalls ) , and her response differs widely as well .
But the main crux of the Hanako - in - the - Toilet tale is the bathroom stall mechanic : by knocking on a particular stall and calling Hanako in a particular way , you can get her to answer you .

Banchou Sarayashiki ( 番町皿屋敷 , “ The Story of Okiku ” ) is a classic Japanese ghost story about a maid named Okiku who is falsely accused of breaking a ceramic plate .
The dish is part of a collection of ten plates , and is extremely valuable to her employers , a samurai family .
Enraged by her mistake , the samurai kills Okiku and throws her in an old well .
Every night thereafter , Okiku ’s ghost rises from the well , counts to nine , and then breaks into sobs .
Eventually her presence is so maddening that the samurai goes insane .

Yuki-Onna ( 雪女 , “ The Snow Woman ” ) is another Japanese classic .
In this story , a young man and his mentor are caught in a terrible blizzard while collecting firewood in a forest .
They take refuge in a small hut and decide to stay there for the night .
In the middle of the night , the young man wakes up to find a strange woman dressed entirely in white standing over the older man , blowing her breath upon him .
The woman turns to the young man and tells him that she had intended to kill him along with his mentor , but because he is such a hansom lad she has decided to let him live .
However , she tells him never to speak of this event to anybody , or she will kill him .
The man is saved the following morning but tells nobody about his encounter with the snow woman .
The following year , the man meets and marries a beautiful girl .
They live happily and have several children .
Then one evening the man relates his encounter with the snow woman to his wife .
In a rage , his wife reveals that she is in - fact the snow woman he met , and were it not for their children she would kill him on the spot .
With that , she melts away into the wind .
Belief Systems
It would not be difficult to write an entire book about the cultural origins of Japanese ghosts , but for the purposes of this article I will try to keep this section short .
The two main religions of Japan are Buddhism and Shinto .
Buddhism was brought by Korean scholars to Japan from China around 500 AD , but Shinto is indigenous to the country .
Interestingly , most Japanese people today practice both Shinto and Buddhism depending on the circumstance ; for example , weddings are often Shinto , while funerals are typically Buddhist .
Neither religion requires strict membership , and for most people , religious rituals are performed because they are traditional , not because they imply some strong religious alignment .
Thanks to this religious flexibility , Japanese culture has a wealth of legends and beliefs to draw upon from two different religions .
Buddhism teaches that life is a facade and that the never - ending cycle of death and rebirth can only be avoided by convincing oneself of this deception .
Many Buddhist ghost stories are designed to reinforce that idea ( see Lafcadio Hearn ’s translation of Fragment [ 1 ] , in which a Buddhist monk climbs a mountain only to find that it is comprised entirely of the bones of his former lives ) .
Shinto , on the other hand , teaches that any dead person can be prayed to , and otherwise has very little to say about life after death [ 2 ] .
The Shinto creation myth [ 3 ] describes Yomi ( 黄泉 ) , the land of the dead , but with the introduction of Buddhism Yomi was adapted to fit the Buddhist concept of multiple hells .
In practice , Shinto teachings rarely deal with death directly , and only suggest that each person has a soul ( called a reikon ; 霊魂 ) that can become stuck among the living if the person dies while feeling burdened with excess emotion or is not given a proper funeral .
This concept of “ excess emotion ” is something we will come back to , as it provides the underpinnings for most contemporary Japanese horror .
The most important point here is that the Japanese typically do not align themselves rigidly to either Buddhism or Shinto , and the reconciliation of these two religions requires the society to accept that most of the universe is fundamentally beyond human understanding .
Thus there is a level of ambiguity among beliefs that gives horror a strong basis to operate upon .
But I am getting ahead of myself ; before we can compare Japanese horror with Western horror , we need to know a little bit more about what we are dealing with .
Rest assured that we will return to these points in a bit .
Classic Apparitions and Monsters
Otherworldly Japanese creatures can be broken down into two categories : youkai ( 妖怪 ) and yuurei ( 幽霊 ) [ 4 ] .
are weird beings that are as often bizarre as they are scary .
Typically physical ( as opposed to the more ethereal ) , are similar to Western monsters : they are animal - like and often dim- witted , and though they may be malicious they seldom maintain any long - term goals or plan .
This class of monsters includes goblins and ogres and the like , as well as neutral or benevolent creatures such as the (a shape - shifting prankster that looks like a large raccoon ) and ( a snake - like creature that is wide around the center and can jump long distances )
There are a great many types of , and they pop up all over the place in Japanese cartoons and comics [ 5 ] .
However , these creatures are generally not very scary , and they have yet to make much of an impact in the West outside of video games ( e.g. Mario ’s raccoon suit is in fact asuit ) and comics , where they are seldom depicted as fearsome creatures .
Yuurei , on the other hand , are the heart of Japanese horror .
Yuurei are ghosts or spirits that have been stranded on this world because they have some unfinished business or because they died while in the throes of intense emotion .
Unlike youkai , yuurei have a singular purpose or mission , and they are very often malicious .
A person who becomes a ghost is said to forget everything else about their life and focus only on that which is preventing them from resting .
There are scores of stories [ 6 ] ( like The Story of Okiku ) that depict ghosts who come back to haunt their murderers , or to express the anguish that lead to their suicide , or to reward those who fulfill their dying wish .
The underlying concept behind Japanese yuurei is onnen ( 怨念 ) , the idea that some emotions are so strong that their power can extend from beyond the grave .
Almost all classic and contemporary ghost stories from Japan operate on onnen : in addition to the obvious case of Okiku , witness Sadako ’s character in The Ring , the antagonist in Juon , or even the explanations given for Hanako ’s origin in the Hanako - in - the - Toilet story .
Onnen is the central concept behind yuurei , and as we will see , it differentiates Japanese horror from works in the West pretty dramatically .
The Japanese often portray yuurei as people dressed in white funeral garb with long dark hair .
Originally , yuurei were portrayed in art and theater as indistinguishable from regular people , but in the 18th century the style changed : since then , the legs of ghosts seem to fade into thin air [ 7 ] , and they are often shown to have their arms outstretched and hands limp .
For some reason , yuurei seem to very frequently female .
Perhaps this is because women are thought to hold grudges longer and more powerfully than men .
Japanese yuurei tend to haunt a specific person or place .
Since yuurei have an explicit reason for sticking around in the mortal plane , they do not often waste their time attacking people who have no relationship to them .
In The Story of Okiku , for example , Okiku ’s despair over her false accusation is so great that she is unable to rest , even though she was not at fault .
Though her appearance eventually causes her murderer to take his own life , her behavior as a ghost indicates that it was this mistake , not her murder , that brings her up the well every night .
We can thus assume that the death of her killer does not put her to rest ; she might instead be appeased if the plate were replaced , or if a set of ten plates were placed by her well , thus correcting a problem for which she has been blamed .
This example also reveals another interesting mechanic used in many Japanese ghost stories : the idea that the troubles of spirits can be solved using an effigy or proxy .
In Of a Mirror and a Bell ( see [ 6 ] ) , a woman kills herself after being publicly humiliated during the construction of a brass bell .
In her suicide note , she declares that any person who is able to break the bell by ringing it will be generously rewarded .
When the bell is lost , an enterprising farmer is able to conjure up the ghost of the deceased woman by destroying a model of the bell made of mud .
This mechanic reenforces the idea that Japanese spirits have a singular purpose in the human world , and that they need not always be malicious to achieve their goals .
Other Characteristics
There are a few other important characteristics of Japanese horror that we should cover before we move on .
I discussed the mutability of Japanese religious beliefs above , and suggested that reconciling Shinto and Buddhist beliefs has required the Japanese to accept a level of ambiguity when it comes to explaining the universe .
This leads us to our first major characteristic of Japanese horror :
The universe is governed by rules .
This is a central theme in Japanese horror ; we can almost always see some sort of logical progression based on some implied set of rules that govern the way all things work .
We have already talked about onnen and some of the rules associated with death , but this characteristic implies that there are rules for everything .
This often manifests as a sequence of events that must occur before terror can be revealed , such as the Hanako - in - the - Toilet summoning procedure .

The rules of the universe are beyond human understanding .
An equally central theme is that the rules and the reasoning behind them may not be something that people can grasp , and thus one must accept that which he cannot explain .
Why does Hanako require a certain stall of a certain bathroom at a certain school to be knocked upon a certain number of times ?
The answer can never be clear , but that does not stop the audience from believing the story .
Another example is the Yuki - Onna story , which suggests that the snow woman has no choice but to reveal herself after her husband betrays his secret ; it is as if the promise between them is all that binds her to the mortal plane .

Modern society offers no protection from spirits and ghosts .
Contemporary Japanese horror very often involves ghosts hijacking modern technology , even though the motives of most malicious spirits are not significantly different than they were a few hundred years ago .
Perhaps this reflects some anxiety about the amazing speed with which Japan reinvented itself and rose to economic power after World War II .
We can see this influence clearly in The Ring ( the video tape as a curse ) , Juon ( the characters are constantly confronted by appliances that are no longer trustworthy ) , and films like Tetsuo The Iron Man , where metal itself plagues the protagonist like a disease .

Perseverance in the face of utter destruction .
It is impossible to talk about modern Japanese culture without acknowledging the impact that the atomic bombs had on the Japanese psyche .
A world that has been utterly destroyed and yet must still sustain life is a constantly recurring theme in modern Japanese media : it is a direct theme in works like Godzilla , Akira , and Dragon Head , and it manifests on a much more subtle level in all sorts of other aspects of the culture ( consider , for example , Princess Mononoke ’s finale ) .

Damp Settings .
While Western tales of the macabre tend to take place in dry , musty locations such as mansions , basements , or cemeteries , the Japanese tend to associate spirits with water and humidity .
Perhaps this is because the Japanese summer months are characterized by intense humidity that persists even after nightfall .
The art and culture magazine Kateigaho pointed this characteristic out in an interview with Koji Suzuki , the author of The Ring novel series .
Dank , confined spaces , [ Suzuki ] believes , are the most conducive to the appearance of ghostly spirits . …
It is damp settings rather than dry ones that the Japanese associate with spirits .
In Western horror movies , the bathroom is a frequent backdrop to terror .
J - horror too makes audiences recoil by suggesting that a disembodied spirit is about to creep into a damp space , a space so damp it ’s hard to breathe . [ 8 ]
Kateigaho also notes the association of water in some of Suzuki ’s works , including Honogurai Mizu no Soko Kara ( Dark Water , 2002 ) and The Ring .
Throughout the remainder of this article I will return to several of these characteristics .
A few of them lie slightly outside the scope of this document , but I have included them because I think that they are relevant avenues of study to anybody interested in Japanese horror .
Modern Japanese Horror
Now that we have covered the cultural and historical background for scary Japanese stories , let us take a look at modern Japanese horror within this historical context .
With the exception of the above - mentioned influence of technology and the effects of the atomic bombs , Japanese ideas about ghosts and fear have not changed dramatically in the modern era .
The introduction of mass communication has certainly brought a great deal of Western influence to the Japanese , but the underpinnings of Japanese horror ( such as the concept of onnen ) run deep in the culture .
A good case study of classic Japanese horror concepts in a modern package is The Ring .
Though there is a wide selection of Japanese horror movies produced before and after The Ring , this film remains significant because it its intense popularity in Japan and abroad .
If we closely examine The Ring , we can see that it is in many ways a classic Japanese ghost story retold in modern context .
Sadako , the films antagonist , almost perfectly fits the description of classic Japanese ghosts : she wears white , her hair is long and hangs over her face , and she exerts her power in the mortal plane because she died a horrible death .
Though Sadako has feet , she ’s otherwise very similar to both Okiku and Yuki -Onna .
Like Okiku , her remains rest at the bottom of a well , and she must ascend out of the well before she can pursue her revenge .
Like Yuki-Onna , Sadako is malicious and destructive , but she is still bound to the rules of the universe .
If her victims do not watch her tape , or if they follow the correct procedure to free themselves from the curse , Sadako can have no power over them .
The protagonists in The Ring spend most of the movie trying to locate Sadako ’s body and put her to rest , but as we see at the end of the film , their efforts are trumped by the rules of the curse .
Though the film ’s core mechanic requires modern technology ( the video tape ) to operate , The Ring is very much a classic Japanese ghost story .
Sticking with this theme of traditional Japanese horror in a modern format , let us take a closer look at the Hanako - in - the - Toilet story .
On the surface , we can see that it also bears some similarities to The Story of Okiku : the toilet is not all that far removed from an old well , as both are places associated with water , darkness , and filth .
This story also adheres to the rules - of - the - universe characteristic , as an exact procedure is required to get Hanako to appear .
But what I think is much more interesting about this story is the accessibility of it , especially to school children .
As Hiroshi points out on his extremely informative site Gendai Kaidan [ 9 ] ( 現代奇談 , “ Modern Day Ghost Stories ” ) , the Hanako - in - the - Toilet story is almost perfectly designed to allow school children to test their mettle .
The elements required to reproduce the procedure described in the story ( i.e. a school with a girls bathroom ) are universally accessible , and the consequences of the story are non-threatening ( in the original version , correctly calling out to Hanako is supposed to only cause her to verbally respond–there was no implied danger ) .
Hiroshi suggests that the popularity of this story throughout the 1980s was fueled by its simple and easily - reproducible premise , as well as by persistent rumors of classmates who had performed the procedure and actually heard Hanako respond .
Bothand thestory tap into the idea that technology and modern society in general provides no protection from spirits .
In fact , andboth go a step further and suggest that technology may be exploited by malicious entities to wreak havoc on their victims .
This theme is extremely common in modern Japanese horror .
One interesting example is the rumor that was popular in the early 1990s during the pager boom .
According to rumor , it was possible to get a page from a phone number that could not possibly exist .
Even worse , this number ( 564219 ) sounds like the words “ I am coming to kill you ” when read phonetically ( ごろくしにいく , “ , ” is transformed into 殺しに行く , “ “ ) .
Another very recent example of this theme is the Flash animation Red Room [ 10 ] .
Red Room tells the story of mysterious internet popup ad that is rumored to exist .
If you surf the web long enough , the rumor explains , eventually you will get a strange popup ad with a nonsensical message accompanied by a weird voice .
The rumor holds that if this popup ad is ever closed , you will die .
Red Room is a nice example because it embodies so many classic Japanese horror characteristics : in addition to the use of technology by some sort of malicious , otherworldly force , the rules governing the popup ad are both ironclad and difficult to rationalize .
Modern Japanese horror is clearly influenced by the events of the 20th century ( especially the second World War , the rise of technology in every day life , and the influence of mass communication ) , but at its core it remains faithful to the characteristics that have defined Japanese macabre for several hundred years .
West of the Sun
Now that we ’ve covered the elements and history of Japanese horror , let us take a look at how the West compares .
Europe has a rich history of stories about ghosts and other monsters , and America has happily inherited much of that culture .
In his book Danse Macabre [ 11 ] , Stephen King identifies three archetypical stories that he believes have shaped modern American horror : Frankenstein , Dracula , and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde .
Indeed , the themes in these stories have become so ingrained in American culture that horror ( especially horror cinema ) has become defined by these clichés .
Some American horror clichés have become so accepted that we actually have special terms to describe them , such as final girl [ 12 ] .
It is perhaps our complacency with these themes that makes horror from other countries interesting ; after all , horror cannot be very effective if the viewer has a comfortable idea of the outcome from the get - go .
So let us take a look at how contemporary Japanese horror differs dramatically from American contemporary horror .
As an American , I have often been struck by the unconventional presentation of Japanese horror films and games .
Over the last thirty years American horror film has become increasingly action - oriented ; we are often treated to shoot outs , fights , and scenes of monsters mauling victims .
Japanese film , on the other hand , has remained mostly understated , relying primarily on mood and pacing rather than blood and guts to achieve scares .
Horror author Koji Suzuki points out that unlike most American horror cinema , many Japanese stories do not end in the destruction of the antagonist .
To me , blood - and - gore horror movies are for kids … Kids are taken in by that sort of stuff .
But real fear , the genuine article , has to stimulate the adult imagination .
In America and Europe most horror movies tell the story of the extermination of evil spirits .
Japanese horror movies end with a suggestion that the spirit still remains at large .
That ’s because the Japanese do n’t regard spirits only as enemies , but as beings that co-exist with this world of ours . [ 13 ]
This understated tone actually helps Japanese horror be more effective , as even the results of the protagonists ’ struggle are often ultimately in vain ( as in The Ring ) .
Another common aspect of American horror is our burning need to explain away and rationalize the supernatural events that occur in the story .
For example , the original script for Alfred Hitchcock ’s Psycho did not include the final scene where Norman Bates ’ psychosis is hastily explained by a psychologist .
The scene was added to quell fears held by the producers that audiences would not understand the film ’s finale .
Similarly , the American remake of Juon ( called The Grudge , released in 2004 ) added several scenes to explain away the antagonist ’s motivations and the way the universe works .
Unlike the original Japanese version , very little was left up to the imagination .
The American remake of The Ring sported similar features : entire sections about Samara ’s ( Sadako ’s post - localization name ) life were added to help explain various details of the plot .
Almost all American horror films take pains to explain why events in the plot occur ( though there are exceptions ; see The Shining and The Birds ) .
In contrast , Japanese horror literature and cinema usually poses more questions than it answers .
Why is Sadako so powerful ?
Why does she use a video tape to return from the grave ?
What is her long - term goal ?
How does the curse in Juon work ?
Why does Hanako respond from her toilet ?
How did she get there ?
In general , the is much left unexplained in Japanese horror , which helps lend it some of its power .
As horror screenwriter Lucus Sussman points out , “ Japanese horror operates on a much more dreamlike level … this actually works well for horror , because horror is about not being in control . ” [ 14 ]
This comfortability with leaving some things unexplained may relate to Japan ’s religious flexibility .
As previously mentioned , reconciling both Buddhism and Shinto within the culture requires the Japanese to accept a level of ambiguity about how the universe works .
This is almost diametrically opposed to the classic Christian perspective , which tends to break the world down into “ good ” and “ evil ” categories .
The idea that the rules of the universe are beyond the scope of human understanding also allows horror authors more leeway in creating their stories because their target audience has less of an expectation that all will be made clear with time .
This characteristic in turn often leads to more powerful horror stories , as much is left up to the viewer ’s imagination .
There may also be another , secondary trait here ; while American horror is often concerned with a decent into the unknown ( Jonathan Harker ’s trek to Dracula ’s castle , the group of teenagers entering the haunted house cliché , the Bates Motel in Psycho , et cetera ) , Japanese tales often describe the unknown invading the known .
Sadako comes out of the TV and directly into the homes of her victims , Hanako ’s toilet is not a noteworthy location , and the samurai in The Story of Okiku cannot escape the ghost of Okiku because she refuses to stay in her well .
This probably relates back to Suzuki ’s conclusion that the Japanese accept a degree of otherworldliness all around them , while Americans like to concentrate our evil spirits in a specific location ( witness our oft - employed “ Ancient Indian Burial Ground ” cliché ) .
The American approach may be another side effect of Christianity ’s tendency to separate everything into absolutes ( in this case , defining explicit physical boundaries between “ evil locations ” and “ normal locations ” ) , but it also means our horror is often less effective ; once a character or location is known to be “ good ” or “ evil , ” there is a certain degree of expectation we can rely upon to remove tension from the drama .
The more vague and invasive approach often employed in Japanese horror can thus be far more affecting , as we do not have any comfortable story archetype to cling to .
Conclusion
Though we may sometimes be confused by the nuances of media from Japan , the country is home to a wealth of history , tradition , and culture .
Japanese horror has piqued the interest of Western audiences with its understated tone and lack of easy answers , but outside of its cultural context even horror can be confounding .
In this article I have attempted to explain some of the common mechanics of Japanese horror , as well as the belief systems , history , and modern context within which these mechanics exist .
Though I have only scratched the surface of the culture of this complex and interesting country , I hope that this article has given you some insight into how Japanese horror works .
The study of culture , even through pulp media such as horror film and games , is an intensely interesting and rewarding activity ; I urge anybody interested in horror to spend some quality time with some of the amazing works from Japan .
There is much more relevant information that could be covered here , but I will leave future investigation up to you .
So curl up with your favorite horror movie , game , or book , and pay close attention ; beyond the screams and the blood there is a whole culture hiding .

Soviet cosmonauts conceal truth about UFOs
The UFO phenomenon never existed in the former USSR , at least in the official records .
There were numerous stories about unidentified flying objects which could be heard from susceptible individuals , but Soviet cosmonauts never said anything on the subject , although they had a lot to share .
Soviet cosmonauts conceal truth about UFOs
Former Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Kovalenok appeared at a press conference devoted to unusual and anomalous phenomena in space .
He said that he had witnessed something inexplicable during his work on board the Salyut orbital station .
The cosmonaut said that he once saw a strange object on Earth ’s orbit .
He asked his partner , Viktor Savinykh , to fetch a camera .
While Savinykh was trying to find the camera , the object exploded in front of Kovalenok ’s eyes .
The object split into two parts and had something like a bridge connecting those parts .
The dumbbell - like object disappeared before the other cosmonaut was ready to photograph it .
A strong radioactive emission was registered on Earth soon after the explosion of the mysterious object .
Kovalenok said that many of his colleagues had witnessed something unusual on a number of occasions , but they decided not to bring those issues to the public attention .
Pilot Pavel Popovich was on a flight from Washington to Moscow in 1978 .
The plane was flying at the height of about 10,000 meters , when he noticed a triangular luminescent object flying on the same trajectory with his aircraft .
The speed of the triangle was higher than that of the plane – more than 1,700 km/h , whereas the jetliner was flying at 1,100 km/h .
Cosmonauts Gennady Strekalov and Gennady Manakov saw a bright spherical object appearing in the cloudless sky above Newfoundland in 1990 .
The sphere disappeared without a trace ten seconds later .
In 1991 , Musa Manarov was observing the module with the new crew nearing the Mir Space Station , filming the process on video camera .
He suddenly saw an antenna - like object separating from the module .
He informed the cosmonauts inside the module that something had undocked from them .
Nevertheless , it never became possible to identify the object , although it was filmed on camera .
It goes without saying that cosmonauts informed their governing bodies of all those and many other strange incidents .
All of the stories were most likely documented and subsequently classified .
Cosmonauts may often witness other inexplicable events happening in space , Vladimir Kovalenok said .
A tape recorder switched on by itself and started playing the crew ’s favorite film on the orbit once , Kovalenok said .
Psychologists often warn cosmonauts prior to their space missions that they may experience a phenomenon known as the altered state of consciousness .
A Russian cosmonaut said in 1994 that he and his partner had numerous visions when they were working on board the Mir station for six months .
It seemed to them that they were turning into weird creatures – animals and even humanoids of extraterrestrial origin .
Survivors group : Did House chaplain once hide clergy sex crimes ?
David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday November 20 , 2008
Print This Email This Roll Call revealed Wednesday that the Catholic priest who currently serves as chaplain for the House of Representatives formerly oversaw a retreat outside Chicago where troubled priests were sent , including those accused of sexual misconduct .
The Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests ( SNAP ) has issued a statement concerning these revelations about Rev. Daniel Coughlin .
" Sadly , this is a familiar pattern in the Chicago archdiocese : a priest who successfully keeps quiet about clergy sex crimes wins a promotion .
...
Among other questions , Coughlin needs to be asked , ' Did you ever call the police about any of these known or alleged crimes and if not , why not ? ' "
SNAP has also issued a press release blasting Cardinal Francis George of the Chicago archdiocese for recommending Coughlin for the House chaplainship and demanding that " Coughlin ... openly address this question and other questions about his role in keeping clergy sex crimes hidden . "
The Roll Call article does not suggest that any impropriety at the Congressional end was involved in Coughlin 's selection .
However , the fact that no one in the House of Representatives appears to have been aware of their chaplain 's past work does raise questions about the vetting process .
When the previous House chaplain retired in 2000 and then - Speaker Dennis Hasters nominated a Presbyterian clergyman as his replacement , it led to a firestorm of charges that Hastert and the Republican leadership were anti-Catholic .
Hastert turned in desperation to Cardinal George , who suggested five candidates .
Because the original search committee had already disbanded , Hastert 's staff interviewed two of the possibilities themselves and settled on Coughlin , in large part because he told them that in his position as vicar for priests , " most of the work is very confidential . "
" That 's the word they liked the most , " Coughlin told Roll Call .
" Confidential . "
What Hastert 's staffers did not ask , and Coughlin did not volunteer , was that he had spent the previous ten years , from 1990 to 2000 , first directing a retreat for troubled priests and then serving as their vicar .
A dozen of the priests Coughlin was responsible for were ultimately forced out of the priesthood and at least ten were alleged sexual abusers .
At that time , the Chicago archdiocese was still attempting to keep allegations of sexual abuse quiet .
Following a nation - wide wave of public accusations in 2002 , it altered its policies and has since settled lawsuits with dozens of alleged victims and paid out millions of dollars in damages .
SNAP notes in particular that in 1999 , Coughlin petitioned for the state of Wisconsin to release a convicted child molester , who remains in prison to this day because he is considered to be a threat to children .
Although Cardinal George denies having approved Coughlin 's letter , he made his own attempts to get the former priest out of prison .
Barbara Blaine , president of SNAP , told ABC News , " It goes back to Cardinal George 's recklessness , lack of leadership and his lack of judgment that he would somehow now go and promote Father Coughlin , who may have been involved in covering up abuse by predators . "
According to Roll Call , Coughlin argues that he " did not create the policies for handling accused priests and had no authority to decide how the church should deal with allegations against them .
...
He was the point man for carrying out the church 's legal obligations to priests who , under church law , could not simply be fired and cut loose . "
A spokeswoman for the Chicago archdiocese confirmed this description , telling Roll Call , " As director of the Stritch Retreat House , Father Coughlin was responsible for the development and presentation of spiritual retreat programs for priests , deacons and others .
He was not responsible for the management , supervision or ongoing monitoring of priests removed from ministry . "
However , Coughlin did acknowledge to Roll Call that when any of the priests under his care ultimately decided to quit the priesthood , " I became more anxious because we were trying to control this as much as we could ... because now he wasnt under our control at all . "
Well I took a polygraph for the SDPD yesturday and it was the worst experience ever .
I went into it a little nervous just because it was a polygraph but I figured I would just tell the truth and I 'd be alright .
I actually believed in the science and that lie detectors worked because if they didnt why would so many places use them right ?
So I took the test and what do ya know im a child molester .
Who knew ?
I sure didnt .
I also reacted to some other sexual questions but when he asked if I had ever engaged in a sexual act with a child I reacted a lot apparently .
It s completely wrong .
Maybe it was because I considered the sexual questions ridicules like sex with dead people and such .
I think when I was asked the child question I was disgusted and angry about it because I thought about something happening to my little brother or something .
For whatever reason this guy pretty much told me his machine said Im a dirt bag child molester and other things .
I felt like having a breakdown .
Im just so depressed about this .
I really wanted the job and im being eliminated for something that cant be further from the truth .
I didnt lie about a single thing on that test and it came back as like the worst thing possible .
Maybe its just because I was uncomfortable with those questions ?
I may have answered and made a facial expression in a way that expressed how ridicules I thought it was .
Still I was drilled about how this machine is accurate and how I was lying and bullshiting him and I was a dirt bag child molester .
I CAN NOT BELIEVE THIS .
I CAN NOT BELIEVE HOW WRONG THIS MACHINE IS .
Is there anything I can do to help myself now ?
Im problem screwed cause any other police department I apply for is going to want to know why I was rejected and they are going to tell them it was because im something im not .
I AM NOT A CHILD MOLESTOR I DO NOT HUMP DEAD PEOPLE OR ANIMALS .
I TOLD THE TRUTH ABOUT EVERYTHING GOOD AND BAD .
I thought I would be ok because I let everything out .
I was honest .
It came back as something that was so wrong that hurt me because its so disgusting to have someone think that of you .
Im so depressed about this .
Is there anything I can do to make this go away ?
I dont want people to think this of me .
THESE TESTS DO NOT WORK AND SOMEONE NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE WAY THEY ARE BEING USED .
I cant believe the results of this test .
It couldnt have been worst .
I would have no problem if I was eliminated by the sdpd for something that was true that I had done or just cause there were better applicants than me .
But this is horrible .
Barack Obama 's Law Personality : Harvard Law Review 's first black president plans a life of public service .
His multicultural background gives him unique perspective .
By Tammerlin Drummond
Times Staff Writer
Barack Obama stares silently at a wall of fading black - and - white photographs in the muggy second - floor offices of the Harvard Law Review .
He lingers over one row of solemn faces , his predecessors of 40 years ago .
All are men .
All are dressed in dark - colored suits and ties .
All are white .
It is a sobering moment for Obama , 28 , who in February became the first black to be elected president in the 102 - year history of the prestigious student - run law journal .
The post , considered the highest honor a student can attain at Harvard Law School , almost always leads to a coveted clerkship with the U.S. Supreme Court after graduation and a lucrative offer from the law firm of one 's choice .
Yet Obama , who has gone deep into debt to meet the $ 25,000 - a- year cost of a Harvard Law School education , has left many in disbelief by asserting that he wants neither .
" One of the luxuries of going to Harvard Law School is it means you can take risks in your life , " Obama said recently .
" You can try to do things to improve society and still land on your feet .
That 's what a Harvard education should buy - enough confidence and security to pursue your dreams and give something back . "
After graduation next year , Obama says he probably will spend two years at a corporate law firm , then look for community work .
Down the road , he plans to run for public office .
The son of a Kenyan economist and an American anthropologist , Obama is a tall man with a quick , boyish smile whose fellow students rib him about his trademark tattered blue jeans .
" I come from a lot of worlds and I have had the unique opportunity to move through different circles , " Obama said .
" I have worked and lived in poor black communities and I can translate some of their concerns into words that the larger society can embrace . "
His own upbringing is a blending of diverse cultures .
Born in Hawaii , where his parents met in college , Obama was named Barack ( blessed in Arabic ) after his father .
The elder Obama was among a generation of young Africans who came to the United States to study engineering , finance and medicine , skills that could be taken back home to build a new , strong Africa .
In Hawaii , he married Obama 's mother , a white American from Wichita , Kan .
Two years later , Obama 's parents separated and he moved to a small village outside Jakarta , Indonesia , with his mother , an anthropologist .
There , he spent his boyhood playing with the sons and daughters of rice farmers and rickshaw drivers , attending an Indonesian - speaking school , where he had little contact with Americans .
Every morning at 5 , his mother would wake him to take correspondence classes for fear he would forget his English .
It was in Indonesia , Obama said , where he first became aware of abject poverty and despair .
" It left a very strong mark on me living there because you got a real sense of just how poor folks can get , " he said .
" You 'd have some army general with 24 cars and if he drove one once then eight servants would come around and wash it right away .
But on the next block , you 'd have children with distended bellies who just could n't eat . "
After six years in Indonesia , Obama was sent back to the United States to live with his maternal grandparents in Hawaii in preparation for college .
It was then that he began to correspond with his father , a senior economist for the Kenyan finance ministry who recounted intriguing tales of an African heritage that Obama knew little about .
Obama treasured his father 's tales of walking miles to school , using a machete to hack a path through the elephant grass - the legends and traditions of the Luo tribe , a proud people who inhabited the shores of Lake Victoria .
He still carries a passbook that belonged to his grandfather , an herbalist who was the first family member to leave the small Kenyan village of Alego , move to the city and don Western clothes .
" He was a cook and he used to have to carry this passbook to work for the English , " Obama recalls .
" At the age of 46 it had this description of him that said , ` He 's a colored boy , he 's responsible and he 's a good cook . ' "
Two generations later , at the most widely respected legal journal in the country , the grandson of the cook is giving the orders .
Yet some of Obama 's peers question the motives of this second - year law student .
They find it puzzling that despite Obama 's openly progressive views on social issues , he has also won support from staunch conservatives .
Ironically , he has come under the most criticism from fellow black students for being too conciliatory toward conservatives and not choosing more blacks to other top positions on the law review .
" He 's willing to talk to them ( the conservatives ) and he has a grasp of where they are coming from , which is something a lot of blacks do n't have and do n't care to have , " said Christine Lee , a second - year law student who is black .
" His election was significant at the time , but now it 's meaningless because he 's becoming just like all the others ( in the Establishment ) . "
Although some question what personal goals motivate Obama , his interest in social issues is deeply grounded .
At Occidental College in Los Angeles , Obama studied international relations and spent much of his time helping to organize anti-apartheid protests .
In his junior year , he transferred to Columbia University , " more for what ( New York City ) had to offer than for the education , " he said .
After graduating , Obama landed a job writing manuals for a New York - based international trade publication .
Once his college loans were paid off , he took a $ 13,000 - a- year job as director for the Developing Communities Project , a church - based social action group in Chicago .
There , he and a coalition of ministers set out to improve living conditions in poor neighborhoods plagued by crime and high unemployment .
Obama helped form a tenants ' rights group in the housing projects and established a job training program .
" I took a chance and it paid off , " he said .
" It was probably the best education that I 've ever had . "
After four years , Obama decided it was time to move on .
He wanted to learn how to use the political system to effect social change .
He set his sights on Harvard Law School , where he quickly distinguished himself as a top student .
He was soon chosen through the strength of his writing and grades to serve as one of 80 student editors on the law review .
Unlike many peer - review professional journals , the law review is run solely by students .
It is widely considered the major forum for current legal debate and consequently is watched closely by courts around the country .
In his second year at law school , Obama decided to run for law review president after a conversation with a black friend .
" I said I was not planning to run and he said , ` Yes you are because that is a door that needs to be kicked down and you can take it down . ' "
It was a marathon selection process , an arcane throwback to the early days of the review .
The students editors deliberated behind closed doors from 8:30 a.m. until early the next day .
The 19 anxious candidates took turns cooking breakfast , lunch and dinner for the selection committee , whose members emerged with a historic decision .
" Before I could say a word , another black student who was running just came up and grabbed me and hugged me real hard , " Obama recalled .
" It was then that I knew it was more than just about me .
It was about us .
And I am walking through a lot of doors that had already been opened by others . "
But few students at the law review were prepared for the deluge of interview requests for Obama from newspapers , radio and television stations .
Strange letters of congratulations began arriving .
Shortly after the elections , a package turned up at the law review office with no return address .
Obama said he hesitated to open it because of the spree of recent mail bombings targeted at civil rights activists nationwide .
When the package was finally opened , inside were two packages of dim sum , with no explanation .
Some students made light of the media invasion , posting a memo titled " The Barack Obama Story , a Made for TV Movie , Starring Blair Underwood as Barack Obama . "
Yet tensions were building .
White students grumbled about the attention paid to Obama 's race .
Black students criticized him for not choosing more blacks for other top positions at the review .
Caught in the cross - fire , Obama , who has a tendency toward understatement , downplayed his own achievements .
" For every one of me , there are thousands of young black kids with the same energies , enthusiasm and talent that I have who have not gotten the opportunity because of crime , drugs and poverty , " he said .
" I think my election does symbolize progress but I do n't want people to forget that there is still a lot of work to be done . "
Describing Obama , fellow students and professors point to a self - confidence tempered by modesty as one of his greatest attributes .
" He 's very unusual , in the sense that other students who might have something approximating his degree of insight are very intimidating to other students or inconsiderate and thoughtless , " said Laurence Tribe , a constitutional law professor .
" He 's able to build upon what other students say and see what 's valuable in their comments without belittling them . "
But what truly distinguishes Obama from other bright students at Harvard Law , Tribe said , is his ability to make sense of complex legal arguments and translate them into current social concerns .
For example , Tribe said , Obama wrote an insightful research article showing how contrasting views in the abortion debate are a direct result of cultural and sociological differences .
As law review president , Obama is the last person to edit student articles , as well as longer pieces by accomplished legal scholars .
The review publishes eight times a year and receives about 600 free - lance articles each year .
Referring to his fellow students at the review , whom he edits , he said : " These are the people who will be running the country in some form or other when they graduate .
If I 'm talking to a white conservative who wants to dismantle the welfare state , he has the respect to listen to me and I to him .
That 's the biggest value of the Harvard Law Review .
Ideas get fleshed out and there is no party line to follow . "
Obama spends 50 to 60 hours each week on law review business .
The full - time volunteer job leaves little time for an additional 12 hours of class , plus homework .
When it comes to choosing between the two , as it often does , Obama usually misses class .
One of Obama 's most difficult tasks as editor in chief is keeping the peace amid the clashing egos of writers and editors .
" He is very , very diplomatic , " said Radhika Rao , 24 , a third - year law student from Lexington , Ind .
" He is very outgoing and has a lot of experience in handling people , which stands him in good stead . "
Tina Ulrich , 24 , a third - year student , wrote an article for the review that went through several editors before her final draft landed on Obama 's desk .
" When he sent it back , it had lots of tiny print all over it and I was just furious , " she said .
" My heart just sank .
But it was accompanied by specific examples of how parts could be made better .
He wound up getting an enthusiastic response from a very tired writer . "
Outside the review , other blacks at Harvard are skeptical that Obama 's appointment will change much at the Ivy League institution , where 180 out of 1,601 law students are black .
" While I applaud Obama 's achievement , I guess I am not as hopeful for what this will mean for other blacks at Harvard , " said Derrick Bell , the school 's first black tenured law professor .
" There is a strange character to this black achievement .
When you have someone that reaches this high level , you find that he is just deemed exceptional and it does not change society 's view of all of the rest . "
Online schools and online degrees have become the go - to alternative to traditional schools and colleges .
If you have a full - time job , a family , are in the military or have other time constraints , learning through an online school is a great way to learn , and to open up your career options .
A recent survey by Babson Survey Research Group and The College Board shows that around 32 % of college students - around 10 students per class of 30 - have taken at least one online class .
That statistic has grown from just over 9 % ten years ago , showing a strong upward trend in the competency , availability , and student preference for online education .
With online schools are rapidly gaining popularity with students as well as employers , online degrees are becoming a more popular option for students who are parents , those with full - time jobs or travel obligations , and anyone else without the flexibility to attend a campus - based school .
Consequently , online schools themselves are consistently evolving to include broader programs , more degrees , more in - depth content , and more opportunity .
If you ’re fully employed , a full - time parent , or have other daytime obligations , there ’s probably an online school that can help you .

*** The Sambia believe that semen is all important to human life but is in short supply , and must therefore be circulated through people , both males and females , very carefully .
Women and men , the Sambia believe , are born with an internal organ called a tingu that secretes their sexual substance .
The poor old male tingu is born shriveled and dry and its ability to produce semen is developed slowly through childhood and adolescence , through a certain practice which takes years .
At the age of 7 to 10 , Sambia boys are taken away from their mothers to a men ’s house in the village , where they will live for the next ten or so years .
there they learn the key act by which their maturation is ensured ; regular fellatio of an older youth , aged roughly 14 - 18 .
the whole point of Sambia initiation is to build up the poor little dry baby tingus of the young boys by feeding them the semen of older , stronger teenagers .
Only when they ’ve gone most of the way through this process , and have a well - functioning tingu , and know a lot of male secrets , will they be ready for the dangerous but exciting business of mature adult sex with women .
After practicing fellatio several times a week for 3 to 6 years , at around the ages of 13 or 14 , the younger boys start to mature physically and sexually as their bodies develop , their sexual organs get bigger , their muscles get stronger , and the Sambians say , in effect , “ hey , look , it works ; this is why we do it ! ”
Another 3 - 4 years after this , at the ages of 17 - 18 , the men are ready to be married .
Married couples do n’t set up house together .
The young man stays in the men ’s house , the woman with her family .
But they do meet for regular oral sex , the husband now being fellated by his wife , who ingests his semen which is believed to toughen her up .
During this first stage of marriage , Sambian males also go on being fellated by younger males , so this is actually a period of bisexuality for them .
For the second part of the Sambian marriage , the couple move in together on a fulltime basis .
They experience for the first time “ man-woman penis - in - vagina sexual intercourse ” .
The man is considered strong enough and knowledgeable enough to engage in the work of sex for the purpose of procreating his own children .
He must no longer allow younger males access to his nurturing penis , for it will now be a threatening penis , too polluted by sex with women to ever be safe for men again .

The decision represents an abrupt shift of strategy for the industry , which has opened legal proceedings against about 35,000 people since 2003 .
Critics say the legal offensive ultimately did little to stem the tide of illegally downloaded music .
And it created a public - relations disaster for the industry , whose lawsuits targeted , among others , several single mothers , a dead person and a 13 - year - old girl .
Instead , the Recording Industry Association of America said it plans to try an approach that relies on the cooperation of Internet - service providers .
The trade group said it has hashed out preliminary agreements with major ISPs under which it will send an email to the provider when it finds a provider 's customers making music available online for others to take .
Depending on the agreement , the ISP will either forward the note to customers , or alert customers that they appear to be uploading music illegally , and ask them to stop .
If the customers continue the file - sharing , they will get one or two more emails , perhaps accompanied by slower service from the provider .
Finally , the ISP may cut off their access altogether .
The RIAA said it has agreements in principle with some ISPs , but declined to say which ones .
But ISPs , which are increasingly cutting content deals of their own with entertainment companies , may have more incentive to work with the music labels now than in previous years .
Al Franken ’s campaign won two key rulings today that may help him overcome a tiny deficit against Sen. Norm Coleman in the Minnesota Senate recount .
The Minnesota Canvassing Board unanimously recommended that all counties include the absentee ballots that were unfairly rejected on Election Day in the recount .
Election officials throughout the state have been sorting absentee ballots based on why they were rejected – and putting aside a fifth group ( called the “ fifth pile ” ) with those unfairly rejected ballots .
Minnesota ’s Deputy Secretary of State predicted over 1,500 ballots fall in this category .
If they ’re included , they could potentially overturn Coleman ’s razor - thin lead .
Coleman leads Franken by 192 votes , according to the Secretary of State ’s official count .
Earlier , the Canvassing Board voted unanimously to include the 133 missing ballots from a Minneapolis precinct that voted overwhelmingly for Franken -- another victory for the Franken camp .
Coleman ’s campaign argued the ballots may never have existed in the first place , and should n’t have been counted .
“ We are pleased that the state canvassing board has affirmed what we always believed to be true : Minnesota is not a state that disenfranchises its voters , ” said Franken spokesman Andy Barr .
“ Today 's decisions represent positive and productive steps towards ensuring that this election is decided fairly and accurately , as well as a complete rejection of the Coleman campaign 's effort to throw out lawful votes from Minnesotans . ”
Next week , the Canvassing Board will pore over as many as 4,000 ballots that both campaigns have disputed .
Coleman 's campaign will be holding a press conference at 1:45 EST to offer its reaction to the ruling .

WASHINGTON  President - elect Barack Obama has imposed stricter conflict - of - interest restrictions on his White House transition team than any president before him .
But a list of transition team members that his office made public on Friday includes a complicated tangle of ties to private influence - seekers .
Among the full roster of about 150 staff members being assigned to government agencies between now and Inauguration Day are dozens of former lobbyists and some who were registered as recently as this year .
Many more are executives and partners at firms that pay lobbyists , and former government officials who work as consultants or advisers to those seeking influence .
After campaigning on promises to end the influence of lobbyists in the White House , Mr. Obama has imposed rules that bar officials on his transition team from handling any issues in areas of policy where they have lobbied over the last 12 months or from seeking to influence the same agencies for the next 12 months .
The rules also bar officials from working on matters where family members or recent business associates may have a direct conflict of interest .
In cases where there is even an “ appearance of conflict , ” officials must seek a waiver from the transition ’s executive director , an Obama Senate aide and law school classmate , Christopher Lu .

This is the sad truth about PA , and probably other states as well ( I can only comment on my home state with any authority ) .
We hear all this stuff about the GOP melting down this year , but the Democrats have just as much scum , and most of them are in the form of corrupt , nasty , greedy for whatever tiny bit of power they can snatch for themselves , older officials .
Over in Western PA there 's tons of people just like this horrid woman .
They may have a " ( D ) " after their names , but they sure as hell do n't follow any of the progressive ideals that brought me and my family to join the party .
Times like this I wish there was more of a 3rd - party presence in American politics , because there are a ton of scumbucket Democrats I wanted to vote out , but since my only other choice was to vote for a Republican who held positions even more opposite my beliefs , I was stuck .

There 's no ready transcript available , but the primary take - away , stated by Deputy Commissioner Fred Voigt and reiterated and reinforced by Commissioner Marge Tartaglione , is that long lines are not a problem ...
Long lines are no justification for any thing but waiting ...
( apparently that was re : paper ballots ) ...
people wait in long lines overnight for baseball tickets ... people wait in line all night for a new Ipod ...
But the most frightning quote is an abbreviated snipper at the beginning and is even worse than the rest ..
" not in the polling place , at the polling place ! " ... if that was in reference to the court - ordered paper ballots then thousands of Philadelphia voters are screwed over through no fault of their own .

I can't believe that she compares waiting in line for an ipod or baseball tickets or groceries to waiting in line to vote .
First of all , we have choices as to where we will purchase any of those things and most people would choose to go elsewhere rather than wait more than a few minutes in line .
In order to cast our vote , we must go to our assigned polling place .
That is a key difference .
I would really like to know what her motivation is for keeping people from voting .

Which brings this article ( below ) to mind .
It 's an excellent article written by my vice presidential candidate , Matt Gonzalez , of Nader / Gonzalez : What Do They Have to Do to Lose Your Vote ?
The Trail of Broken Promises By MATT GONZALEZ Excerpt : Watching the Democrats in the final weeks of the presidential election has been a lesson in revisionist history .
While they lament the terrible crimes perpetrated against the American people by George Bush and vow to keep fighting for our rights , they conveniently gloss over the fact that they have no standing to make such claims .
Indeed , the Democrats , including Senator Barack Obama , have actually voted with President Bush ’s agenda , making them complicit in his acts , not valiant opponents defending our liberties ...
On the street when I am approached by an Obama / Biden volunteer or someone who tells me they ’re voting for Obama , I usually ask “ What about the FISA vote ? ”
And each time I hear in return “ What ’s that ? ”
Or if I say , “ You know he supports the death penalty , ” I usually hear in response , “ No he does n’t . ”
At what point will there be intellectual honesty about what is happening ?
People are voting for Obama because they find him to be an engaging public speaker and like his message regardless of his history of being part of the very problem he professes to want to fix .
Most people do n’t want the actual facts to interfere with the desperate hope that he is everything they want him to be .
Do you really want to vote for someone who has already voted to take away your civil liberties because of some vague wish that he ’ll act differently as president ?
Obama himself , speaking of Sen. Hillary Clinton , made a remark that could just as easily apply to him , and , unwittingly makes the case for why no one should vote for him :
“ We ca n’t afford a president whose positions change with the politics of the moment .
We need a president who knows that being ready on day one means getting it right from day one . ” ( Salem , OR , 3/21/08 ) .
If voting for war appropriations and taking away civil liberties was bringing us closer to a more democratic and egalitarian society , well , I would advocate it .
But it is n’t doing that .
What is your breaking point ?
At what point do you decide that you ’ve had enough ?
What do they have to do to lose your vote ?
End Excerpt .

Erma # 12 I used to read articles at Alexander Cockburn 's Counterpunch until I realized he had become unreasonable and out of touch with reality , much like Marge Troglodyte [ did I spell that right , Marge ? ]
I can tell you that the blanket statement " Obama supports the death penalty " is far too simplistic .
Obama Said That Certain Precautions Had To Be Taken Before One Could Consider
The Death Penalty , Supported A Moratorium .
" As for death penalty moratoriums , Obama , who 's also a constitutional lawyer , said unless proper due process exists , no one should be put on death row ...' I was a main sponsor of a bill that would have put an immediate moratorium on the death penalty , ' said Obama .
' We need to put more resources into the Public Defender 's office , so they can do things like DNA testing and take other means to make sure you 've got the right person before you consider the death penalty . ' "
Obama Said He Supported The Death Penalty For Certain Crimes , But Did Not Support How The Death Penalty Was Administered .
Obama said , " I support capital punishment for heinous crimes .
I cannot , however , support the current system which is rife with error and lacks sufficient safeguards against wrongful convictions . "
The Chicago Tribune reported , " Obama qualified his stance , saying that his support eroded further when looking at how the death penalty 'is currently administered in this country . ' "
Obama Said That He Supported The Death Penalty For Certain Crimes But Opposed The Death Penalty In Its Current Application .
Obama said , " Because my own views on the death penalty are very complicated .
I 've said that in theory I do n't object to the death penalty for heinous crimes -- terrorism , mass murder , child killers .
But , in its application , it 's been racially biased , highly unreliable , inconsistent .
So for me to try to pretend that I was a cheerleader for the death penalty , simply to score a political point , that was n't reflective of my views . "
Matt Gonzalez is n't paying enough attention to detail and can't [ or wo n't ] see the whole picture .
To understand what ’s really happened since the Democrats took their very small majority in congress in 2006 , here ’s a good site : The Real Story of the 110th Congress : The Right - Wing Block - And - Blame Game
As the 110th Congress nears its close , the impact of a record - breaking campaign of obstruction by a conservative minority in the Senate is now more clear than ever .
The right - wing strategy of " block and blame " has driven the public perception of a " do- nothing Congress . "
In reality , the 110th Congress would have achieved truly landmark accomplishments — including safely bringing the troops home from Iraq , reducing America 's dependence on foreign oil and its contribution to global warming , and funding long - neglected domestic priorities — had it not been for conservative obstruction .

This woman , Marge Tartaglione ( D ) , reminds me of the Bush - enabling scum in congress who charade as Dems ( and who are Repugs in reality ) .
Since 2000 , most of the so - called Dems in congress --- especially the so - called " leadership " --- by their actions and voting record have told us to " fuk off , we do n't care what you think .
We work for the Bush regime .
Do n't you understand that by now ?
We take your votes for granted .
We know you will vote for us in 2008 and beyond no matter what we do for Bush / Cheney et al . "
This Marge has the same despicable approach to the voters as the Republicrats in congress .
I would n't be the least bit surprised if this bitch ran for congress .
She 'd certainly fit in perfectly with the rest of the trash in there .
Another excellent article : Vote independent or boycott the elections
By Reza Fiyouzat
Online Journal Contributing Writer
How long shall we allow the system to kick us in the head , take our money , insult us after taking our money , and still expect us to participate in its frauds ?
With every passing year , the differences between the two ruling political parties in the U.S. diminish further , and their outlook , conduct and even advertising campaigns merge so much so that their members can be mistaken one for the other .
By now it must be clear that the ‘ two - party ’ system is not only no such thing , it is corrupt to the bone .
It should be instructive to recount some major points of Obama ’s record , but since much of that has been done by far more qualified people , it should suffice to point to what ’s presented by Matt Gonzalez , in his piece , What Do They Have to Do to Lose Your Vote ?
( http://www.counterpunch.org/gonzalez10292008.html), in which we find all that is needed to persuade any whose illusions regarding Obama are still unshaken .
If , after reading that , you still vote for Obama , then you deserve everything Obama throws at you once in office , and it is you who have no right to complain .

Responding to COMMENT # 14 regarding the death penalty .
Matt Gonzalez is correct when he makes the statement that Obama is pro-death penalty .
This is from the blog " Abolish the Death Penalty " : Quote : Courtesy of today 's Washington Post , here 's where Barack Obama stands on the death penalty .
In a nutshell : He 's pro-death penalty but he is also pro-let 's not execute the wrong guy : ...
End Quote http://deathpenaltyusa.b...a-and-death-penalty.html
Therefore , if you have 2 categories ( one being pro-death penalty and the second one being anti-death penalty ) , Obama IS pro-death penalty , as Matt Gonzalez correctly said .
I see nothing on Obama 's website about the death penalty .

End Quote Kira , you really should do just a tad bit of research AND LISTENING with an open mind to what Nader / Gonzalez say before you post your propaganda against Nader / Gonzalez .
Yes , " selling his soul " is being anti-war , anti-corporate , anti-FISA , anti-Wall Street bailout and pro-universal health care just to name a few things .
Yes , that sounds like somebody that is really " out of touch , " considering your lord and saviour Obama is for NONE of these things .
In other words , there is no liberal / progressive agenda on Obama 's part whatsoever .
So now who 's the one who 's " out of touch ? "
The wheels came off Obama 's bus long before he chose to actively work for and vote for Bush 's Wall Street bailout and war appropriations .

I guess we need cameras on at the PA polling sites to see just how long these lines are .
It was wrong to compare working voters to iPod line waiters ..
And I know a LOT of people that wo n't wait in line for some bauble because it's not a priority for them , but voting is .
When she said " people stand in lines at the grocery store " I screamed at my screen " NOT for 10 hours !
That store would be out of business !! "
Though , she said that " we 've never had problems with long lines in PA " ..
Is that accurate ?
I thought long lines were problematic most places , but figured there were some places with no issues .
Do we have documented long line in PA ?
If yes , she 's nuts .. if no , perhaps this is much adieu about nothing .
( after all , was n't this initially about making sure they had back up voting mechanisms if the machines failed ? )

While Republicans are always vilified and held accountable for alleged misdeeds or shortcomings , Democrats never incur even a modicum of the same level of criticism and self - examination .

I have been told on multiple occasions about irregularities in the Philadelphia polling process .
In 2000 , I personally witnessed Kerry / Edwards signs in the windows of polling places .
Also , friends of mine told me ( on election day ) that the " helpful " poll workers escorted them to the polling booth and " showed them how the machine works " by telling them to press the buttons .
This " helpful " worker then proceeded to press the entire D slate of candidates , and then waved the voter into the booth .
Now , the new machines in use are n't really a booth , they are just a curtain , as shown in the photos of this article .
The curtain barely closes , and the " helpful " worker stood right behind my voter friends while they voted .
The thing is , the worker could tell how the voter was voting , because if they voted Democrat , they would only press the VOTE button .
If they were voting Republican , they would have to press all the buttons , and the buttons beep when pressed .
Since both my friends are Democrats , they merely laughed it off .
I was amazed .
This is a basic violation of the secret ballot , upon which democracy is based .
Anybody else in Philly have this happen at their polling place ?

i agree with Kira # 17 this poor excuse for an election official has forgotten that she is a public servant .
her position most likely lets her vote early so standing in line does n't affect her or her poor feet .
this just shows how badly this system needs new blood .
its too bad that employers do n't allow people to go & work the polls without penalty .
its really awful that they wo n't allow people to take the time needed to vote without incident .
the silver lining here is the incredible enthusiasm people now have about voting at all .
for some 30 years prior to the 2000 elections , the silence heard on voting day was blaring .

Because entrenched interests oppose it ... as do quite a few election integrity groups .
Strange bedfellows indeed
The entrenched voting machine interests should be familiar to regulars here , and the EI opposition is because vote - by - mail uses optical scanners to count the ballots and thus VBM actually has all of the vulnerabilities as optical scan machines elsewhere ... and VBM adds a few of its own as well .
Brad has commented at length on this hereabouts .
Also here you will find much information on the particular ES&S optical scanners used by Oregon but be careful ... to quote Dr. Zaius " You may not like what you find . "

Nader has spent his time attacking Obama , but never a peep about McCain .
Nader hates Democrats .
It has been his sole occupation for the last 20 years to trash them .
He had great potential - but he let his personal hate of the Democrats ruin him .

Pentagon mad - science division Darpa is helping build thought - controlled robotic limbs , artificial pack mules , real - life laser guns and " kill - proof " soldiers .
So it comes as no surprise , really , that the agency is now getting into the flying - car business , too .
Darpa hopes its " Personal Air Vehicle Technology " project , announced yesterday , will ultimately lead to a working prototype of a military - suitable flying car – a two - or four - passenger vehicle that can " drive on roads " one minute and take off like a helicopter the next .
The hybrid machine would be perfect for " urban scouting , " casualty evacuation and commando - delivery missions , the agency believes .
Flying cars have been a just - around - the - corner promise for decades , of course .
Today , several companies swear that they are just on the verge of manufacturing such machines .
Terrafugia claims its folding - wing mini-plane will be ready to deliver by 2009 .
Pal - V has a three - wheeled gyrocopter thingy .
Urban Aeronautics promises to do the whole thing without any wings or rotors at all .
And let 's not even get into the personal flying saucers .
Darpa says its Cessna - sized combo vehicle should be able to cruise at 60 mph on land , and 150 mph in the air .
It should be able to stay aloft for two hours on a tank of fuel .
" The challenge , " the agency says , " is to define the major components of such a vehicle that would be suitable for military scouting and personnel transport missions , yet are small enough , inexpensive enough , and easy enough to operate that it can be widely used . "
To make the flying car work , Darpa believes , makers will have to use " morphing wings " to ease the transition from road to sky ; " optimized disk loading " propulsion , " for the combined fly / drive mission " ; and strong flight control software .
Darpa is n't making an enormous commitment to the flying car , just yet .
This is a project aimed at small business ; contracts of this type are typically under a million dollars per year .
But maybe , with a small Pentagon push , the flying car dream could finally clear the ground .

This post is a continuation of Dangerous Virus Rapidly Spreading The Globe ( Part 1 ) .
If you have not yet done so , please read part 1 .
The symptoms of the FIV disease are complex .
Part 1 addresses the symptoms and part 2 below continues with more symptoms and a discussion about preventative measures and cures .
Part 2 :
Most In Congress Infected With FIV
Most Congressional member are afflicted with FIV , as is Paulson and president Bush , otherwise the reckless $ 700 billion bailout package would never have passed .
True to form , those in the highest positions of authority , notably Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Finance Chairman Barney Frank , show the most severe symptoms .
President elect Obama shows signs of being in the late stages of FIV already .
Hair samples are not even required to make this determination , one can now reliably identify those afflicted with FIV by the symptoms alone .
Interesting enough , Congress is calling for more regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , yet the first thing a regulator in his right mind would do would be to shut them down .
Instead , Congress wants Fannie and Freddie to lend more .
Calls from Krugman and others scream for more regulation even though it is perfectly clear regulation in and of itself always fails .
Power Grab By Those Infected
Another distinguishing characteristic of FIV is those afflicted have a marked propensity to usurp power not caring whether it is legal or not .
I discussed this phenomenon in the Fed Uncertainty Principle .
....
Corollary Number Two :
The government / quasi - government body most responsible for creating this mess ( the Fed ) , will attempt a big power grab , purportedly to fix whatever problems it creates .
The bigger the mess it creates , the more power it will attempt to grab .
Over time this leads to dangerously concentrated power into the hands of those who have already proven they do not know what they are doing .
Corollary Number
Three :
Do n't expect the Fed to learn from past mistakes .
Instead , expect the Fed to repeat them with bigger and bigger doses of exactly what created the initial problem .
Corollary Number Four :
The Fed simply does not care whether its actions are illegal or not .
The Fed is operating under the principle that it 's easier to get forgiveness than permission .
And forgiveness is just another means to the desired power grab it is seeking .
Academic Wonkishness
I ’ve been on the warpath over Germany ’s refusal to play a constructive role in European fiscal stimulus .
But what does the math look like ?
Here ’s a simple analysis — well , simple by economists ’ standards — of the reason coordination is so important for the EU .
....
Consider the effects of an increase in government purchases dG .
This will raise GDP directly , to the extent that it falls on domestic goods and services , and indirectly , as the rise in GDP induces a rise in consumer spending .
We have :
dY = ( 1 - m ) dG + ( 1 - m ) ( 1-t ) c dY
or dY / dG = ( 1 - m ) / [ 1 - ( 1 - m ) ( 1- t )
c ]
Since governments are worried about debt , it ’s also important to ask how much the budget deficit is increased by an increase in government spending .
It ’s not one - for - one , because higher spending leads to higher GDP and hence higher tax revenue .
We have
dD = dG - tdY
A crucial number is “ bang for euro ” : the ratio of the increase in GDP to the increase in the deficit .
After a bit of grinding , it can be shown to be
dY /dD = ( 1 - m ) / [ 1 - ( 1 -t ) ( 1 - m ) c - t ( 1-m ) ]
Non-Wonkish Rebuttal
The average 8th grader understands that one cannot continually spend more money than he has .
The average homeowner who has been foreclosed on understands that buying more house than he could afford vs. wages earned was a very bad idea .
The average economics professor afflicted with the K - Virus thinks that it is possible to spend one 's way out of a fiscal crisis .
The average economics professor afflicted with the M - Virus thinks that it is possible to inflate one 's way out of a fiscal crisis by destroying the currency .
The average congressional representative believes in the free lunch theory of spending many multiples of what is collected in taxes .
The Economic Free Lunch
Japan Model Revisited
Mish :
Would you say that consumer debt in the US as opposed to the lack of consumer debt in Japan increases the deflationary pressures on the US economy ?
Kasriel : Yes , absolutely .
The latest figures that I have show that banks ' exposure to the mortgage market is at 62 % of their total earnings assets , an all time high .
If a prolonged housing bust ensues , banks could be in big trouble .
Mish :
What if Bernanke cuts interest rates to 1 percent ?
Kasriel :
In a sustained housing bust that causes banks to take a big hit to their capital it simply will not matter .
This is essentially what happened recently in Japan and also in the US during the great depression .
Mish : Can you elaborate ?
Kasriel : Most people are not aware of actions the Fed took during the great depression .
Bernanke claims that the Fed did not act strong enough during the great depression .
This is simply not true .
The Fed slashed interest rates and injected huge sums of base money but it did no good .
More recently , Japan did the same thing .
It also did no good .
If default rates get high enough , banks will simply be unwilling to lend which will severely limit money and credit creation .
The Debt Bubble And Its Root Cause
I ’m also with Barry Ritholtz that Bush ’s emphasis on homeownership was not the problem .
Bush favored homeownership ; I ’m sure he also favored marital fidelity ; his influence on homeownership and his influence on adultery were probably comparable .
It ’s Bush ’s opposition to financial regulation that did the evil deed .
Time and time again Krugman , Mankiw , and others , even Ritholtz fail to take the problem back to the root cause : Government Regulation , Fractional Reserve Lending , and the Fed .
Let 's Play A Non-Wonkish Game Of Q&A
" In my view , issuing promises to pay on demand in excess of the amount of the goods on hand is simply fraud , and should be so considered by the legal system .
For this means that a bank issues " fake " warehouse receipts — warehouse receipts , for example , for ounces of gold that do not actually exist in the vaults .
This is legalized counterfeiting ; this is the creation of money without the necessity of production , to compete for resources against those who have produced .
In short , I believe that fractional - reserve banking is disastrous both for the morality and for the fundamental bases and institutions of the market economy .... "
The Austrians Were Right
Before the U.S. House of Representatives , November 20 , 2008
Madame Speaker , many Americans are hoping the new administration will solve the economic problems we face .
That ’s not likely to happen , because the economic advisors to the new President have no more understanding of how to get us out of this mess than previous administrations and Congresses understood how the crisis was brought about in the first place .
Today , a major economic crisis is unfolding .
New government programs are started daily , and future plans are being made for even more .
All are based on the belief that we ’re in this mess because free - market capitalism and sound money failed .
The obsession is with more spending , bailouts of bad investments , more debt , and further dollar debasement .
Many are saying we need an international answer to our problems with the establishment of a world central bank and a single fiat reserve currency .
These suggestions are merely more of the same policies that created our mess and are doomed to fail .
At least 90 % of the cause for the financial crisis can be laid at the doorstep of the Federal Reserve .
It is the manipulation of credit , the money supply , and interest rates that caused the various bubbles to form .
Congress added fuel to the fire by various programs and institutions like the Community Reinvestment Act , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , FDIC , and HUD mandates , which were all backed up by aggressive court rulings .
The Federal Reserve created our problem , yet it manages to gain even more power in the socialization of the entire financial system .
The whole bailout process this past year was characterized by no oversight , no limits , no concerns , no understanding , and no common sense .
Similar mistakes were made in the 1930s and ushered in the age of the New Deal , the Fair Deal , the Great Society and the supply - siders who convinced conservatives that deficits did n’t really matter after all , since they were anxious to finance a very expensive deficit - financed American empire .
All the programs since the Depression were meant to prevent recessions and depressions .
Yet all that was done was to plant the seeds of the greatest financial bubble in all history .
Because of this lack of understanding , the stage is now set for massive nationalization of the financial system and quite likely the means of production .
Although it is obvious that the Keynesians were all wrong and interventionism and central economic planning do n’t work , whom are we listening to for advice on getting us out of this mess ?
Unfortunately , it ’s the Keynesians , the socialists , and big - government proponents .
Who ’s being ignored ?
The Austrian free - market economists – the very ones who predicted not only the Great Depression , but the calamity we ’re dealing with today .

MEXICO CITY  Mexico ’s former senior antidrug official has been arrested and accused of accepting bribes from a drug cartel , the authorities said Friday .
Noé Ramírez Mandujano , who as the chief of Mexico ’s organized crime unit was the closest equivalent to the government ’s drug czar , was arrested late Thursday after questioning , said Attorney General Eduardo Medina - Mora .
Mr. Ramírez is the highest - ranking official to come under suspicion in a purge of the police and prosecutors for possible ties to drug traffickers .
While he led the unit , known by its Spanish initials as the Siedo , Mr. Ramírez met twice with a member of a loose federation known as the Pacific Cartel and took a payoff of $ 450,000 , Mr. Medina - Mora said .
In return , Mr. Ramírez passed along information about investigations and actions against the cartel , Mr. Medina - Mora said .
The witness who accused Mr. Ramírez of taking the bribe told investigators that more money had also been promised to him .
That ’s my prediction .
Of course , the truth of the matter is that KDE 4.2 ( trunk ) flat out rocks today .
Seriously .
I have never been more excited about the Linux desktop than I am right now .
And this , 2 + months out from our actual KDE 4.2 release .
I ’ve been running OpenSUSE 11 for a couple of months now , and thanks to the awesome nightly / weekly KDE 4.2 / trunk packages , I ’m thoroughly enjoying pretty - darned - bleeding - edge 4.2 / trunk packages , but with half the carbs , and I am loving what I ’m seeing !
Recent KMail improvements are awesome .
Plasma is getting more and more bullet - proof and gorgeous by the week .
Kwin just keeps getting more and more stable and purty .
Kdevelop4 and Kate are getting some SERIOUSLY cool enhancements and RAD - helping juju .
Even our lowly KPilot has been getting some bugzilla lovin ’ from yours truly lately , and I ’m about half - way through porting the old memofile conduit to our groovy base conduit syncing goodness .
Whereas a few months ago , I just could not use KDE4 as my main work environment ( gots ta make a living too , don’ tcha know ! ) , I have long - since switched and am thrilled with what we have right now .
( of course , BIG thanks to the Linux nVidia team for improving their X11 driver !!! )
I can just feel the momentum behind us , ca n’t you ?
If this were a corporation , right about now , you ’d expect to see some old dude get up in front of everybody , work himself into a frenzy , run around on stage ( “ developers , developers , developers ” ? ) , and try to get everybody motivated to keep pushing hard at making our software the most awesomest , bestest , most stablest thing you could ever want .
But we ’re not a corporation ( thank God ! ! ) .
And we do n’t have an old , sweaty , balding dude to put up on stage and try to whip everybody into being motivated ( also , thank God ! ) .
We just have us .
And that is the magic of Open Source .
It is up to us to keep our momentum going , to not give up , to keep pushing ourselves harder , to keep improving our software stack , to keep squashing bugs , to try to have the best desktop environment possible .
So keep up the awesome work , everybody .
You ’re doing it right !! =:)
Just days after publishing U.S. vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin 's personal email messages , the Wikileaks Web site has published data about members who signed up for a section of Fox Television host Bill O'Reilly 's Web site .
Hackers were able to obtain a list of Billoreilly .com premium members , including email addresses , site passwords and the city and state where they live .
Some of the information was published Friday on Wikileaks.com , which has been under fire from conservative commentators , including O'Reilly , for publishing Palin 's messages .
" Wikileaks has been informed the hack was a response to the pundit 's recent scurrilous attacks over the Sarah Palin 's email story -- including on Wikileaks and other members of the press , " Wikileaks said on its site .
" Hacktivists , thumbing their noses at the pundit , took control of O'Reilly 's main site , Billoreilly.com . "
Premium members pay US $ 49.95 per year to access special content on the Web site , including discussion boards .
Operators of Billoreilly.com could not be reached for comment Friday afternoon , and IDG News Service could not immediately confirm whether the list was legitimate .
A link to the full membership list has been published on a little - known political discussion Web site , which reported that rather than seizing control of O'Reilly 's site , hackers were able to get the information from an unencrypted Web page that did not require a login .
The list includes information about 205 people who signed into the O'Reilly site during the previous 72 - hour period .
Earlier this week , O'Reilly , host of the TV show " The O'Reilly Factor , " had accusedsites such as Wikileaks of " trafficking in stolen merchandise . "
Although the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Secret Service declined to comment on the Palin hack , Tennessee Democratic state assemblyman Mike Kernell said his son David has been identified on Internet blogs and chatrooms as a suspect , according to a report Friday in The Tennessean newspaper .
Mike Kernell did not respond to messages seeking comment Friday .
Posting to an online discussion group Wednesday , a hacker calling himself Rubico said he had accessed Palin's Yahoo account by using the site 's password reset feature and answering questions using publicly available information on Governor Palin .
Because many Internet users employ the same username and password for many sites , the Billoreilly .com information could be misused to gain access to other Web sites , but it could also undermine the integrity of the Billoreilly .com messageboards , which are accessible to premium members , according to Paul Ferguson , a researcher with antivirus vendor Trend Micro .
" People have the ability now to completely demonstrate that content on that Web site cannot be trusted , " he said .
Given the online animosity over Palin 's email hack , Ferguson said the O'Reilly attack could be the next step in a " hacktivist " war between liberals and conservatives .
" It 'll be interesting to see how this all shakes out , " he said .
George Harrison said it was too avant - garde .
Now Sir Paul says the time has come to release 1967's ' Carnival of Light '
For Beatles fans across the world it has gained near mythical status .
The 14 - minute improvised track called ' Carnival of Light ' was recorded in 1967 and played just once in public .
It was never released because three of the Fab Four thought it too adventurous .
The track , a jumble of shrieks and psychedelic effects , is said to be as far from the melodic ballads that made Sir Paul McCartney famous as it is possible to imagine .
But now McCartney has said that the public will have the chance to judge for themselves .
' It does exist , ' McCartney says on a BBC Radio 4 arts programme to be broadcast this week .
Talking to John Wilson , the presenter of Front Row , the former Beatle confirms that he still has a master tape of the work and says he suspects that ' the time has come for it to get its moment ' .
' I like it because it 's the Beatles free , going off piste , ' he adds .
In the 40 years since ' Carnival of Light ' was recorded by McCartney , Ringo Starr , George Harrison and John Lennon in the Abbey Road studios in London , its collection of disparate rhythms has become a kind of holy grail for Beatles obsessives .
The track was put together on 5 January 1967 , in between working on the vocals for the song ' Penny Lane ' .
Once released it should offer proof that the Fab Four , and McCartney in particular , were much more avant - garde in their tastes than many gave them credit for .
According to the few who heard the track on the one occasion the recording was played publicly , at a London music festival in 1967 , it features the sound of gargled water and strangled shouts from Lennon which vie with church organs and distorted guitar .
' We were set up in the studio and would just go in every day and record , ' McCartney tells Wilson .
' I said to the guys , this is a bit indulgent but would you mind giving me 10 minutes ?
I 've been asked to do this thing .
All I want you to do is just wander round all of the stuff and bang it , shout , play it .
It does n't need to make any sense .
Hit a drum , wander to the piano , hit a few notes ... and then we put a bit of echo on it .
It 's very free . '
McCartney had been commissioned to create a piece for an electronic music festival at the Roundhouse Theatre in north London by his friend Barry Miles .
The event , the Million Volt Light and Sound Rave , was organised by International Times , an underground newspaper .
Many in the audience had no idea they were listening to a new Beatles track .
Other performers included Delia Derbyshire whose work at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop included jointly creating the theme for Doctor Who .
McCartney , who this month releases his third experimental album of new work under the alias the Fireman , regards ' Carnival of Light ' as evidence of how musically adventurous he has always been .
For the three other Beatles the track was just an oddity .
George Harrison dismissed it as too weird .
But McCartney is hopeful it can now be released with the agreement of the group 's estate .
' It will help reaffirm McCartney 's claim to have been the most musically adventurous of all the Beatles , ' said Wilson this weekend .
' He told me he would love to release the track .
All he needs now is the blessing of Ringo Starr , Yoko Ono and George Harrison 's widow Olivia . '
The piece was inspired , McCartney says , by the works of composers John Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen .
In his book Complete Beatles Recording Sessions , author Mark Lewisohn - who was played the track in 1987 - describes ' distorted , hypnotic drum and organ sounds , a distorted lead guitar , the sound of a church organ , various effects ( water gargling was one ) and , perhaps most intimidating of all , Lennon and McCartney screaming and bawling random phrases including " Are you all right ? " and ' " Barcelona ! " . '
Beatles fans came close to hearing ' Carnival Of Light ' in 1996 when it was considered for inclusion in the exhaustive Anthology compilation .
' We were listening to everything we 'd every recorded , ' McCartney says .
' I said it would be great to put this on because it would show we were working with really avant - garde stuff ...
But it was vetoed .
The guys did n't like the idea , like " this is rubbish " . '
McCartney revealed that George Harrison disparaged sonic experimentation as ' avant - garde a clue ' .
Sir George Martin , the Beatles producer who oversaw the track , has described it as ' one of those weird things ' .
' It was a kind of uncomposed , free - for - all melange of sound that went on .
It was not considered worthy of issuing as a normal piece of Beatles music at the time and was put away . '
Coincidentally , McCartney played some of his Fireman compositions at the reopened Roundhouse venue last year during the Electric Proms .
' With the Fireman you 're in disguise , ' he told Observer Music Monthly .
His pseudonym may have been taken from the lyric of ' Penny Lane ' where a fireman ' rushes in from the pouring rain ' and could also be a nod to his father , Jim McCartney , a firewatcher on the Liverpool docks in the Second World War .
• John Wilson 's interview with Paul McCartney can be heard on Front Row , Radio 4 , on Thursday
· This article was amended on November 23 2008 .
The article above neglected to mention that The Beatles track ' Carnival of Light ' was first played publicly at the Million Volt Light and Sound Rave ( also known as the Festival of Light ) at the Roundhouse , north London , in January 1967 , an event organised by Binder , Edwards & Vaughan , who also commissioned the music .
Barry Miles and the International Times arranged the Technicolour Dream which took place some two months later at Alexandra Palace .

Guess what ?
We still need you to submit good articles about software you like !
One of the packages I manually install in every new installation is smartmontools .
I ’ve some expertise in managing computers and networks , and it is a fact that pirate hackers and software bugs are not the main cause of problems in small and medium installations .
Hardware is .
Thus , you have hardware that can fail , and Murphy says that if it can fail , it will .
The point is not to avoid hardware failures , which would be impossible , but to detect them early or even prevent them .
Particularly for hard disks , the tool in charge is smartctl from the package smartmontools .
IDE disks ( if they ’re not of the age of dinosaurs ) have an integrated self - testing tool called SMART which means “ Self - Monitoring , Analysis and Reporting Technology ” .
Modern SCSI disks have it too if they ’re SCSI 3 or newer .
It happens that inside the disk chipset there are routines to check parameters of disk health : spin- up time , number of read failures , temperature , life elapsed …
And all of those parameters are not only registered by the disk chipset , but they have designated security limits and both parameters and limits can be checked by software who access the disk using the appropriate I/O instructions .
And that software is smartctl , a piece of the smartmontools deb package .
Of course , since they access the disk in a raw way , you need to be root to use these commands .
smartctl can ask the disk for its smart identification :

As you can see , there are some attributes marked as “ Pre-fail ” .
If any of these attributes goes beyond its threshold , the disk is about to fail in hours , maybe minutes .
Even if there are more options to smartctl , the last ones I will comment here are - a and -t .
smartctl -t launches a disk test .
It needs a parameter indicating the type of the test , and in the longest case it can last for tens of minutes and will check the electrical and mechanical performance as well as the read performance of the disk , going through all its surface .
smartctl - a , in its turn , shows all available information about the disk , including self testing results .
Since tests will span minutes or tens of minutes , we can not see them happening .
All what we will get when launching tests is like :
# smartctl -t long / dev/sda smartctl version 5.38 [ i686-pc-linux - gnu ]
Copyright ( C ) 2002 - 8 Bruce Allen Home page is http://smartmontools.sourceforge.net/ === START OF OFFLINE IMMEDIATE AND SELF - TEST SECTION === Sending command : “ Execute SMART Extended self - test routine immediately in off - line mode ” .

Testing has begun .
Please wait 41 minutes for test to complete .
Test will complete after Mon May 12 05:44:03 2008
Use smartctl - X to abort test .
Here , we ’re being informed that ( maybe ) we will get a slightly lower performance on the disk for the next 41 minutes , since the test has started .
It is completely background , or better ‘ underground ’ , since it does not happen under the kernel control at all : everything is happening internally to the disk , and all what we can get is the result .
smartctl - a , in turn , show a very large amount of SMART information about the disk : almost all stored SMART information parsed for us .
It is usually better to use a more specific switch , see the man page for details .
Finally , I want to comment that there is a daemon in the smartmontools package , smartd , who can take care of doing tests for you .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - A U.S. utility group announced on Monday a plan to test adding solar thermal energy to natural gas and coal - fired power plants in a move designed to cut fuel costs and greenhouse gas emissions .
The Electric Power Research Institute said Dynegy Inc and NV Energy will host case studies of the technology at natural gas plants in Arizona and Nevada , respectively .
Both projects will add steam generated by a solar thermal field to a conventional natural gas - powered steam cycle , EPRI said .
Tests at coal - fired facilities will be announced around the beginning of next year .
Southern Company , Progress Energy Inc and Salt River Project are also providing funding for the projects .

( CNN ) -- President - elect Barack Obama 's top choice for secretary of homeland security is Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano , multiple Democratic sources close to the transition told CNN on condition of anonymity .
One source said he believed the final decision depends on the vetting of the Democratic governor , much like the selection of Eric Holder for attorney general .
Also , multiple Democratic sources say billionaire Chicago businesswoman Penny Pritzker is Obama 's choice for commerce secretary .
Pritzker ran Obama 's record - breaking fundraising effort , serving as the campaign 's finance chair .
The sources say she will accept the job , which would be formally offered after vetting is complete .
But whether the rigors of the Obama vetting process will present a challenge to a business person with no record in public office -- and presumably extensive financial holdings -- was unknown .

Obama met last week with Sen. Hillary Clinton to discuss the possibility of her serving as secretary of state .
The Obama team is also vetting her husband , former President Bill Clinton , who has made several concessions in moving the process along .
Sen .
Clinton 's response is expected this week .
Watch how Obama 's team wants to avoid ' distractions ' »
However , a Democratic official said Wednesday that Senate leadership is considering a new role for Sen.
Clinton should she decide to remain in the Senate .
Also Wednesday , three sources close to the transition said Obama has chosen former Sen .
Tom Daschle to be Secretary of Health and Human Services , and the former Senate majority leader has indicated he wants the job .
Watch how Obama 's Cabinet will have ties to lobbyists »
The sources said that Daschle negotiated that he will also serve as the White House health " czar , " or point person , so that he will report directly to the incoming president .
By wearing two hats , Daschle -- not White House staffers -- will be writing the health care plan that Obama submits to Congress next year .
The sources said the timing of the announcement has not been worked out , but Daschle is likely to join the Obama transition team as the lead adviser on health issues in the next few weeks .
Watch what the Daschle pick could mean »
An Obama transition official would not comment .
Daschle is currently billed as a " special public policy adviser " in the Washington office of the law firm Alston & Bird .
He is not a federally registered lobbyist , but his wife , Linda Daschle , is a registered lobbyist at the firm Baker Donelson , which has clients in health - related fields .
Critics question whether Obama 's top staff picks so far represent the " change " that he promised during the campaign .
iReport.com : Who would you choose for Obama 's cabinet ?
More than half of the people named to Obama 's transition or staff posts have ties to President Clinton 's administration .
In addition to Sen. Clinton and incoming White Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel , who is a former top aide to President Clinton , Eric Holder and Peter Orszag also have Clinton ties .
Holder , who is expected to be named attorney general , served as Clinton 's deputy attorney general .
Orszag , who will reportedly head the Office of Budget and Management , was Clinton 's special assistant at the National Economic Council and served on the Council of Economic Advisers .
The Clinton - heavy team has caused Republicans to question Obama 's call for change .
Watch analysts weigh in on Obama 's staff picks »
" I think several individuals are very frustrated to think that President - elect Obama may just cut and paste from some of the Democratic operatives from the Clinton administration and put them into his White House , " said Leslie Sanchez , a Republican strategist and CNN contributor .
Republicans are n't the only ones who want Obama to branch out .
Robert Kuttner , a liberal and author of " Obama 's Challenge , " says the president - elect should broaden his recruiting efforts .
" It 's not as if the only competent people who ever served in government or who are capable of serving in government are veterans of the Clinton administration , so he 's got to be careful how many Clintonistas he appoints to top level government posts , " Kuttner said .
Before Clinton , however , Democrats had not been in the White House since Jimmy Carter , and many of those in Carter 's administration are too old to serve again under Obama .
The Obama transition team said in a statement that they are dedicated to building a well - rounded administration .
" President - elect Obama is committed to putting together a competent team that is diverse in many ways , including experience .
Serving in high level positions whether in government , in the private sector or in public service is seen as a positive , " spokesman Nick Shapiro said .
CNN 's Gloria Borger , Jason Carrol , Ed Henry , Jamie McIntyre , John King and Jessica Yellin contributed to this report .

Labour MPs join opposition parties in attack on Home Secretary 's ' Orwellian ' plans
Jacqui Smith faces a parliamentary backlash over " Orwellian " plans to intercept details of email , internet , telephone and other data records of every person in Britain .
Labour MPs joined opposition parties in expressing doubts about plans announced by the Home Secretary which could lead to a vast database of information about Britons ' calls and internet habits .
They warned that MPs , emboldened by the Government 's decision to ditch plans to hold terrorist suspects for up to 42 days without charge , would not accept this extension of state power .
The scale of the Government 's ambitions to hold data on email , internet and phone use emerged as government sources made it clear they needed new powers to obtain details of social networking sites on the internet , video sites , web - based telephone calls and even online computer games .
Yesterday , Ms Smith said she would launch a consultation on the expansion of data and communications collection next year .
She insisted , " it is a reality to which government needs to respond " .
She warned : " If you want to maintain your ability to identify where the user of a mobile phone is , let 's say ... it may well be that the only alternative to collecting that data would be a massive expansion of surveillance . "
Ms Smith said there were " no plans for an enormous database " of the content of your emails , texts or your phone chats .
Instead officials are concentrating on capturing huge amounts of so - called " communications data " – background information about when and to whom electronic and phone messages are sent .
They argue such data is a vital element in 95 per cent of serious criminal prosecutions and has helped avert scores of threats to life and kidnaps .
Civil liberties campaigners have expressed horror at the plans .
Keith Vaz , chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee , warned : " Extreme caution needs to be taken .
The Government needs to ensure that information - gathering is targeted and wiped and not collected just because it 's possible . "
Labour left - winger John McDonnell called the proposals " Big Brother gone mad " , while Ian Gibson , Labour MP for Norwich North , added : " There is not a lot of confidence that we can hold on to data we collect already . "

In his first major interview since polling day , President - elect Barack Obama said last night that upon taking office he would close Guantanamo Bay and ban torture by the American military .
He also said it would be " a disaster " if the US car industry were to collapse in the midst of today 's economic crisis .
Mr Obama provided America with a glimpse of both the problems his administration will face and the bipartisan tone he intends to adopt once he takes office .
The President - elect , joined by his wife , Michelle , discussed his priorities and the impact of the election on his family .
His first priority , he said , was appointing a new national security team to ensure a smooth transition to power .
But the wide - ranging interview focused largely on the threats to the US economy .
" It 's my belief that we need to provide assistance to the auto industry , " Mr Obama told CBS 's 60 minutes , adding " But I think that it can't be a blank check . "

The Senate , which he resigned from yesterday , is expected to vote this week on emergency loans to the beleaguered car industry , despite stiff opposition from Republicans .
Mr Obama meets his defeated rival , John McCain , today for the first time since crossing swords in the debates that punctuated their occasionally ill - tempered election battle .
The meeting in Chicago is billed as an attempt to usher in a new era of bipartisanship , a frequent refrain of Mr Obama 's on the campaign trail .
Unlike Mr Obama 's other former rival , Hillary Clinton , who is among the top contenders for Secretary of State , Senator McCain is not being considered for a formal role in the administration .
Advisers say he will be asked for help on issues where they share common ground , including climate change , ethics reform , immigration and torture .
That bipartisan mood between the former rivals may be tested if Mr McCain opposes a taxpayer bailout of Detroit .
The new bill would allow some of the $ 700 bn ( £ 350 bn ) fund to bail out the financial services industry to be used to rescue the car industry .
Mr Obama said he wants the aid to ensure there is a sustainable car industry , " so that we are creating a bridge loan to somewhere as opposed to a bridge loan to nowhere .
And that 's , I think , what you have n't yet seen . "
On the broader economy he said " the challenges that we 're confronting are enormous , and they 're multiple .
And so there are times during the course of a given a day where you think , ' Where do I start in terms of moving – moving things forward ? '
" And part of this next two months is to really get a clear set of priorities , understanding we 're not going be able to do everything at once , making sure the team is in place , and moving forward in a very deliberate way and sending a clear signal to the American people that we 're going to be thinking about them and what they 're going through . "
Mr Obama published a farewell letter to newspapers in Illinois to accompany his formal resignation of his Senate seat .
He compared himself with Abraham Lincoln , " another son of Illinois " who had left for Washington , " a greater man who spoke to a nation far more divided " .
SAN DIEGO , Oct. 20 ( UPI ) -- Emergency response workers in San Diego are trying to pinpoint the cause of a mysterious muck that appears every morning near the Golden Hill Elementary School .
The 14 - foot - long patch of moisture has the distinct odor of sewage but no one has been able to determine its origin , The San Diego Union - Tribune reported Monday .

" This has been going on since last November or December , " says area resident Florence Davich .
" The smell is horrendous .
Sometimes I have to close my window . "
Dye tests of residents ' bathroom facilities have failed to pinpoint the cause of the muck , the newspaper said .
Neighbors say they are worried that if the seepage contains bacteria it could be hazardous to children walking to and from the school .
The Metropolitan Wastewater Department rechecked the area during the weekend and plans to report its findings , the Union - Tribune said .
When my husband and I were about to move to our new place , I told him I ’d like to get a cat , so we planned to adopt one .
We did n’t get that far , however , because as soon as the landlady unlocked the front door to let us in to our new place , a skinny little black cat scurried in and made herself at home .
She ’s been with us ever since .
Speaking of black cats , there still prevails a superstitious bias against dark - colored animals and they are often passed over for adoption at animal shelters .
Unless you have all - white furniture and the dark shedding fur would cause you major grief , consider bringing a black dog or cat home with you .
There are some other important and compassionate reasons to consider adopting a pet over buying from a store .
Puppy mills .
Most pet stores get their puppies from factory - style breeding facilities called puppy mills .
Puppy mills are high - volume breeding facilities where many dogs are kept in squalid , caged conditions until they ’re ready to sell .
They often have health and socialization problems .
Save a life , make a friend for life .
It ’s sad but true – space is limited in animal shelters and if that sweet little creature does n’t get adopted within a certain amount of time , it will have to be euthanized .
There are some no -kill shelters , but they are in the minority .
Save money .
It costs much less to adopt from a shelter than to buy from a pet store .
What you pay to the shelter generally includes vaccination , de-worming and spay / neuter services .
You ’ll also get some guidance and advice for the care of your new pet !
AKC papers do n’t guarantee health .
Purebred papers from the American Kennel Club guarantee only the purity the breed – nothing more .
Even if a puppy is purebred , it might have hereditary health problems .
If you are looking for an AKC - certified pet , look beyond the anonymity of the pet store or the internet and visit a reputable breeder in person to find out more about the puppy ’s parentage and living conditions .
These days there are rescue organizations for nearly every breed , so it ’s not necessary to adopt a mutt if you want to rescue an animal .
You can find purebreds at a shelter .
If you ’ve got your heart set on a particular breed , give animal shelters a chance ; purebreds show up there all the time .
Good karma .
Many years ago , our family cat went missing and although my mom scoured the local shelters for him , he was never found .
In the meantime , however , she came across a scrawny little ball of fluff that caught her eye and tugged at her heart .
She brought him home , took care of him , and now he ’s the biggest , fluffiest Maine Coon you ’ll ever see .
He and my mom are inseparable .
She saved his life and he ’ll never forget it .
Socialization .
A pet store animal has probably never been in a house before , whereas a shelter animal most likely has .
Most shelters screen for good behavior and temperament and will be honest with you about the animal ’s personality and needs , whereas a pet store only wants to make a profit .
Most shelter animals have been left behind because of a cross-country move , a new baby , or expense .
These animals have likely been housebroken and know how to manage their way in the world of humans .
They ’ll certainly be happy to have a new home .
Do n’t support animal over - population .
There are already so many domestic animals in this world that need a home .
Pet shops and puppy mills support over - breeding of these animals for profit .
It ’s estimated that 6 to 8 million pets are euthanized every year !
Rescue a spayed or neutered pet instead and give it the loving home it deserves .
Shelters offer a huge selection of animals .
Many shelters rescue more than just dogs or cats .
Birds , horses , guinea pigs , hamsters , reptiles , farm animals and all kinds of other critters may be your ideal companion , too .

( Photo courtesy of Gary Strobel . )
( PhysOrg.com ) --
A unique fungus that makes diesel compounds has been discovered living in trees in the rainforest , according to a paper published in the November issue of Microbiology .
The fungus is potentially a totally new source of green energy and scientists are now working to develop its fuel producing potential .
" This is the only organism that has ever been shown to produce such an important combination of fuel substances , " said Professor Gary Strobel from Montana State University .
" The fungus can even make these diesel compounds from cellulose , which would make it a better source of biofuel than anything we use at the moment . "
The fungus , which has been named Gliocladium roseum , produces a number of different molecules made of hydrogen and carbon that are found in diesel .
Because of this , the fuel it produces is called " myco- diesel " .
" Gliocladium roseum lives inside the Ulmo tree in the Patagonian rainforest .
We were trying to discover totally novel fungi in this tree by exposing its tissues to the volatile antibiotics of the fungus Muscodor albus .
Quite unexpectedly , G. roseum grew in the presence of these gases when almost all other fungi were killed .
It was also making volatile antibiotics .
Then when we examined the gas composition of G. roseum , we were totally surprised to learn that it was making a plethora of hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon derivatives .
The results were totally unexpected and very exciting and almost every hair on my arms stood on end ! "
Many microbes produce hydrocarbons .
Fungi that live in wood seem to make a range of potentially explosive compounds .
In the rainforest , G. roseum produces lots of long chain hydrocarbons and other biological molecules .
When the researchers grew it in the lab , it produced fuel that is even more similar to the diesel we put in our cars .
" When crops are used to make biofuel they have to be processed before they can be turned into useful compounds by microbes , " said Professor Strobel .
" G. roseum can make myco - diesel directly from cellulose , the main compound found in plants and paper .
This means if the fungus was used to make fuel , a step in the production process could be skipped . "
Cellulose , lignin and hemicellulose make up the cell walls in plants .
Lignin is the glue that holds the cellulose fibres together and makes the plant stand up .
These compounds form the part of the plant that most animals cannot digest .
They makes up non-foodstuffs like stalks , sawdust and woodchip .
Nearly 430 million tonnes of plant waste are produced from just farmland every year ; a huge amount to recycle .
In current biofuel production , this waste is treated with enzymes called cellulases that turn the cellulose into sugar .
Microbes then ferment this sugar into ethanol that can be used as a fuel .
" We were very excited to discover that G. roseum can digest cellulose .
Although the fungus makes less myco - diesel when it feeds on cellulose compared to sugars , new developments in fermentation technology and genetic manipulation could help improve the yield , " said Professor Strobel .
" In fact , the genes of the fungus are just as useful as the fungus itself in the development of new biofuels . "
" The discovery also questions our knowledge of the way fossil fuels are made .
The accepted theory is that crude oil , which is used to make diesel , is formed from the remains of dead plants and animals that have been exposed to heat and pressure for millions of years , " said Professor Strobel .
" If fungi like this are producing myco - diesel all over the rainforest , they may have contributed to the formation of fossil fuels . "

We already know most of what there is to know about USB 3.0 — officially dubbed SuperSpeed USB — but today it 's officially set in stone .
To recap , with transfer speeds of 4.8 Gbps , it 'll dump a 25GB HD file in about 70 seconds , and the architecture has been beefed up with extra data lanes to make for more sustained , rather than bursty transfer speeds , making it better for camcorders and the like .
Even though it delivers more power than USB 2.0 to charge gadgets faster ( and it'll revive a completely dead one too ) , its new polling architecture makes it more efficient .

The one bad bit of news is that your old USB cables wo n't deliver SuperSpeeds — you 'll have to have USB 3.0 gear from end - to - end to get the ridiculous transfer rates because the cables have extra pins for data , though it is all backward compatible .
On the cable front you 've got three plugs : Standard A ( which looks like the one you know and love ) , standard B ( the square one ) , mini B ( which looks like a bizarre double - headed monster ) and micro .
We should start seeing the first USB 3.0 - equipped gadgets sometime in 2010 , though mayyyybe by the end of 2009 if we 're lucky .

Cancer researchers have known for years that it was possible in rare cases for some cancers to go away on their own .
There were occasional instances of melanomas and kidney cancers that just vanished .
And neuroblastoma , a very rare childhood tumor , can go away without treatment .
But these were mostly seen as oddities  an unusual pediatric cancer that might not bear on common cancers of adults , a smattering of case reports of spontaneous cures .
And since almost every cancer that is detected is treated , it seemed impossible even to ask what would happen if cancers were left alone .
Now , though , researchers say they have found a situation in Norway that has let them ask that question about breast cancer .
And their new study , to be published Tuesday in The Archives of Internal Medicine , suggests that even invasive cancers may sometimes go away without treatment and in larger numbers than anyone ever believed .
At the moment , the finding has no practical applications because no one knows whether a detected cancer will disappear or continue to spread or kill .

Is there a biological precursor to belief in the supernatural ?
The belief in God is perhaps one of the most basic beliefs we as humans hold to .
But one has to consider this carefully .
If you were born in Baghdad , and your parents were Islamic , you have to consider the possibility that you would have believed in Allah .
Were you born in Tel Aviv , chances are you would have believed in the Hebrew God , but would have denied Jesus as your saviour .
Were you born in the jungles of Borneo and were never exposed to any of the " modern " gods , you probably would have believed what your parents believed , even if that might have been the godliness of a piece of wood .
There are specific reasons why we feel this way .
When we are infants , and our brains are totally " plastic " , meaning it is eager to accept new information , we are exposed to certain constant presences in our lives .
An infant does not see itself as separate from its mother during those first few months .
It has no concept of " self " and has not yet developed a view of the world , simply because it has not been able to " view " this world .
It 's only reference to it 's existence is the " oneness " that it perceives with it 's mother , or caregiver .
Imagine this .
Many times a day , a hundred times a week , a thousand times a month , and many thousands of times a year , that baby cries because it seeks comfort , warmth , food and closeness .
Every time it cries , it 's caregiver comes , without faltering , and offers what the child seeks .
This process is called the biological event , and it is one of the most potent manifestations of a " supreme " being in our early lives .
Our mothers were always there when we needed them .
However , during this period , the child 's brain is developing , forming neural connections at a massive rate .
Everything the child perceives and experiences during this period gets absorbed into this newly forming neural network , but the things that are repeated obviously make a much stronger impression on the child 's brain .
One such thing is , yip , you guessed it ... the mother always being there to care for the child .
This presence is " hard - wired " into the child 's brain in this manner .
But there is more .
As the child matures , it goes through a stage where it attempts to separate itself from the caregiver who has always been there to take care of it .
This is a difficult period for this child , because it feels the urge to separate , and yet it still needs the safety and security offered by the caregiver .
This is also the point where the adults in this child 's life start to teach it about God 's love and mercy , how he will care for you and how Jesus loves you .
Effectively , we replace the concept of caregiver , previously the mother , with the concept of God taking on the responsibility of caring for the child .
In this way , the child continues to feel safe and cared for , even during the periods that it is , due to educational and other societal influences , are separated from the mother .
This desire for someone to look over us is created at a very early stage in our lives .
The power of this desire can be ascribed to the instinct of survival .
We are taught , by religious parents or others , that we possess souls , and that our souls will survive death and we will move on to some other form of existence and consciousness .
The details of this is always and will always be very sketchy and poorly defined , simply because no - one really knows , do they ?
Yet our parents , whom we trust implicitly , teach us these things as gospel truths , and we find within ourselves a sense of comfort with which we are at ease with .
Fear has been stilled , and even if our mothers are not there to provide food and shelter , we believe that God in his love will provide .
It is also the remnants of this fact that causes adults to seek out God and Jesus when they are experiencing difficult times .
Like the infant crying for food , we cry ( pray ) for deliverance from our hardships .
We simply " believe " that God will hear our prayers , because he is always there , and will always be , in the same way that we , as infants , simply " knew " that our mothers will always be there to care for us .

( AP )  Princeton economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman won the Nobel economics prize on Monday for his analysis of how economies of scale can affect trade patterns and the location of economic activity .
Krugman was the lone of winner of the award with $ 1.4 million in Swedish kronor , and he was the latest in a string of American researchers to be honored .
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences praised Krugman for formulating a new theory to answer questions about free trade .
" What are the effects of free trade and globalization ?
What are the driving forces behind worldwide urbanization ?
Paul Krugman has formulated a new theory to answer these questions , " the academy said in its citation .
" He has thereby integrated the previously disparate research fields of international trade and economic geography , " it said .
The award , known as the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences , is the last of the six Nobel prizes announced this year and is not one of the original Nobels .
It was created in 1968 by the Swedish central bank in Nobel 's memory .
In addition to his work as an economist at Princeton University in New Jersey , where he has been since 2000 , Krugman also writes about politics and inequality in the United States and other topics for The New York Times .
Commenting on the global economic meltdown , he told a news conference in Stockholm by telephone from the United States that some of his research was linked to currency crises and related issues .
" This is terrifying , " he said , comparing it to the financial crisis that gripped Asia in the 1990s .
He said winning the Nobel award wo n't change his approach to research and writing .
" The prize will enhance visibility , " he said , " but I hope it does not lead me into going to a lot of purely celebratory events , aside from the Nobel presentation itself . "
The citation said Krugman 's approach is based on the premise that many goods and services can be produced at less cost in long series , a concept known as economies of scale .
His research showed the effects of that on trade patterns and on the location of economic activity .

Even as Israel 's F16s were aiming their first deadly salvoes at Hamas positions in the Gaza Strip on Saturday , questions were being asked at home and abroad , about what this " shock and awe " campaign was intended to achieve - and what Israel 's exit strategy would be .
Preparations
Unlike the confused and improvised Israeli response as the war against Hizbullah in Lebanon unfolded in 2006 , Operation Cast Lead appears to have been carefully prepared over a long period .
Israeli media reports , by usually well - informed correspondents and analysts , alluded yesterday to six months of intelligence - gathering to pinpoint Hamas targets including bases , weapon silos , training camps and the homes of senior officials .
The cabinet spent five hours discussing the plan in detail on December 19 and left the timing up to Ehud Olmert , the caretaker prime minister , and his defence minister Ehud Barak .
Preparations involved disinformation and deception which kept Israel 's media in the dark .
According to Ha'aretz , that also lulled Hamas into a sense of false security and allowed the initial aerial onslaught to achieve tactical surprise - and kill many of the 290 victims counted so far .
Friday 's decision to allow food , fuel and humanitarian supplies into besieged Gaza - ostensibly a gesture in the face of international pressure to relieve the ongoing blockade - was part of this .
So was Thursday 's visit to Cairo by Tzipi Livni , Israel 's foreign minister , to brief Egyptian officials .
The final decision was reportedly made on Friday morning .
Why now ?
Barak said yesterday the timing of the operation was dictated by Israel 's patience simply " having running out " in the face of renewed rocket and mortar attacks from Gaza into Israel when the shaky six - month ceasefire expired 10 days ago .
" Any other sovereign nation would do the same , " is the official Israeli refrain .
Amid the storm of international criticism of Israel 's hugely disproportionate response , it is easy to overlook the domestic pressure faced by the Israeli government over its handling of " Hamastan " .
Homemade Qassam rockets and mortars rarely kill but they do terrify and have undermined Israel 's deterrent power as well as keeping 250,000 residents of the south of the country in permanent danger .
But the context now is February 's Israeli elections .
The contest that matters is between Livni 's centrist Kadima party and the rightwing Likud under Binyamin Netanyahu , who talks only of " economic peace " with the Palestinians and does not want an independent Palestinian state , as Livni does .
Opinion polls show that it pays to talk tough : Livni 's standing has improved in recent days .
The US political timetable may be as significant .
The three weeks before Barack Obama 's inauguration were Israel 's last chance to assume automatic diplomatic support from Washington , as it got from George Bush over both West Bank settlements and the Lebanon war .
It is hard to imagine an Israeli government testing Obama , whom it views with foreboding because of a sense he has more sympathy for the Palestinians , with a crisis of these dimensions during his first days or weeks in office .
Game plan
Livni and other Israeli officials have spoken openly of wishing to topple Hamas since the Islamist movement took over from the western - backed , Fatah - dominated Palestinian Authority ( PA ) in June 2007 .
But this may be something less ambitious .
" The realistic objective of any military operation is not the ousting of Hamas , but rather ... undermining its military effectiveness and weakening its rule , " is the view of Yediot Aharonot analyst Alex Fishman .
Ron Ben - Yishai , another military expert , called it an attempt to " change the rules of the game . "
This appears to be a case of " asymmetric warfare " in which the weaker party commands disproportionate force - by repeatedly firing crude rockets or using suicide bombers - and the more powerful one responds with a massive , disproportionate blow .
" The objective of an Israeli military operation in Gaza must be to undermine Hamas ' desire to keep fighting , and at that point agree on a ceasefire , " said Fishman .
Israel is well - informed about what happens in Gaza .
Its premise is that Hamas is unpopular and that by targeting its personnel it can encourage that trend .
But not all the victims are from Hamas .
Some are civilians and there are security officers who belong to Fatah .
And nor , crucially , has the PA been able to deliver a peace agreement with Israel , or even end its settlement activity .
Most significantly , the scale of the bloodshed - ranking in Palestinian history alongside the 1948 Deir Yassin killings or the Sabra and Shatila massacres ( by Israel 's Christian Lebanese allies ) in 1982 means renewed motives for hatred and revenge .
What next ?
Israel said yesterday that it is calling up thousands of reservists .
There can be little doubt that it could reoccupy and hold the coastal strip - as it did from 1967 to 2005 - but tanks and infantry would be vulnerable in guerrilla warfare against lightly - armed but highly - motivated Hamas or Islamic Jihad fighters .
Civilian casualties would grow with international pressure .
The only reason to deploy ground forces would be to achieve something air power could not - searching for rocket production and storage facilities that have not yet been identified .
Israeli commentators suggest the army has no appetite for a ground war , making comparisons with Lebanon in 2006 , and pointing to the impending elections .
Another key question for the military must be the fate of Gilad Shalit , the Israeli corporal held in Gaza since he was captured in 2006 .
It is hard to see negotiations on his release , and of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel , continuing in these circumstances .
Repercussions
The Gaza offensive has already fuelled anti-Israeli and anti-American feeling across the Arab world .
Mahmoud Abbas , the Palestinian president , faces demands for an end to any talks with Israel .
Hamas , calling for a " third intifada , " accused Egypt and Jordan of colluding with the Gaza plan .
If there is a silver lining in this dark cloud it is to have shown that working to achieve a lasting peace in the Middle East is still a desperately urgent task .
Lawmaker Accused of Fannie Mae Conflict of Interest
Friday , October 03 , 2008

WASHINGTON —
So did Frank ’s partner , a Fannie Mae executive at the forefront of the agency ’s push to relax lending restrictions .
Now that Fannie Mae is at the epicenter of a financial meltdown that threatens the U.S. economy , some are raising new questions about Frank 's relationship with Herb Moses , who was Fannie ’s assistant director for product initiatives .
Moses worked at the government - sponsored enterprise from 1991 to 1998 , while Frank was on the House Banking Committee , which had jurisdiction over Fannie .
Both Frank and Moses assured the Wall Street Journal in 1992 that they took pains to avoid any conflicts of interest .
Critics , however , remain skeptical .
" It ’s absolutely a conflict , " said Dan Gainor , vice president of the Business & Media Institute .
" He was voting on Fannie Mae at a time when he was involved with a Fannie Mae executive .
How is that not germane ?
" If this had been his ex-wife and he was Republican , I would bet every penny I have - or at least what ’s not in the stock market - that this would be considered germane , " added Gainor , a T. Boone Pickens Fellow .
" But everybody wants to avoid it because he ’s gay .
It ’s the quintessential double standard . "
A top GOP House aide agreed .
" C’mon , he writes housing and banking laws and his boyfriend is a top exec at a firm that stands to gain from those laws ? " the aide told FOX News .
" No media ever takes note ?
Imagine what would happen if Frank ’s political affiliation was R instead of D? Imagine what the media would say if [ GOP former ] Chairman [ Mike ]
Oxley ’s wife or [ GOP presidential nominee John ]
McCain ’s wife was a top exec at Fannie for a decade while they wrote the nation ’s housing and banking laws . "
Frank ’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment .
Frank met Moses in 1987 , the same year he became the first openly gay member of Congress .
" I am the only member of the congressional gay spouse caucus , " Moses wrote in the Washington Post in 1991 .
" On Capitol Hill , Barney always introduces me as his lover . "
The two lived together in a Washington home until they broke up in 1998 , a few months after Moses ended his seven - year tenure at Fannie Mae , where he was the assistant director of product initiatives .
According to National Mortgage News , Moses " helped develop many of Fannie Mae ’s affordable housing and home improvement lending programs . "
Critics say such programs led to the mortgage meltdown that prompted last month ’s government takeover of Fannie Mae and its financial cousin , Freddie Mac .
The giant firms are blamed for spreading bad mortgages throughout the private financial sector .
Although Frank now blames Republicans for the failure of Fannie and Freddie , he spent years blocking GOP lawmakers from imposing tougher regulations on the mortgage giants .
In 1991 , the year Moses was hired by Fannie , the Boston Globe reported that Frank pushed the agency to loosen regulations on mortgages for two - and three - family homes , even though they were defaulting at twice and five times the rate of single homes , respectively .
Three years later , President Clinton ’s Department of Housing and Urban Development tried to impose a new regulation on Fannie , but was thwarted by Frank .
Clinton now blames such Democrats for planting the seeds of today ’s economic crisis .
" I think the responsibility that the Democrats have may rest more in resisting any efforts by Republicans in the Congress or by me when I was president , to put some standards and tighten up a little on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , " Clinton said recently .

At Microsoft 's recent Professional Developers Conference ( PDC ) in Los Angeles , the air crackled with anticipation .
On the heels of Vista , arguably the biggest disaster in Microsoft 's history , Windows 7 was about to be revealed .
A blast of fanfare , and Chief Software Architect Ray Ozzie took the stage to pull the wraps off the new desktop operating system -- which would deliver better performance , an improved user experience , and some nifty media - sharing features .
The crowd salivated at the chance to play with Microsoft 's latest and greatest .
Note :
For a look at some of PC World 's Windows 7 coverage to date , see :
As Windows desktop blogger for InfoWorld ( a sister publication of PC World ) , I was drooling , too .
When I got my hands on the Windows 7 " pre-beta , " distributed right there at the show , I immediately installed it and began running tests .
For PC
World , I did an analysis of the changes ( or lack of them ) that consumers might see .
For a deeper dive into my Windows 7 tests , check out Windows 7 unmasked on the InfoWorld site .
The more I dug into Windows 7 , the more I became convinced that I was dealing with an OS that was a slightly tweaked , nearly baked revision of Windows Vista .
If any pre-beta software ever called for a close look and benchmark testing , Windows 7 was it .
I rolled up my sleeves and dove in .
I started by examining Windows 7's innards -- the kernel and other low - level structures -- then slowly worked my way out to subsystem behavior and application runtime characteristics .
Because one of the focal points of Microsoft 's keynote presentation was improved performance , I looked for signs that Windows 7 would be faster , more responsive , and less resource - intensive than the bloated Windows Vista .
Bottom line :
So far , Windows 7 looks , behaves , and performs almost exactly like Windows Vista .
And it breaks all sorts of things that used to work just fine under Vista .
In other words , Microsoft 's follow - up to its most unpopular OS release since Windows
Me threatens to deliver zero measurable performance benefits while introducing new and potentially crippling compatibility issues .

network
Web site .
You can also test your current PC for Windows 7 compatibility now , and then monitor Windows 7 performance on your own system when it enters public beta later this year , using InfoWorld 's free Windows Sentinel tool .
The View From Inside
Here 's what I found in the heart of the OS .
Using a combination of the Windows Performance Monitor utility and some reference data I 'd gathered from Windows Vista and XP , I began comparing the runtime structure and composition of various OS processes and services .
First up was the Windows 7 kernel - - aka the System process .
When comparing Windows versions , it 's always good to start with the kernel because this is where the most fundamental changes take place .
For example , when Microsoft went from Windows 2000 to Windows XP , the System process gained 21 execution threads in its default configuration .
Likewise , when Microsoft introduced Windows Vista , the kernel gained 39 execution threads .
[ What 's so wrong with Vista , anyway ?
See " Death match : Windows Vista versus XP . " ]
In fact , the kernel in each major new version of the Windows OS has spawned a different , typically higher number of threads .
So when I examined Windows 7 and found a nearly identical thread count ( 97 to 100 ) for the System process , I knew right away that I was dealing with a minor point - type of release , as opposed to a major update or rewrite .

TPM Reader AM ’s lament …

Call it a sneak preview of the recount .
Twenty men and women settled in along tables at the Ramsey County elections office first thing Monday morning and began plowing through more than 7,700 ballots cast last Tuesday in the U.S. Senate race .
After nearly three hours of counting , Norm Coleman had lost exactly one net vote in five of the county 's precincts .
Al Franken had gained exactly one .
This is n't a recount , but it sure looks like one .
" You take the ballots out , you count them by hand and you report the results -- exactly what we 'll be doing with the [ recount ] , " said Joe Mansky , the county elections director in the midst of overseeing what is known as a " postelection audit , " currently underway in all 87 Minnesota counties .
This audit process functionally has nothing to do with the looming statewide recount .
It is mandated by a four - year - old state law and is intended to check the accuracy of Minnesota 's optical scan voting machines .
But with the massive , 2.9 million - vote recount of the U.S. Senate race set to begin next week , these audits provide something of a curtain - raiser of just how that process will unfold .
Every vote is counted , by hand , with only election judges and elections staffers touching them .
The whole process is open to the public , so it occurs under the watchful eyes of good - government volunteers and operatives for the campaigns .
" I 'm just watching like everyone else , " said John Stiles , a DFL spokesman who had staked out one corner of the conference room .
" It all seems pretty straightforward to me . "
Coleman volunteer John Nygaard agreed .
" It 's very transparent -- I 'm impressed , " he said midway through the morning .
" I did n't realize how much work went into this . "
Practice round
After the 2006 election , the first time the audit was conducted , it reviewed votes in about 5 percent of the state 's 4,123 precincts .
Among 94,073 votes cast in the U.S. Senate race in those precincts , the audit found 53 discrepancies , an error rate of .00056 .

TALK about a dilemma : next year has been labelled the International Year of Astronomy because it marks the 400th anniversary of Galileo ’s first use of the telescope .
Unfortunately , as it is the 200th anniversary of Darwin ’s birth , 2009 has also been appropriated as Darwin Year .
Both anniversaries have good claims on our attention , so at New Scientist we find ourselves unable to decide which year matters most .
It ’s an unfair question , of course .
Galileo and Darwin worked in different fields , in different eras and under different cultural pressures .
But never ones to duck …
National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) scientists have identified a protein that plays matchmaker between two key types of white blood cells , T and B cells , enabling them to interact in a way that is crucial to establishing long - lasting immunity after an infection .
Their finding may also explain why some individuals who have a genetic defect that prevents them from making this protein — called SAP — suffer from lethal infections with a common virus that otherwise is rarely fatal ( Epstein - Barr virus ) , while others with this genetic defect have problems with B - cell lymphomas .
The new study was a collaboration between the laboratories of NIH scientists Ronald Germain , M.D. , Ph.D. , at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) , and Pamela Schwartzberg , M.D. , Ph.D. , at the National Human Genome Research Institute ( NHGRI ) .
Their findings appear in the Oct. 9 issue of Nature .
When a B cell encounters a virus or other foreign agent , the B cell engulfs the virus and parts of it , called antigens , become displayed on the surface of the B cell .
These antigens signal to T cells , which have specialized receptors that can bind to antigens on the B cells .
Thus coupled , the T cells deliver signals that help B cells multiply and produce antibodies that will eventually destroy the offending virus .
A critical tissue structure that facilitates these events is the germinal center , which normally forms after an infection within the lymph nodes , organs in which immune cells gather to carry out their functions .
" Understanding how B and T cells interact in the lymph nodes is crucial , because the germinal centers are the sites where long - lasting immunity begins , " says NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci , M.D. " If we can unravel how the body naturally builds defenses against repeat infections , it will aid us in developing more effective vaccines . "
In some individuals , B cells do not make antibodies in response to infections and immunizations .
These individuals include those with a genetic disease called X - linked lymphoproliferative disease ( XLP ) , a rare disorder affecting approximately one in one million male children .
Those affected with XLP lack SAP protein and do not have germinal centers .
As a result , they have an impaired immune response to certain infections , which can prove fatal .
According to Dr. Germain , " For years , researchers tried to understand what the relationship was between the absence of germinal centers and the missing SAP protein in XLP patients by studying mouse models of the human disease , but we could not identify why the absence of SAP caused these problems . "
The work by Hai Qi , M.D. , Ph.D. , and Jennifer Cannons , Ph.D. , in the laboratories of Drs. Germain and Schwartzberg , respectively , has now solved an important piece of this puzzle .
Using a special microscopy technique that allows direct visualization of immune cell actions in living mice , they observed how T and B cells and another type of white blood cell , the dendritic cell , interact dynamically within mouse lymph nodes .
The research team found that T cells lacking SAP do not bind strongly to B cells carrying antigens the T cells otherwise could recognize .
" The relationship between B and T cells normally is like a pair of dancers , " says Dr. Qi , the lead author .
" The B cell leads and the T cell follows in a long tango that eventually goes into the germinal center . "
Without SAP , however , it is as if the arms of the T - cell receptor cannot firmly grasp the antigenic arms of the B cell , and thus the tango between the two immune cells does not last .
The inability of SAP - negative T cells to adhere to B cells prevents B cells from receiving crucial signals they need to become antibody - secreting cells and to generate functional germinal centers .
Another striking finding was that that SAP - negative T cells can bind to dendritic cells without any problems , although dendritic cells have antigenic arms similar to those of B cells .
Dr. Cannons explains , " Some cell receptors act like Velcro , allowing two different cells to stick together .
We think that different cells use different receptor signals to stick together .
A signal that does not affect the sticking between two cell types may well prevent another two cell types from interacting . "
These findings not only help explain the basis for the immunodeficiency disease known as XLP , but also provide important new insights into the exquisitely specific communications between different types of immune cells .
According to Dr. Schwartzberg , " This work provides a great example of the power of combining mouse models of human diseases with live imaging microscopy to uncover secrets of the immune system and help discover new ways to combat disease . "
" This work nicely demonstrates both the value of interdisciplinary collaboration and that exploring relatively rare genetic diseases can offer important insights into biological processes that are important to the health of all of us , " says Alan E. Guttmacher , M.D. , acting director , NHGRI .

Leave it to the French to figure out how to make men gallant .
In BLONDES I describe a touching French experiment in which a strapping young man , code - named Antoine , successfully picks up women on the street and at dance clubs .
That study was led by French psychologist Nicolas Gurguen , and now Dr Gurguen and his colleagues have made another fun discovery .
In the current study , 253 male and female participants were approached on the street by researchers recruited by Gurguen .
Approximately half were asked to think about a piece of music they love .
The others were asked to remember “ love episodes ” — the most romantic moments in their lives : their first kiss , the blissful initial months of a love affair , the cherished times in their current relationships , etc .
In psychological parlance , these latter participants were “ primed ” to think of love .
After being released , the participants continued walking , and were later stopped , seemingly randomly , by a female stranger asking for money to buy a bus ticket .
The stranger , of course , was complicit in the study .
The results ?
Men who had been primed to think of love were three times more likely to help out a “ damsel in distress ” than men who were primed to think about their favorite music .
Only 13 percent of the music - primed men gave money compared to 38 percent of the love - primed guys .
Interestingly , love priming did n’t have any effect on women ’s generosity , which leads the researchers to speculate that cultural and evolutionary impulses trigger generosity in men alone .
Why ?
For one , women value wealth and chivalry in men more than men do in women , so men in love may be unconsciously more generous than women in love — and with any woman , not just their beloved .
( There ’s also a neurological basis here .
As detailed in BLONDES , lust and love activate and deactivate various regions of the brain . )
Of course , it would be more interesting to see the study conducted with a variety of stangers in need — old ladies , young men , people of different races , and so on .
In any case , one lesson from the French study is that it behooves charities and advertisers to induce feelings of love in men .
Open men ’s hearts and their wallets follow suit — at least for a few minutes .
Of course , Frenchwomen have known this all along .
The service is a shared high - power EV - DO Rev. A connection , at 3.6 M bps downstream and 1.8 M bps upstream .
By April , 100 % of Virgin America 's flights will have GoGo service .
Dayumn !
All GoGo service is $ 10 for short flights ( under 3 hours ) and $ 13 for longer flights ( over 3 hours ) .
So far I 've been getting about 1 M bps down , and 200 Kbps up -- pretty good considering that this is about as pinned as the system is going to get .
There are only about 150 people on it right now , you know ?
Latency is between 200 - 500 ms , sometimes higher .
Reasonable latency , though .
The system uses 802.11a/b/g , although it's an open AP ( i.e. no encryption ) .
Speaking of which , GoGo claims they 'll support VPN , so expect that to work .
SSH is iffy though -- it worked for us , but they do n't really want people SSH tunneling ( especially to do stuff like VoIP ) .
Aircell intends to block voice and video chat to keep things less obnoxious for travelers .
It 's working in flight though -- people are doing iChat sessions .
But part of this inaugural flight will have live YouTube streaming , so one should expect to have this cut off later .
BitTorrent works !
It 's not crazy fast , but I 'm peering with about 8 nodes .
I would n't expect this to work when the service launches .
GoGo has a built - in traffic shaper that keeps an eye out for those using more traffic than others .
If you 're consuming too much , it 'll scale you back ( although no one has a hard cap ) .
If you 're the only one on GoGo ( say , on a red - eye at 4 am ) then you can go crazy , you wo n't be scaled back .
Still , I 'm sitting next to my old pal Brian Lam from Giz , and I 'd wager the two of us are somehow taking up about 80 % of the plane 's bandwidth .
Virgin America is n't filtering content , so feel free to cast a glance over your shoulder and engage your browser 's private mode .
So I took a little a break from working on gdgt to get on Virgin America 's inaugural Aircell GoGo WiFi party flight , posting this at altitude .
If you have n't already caught one of the early Aircell flights on Delta , American , or Air Canada , their now - active GoGo service provides in - flight internet .
So far , as far as party planes go , this one has n't been too raucous -- probably because everyone 's been geeking out on their laptops .
Quick facts :
Any thing else you want to know ?
( h/t Silent Patriot )
Oh , it 's so nice to see some of the straight - talkin ' , ready - to - lead , he - gets - it - because - he - was - a - POW stylings of former presidential candidate John McCain , is n't it ?
The strongest assessment and responsibility assigned for the Torture Presidency was co-authored by Our Man McCain , dismissing completely the White House alibi that Abu Ghraib atrocities were committed by a few " bad apples " .
The abuse of detainees in U.S. custody cannot simply be attributed to the actions of ‘ a few bad apples ’ acting on their own .
The fact is that senior officials in the United States government solicited information on how to use aggressive techniques , redefined the law to create the appearance of their legality , and authorized their use against detainees .[..]
The administration ’s policies concerning [ torture ] and the resulting controversies damaged our ability to collect accurate intelligence that could save lives , strengthened the hand of our enemies , and compromised our moral authority .
You read that right .
John McCain and Carl Levin said in no uncertain terms that the policy to torture prisoners was conceived in the highest offices of the administration and have hurt this country both in intelligence gathering , but also more critically , national security .
But hold those public servants accountable ?
Hey now , that 's asking too much of ol ' Johnnie .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Some look at that and say , because of that , there should be a special prosecutor looking into all the crimes that were committed , and no one should be exempted from that .
MCCAIN : Well , look , that 's not my job .
If overwhelming evidence indicates that , that 's fine .
But the point is , I thought , and Senator Levin did , that we should carry out our responsibilities in the Senate Armed Services Committee and do a thorough and complete investigation .
I 'm not that interested in looking back .
What I am interested in and committed to is making sure we do n't do it again .
" It 's not my job " ?!?!?!?!
Who the hell 's job is it , then ?
C'mon , McCain .
You KNOW they 've broken the law .
You KNOW they 've hurt our national security .
You KNOW that our reputation on the world stage is horribly damaged .
But you 're not interested in " looking back " ?
How about being interested in doing your damn job , Senator , and exercise some oversight ?
History is n't going to look poorly on the presidency alone , you cowardly putz , if you REPORTED torture and did nothing about it .
Transcripts below the fold
STEPHANOPOULOS :
You and the president - elect also Guantanamo , closing down Guantanamo .
MCCAIN : Yes .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
And you signed on to a very harsh report , out of the Senate Armed Services Committee , this week , on the torture of detainees across the military prison system .
And you said this was n't just the work of a few bad apples .
In fact , you laid direct responsibility of Secretary of Defense -- former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld .
Listen to this : " Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld 's authorization of aggressive interrogation techniques for use at Guantanamo Bay was a direct cause of detainee abuse there .
It conveyed the message that physical pressures and degradation were appropriate treatment for detainees in U.S. military custody .
What followed was an erosion in standards dictating that detainees be treated humanely . "
His spokesman called these allegations " unfounded . "
How do you respond to that , first of all ?
And , number two , how should the Secretary of Defense be held accountable for this ?
MCCAIN : I do n't know .
I think history , obviously , will render very harsh judgment about this whole detainee treatment situation , whether additional action is called for .
I think , as a member of the -- ranking member of the Armed Services Committee , that we 've done our job .
Let me just tell you a brief story .
Not that long ago , a year and a half ago , Senator Lindsey Graham and I were in Iraq .
We were in the prison .
The general , our U.S. general in charge of prison had us in a secluded area and met a former high - ranking member of Al Qaida , one of the toughest guys I 've ever seen .
I said , how did you succeed so well after the initial American victory ?
He said , " Two things " -- he said , " One " -- he said , " there was no control by your troops .
It was total lawlessness .
There was rape , looting , pillage , murder , settling of old scores .
So there was
lawlessness .
Second , the greatest recruiting tool we had -- we were able to recruit thousands of young men , " he said , " was Abu Ghraib . "
So you can't underestimate the damage that our treatment of prisoners , both at Abu Ghraib and other ...
STEPHANOPOULOS :
But some look at that and say ...
MCCAIN : ... harmed our national security interests .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Some look at that and say , because of that , there should be a special prosecutor looking into all the crimes that were committed , and no one should be exempted from that .
MCCAIN : Well , look , that 's not my job .
If overwhelming evidence indicates that , that 's fine .
But the point is , I thought , and Senator Levin did , that we should carry out our responsibilities
in the Senate Armed Services Committee and do a thorough and complete investigation .
I 'm not that interested in looking back .
What I am interested in and committed to is making sure we do n't do it again .
We 're in this long twilight struggle here , and so America 's prestige and image , as we all know , was damaged by these stories of mistreatment .
And we 've got to make sure the world knows that that 's not the United States of America that they knew and appreciated for centuries .

It seems probable to me that many men spend a certain share of their lives engaged in that most ridiculous of Western Man 's cultural rituals , shaving .
OK , some of us have to do it for one reason or another : to hold that job until the Time comes , or to keep from having a scraggly growth on the face because we can't grow a good beard , or whatever .
But let 's give the problem some thought .
Short of electrolysis ( preferably at an early age ) , there are only two basic methods of depilation : the electric razor and the blade .
Each has its advantages : fewer cuts with the electric , a closer shave ( in spite of what the electric razor manufacturers say ) with the blade .
But there are disadvantages to each , too .
Electric razors needlessly support the power companies , are initially rather expensive , and require maintenance ( which often involves sending the blamed things to the factory ) from time to time .
And suppose you want to go out into the woods for a while without coming back looking like one of the animals .
What then ?
That electric razor is about as useful in the forest as a refrigerator .
Very few trees come equipped with outlets .
Now consider the safety razor .
Any male who 's ever used or thought about how to use a straight razor will attest there 's nothing safe about it .
The first shave on a new blade leaves your face looking as if it 's been gone over by someone in hobnail boots , and when the blade gets dull , the last shave is just about as bad as the first with the sole difference being that it hurts more .
And what do you do then ?
You cuss , replace the blade , and consign the old one to that little slot in back of the medicine chest .
How many tons of steel are consumed each year in this way , never to be seen again until and unless the house is torn down ?
I 'd love to know how much steel and other less common metals we consume annually in the form of blades .
The manufacturers are using platinum now and claiming 10 or 15 shaves per blade , the same number claimed for the stainless steel cutting edges when they were introduced seven or eight years back .
This is an improvement ?
Well , many moons ago , while picking a safety razor from the gouge in my cheek ( it was quite literally hung there ) I decided that there must surely be a better way .
I had already been the electric route and found that it left much to be desired — for instance , a decent shave .
The next afternoon , while trucking around town , I dropped into a junk shop , and there in a display case was something I had n't seen outside a barber shop in years : a straight razor .
The razor was in good shape , so I bought it and took it home .
After a week or so of experiments ( during which I cut myself , I think , four times ) I got the hang of the thing with a little help from a friend who had used a straight razor before .
Since then , the results have gotten better all the time .
I 'm not babyfaced , but I can sure look like it with a little application , and the shave lasts the whole day instead of just a few hours .
After I 'd learned the ins and outs of wielding a straight razor , I began to have fun with the stainless steel boys when they gathered to swap lies about the number of shaves they were getting from a single blade .
I 'd look around the group and top them all by saying , " I use a straight razor , and I 'd hate to tell you guys how many shaves that one blade has given me . "
I usually keep several straight razors on hand now .
Most are hollow - ground ( the best , most comfortable shaves obtainable come from hollow - ground straight razors ) and some have pretty fancy handles , which does n't help their performance any but which are nice to look at .
All are in good working condition and all are first - class instruments .
Every once in a while someone gets interested and I turn him on to this " new " method of shaving .
Generally he goes away with one of the razors and a much happier face .
Here are some tips for the man who wants to try it :
(1) Do n't buy a new razor unless you 're sure that it does not have a stainless steel blade .
Stainless steel wo n't hold an edge worth a good damn .
Look for good quality old - time razors in your local junk and antique shops .
Examine the blades of the ones you find .
The best are made of Sheffield steel and are clearly marked so on the blade .
Do n't pay money for a fancy handle unless that 's what you really want .
(2) Check the blade 's cutting edge for nicks .
Do n't accept even the slightest imperfection and do n't let the man tell you that such nicks will come out .
It 's your face , baby , and a jagged cutting edge will make it look like a battle map .
And no , those nicks wo n't come out .

(3) If you think the blade is OK , have a look at the handle .
It may be wood , bone , horn , celluloid , or possibly some other material I 've never seen .
Make sure the handle is in good shape .
Plain or fancy , its primary job is to give you something to hold the razor by and something to fold the blade into .
If it 's broken ANYWHERE , the razor is potentially dangerous to your face and your hands .
(4) You can lose a lot of flesh if the blade flops too easily .
You 're much better off with one that is hinged into its handle a little too tightly .
If you pay more than $ 2.50 for your used razor , you 're getting ripped off .
I have personally never shelled out more than $ 2.00 for a razor in Class A shape .
If that 's too steep , scrounge around .
The one I 'm using now did n't cost me anything .
Lots of folks have grandpa 's old shaving implement lying around rusting in a drawer and will be glad to get rid of it before little Wilbur finds the cussed thing and whacks off his arm .
Try barbers as a last resort only .
A lot of them have abandoned the straight razor and changed over to using electric clippers on necks .
They often have good razors lying around unused , but again , do n't pay a premium for one .
Remember , the barber does n't need the thing and he 's already making a living cutting hair , Western Man 's second most ridiculous cultural ritual .
Once you have your razor , you 'll need two things to keep the tool in shape : a stone to sharpen it and a strop to hone its edge nice and flat .
The stone is potentially the most expensive part of the deal .
Expect to lay out from $ 2.50 to $ 10.00 for a good one , and make sure it 's intended for razors and nothing else .
Knife sharpening stones just do n't make it with a straight razor , and I suspect they 'll even ruin its blade .
They 're just too coarse .
A good strop is also mighty important because , if the blade on your razor is wavy , your face will be too .
Antique and junk shops often have serviceable strops for a buck or less .
Just make sure the face of the one you buy is smooth and not all cut up .
A bit of saddle soap or bar soap or neats - foot oil ( boot grease ) applied sparingly will generally put an old strop into working shape .
For instruction in the art of using the straight razor , I firmly refer you to a barber , preferably an old one .
Barbers often use one of these babies on themselves , and are usually delighted to demonstrate both the handling of the razor and its care and feeding .
They 'll tell you how and how often to use the stone , how to strop the razor without ending up with a frayed temper and a handful of shredded leather , and other little secrets .
For that matter , if you do n't want to invest in a stone , you can often find a barber who'll put a new edge on your razor for free , or at least let you borrow his stone for the few moments it takes .
I know , I 've done it myself .
The only problem you may have is in convincing your benefactor that you intend to shave with the thing , not use it on someone .
With a straight razor you can get a close shave with anything that 'll put a good , moist foam on your face , but I personally wo n't touch the aerosol creams .
You 're being ripped off terrifically when you buy them , they 're too thick , you always wind up wasting half of what you shoot out of a can , and the containers ( which are still half full of goo when the gas runs out ) present a recycling problem .
I use cup soap and a brush .
( The best brushes are badger hair , which must give pause .
Try the junk shops again .
It 's better to recycle an old one than to buy new . )
Ordinary soap will work quite well , especially when you 're going backpacking and do n't want to tote along the cup variety as added weight , but do carry that strop .
Your boots wo n't put a flat edge on a straight razor 's blade .
I know , I tried .
You can plan on cutting yourself about once a month .
Better yet , skip that day and 14 others by shaving only every other morning .
When you have a real razor that shaves as close as the straight ones do , you can hack off two days ' worth of brush as fast and much easier than any other equipment will take off one .
At the risk of incurring some personal injury suits , the general idea of whacking whiskers with a straight razor ( if you ca n't get someone who knows how to show you ) is this :
(1) Always shave against the grain .
That is , if your whiskers grow down , shave up .
Shave cowlicks twice , once up and once down .
When you make razor strokes only with the grain of your beard , you 're not shaving , you 're just scraping your face and it'll feel like it .
(2) Good concentration is absolutely essential until you get the hang of handling a straight razor .
When you 're first starting out , use a light touch , take your time , and shave alone .
Later , after you 've mastered the art , you can let the kids watch or you can think about the compost heap while you shear your shag .
(3) Always mow in a direction 90 degrees to the length of your razor 's blade .
Never , never , never move that blade lengthwise across your face .
Be especially careful when trimming around your mustache or ' burns , unless you want a nice scar to use as a guide in the future .
(4) Finish with a little alcohol ( it 's much cheaper than the perfume they sell for aftershave lotion and just as effective ) and then go out and turn your buddies on to a really decent shave with about as little environmental impact as possible , a shave you can get anywhere ( I 've shaved in the rearview mirrors of my truck out in the wilderness ) .
If you pack your razor with you and it does n't have a case , wrap a strong rubber band around the instrument a couple of times after you close it , to keep it closed .
And do n't EVER leave that thing lying around where your little boy can get it ; children love to imitate paddy shaving , and emergency calls are expensive .
Well , there it is , an introduction to the finest shave in the world and the best , the greatest , the ONLY way to trim around mustaches and stylized beards such as goatees .
With a straight razor you can select a single hair that 's out of place and cut it off without touching another whisker .
The tool will make beautifully straight lines for this job and , with a little practice , trim curves too .
Just remember that you must never move that " razor sharp " blade lengthwise .
Shaving with a straight razor is a very simple idea that will preserve your face , and in some small measure the environment as well .
Small measure ?
I may be nuts , but when I think of all those old razor blades rusting away inside the walls of houses , all those throw - away shaving cream cans , and all the raw materials and energy it takes to produce and market them ....
Inayat Bunglawala thinks I talk " pure twaddle " .
Why ?
Because I suggested in an article about the firebombers who last week attacked the offices of the publishers Gibson Square that part of the problem is that too many liberals have come to accept that it is " morally unacceptable to give offence " .
Not so , said Inayat .
" If anyone has given ground in this debate , " he suggested , " it is surely those who once believed in banning books because they regarded them as being ' offensive ' . "
Inayat himself has certainly given ground .
Once a campaigner against The Satanic Verses , he now believes that no one has the right not to be offended .
Inayat 's welcome change of heart should not , however , blind him ( or us ) to the fact that much of the rest of the world has been marching in the opposite direction .
Gibson Square was attacked because it is about to publish The Jewel of Medina , Sherry Jones ' novel about the Prophet Muhammad 's wife Aisha .
It had originally been bought by Random House for $ 100,000 .
But the American publishers dropped the book for fear that it " might be offensive to some in the Muslim community " .
Every other major publisher felt the same .
It fell to small independents , with a record of defending free speech , such as Beaufort in America and Gibson Square in Britain , to pick up the pieces .
This is not , however , just a story about a single book or a single publisher .
Many within the political and cultural elite have come to think like the directors of Random House .
" You would think twice , if you were honest , " said Ramin Gray , associate director at London 's Royal Court Theatre , when asked last year by the journalist Peter Whittle whether he would put on a play critical of Islam :
You'd have to take the play on its individual merits , but given the time we 're in , it 's very hard , because you 'd worry that if you cause offence then the whole enterprise would become buried in a sea of controversy .
It does make you tread carefully .
In June 2007 , the theatre cancelled a new adaptation of Aristophanes ' Lysistrata , set in Muslim heaven , for fear of causing offence .
Another London theatre , the Barbican , carved chunks out of its production of Tamburlaine the Great for the same reason , while Berlin 's Deutsche Oper cancelled a production of Mozart 's Idomeneo in 2006 because of its depiction of Muhammed .
That same year , London 's Whitechapel Art Gallery removed life - size nude dolls by surrealist artist Hans Bellmer from a 2006 exhibit just before its opening , ostensibly because of " space constraints " , though the true reason appeared to be fear that the nudity might offend local Muslims .
Tim Marlow of London 's
White Cube gallery suggested that such self - censorship was now common , though " very few people have explicitly admitted " it .
There is a similar climate within TV .
Just this month , the comedian Katy Brand , of ITV's Big Ass Show , was forced to drop a sketch called " The Imam of Dibley " after lawyers deemed it " culturally insensitive " .
Three years ago , after the Birmingham Repertory Theatre had cancelled a production of the play Bezhti , because of protests by Sikhs that it was offensive , Ian Jack , the then editor of the literary magazine Granta , argued for the necessity of self - censorship in a plural society .
Whatever may appear to be right in principle , he suggested , in practice one must appease religious and cultural sensibilities because such sensibilities are so deeply felt .
The avoidance of cultural pain was more important than the right to freedom of expression .
" The state has no law forbidding a pictorial representation of the prophet " , Jack wrote , " but I never expect to see such a picture . "
An individual might have the abstract right to depict Muhammed , but the price of such freedom was too high when compared to the " immeasurable insult " that the exercise of such a right could cause – even though " we , the faithless , do n't understand the offence . "
Jack wrote that a year before the Danish cartoon controversy erupted .
The response to that controversy showed how deeply embedded such arguments had become .
" I understand your concerns , " Louise Arbour , the UN high commissioner for human rights , told delegates at the organisation of the Islamic conference summit in Mecca , " and would like to emphasise that I regret any statement or act that could express a lack of respect for the religion of others . "
The European Union expressed " regret " about the publication of the cartoons .
Former US president Bill Clinton condemned " these totally outrageous cartoons against Islam " .
The then Russian president , Vladimir Putin , not generally recognised as a supporter of Islam , suggested that the Danish government was using the excuse of freedom of expression to protect those who had insulted Islam .
The British foreign secretary Jack Straw praised the British media for not publishing the cartoons and condemned as " disrespectful " the decision of some European newspapers who reprinted them .
What we are talking about here is not a system of formal censorship , under which the state bans works deemed offensive .
Rather , what has developed is a culture of self - censorship in which the giving of offence has come to be seen as morally unacceptable .
In the 20 years since the publication of The Satanic Verses the fatwa has effectively become internalised .
In a plural society , so the argument for self - censorship runs , social justice requires not just that individuals are treated as political equals , but also that their cultural beliefs are given equal recognition and respect .
As the British sociologist Tariq Modood has put it :
If people are to occupy the same political space without conflict , they mutually have to limit the extent to which they subject each others ' fundamental beliefs to criticism .
I disagree .
In a plural society it is both inevitable and important that people offend others .
Inevitable , because where different beliefs are deeply held , clashes are unavoidable .
And we should deal with those clashes in the open rather than suppress them .
Important because any kind of social progress requires one to offend some deeply held sensibilities .
" If liberty means anything , " as George Orwell once put it , " it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear . "
If we want the pleasures of pluralism , we have to put up with the pain of being offended .
I am pleased that Inayat Bunglawala has come to agree with Orwell .
It 's just a pity that he is still in denial about the harm caused by the broader culture of self - censorship .

Iraqi journalist Muntazir al - Zaidi , who threw the shoes at Bush in Baghdad , shouted “ Killer of Iraqis , killer of children . ” while security guards piled on him .
McClatchy reports that he had covered the US bombing of Sadr City last spring , in support of PM Nuri al - Maliki ’s incursion into this stronghold of the Sadr Movement and its Mahdi Army , and is said to have been emotionally affected by the sight of that destruction .
Courtesy of Newsweek
The frequent US bombing of civilian Iraqi cities that are already under US military occupation has been one of the most under - reported stories of the Iraq War .
Baghdadiya Television , for which al - Zaidi works , on Monday demanded his release from custody .
Even as Bush spoke of the situation in Iraq in glowing terms , guerrillas set off three bombs in the capital on Sunday , wounding 17 persons .
In the northern , largely Sunni Arab city of Mosul , guerrillas badly wounded the dean of the college of medicine in a gun attack on Sunday .
On Monday morning , guerrillas invaded the home of Yazidis in the north and killed 7 family members .
The Salafi Jihadi Sunnis deeply dislike the Yazidis , who follow a pre-Islamic , Iranian folk religion .
As usual , Bush had to sneak in and out of Iraq under a shroud of secrecy , giving the lie to his assertions about its good security situation .
British forces will have to leave Iraq by July 31 under a ‘ mini- agreement ’ crafted by the Iraqi cabinet .
It lacks the detail of the Status of Forces Agreement negotiated between Baghdad and Washington , and the Times of London calls it ‘ humiliating . ’
In the absence of this ‘ mini- agreement , ’ British troops might have had to depart in January for lack of legal cover for their operations in Basra .
The dramatic fall in the price per barrel of petroleum in recent months is threatening Iraq ’s budget and could lead to layoffs of government workers and cutbacks in food aid to the poor .
This interview with Maj. Gen. Mark P. Hertling , the 1st Armored Division commander , who has been in Samarra , is refreshing for its candor even as the general rightly stresses the improvements in the security situation .
There are still 400 attacks a month in Iraq ; unemployment ranges from 40 % to 80 % ; the infrastructure of the country is completely dilapidated , with the Beiji refinery an ecological disaster ; and the Shiite government shows no interest in the welfare and progress of the Sunni Arab north–
“ It would be like having a central government in Bonn that did n’t care anything about what was going on in Wiesbaden or Frankfurt . . . ”
Mosul , long ‘ off the political map ’ of the Shiite government in Baghdad , is hoping that provincial elections will bring a stronger , more representative government .
Meanwhile , the city is violent and dangerous .
McClatchy reports political violence in Iraq on Sunday :
Wikipedia may be the world 's largest reference source based on user submissions , but what rarely gets talked about is how many entries get deleted from the site .
Editors often delete entries for a host of reasons - including copyright violations , pages with serious libel problems , and pages which set out to offend others .
This may not be a surprise , except that they also delete entries for " being uninteresting " or if they 're deemed " the result of manipulation by political and business interests " .
These are obviously criteria that are severely open to interpretation , so as a result , a new website called Deletionpedia was created to host all of the deleted Wikipedia articles .
That way we do n't miss out on gems like " List of Films with Monkeys in Them "
But on a serious note , what 's become a real point of contention is the actual Wikipedia article describing Deletionpedia .
Some editors are trying to remove it , sparking a raging discussion on whether that 's a wise move .
As Cyndy Aleo- Carreira observes , " it appears that the impetus for removal is n't so much due to insignificance ... as it is due to perceived criticism of Wikipedia itself .
" This opens a pandora 's box of questions .
Have the editors at Wikipedia taken on a censorship role ?
If so , how does that conflict with the website 's characterization of being user - driven ?
To what extent does this case illustrate the ongoing inclusion vs. exclusion debate in cyberspace ?
Most people are completely unaware that Wikipedia even deletes entries at all , let alone that it 's now .
What we really ought to be asking is who exactly are these censoring editors and how did they obtain their positions of power over the rest of us ?

1. PG ’s project
In How to Do Philosophy , Paul Graham claims that “ judging from their works , most philosophers up to the present have been wasting their time . ”
His point is that philosophy per se is structurally flawed .
How ?
The trouble began with Aristotle : “ he sets as his goal in the Metaphysics the exploration of knowledge that has no practical use .
Which means no alarms go off when he takes on grand but vaguely understood questions and ends up getting lost in a sea of words . ”
In other words , because philosophy aims at the most general truths without worrying about how useful they are , it ’s able to get away with nonsense .
Other fields , by contrast , only seek ideas with some practical value — ideas that make it easier to do something useful ; if they arrive at general truths , it ’s only because abstraction usually works : it buys you simpler theories and makes your algorithms faster .
So whatever “ philosophy ” we ’re after , PG says , we should get from able specialist non-philosophers who work their way up chains of abstraction until what they know is general enough to apply elsewhere .
That way we guarantee ( a ) that it ’s useful , since specialist non-philosophers favor the more useful of two rivals , ceteris paribus , and ( b ) that it ’s easy to understand , since specialist non-philosophers do n’t have time for difficult texts ( because they are less useful , in general , than easy ones ) .
2. Something ’s rotten in the state of Denmark
The simplest flaw in PG ’s account is its scope : it implicates most philosophers up to the present , which means all one has to do to rebut it is point to a few groups of contemporary philosophers who systematically are n’t wasting their time .
I take up that task in the next two sections .
This is not to elide the indirect influence , however , of even those thinkers — Kant , for instance — most susceptible to PG ’s attack .
That influence , I ’ll argue in section 5 , should give their critics pause .
Finally , I will defend the value of “ doing philosophy ” — an argument that I do not think is “ like someone in 1500 looking at the lack of results achieved by alchemy and saying its value was as a process , ” however similar it may sound .
3 . Do n’t mind us philosophers … of mind
What would we lose if , of the 18,460 papers at MindPapers , a “ bibliography of the philosophy of mind and the science of consciousness , ” we removed the 12,500 or so written by philosophers ?
Let ’s take a look at the top 100 most cited works for an idea .
The first to go would be Jerry Fodor ’s 1983 The Modularity of Mind , in which he revived an idea that phrenologists once took for granted , albeit in a perverted form : “ that many fundamentally different kinds of psychological mechanisms must be postulated in order to explain the facts of mental life . ”
He argues , in other words , that for our mind to work the way it does there must be vertically integrated components ( modules ) in our brain — like the “ universal grammar ” faculty proposed by Chomsky .
Fodor ’s paper cleared up a lot of conceptual misunderstandings , generated testable predictions , and set the stage for decades of cognitive science that has ( largely ) borne out his view .
We would also lose John Searle ’s 1980 Minds , brains , and programs , which gave a negative answer to Turing ’s question , “ Can machines think ? ”
As support he introduced his famous Chinese Room thought experiment , which apparently defeats a functional account of intelligence by demonstrating that if understanding Chinese were an algorithm merely “ run ” on one ’s brain , then it could be run in similar fashion by a man in a room shuffling about slips of paper ; would we then say that the man , or for that matter the room , understands Chinese ?
If not , then machines can never understand the way that we do — there is something special ( he called it “ causal power ” ) about our brains .
Searle ’s paper is important because if he ’s right then a whole lot of AI researchers trying to make computer programs with “ general intelligence ” ought to move on to something else .
If wrong , then we ought to figure out how he ’s wrong — because that will be the secret to making machines think the way we do .
We would lose Thomas Nagel ’s 1974 exploration and articulation of phenomenal experience , What is it like to be a bat ? ; Daniel Dennett ’s The Intentional Stance , and all its elegant abstractions ; Andy Clark ’s ( and Rodney Brooks ’s ) idea that our minds are fundamentally embedded in the world , and that our inner model of our environment is far sparser than once thought — articulated recently in Being There : Putting Brain , Body , and World Together Again ; etc .
What ’s more , we would lose thousands of articles that clear the ground for , inform , or integrate findings across the brain sciences .
Ned Block ’s influential review , Philosophical issues about consciousness , is a nice recent example .
Perhaps the scariest omission would be the work of one of my intellectual heroes , Douglas Hofstadter .
The little - known computer programs produced under his watch by FARG at Indiana — Metacat or Letter Spirit — could stay , and so could his 1976 “ Energy levels and wave functions of Bloch electrons in rational and irrational magnetic fields , ” but Godel , Escher , Bach : An Eternal Golden Braid would have to go : it is too much a search for the most general truths , not enough a work of original , concrete research ; there is too much unconstrained philosophizing in there .
If that idea seems troublesome , to keep only some of Hofstadter ’s work while throwing out the rest ( the far more influential stuff , no less ) , then you have probably begun to appreciate the special relationship between contemporary philosophy of mind and “ hard ” cognitive science — they are of one mind , sometimes literally .
Divorcing the two would probably hurt them both .
What language game ?
PG argues that philosophy is , at bottom , a “ language - game ” in the Wittgensteinian sense .
Here ’s how he puts it :
There are things I know I learned from studying philosophy .
The most dramatic I learned immediately , in the first semester of freshman year , in a class taught by Sydney Shoemaker .
I learned that I do n’t exist .
I am ( and you are ) a collection of cells that lurches around driven by various forces , and calls itself I .
But there ’s no central , indivisible thing that your identity goes with .
You could conceivably lose half your brain and live .
Which means your brain could conceivably be split into two halves and each transplanted into different bodies .
Imagine waking up after such an operation .
You have to imagine being two people .
The real lesson here is that the concepts we use in everyday life are fuzzy , and break down if pushed too hard .
This is why , apparently , philosophy ends up looking like a “ word salad , ” like a “ garbled message ” — “ hard to understand because the writer was unclear in his own mind ” and not “ because the ideas it represents are hard to understand . ”
My response is twofold .
For one , the split brain example he gives is , at bottom , about the word “ I . ” Fine .
But once you know what the word “ I ” actually means , you have not just learned that your everyday concept was fuzzy , that it breaks down when you push it too hard — you ’ve developed a richer model of the self , ( hopefully ) including all of the complicated neural , computational , and functional details .
Thus a petty semantic question — what is the meaning of the word “ I ” ?— can open up a deeper line of inquiry : how do we form an integrated sense of self , why do we even have a word like “ I , ” when our brain is apparently just a soup of meaningless symbols ?
That is a question that , once articulated properly , can be explored by philosophers and scientists alike .
( See Hofstadter ’s “ Who Shoves Whom Around Inside the Careenium ? , or , The Meaning of the Word ‘ I ’ ” for one such exploration . )
This kind of thing happens all over the place .
Philosophical debates about “ metaphysical necessity ” sure sound like wasteful bickering over the names of things , until a murder trial turns on whether someone “ could have possibly acted differently ” ; ethicists may seem like they 're in the clouds , except when one of their moral frameworks gets written into a country ’s constitution ; Hilary Putnam ’s famous paper , The Meaning of “ Meaning ” , feels hopelessly out of touch with reality — we all get along just fine without knowing the first thing about “ intension ” or “ extension ” — but it raises questions that figure deeply in language learning and AI .
And so on .
It ’s easy to say that philosophy is one big conversation about the color of the bikeshed .
What that misses , though , is that the right question asked in the right way can cause a paradigm shift ( a term due , incidentally , to a philosopher ) :
“ What is the meaning of the word ‘ I ’ ? ”
“ How can someone ever cross a room ? ”
“ Can machines think ? ”
“ Are meanings in the head ? ”
“ Is the mind organized horizontally or vertically ? ”
“ What constitutes moral responsibility ? ”
“ Are mathematical objects real ? ”
“ Is the mind a blank slate ? ”
“ Do macroscopic objects actually exist ? ”
“ Is the accused to be presumed innocent , or guilty ? ”
That last one brings me to a brief aside : nearly every legal opinion I ’ve ever read had some linguistic issue at its core .
Example : should the blotter paper used to drop acid be counted in its weight , which determines the length of mandatory sentences ?
The argument comes down to the phrase “ mixture or substance containing a detectable amount ” ( see Chapman v. United States , 500 U.S. 453 ) .
Point being , wresting imprecise words out of their natural context and plugging them into a perverted formalism is the law as we know it — it ’s practically the whole game .
We do n’t attack it , though , because we know that their “ language - games ” help to draw increasingly fine lines around difficult ideas — to , as it were , measure the coast of Britain .
I think the same should be said of philosophy .
My second objection to PG ’s “ word salad ” comment is more straightforward : most contemporary philosophers of mind do write well .
So well , in fact , that I think one can become a better writer just by reading them .
They know their Strunk & White and most would probably appreciate PG ’s aesthetic .
See Eric Lormand ’s But Momma Never Told Me about Philosophy Papers for evidence ( or just look at any of the papers mentioned above ) .
4. Problematizing a purely syntagmatic critique of postmodern critical theory
PG ’s biggest enemy here , besides the ancient philosophers , seems to be postmodern critical theorists .
Example :
The field of philosophy is still shaken from the fright Wittgenstein gave it . [ 13 ]
Later in life he spent a lot of time talking about how words worked .
Since that seems to be allowed , that ’s what a lot of philosophers do now .
Meanwhile , sensing a vacuum in the metaphysical speculation department , the people who used to do literary criticism have been edging Kantward , under new names like “ literary theory , ” “ critical theory , ” and when they ’re feeling ambitious , plain “ theory . ”
The writing is the familiar word salad : Gender is not like some of the other grammatical modes which express precisely a mode of conception without any reality that corresponds to the conceptual mode , and consequently do not express precisely something in reality by which the intellect could be moved to conceive a thing the way it does , even where that motive is not something in the thing as such . [ 14 ]
Elsewhere , on his Quotes page , we find another jab :
“ Simultaneously reifying and challenging hegemonic codes of race , class , gender and regional or national identity , his characters explore the complex and changing postmodern cultural landscape . ”
Robert Bennett , English professor at Montana State , announcing a panel discussion about Brad Pitt
To a certain extent I ’m on board .
Bennett ’s sentence is incredibly vague ( though I imagine part of that is just being in an introduction ) .
And I find a lot of the writing done by postmodern critical theorists to be obfuscatory bullshit .
This is not to say , however , that all of it is .
Nor that if someone writes like an idiot then what they ’re saying must be fundamentally unimportant in the same way that Kant ’s musings may have been fundamentally unimportant ( more on that later ) .
I ca n’t help but think that PG is taking a line that a lot of people take , which is to laugh at how these lefty hipster professors put on such a show for something as trivial as Brad Pitt .
The idea is that something like “ Every connected , locally compact , non trivial group has a non trivial , closed , invariant subgroup ” from a math exam is completely unilluminating , but at least we go in expecting not to understand anything ; we assume the stuff is way beyond us .
But with cultural theory , postmodern theory , etc. , the lay reader expects to be able to talk about things like “ culture , ” “ literature , ” and “ Brad Pitt ” at a pretty high level .
So when they see technical phraseology — “ complexly situation within ” , “ mutual historicization of ” , “ theorizing the subject ” , etc . — they can’t help but feel hoodwinked , as if something that ’s supposed to be understandable has been made needlessly complex .
But if we take the operations of language and culture to be as complicated as any other object of study , and if we allow that certain professionals within the field want to use shared tokens ( e.g. “ historicization ” ) to collapse complex ideas that show up all over their literature , then we can begin to understand why this stuff sounds the way it does .
They ’re not writing for every Joe Intellectual , just for the people who put the time in to be part of their club .
Compare , for the sake of illustration , two definitions of Stokes ’ Theorem .
One is for a more general audience , like Calc II or first - year physics students :
The curl theorem states
The other , of which the first is just a special case , is for mathematicians :
Let M be an oriented smooth manifold of dimension n and let α be an n-differential form that is compactly supported on M .
The integral of α over M is defined as follows :
Let {f_i} be a partition of unity associated with a locally finite cover { U_i} of ( consistently oriented ) coordinate neighborhoods ...
The analogy back to critical theory should be apparent .
On one level you have concrete , special cases with correspondingly concrete writing .
This seems to be the level that PG would be interested in , if any .
To get access to it you can look at magazine covers critically , or remark on the homosexual tension in Fight Club , or read something like Introducing Postmodernism or this incisive essay on television and U.S. fiction by David Foster Wallace , who intentionally eschews the standard vocabulary .
On another level is the “ deeper ” theory or more general framework .
A conversation on this level , if you ’re an outsider , sounds like two people talking about Starcraft if you ’ve never played .
But there is more content here , too , just as there ’s more content in the second formulation above .
Perhaps the ratio between the two levels is tighter in critical theory , but I suspect it ’s far greater than PG thinks .
I say that because I also had strong misgivings about the subject — for its insuperable tomes , hipster followers , and radical political agenda — before finally easing into it via writers like Richard Dyer , Patsy Yeager , Simon Gikandi , and Fredric Jameson .
I took a class on culture theory with a professor who found herself “ increasingly irritated by the French philosophers , ” and whose reading selections were recent and down - to - earth ; Dani Cavallaro ’s Critical and Cultural Theory was a fine textbook .
After a bit of training , sentences that I once found unreadable ( e.g. Foucault ’s or Barthes ’s ) became just as crisp and insightful as PG ’s best .
I had only to learn the language .
I ’m reminded of how chess experts can recall legal board positions with far greater fidelity than someone who does n’t play , but perform about equally when the pieces are arranged in ways they ’d never see in a real game .
The difference , of course , is that a legal board position means a lot more to the expert than to the lay person — he can consider strategic features like “ pawn strength ” and “ control of the center , ” and think of scenarios ( “ Sicilian opening with a queen ’s gambit ” ) that he ’s encountered before — whereas a jumble of pieces reduces them both to rote memorization .
My point is that if a work of critical theory looks like a “ garbled message , ” it could be that it really is garbled ( e.g. Derrida ) , or it could be that one simply has n’t read enough of the stuff to know .
Good ideas
I fear that I ’ve spent too much of my defense on the language of critical theory and not enough on the actual ideas .
But I think that PG attacks these guys because of the language , and could — for all I know — not give a hoot about what they ’re actually saying .
In case that ’s happened , here are some of their good ideas off the top of my head :
All language is political ; capitalism - as - market - system is tremendously good , but capitalism - as - defining - roles - in - terms - of - production is dangerous ; there is a causal connection between Cosmopolitan and increased labioplasty among 14 year - olds ; the simulacrum ; the panopticon ; art once made the strange familiar , and now it makes the familiar strange ; gays appropriated “ queer ” and largely defused it — could “ nigger ” be defused , and how ? ; television uses self - aware irony to swallow attacks leveled against it ; the medium is the message ; photography is a special kind of representation because it feels objective ; if you do n’t think Aladdin is racist , then your working definition of “ racist ” is inadequate ; etc .
These are the kind of ideas that satisfy PG ’s criterion : they “ would cause someone who understood them to do something differently . ”
Interlude : PG and brevity
I think it ’s worth commenting on PG ’s apparent preoccupation with brevity .
See , for example , his handle ( pg ) , the URLs on paulgraham.com , his comments on writing , and these excerpts from a few of his essays :
One thing hackers like is brevity .
Hackers are lazy , in the same way that mathematicians and modernist architects are lazy : they hate anything extraneous .
and
[ on developing Arc : ]
I did n’t decide what problems to work on based on how hard they were .
Instead I used what might seem a rather mundane test : I worked on things that would make programs shorter .
Why would I do that ?
Because making programs short is what high level languages are for .
It may not be 100 % accurate to say the power of a programming language is in inverse proportion to the length of programs written in it , but it ’s damned close .
I bring it up because I think he may occasionally make sacrifices in the service of his aesthetic .
He may elide the complexities of an argument — saying “ most philosophers ” instead of singling out specific people or schools of thought — to make sure an essay reads well .
Or he may ignore what you ’re saying if you say it poorly , like if you ’re a critical theorist .
The curious thing about PG ’s writing is that every sentence sounds … not dispassionate , but not emphatic , either .
There are no vicissitudes of character , there is no modulating voice that rises with the important bits and falls with the bits it ’s not so sure about .
There is just a monotone that declares , sentence after sentence , the self - evident truth .
What that means is that something like
Books on philosophy per se are either highly technical stuff that does n’t matter much , or vague concatenations of abstractions their own authors did n’t fully understand ( e.g. Hegel ) .
sounds just as vanilla , to the point , and obviously “ the way it is ” as this :
Embedded languages ( or as they now seem to be called , DSLs ) are the essence of Lisp hacking .
We ’re tempted to take his word on the one because we respect his authority on the other , just as Apple fans gawked at the iPhone no less than they did the iPod — because Steve Jobs had the same magical pitch each time .
5 . A web of knowledge and a pretty picture
It took several centuries to prove the unsolvability of the quintic by radicals — a result due to Evariste Galois when he was just nineteen .
Everyone before him was wrong , and of those , most were hopelessly wrong : they worked in the wrong direction , trying to devise a “ quintic formula ” instead of proving one could n’t exist .
Were all of these people wasting their time ?
To say so would vastly oversimplify history .
I ’m reminded of the following account of creativity ( Koestler 1964 , cited here ) :
The moment of truth , the sudden emergence of a new insight , is an act of intuition .
Such intuitions give the appearance of miraculous flashes , or short - circuits of reasoning .
In fact they may be likened to an immersed chain , of which only the beginning and the end are visible above the surface of consciousness .
The diver vanishes at one end of the chain and comes up at the other end , guided by invisible links .
More concretely ,
There is a tendency to completely overlook the power of brain algorithms , because they are invisible to introspection .
It took a long time historically for people to realize that there was such a thing as a cognitive algorithm that could underlie thinking .
( link )
I think the description serves equally well for innovation , where lots of unseen activity occasionally generates a good idea .
Our tendency , of course , is to focus on the ends — that is usually all that we can see .
Think of Marconi getting credit for the radio , or , on the other side , “ the strong ‘ first - mover ’ effect under which the first papers in a field will , essentially regardless of content , receive citations at a rate enormously higher than papers published later ” ( arXiv:0809.0522v1 ) .
This is not to advocate for some kind of “ butterfly effect ” whereby we should recognize everyone ’s mysterious role in a delicate chain of influence .
But there is a chain of influence , and we should be careful not to ignore large swaths of it .
That includes all those people who were wrong , or whose “ programs ” were fundamentally misguided — because I do n’t think we could confidently say we ’d be better off without them .
See , for example , Immanuel Kant , a philosopher who on PG ’s account basically wasted his time , but whose influence extends by way of second - and third - degree connections through all kinds of treasured scientists , sociologists , philosophers , authors , painters , etc. :

Would it really be fair to say he “ wasted his time ” ?
Or did his work set the stage — even if only as a guide to what not to do — for the kind of “ miraculous flashes ” we now take for granted ?
6. Philosophy is my favorite class
From a footnote to PG ’s essay :
Some introductions to philosophy now take the line that philosophy is worth studying as a process rather than for any particular truths you ’ll learn .
The philosophers whose works they cover would be rolling in their graves at that .
They hoped they were doing more than serving as examples of how to argue : they hoped they were getting results .
Most were wrong , but it does n’t seem an impossible hope .
This argument seems to me like someone in 1500 looking at the lack of results achieved by alchemy and saying its value was as a process .
No , they were going about it wrong .
It turns out it is possible to transmute lead into gold ( though not economically at current energy prices ) , but the route to that knowledge was to backtrack and try another approach .
If everything you learned in philosophy class was useless , and other classes , in addition to teaching you valuable truths , also used the same “ process ” as philosophy , then it ’d probably be Pareto optimal to jump ship .
But I do n’t think that ’s the case .
For one , there are plenty of valuable truths to be learned in philosophy — that has been the burden of the rest of this essay , and I hope we can dispense with it now .
But I ’d also argue that ( good ) philosophy classes are special :
Philosophy professors are very smart .
Say what you will about the material , but it tends to attract sharp thinkers .
On its own that would n’t mean much , except that …
There ’s a lot of action in a philosophy class .
My smartest professors have been math and computer science guys , but I only know that by reading about them — there is unfortunately not a lot of back - and - forth in math class , even though there could be .
In philosophy , though , that ’s all there is : someone presents an objection to the reading , and — if nobody else will — the professor chips away .
There is tons of dialogue , and not the kind of noise that you find in a lot of English classes : in philosophy , as in math , there is a wrong answer ( or at least a poorly argued one ) .
It ’s hard to argue well .
You learn a lot of the same stuff in philosophy as you do in a proof - based math class , which basically comes down to :
how to solve hard problems break it down , work through examples , think extremes , etc .
how to express your solution ( writing proofs , mostly )
Trouble is , because there is so little talking in math classes , most of this stuff happens on your own in a room somewhere ; you do n’t have to construct or destroy an argument on the spot .
If nothing else , a few hours of good philosophy talk among people much smarter than you teaches you that it ’s a lot harder than it looks to ( a ) defeat even the dumbest - sounding arguments , ( b ) construct a solid argument of your own , and ( c ) respond to attacks , all in real - time .
Philosophy papers !=
English papers .
In my experience you can write your way out of an English paper , which is to say , you can think ( somewhat ) poorly , write well , and get an A .
Not so in philosophy .
I think this has to do with literary analysis in general ; see PG ’s essay on essays .
Good philosophy articles are like squash videos .
Squash is one of those sports where , if you ’re at my level at least , just watching professionals play can noticeably improve your game .
The same seems to be true of good philosophy articles .
( And it might be true of good math articles , but most mortals are n’t able to read those until grad school ; but that ’s another essay … )
Of course , this could all have to do with the special mix of classes that I ’ve taken .
But I have found that contemporary analytic philosophy offers excellent intellectual training .
7. Conclusion
There has been a lot of “ bad ” philosophy … maybe even most of it .
But the subject came clean on that point a long time ago ( say , the 1960s ) and has been recovering since .
I ’ve tried to give a picture of what I take to be the good stuff , and I can only hope that it is not offensively incomplete .
Read the discussion on Hacker News
" We talked about strong relationships in the past and the fact that we intend to make it even stronger in the future . "
Mr Rudd also announced Australia had no plans to increase the number of troops stationed in Afghanistan .
He responded to reports in today 's Herald that , according to Senator Obama 's campaign adviser on Asia policy , the first priority of the new US administration 's dealings with Australia would be to seek help in winning the war in Afghanistan .
Mr Rudd said Australia 's troop contribution in Afghanistan , where more than 1000 defence personnel are serving , would not be bolstered in the near future .
" Of the non-NATO countries contributing to Afghanistan at the moment Australia has the largest contingent .
That is a fact , " he said .
" We 've got no plans to increase that [ contribution ] in the future but of course we look forward to discussing that in the future . "
Mr Rudd said the matter did not come up directly in this morning 's conversation , saying that Senator Obama had been voted in only two days ago and that it would be two months before he assumed office .
Mr Rudd said he did not take the opportunity to invite Senator Obama to Australia , but said that he was always welcome in Australia .
" I 'm convinced we 're going to have a first - class working relationship .
His message of hope for America is equally a message of hope for the entire world .
" The challenges we face are common .
When it comes to climate change , the financial crisis and security , we must work together . "

Since our previous post on shipping container houses , the craze of prefab structures and cargo homes has accelerated to new levels .
From quiet mountain cottages to chic container hotels , it ’s easier ( and cooler ) than ever to call a rusty old shipping container home sweet home .
Take a look at a few of the possibilities ….
Container City , designed by Nicholas Lacey , overlooks the Trinity Buoy Wharf in London and provides 37 studio apartments for area artists .
The project was completed in 2 phases , using 50 shipping containers , and boasts an intriguing , Lego - like design .
Since the completion of Container City I and II in 2002 , Urban Space Management has developed several other shipping container designs including the 2500 square foot Mansell Community Center below .
SG Blocks , a St. Louis based company , received a great deal of attention with their 1800 square foot Harbinger House at West Coast Green last September .
Fashioned from 5 recycled shipping containers , the 2 - story home took less than a month to fabricate and not even 5 hours to assemble .
The company has also designed a military building in Fort Bragg and assembled this simple 4 - container home in about 2 hours at the EcoBuild Convention in DC earlier this month .
The latest project from SG Blocks is the 1920 square foot Hatchet Cactus House in Desert Hot Springs , CA , in partnership with Guller Padilla Design & Development .
Paul Stankey , along with wife Sara and his brother Paul and wife Krista , constructed their weekend getaway in the Minnesotta woods from 2 small shipping containers ( $ 800 each ) and birch wood .
Holyoke Cabin was built completely by hand , without electricity , and water was pumped from a creek 1 / 4 mile away to mix concrete .
Paul is co-founder of HIVE Modular , specializing in modern prefab design that is affordable and efficient .
British Columbia is seeing its share of shipping container houses as well , thanks to Keith Dewey , founder of Zigloo Canada .
Zigloo Domestique , completed in late 2006 , is Dewey ’s personal home constructed of 8 used shipping containers .
Bamboo , Douglas fir , and sandstone cover the walls and floors of the 1280 square foot home .
Be sure to visit Zigloo.ca for a peek at his latest container home concepts .
Three insulated shipping containers were modified to create the 2 bedroom home designed by Leger Wanaselja Architecture pictured up top .
The doors were repurposed as retaining walls , while bamboo flooring and wool carpet enhance the interior .
Completed in late 2007 , this container house overlooks the tranquil San Fransisco Bay and will withstand strong winds and earthquakes .
Shipping containers are not just for houses .
Tempohousing in Amsterdam has created huge student housing facilities , hotels , and commercial buildings from used shipping containers since 2002 .
Keetwonen , student housing in Amsterdam , was completed in 2006 and is currently the largest container city in the world .
Tempohousing is currently working on Hotel Yenagoa , a 4 - star hotel in Nigeria .
Other projects include a local supermarket , an array of houses , and housing for the Dutch branch of the Salvation Army .
The 9 - minute snooze is a product of mechanical clock engineering and digital clocks have followed suit since .
Mechanical clock engineers had to configure clock gears to work with the clock 's other gears .
They had two choices - to set the snooze for either a little more than nine minutes , or a little more than 10 minutes .
Clock makers decided on the 9 - minute gear , believing 10 + minutes would be too long and allow someone to fall into a deep sleep .
Clock manufacturers today have the option to set snooze buttons at any length but it is most stick with the 9 - minute custom .
Engineers working in the teeming cities and lonely deserts of North Africa are creating the last links in a power grid that will ring the Mediterranean Sea .
Sharing electricity over this ‘ Mediterranean Ring ’ could secure Europe ’s power supply with clean renewable energy , accelerating North Africa ’s development and knitting together two worlds that seem to be racing apart — those of Muslim North Africa and an increasingly xenophobic Europe .
We make the case for all this unabashed optimism in Closing the Circuit – a feature story in this month ’s issue of Spectrum .
Closing the Circuit is the product of two years of on - again , off - again research that came to fruition with on - site reporting in Libya and Morocco this summer .
The timing is fortuitious : North African countries – in many ways among the most progressive in the Muslim world – face a rising threat of Islamic fundamentalism , including increasingly deadly attacks by Al Qaeda - aligned militants .
Economic development and democratization are the best hope for a North African renaissance .
At the same time Europe ’s growing dependence on Russian oil and gas and desire to slash carbon emissions has intensified interest in North Africa ’s energy resources .
The scale of the potential exchange is immense : Analyses by the German government estimate that solar power generated in scorching North Africa could meet Germany ’s entire electricity demand .
No wonder then that the Union for the Mediterranean launched by French president Nicolas Sarkozy this summer to spur cooperation between Europe and North Africa is fleshing out a “ Mediterranean solar plan ” as one of its first actions .
The geopolitical and social import could be bigger .
Consider what Dominique Maillard , President of French grid operator Réseau de Transport de l’Electricité , said when asked last month what the Mediterranean Ring represents during an interview last month for the European Energy Review .
Maillard began his response by noting that the electrical interconnections between the European countries got started in 1951 – well before the signing of the Treaty or Paris , which created a European coal and steel market , and before the Treaty of Rome in 1957 .
“ At the dawn of Europe , energy – and even electrical energy – had therefore already preceded politics , ” says Maillard .
The implication by extension is clear : Electrical interconnection can be the forerunner for peaceful codevelopment among the countries of the Mediterranean , even including Israel .
Call it informed optimism .

New York — The widow of a well - known musician and Falun Gong adherent who died from abuse in police custody is scheduled to be sentenced to a potentially long prison term in a Beijing Court on Tuesday morning Beijing time ( Monday evening EST ) .
Ms. Xu Na and her husband Yu Zhou , a popular folk band member , were arrested in Beijing on January 26 while returning home from a performance by Yu ’s band .
They were stopped by police at one of many check - points setup throughout Beijing in the run-up to the Olympics as part of Beijing ’s efforts to stamp out potential dissent before the Games began .
During the stop , police discovered they were practitioners of Falun Gong .
Eleven days later , Yu ’s family was told to go to the Qinghe Emergency Center .
When his family arrived , they found him dead .
( news )
Soon after , Yu’s death was mourned in the Chinese blogosphere and reported on by The ( London ) Times ( news ) .
It was also included in a recent submission by Amnesty International to the United Nations Committee on Torture ( news )
His wife Xu Na , herself an award - winning artist , has remained in detention since the couple ’s arrest .
In April , her family was notified that she was to be charged with “ using a heretical organization to undermine implementation of the law , ” a vague provision of the penal code commonly used to sentence Falun Gong adherents to prison terms of up to 12 years .
( Amnesty report )
According to sources inside China , Beijing ’s Chongwen District Court is scheduled to announce the result of the trial against Xu on November 25 , at 9 am ( Beijing time ) .
The court ’s address is 10 Yong Wai Ding An Li , Chongwen District , Beijing .
Xu has been represented by Mr. Cheng Hai of Yitong Law Firm , a well - known human rights lawyer , who has pleaded Xu ’s innocence .
She was released in 2006 after serving a five year sentence for having lent her apartment to Falun Gong adherents traveling to Beijing to appeal to the authorities for an end to the persecution campaign .
While in detention , she was reportedly subjected to torture , including beatings , sleep deprivation , forced - feeding , and being tied into uncomfortable positions for hours .
The Falun Dafa Information Center urges members of the foreign media and diplomatic corps to seek to observe the hearing , fully investigate the circumstances surrounding Xu ’s trial , and call for her immediate and unconditional release .

Leading lawyer calls for Rumsfeld prosecution John Byrne
Published : Friday December 12 , 2008
Print This Email This The President of the legal nonprofit Center for Constitutional Rights , Michael Ratner , has resumed calls for a formal prosecution of ex-Bush Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld following revelations by a Congressional report that Rumsfeld was to blame for the Pentagon 's policy allowing torture .
In a statement , he said that the report reaffirms findings he spelled out in his book published this September , The Trial of Donald Rumsfeld : A Prosecution .
Ratner 's group was the first to volunteer an attorney to meet with one of the CIA 's " ghost detainees . "
" The Committees report reaffirms that high - ranking administration officials , including Donald Rumsfeld , were directly responsible for the abuse and torture of detainees in Guantanamo , Iraq and Afghanistan , " Ratner said in a statement to RAW STORY .
" The brutal interrogation techniques used on our clients and many others were carried out despite well - documented opposition from military lawyers and others concerned by the illegality and ineffectiveness of the techniques . "
" There is no question that Rumsfeld and the others must be held individually accountable , and it must be before a court of law .
There must be consequences for their illegal activities , " he said .
" A special prosecutor should be appointed .
To do otherwise is to send a message of impunity that will only embolden future administrations to again engage in serious violations of the law . "
A Senate Armed Services report issued Thursday asserted that former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and other members of the Bush administration " conveyed the message that physical pressures and degradation were appropriate treatment for detainees . "
According to the committee , prisoners were tortured in the Iraqi prison Abu Ghraib , the US prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , and other US military installations .
Senators Carl Levin ( D - MI ) and John McCain ( R - AZ ) were responsible for the content of the Senate 's findings .
The report determined that placing the blame on " a few bad apples , " as Bush administration officials attempted to do in the aftermath of the Abu Ghraib scandal , is inappropriate .
The policies were adopted after government assessments determined waterboarding and other torture techniques were " 100 percent effective " at breaking the wills of US officers who underwent the military 's Survival Evasion Resistance and Escape program .
Ratner says Rumsfeld 's being singled out is no coincidence .
" After reviewing thousands of documents , this bi-partisan committee confirmed that senior officials are directly responsible for ushering in one of the darkest chapters in our nations history and the loss of our moral authority in the eyes of the world , " Ratner said .
" The report re-asserts that the torture and abuse of detainees in U.S. custody was the result of deliberate decisions made at the top , with explicit approval given by Rumsfeld and other officials for inhumane treatment of prisoners , and was not merely the work of a few bad apples way down the chain of command . "
He addds that report notes that techniques used by the Pentagon were " based on Communist Chinese methods employed to obtain false confessions for propaganda .
Professional interrogators agree that the fastest way to get the best information from a prisoner is through building trust and rapport , not torture .
The recognition of the illegality and unreliability of this kind of evidence is critical in the cases of some of our clients , like Mohammed al Qahtani .
Time and time again , we have seen that torture simply does not work , and only undermines our commitment to basic human rights . "
" We hope the courts and the next administration take notice and take action , " he concludes .

It also claims that " Chinese espionage in the United States is comprehensive and pervasive " and that there is no point in trying to shape Chinese policy by " educating " the Chinese .
Instead , the US must build a new missile shield and " undertake the development of new weapons [...] to convince China that it will not be able to overcome the US militarily . "

Box users will probably need to pay extra attention to their desktop PC as their new PC might be infected with virus .
It was reported in Japan that the new Asus Eee Box low - cost desktop PC has been infected with virus during shipping .
Users who had bought Eee Box PC in Japan found out that there was a virus file named “ recycled.exe ” in the D drive of their new Eee Box B202 .
Once users opened the drive , the virus began copying itself to the main C drive on the machine as well as other removable drives connected to the computer such as USB pen drive , etc .
If users use Norton Antivirus to scan it , the virus name appears to be W32 / SillyFDC .
McAfee named it W32 / Hilin.worm while Kaspersky identified it as Trojan - Spy.Win32.VB.dz .
This worm found in Asus Eee Box is written in Visual Basic .
It uses Microsoft Word icon to fool users into opening it .
It then searches for Microsoft Word documents in the local harddisk and mapped network drives .
These Word documents are deleted and replaced with a copy of the worm itself .
It adopts the same filename as the original document and changes the extension to *.exe .
Scanned result via Norton Antivirus shown the computer affected by W32 / SillyFDC worm
Asustek has yet to reply and confirm whether this virus problem is only limited to the Japan market or worldwide .
The company also did n’t give any explanation on how the virus got into the computers .
However , the company ’s Japanese arm has alerted owners of this PC model to be more cautious .

John McCain ’s fulminations against President - elect Barack Obama ’s socialism or infatuation with redistributing wealth were as risible as would be former President Bill Clinton lecturing Pinocchio on the evils of mendacity .
For the last century , both the Republican and Democratic parties have embraced the morality if not the economic wisdom of the progressive income tax and government spending to redistribute wealth .
The parties differ in inches as how much redistribution would be morally or economically optimal .
But the Republican and Democratic orthodoxy  held as fervently as the geocentric theory of the universe before Copernicus  are wrongheaded .
Morality and economic prosperity militate in favor of turning the prevailing progressive income tax scheme on its head .
They also argue against government redistributions of wealth through spending , including the $ 700 billion Troubled Assets Relief Act of 2008 , which was championed by President Bush , Mr. McCain , and the president - elect alike .
It lavishly rewards the prodigal , financially irresponsible , and politically connected at the expense of the thrifty and prudent .
All governments are inclined to employ the taxing and spending powers to advantage persons who wield political power  either singly or collectively .
During pre-Revolutionary France , the First and Second Estates were exempt from taxation .
In the United States , political power has been progressively captured by the masses as barriers to voting tumbled and checks against majoritarian tyranny receded .

( 汎用 ) プログラミングと呼ばれている形を使用することができます。これと同様の機能は、C++、Ada、そして
Java™ 言語など、最近の多くのプログラミング言語でも見つかるはずです。Linux では、 typeof を使用して、型に依存する演算処理 ( min 、 max など ) を作成します。リスト 1 に、 typeof によって汎用マクロを作成する方法を記載します (./linux/include/linux/kernel.h から抜粋 ) 。
リスト 1. typeof を使用した汎用マクロの作 成
# define min(x , y ) ( { \ typeof ( x ) _min1 = ( x ) ; \ typeof ( y ) _min2 = ( y ) ; \ ( void ) ( &_min1 == &_min2 ) ; \ _min1 < _min2 ?
_min1 : _min2 ; })
範囲拡張
GCC に含まれる範囲のサポートは、C 言語のさまざまな領域で活用することができます。これに該当する領域の
1 つは、 switch / case ブロック内の case 文です。複雑な条件構造では通常 if 文のカスケードに依存しなければ実現できないような結果が、リスト
2 では簡潔に表現されています (./linux/drivers/scsi/sd.c から抜粋 ) 。 switch / case を使用すれば、ジャンプ・テーブルの実装を使用することによってコンパイラーを最適化することも可能です。
リスト 2 . case 文のなかでの範囲の使 用
static int sd_major ( int major_idx ) { switch ( major_idx ) { case 0 : return SCSI_DISK0 _MAJOR ; case 1 ... 7 : return SCSI_DISK1_MAJOR + major_idx - 1 ; case 8 ... 15 : return SCSI_DISK8 _MAJOR + major_idx - 8 ; default : BUG ( ) ; return 0 ; /* shut up gcc */ } }
以下に示すように、範囲は初期化にも適用することができます
(./linux/arch/cris/arch-v32/kernel/smp.c から抜粋 ) 。この例では、 spinlock_t からサイズが LOCK_COUNT
の配列を作成しています。配列の各要素は、
SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED
の値で初期化されます。
/* Vector of locks used for various atomic operations */ spinlock_t cris_atomic_locks [ ] = { [ 0 ...
LOCK_COUNT - 1 ] = SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED} ;
また、範囲ではこれより複雑な初期化もサポートします。以下は、配列のサブ範囲の初期値を指定するコードの例です。
int widths [ ] = { [ 0 ... 9 ] = 1 , [ 10 ... 99 ] = 2 , [ 100 ] = 3 } ;
ゼロ長の配 列
標準 C では、配列を構成する要素を少なくとも 1 つは定義しなければなりません。コードの設計が複雑になりがちなのは、この要件が原因となっています。一方
GCC ではゼロ長の配列という概念をサポートしており、構造体を定義する際、この概念を利用すると便利です。この概念は
ISO C99 での柔軟な配列メンバーに似ていますが、使用する構文は異なります。
以下の例 (./linux / drivers/ieee1394/raw1394-private.h から抜粋 ) で構造体の最後で宣言しているのは、要素数がゼロの配列です。これにより、構造体のメンバーは、構造体インスタンスのすぐ後に続くメモリーを参照することが可能になります。この方法は、配列の要素の数を可変にしなければならない場合に役立つはずです。
struct iso_block_store { atomic_t refcount ; size_t data_size ; quadlet_t data [ 0 ] ; } ;
呼び出しアドレスの判断
多くのインスタンスでは、特定の関数の呼び出し側を判断することが役に立つ場合や、あるいはその必要がある場合があります。GCC
には、まさにそれを目的にした組み込み関数、 __builtin_return_address が用意されています。この関数は一般的にデバッグに使用されているものですが、カーネル内では他にも多くの用途があります。
以下のコードに示されているように、 __builtin_return_address
は level という引数を取ります。この引数が定義するのは、戻りアドレスの取得対象とする呼び出しスタックのレベルです。例えば level を
0 に指定すると、現行の関数の戻りアドレスを要求することになり、 level を 1 に指定すると、呼び出し側関数の戻りアドレスを要求することになります。
void * __builtin_return_address ( unsigned int level ) ;
以下の例 (./linux/kernel/softirq.c から抜粋 ) にある local_bh_disable は、ローカル側プロセッサーでのソフトウェア割り込みを無効にして、softirq、tasklet、ボトムハーフが現行プロセッサーで実行されないようにします。 __builtin_return_address を使用して戻りアドレスを取得するため、後で追跡する際には、このアドレスを使用することが可能になります。
void local_bh_disable ( void ) { __local_bh_disable (( unsigned long)__builtin_return_address(0 ) ) ; }
定数検出
GCC には、コンパイル時に値が定数であるかどうかを判断するために使用できる組み込み関数が用意されています。定数であることがわかれば定数畳み込みによって最適化できる式を作成できるため、値が定数であるかどうかは貴重な情報となります。この
__builtin_constant_p
関数は、定数であるかどうかをテストするために使用します。
以下に、 __builtin_constant_p のプロトタイプを記載します。 __builtin_constant_p はすべての定数を確認できるわけではないことに注意してください。これは、一部の定数は
GCC によって定数であることを証明するのが簡単ではないためです。
int __builtin_constant_p( exp )
Linux では定数検出をかなり頻繁に使用します。リスト 3 に記載する例 (./linux/include/linux/log2.h から抜粋 ) では、定数検出を使用し て roundup_pow_of_two マクロを最適化します。式を定数として確認できた場合には
( 最適化に使用可能な ) 定数式が使用されます。式が定数でない場合には、値を 2 の累乗に切り上げるために別のマクロ関数が呼び出されます。
リスト 3 . 定数の検出によるマクロ関数の最適化
# define roundup_pow_of_two(n ) \ ( \ __builtin_constant_p(n ) ? ( \ ( n == 1 ) ? 1 : \ ( 1UL << ( ilog2 ( ( n ) - 1 ) + 1 ) ) \ ) : \ __roundup_pow_of_two(n ) \ )
関数属性
GCC には多種多様な関数レベルの属性が用意されており、これらの属性によって、最適化プロセスを支援する、より多くのデータをコンパイラーに提供することができます。このセクションでは機能に関連する属性を抜粋して説明します。最適化に影響する属性については次のセクションで説明します。
リスト 4 に示すように、属性にはシンボリック定義によって別名が割り当てられます。このリストに照らし合わせながら、(/linux/include/linux/compiler-gcc3.h で定義された ) 属性の使用方法を説明するソース参照を読んでください。
リスト 4 . 関数属性の定義
# define __inline__ __inline__ __attribute__(( always_inline ) ) # define __deprecated __attribute__( ( deprecated ) ) # define __attribute_used__ __attribute__(( __used__ ) ) # define __attribute_const__ __attribute__(( __const__ ) ) # define __must_check __attribute__((warn_unused_result ) )
リスト 4 に記載した定義は 、GCC で使用可能な一部の関数属性を反映しています。これらの関数属性は、Linux カーネルでもとりわけ役立つものです。以下に、その最適な使用方法を説明します。
always_inline は GCC に対し、最適化が有効であるかどうかに関わらず、指定した関数をインライン化するように指定します。
は GCC に対し、最適化が有効であるかどうかに関わらず、指定した関数をインライン化するように指定します。 deprecated は、関数がすでに廃止されていて、現在使用できないことを通知します。廃止された関数を使用しようとすると、警告を受け取ります。この属性を型および変数に適用すれば、開発者がこれらのカーネル・アセットに依存しないようにすることができます。
は、関数がすでに廃止されていて、現在使用できないことを通知します。廃止された関数を使用しようとすると、警告を受け取ります。この属性を型および変数に適用すれば、開発者がこれらのカーネル・アセットに依存しないようにすることができます。
__used__ はコンパイラーに対し、GCC
が該当する関数への呼び出しインスタンスを検出するかしないかに関わらず、この関数を使用するように指示します。この属性は、C
関数をアセンブラから呼び出す場合に役立ちます。
はコンパイラーに対し、GCC
が該当する関数への呼び出しインスタンスを検出するかしないかに関わらず、この関数を使用するように指示します。この属性は、C
関数をアセンブラから呼び出す場合に役立ちます。 __const__ はコンパイラーに対し、ある特定の関数には状態がないことを通知します
( つまり、関数は渡された引数を使用して結果を生成し、返すということです ) 。
はコンパイラーに対し、ある特定の関数には状態がないことを通知します
( つまり、関数は渡された引数を使用して結果を生成し、返すということです)。 warn_unused_result は、すべての呼び出し側が関数の結果を確認していることをコンパイラーに確認させます。これにより、呼び出し側が対応するエラーを処理できるように、適切に関数の結果を確認することになります。
以下は 、Linux カーネルでの上記の関数の使用例です。 deprecated の例はアーキテクチャーに固有ではないカーネル (./linux/kernel/resource.c ) から抜粋し、 const の例は IA64 カーネル・ソース (./linux/arch/ia64/kernel/unwind.c ) から抜粋しています。
int __deprecated __check_region ( struct resource * parent , unsigned long start , unsigned long n ) static enum unw_register_index __attribute_const__ decode_abreg ( unsigned char abreg , int memory )
最適化に関する拡張機能
ここからは、できる限り最適なマシン・コードを作成するために用意された
GCC の裏技を探っていきます。
分岐予測のヒン ト
Linux カーネルで最も使用されている最適化手法のなかで、最も汎用的な手法の
1 つは、 __builtin_expect です。条件付きコードに取り組む際には、最も可能性の高い分岐がどれで、そうではない分岐がどれかであるかが明らかな場合がよくあります。コンパイラーにこのような予測情報があれば、分岐に関する最適なコードを生成することが可能になります。
以下に示すように、 __builtin_expect を使用するには、 likely と unlikely という 2 つのマクロをベースにします (./linux/include/linux/compiler.h から抜粋 ) 。
# define likely (x ) __builtin_expect (!!( x ) , 1 ) # define unlikely ( x ) __builtin_expect (!!( x ) , 0 )
__builtin_expect によって、コンパイラーは提供された予測情報に従って命令選択の決定を行えるようになるため、コードが条件に即して ( 分岐によるジャンプもなく ) 実行される可能性が極めて高くなります。それだけでなく、キャッシングおよび命令のパイプライン化を改善することにもなります。
例えば、条件に 「 likely 」というマークが付いていれば、コンパイラーは
( おそらく分岐命令によるジャンプはないであろう ) 分岐命令の直後にコードの
True の部分を配置することができ、条件 の
False の部分 ( 実行される可能性も低く、パフォーマンスも最適ではない部分)
は分岐命令によってジャンプした先に配置されるようになります。このようにして、コードは最も可能性の高い場合に合わせて最適化されるというわけです。
リスト 5 に、 likely と unlikely 両方のマクロを使用した関数を記載します (./linux/net/core/datagram.c から抜粋 ) 。この関数が期待する内容は、 sum 変数がゼロになり ( checksum はパケットに有効 ) 、 ip_summed 変数が CHECKSUM_HW と等しくならないということです 。
リスト 5 . likely および unlikely マクロの使用 例
unsigned int __skb_checksum_complete( struct sk_buff * skb ) { unsigned int sum ; sum = ( u16)csum_fold(skb_checksum(skb , 0 , skb ->len , skb->csum ) ) ; if ( likely ( !sum ) ) { if ( unlikely ( skb-> ip_summed == CHECKSUM_HW ) ) netdev_rx_csum_fault(skb->dev ) ; skb->ip_summed = CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY ; } return sum ; }
プリフェッ チ
パフォーマンスを向上させるもう 1 つの重要な方法は、必要なデータをプロセッサーの近くのメモリーにキャッシングすることです。キャッシングにより、データにアクセスする時間は最小限に短縮されます。最近のほとんどのプロセッサーはアクセス時間の異なる 3 種類のメモリーを内部に持っています。
レベル 1 キャッシュ。通例、単一サイクルでのアクセスが可能です 。
レベル 2 キャッシュ 。2 サイクルでのアクセスが可能です。
システム・メモリー。これより長いアクセス・サイクルを必要とします。
アクセス待ち時間を最小限にしてパフォーマンスを向上させる最善の方法は、データを最も近いメモリーに入れることです。このタスクを手動で行うことを、プリフェッチと呼びます。GCC
がデータの手動プリフェッチをサポートするために使う手段は、 __builtin_prefetch という組み込み関数です。この関数を使用して、データが必要になる直前にデータをキャッシュに入れます。 __builtin_prefetch 関数は以下の 3 つの引数を取ります。
データのアドレ ス
rw パラメーター。このパラメーターを使用して 、Read 操作のためにデータを取り込んでいるのか 、Write 操作のためにデータを準備しているのかを示します。
パラメーター。このパラメーターを使用して、Read 操作のためにデータを取り込んでいるのか、Write 操作のためにデータを準備しているのかを示します。 locality パラメーター。このパラメーターは、データをキャッシュに残しておくか、あるいは使用した後にパージするかを定義するために使用します。
void __builtin_prefetch ( const void * addr , int rw , int locality ) ;
Linux カーネルでは、プリフェッチを広範に使用します。なかでも最もよく使われている方法は、マクロとラッパー関数によるプリフェッチです。リスト
6 は、組み込み関数にラッパーを適用したヘルパー関数の例です (./linux/include/linux/prefetch.h から抜粋)。この関数はストリーム操作に対し、プリエンプティブな先読みメカニズムを実装します。この関数を使用するとキャッシュ・ミスとパイプラインのストールが最小限になるため、通常はパフォーマンスの向上につながります。
リスト 6 . ラッパー関数による範囲のプリフェッチ
#ifndef ARCH_HAS_PREFETCH
# define prefetch(x ) __builtin_prefetch(x ) #endif static inline void prefetch_range ( void * addr , size_t len ) { #ifdef ARCH_HAS_PREFETCH char * cp ; char * end = addr + len ; for ( cp = addr ; cp < end ; cp += PREFETCH_STRIDE ) prefetch ( cp ) ; #endif }
変数属性
この記事で前述した関数属性に加え、GCC
には変数および型定義のための属性もあります。そのうち最も重要な属性の
1 つは、メモリー内のオブジェクトの配置に使用する aligned 属性です。オブジェクトの配置はパフォーマンスにとって重要であるだけでなく、特定のデバイスまたはハードウェア構成には必須となる場合もあります。 aligned 属性が取る引数は 1 つだけで、この引数によって目的とする配置タイプが指定されます。
以下は、ソフトウェア・サスペンドに使用する例です
(./linux/arch/i386/mm/init.c から抜粋 ) 。
PAGE_SIZE オブジェクトは、ページ位置合わせの必要に応じて定義されます。
char __nosavedata swsusp_pg_dir[ PAGE_SIZE ] __attribute__ ( ( aligned ( PAGE_SIZE ) ) ) ;
リスト 7 の例では、最適化に関する要点が明らかに示されています。
packed 属性は構造体の要素を圧縮し、使用するスペースを最小限にします。つまり、 char 変数を定義する場合、その使用するスペースは 1 バイト ( 8 ビット ) 以下になるということです。ビット・フィールドは
1 ビットに圧縮され、それ以上のスペースは使用されません。
属性は構造体の要素を圧縮し、使用するスペースを最小限にします。つまり、
変数を定義する場合、その使用するスペースは 1 バイト ( 8 ビット ) 以下になるということです。ビット・フィールドは
1 ビットに圧縮され、それ以上のスペースは使用されません。
このソースは、カンマ区切りリストで複数の属性を定義する単一の __attribute__ を指定することによって最適化された記述方法になっています。
リスト 7 . 構造体の圧縮と複数の属性の設定
static struct swsusp_header { char reserved [ PAGE_SIZE - 20 - sizeof ( swp_entry_t ) ] ; swp_entry_t image ; char orig_sig [ 10 ] ; char sig [ 10 ] ; } __attribute__( ( packed , aligned ( PAGE_SIZE ) ) ) swsusp_header ;

The money is be used to fund research on agricultural emissions .
However New Zealand farmers argue that taxpayers should pay for the research , because reducing the emissions benefits everyone .
" This decision is yet another example of the government 's desire to act in the wider public interest but expecting rural New Zealand to pay for its largesse , " Federated Farmers President Tom Lambie said .
Sheep , cattle , goats and deer produce large quantities of gas through belching and flatulence , as their multiple stomachs digest grass .
Ruminants are responsible for about 25 % of the methane produced in Britain .
In countries with a large agricultural sector , the proportion is much higher .
In New Zealand , farm animals produce 90 % of methane emissions .
SAN FRANCISCO — A week after ballot initiatives banning same - sex marriage passed in Arizona , California , and Florida , bringing the total number of states with constitutional amendments barring gay marriage to 30 , the fierce battle over this culture war issue appears to be far from over .
Yesterday , Connecticut became the third state ever to issue marriage licenses to same - sex couples , a month after the state 's Supreme Court ruled that gays and lesbians have the right to marry under the state Constitution .
Unlike California , where the state 's Supreme Court issued a similar ruling earlier this year only to see it overturned by ballot initiative , there is no statewide initiative process in Connecticut that would allow the ruling to be reversed .
Connecticut voters could have supported a measure on last week 's ballot that would have called for a convention to amend the state 's Constitution , but the measure failed .
Under the state Constitution , the question can go on the ballot only once every 20 years .
Connecticut joins Massachusetts as one of only two states where same - sex marriage is legal , and it appears likely to stay that way .
" Today , Connecticut sends a message of hope and promise to lesbian and gay people throughout the country who want to be treated as equal citizens by their government , " said Ben Klein , a lawyer with Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders , which litigated the Connecticut case .
" It is living proof that marriage equality is moving forward in this country . "
Opponents of same - sex marriage , after a series of dramatic victories in this fall 's elections , do not have much recourse in Connecticut , but they vowed to fight the new law in future elections .
" Unlike California , we did not have a remedy , " said Peter Wolfgang , executive director of the Family Institute of Connecticut .
" It must be overturned with patience , determination , and fortitude . "
As gay couples in Connecticut celebrated , same - sex marriage supporters in California continued to protest the passage of Proposition 8 , which eliminated the right of gay and lesbian couples to marry .
Protests have been held across the state every day since the election , including several passionate demonstrations outside Mormon places of worship in Los Angeles and Oakland .
According to some estimates , more than 40 percent of the money donated to defeat the same - sex marriage initiative came from individuals associated with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints .
A church spokesperson has condemned the protests as discriminatory .
While the protests grow more heated , there appears to be a growing divide among gay rights groups about what their next step should be .
Three lawsuits have been filed asking the state Supreme Court to overturn the new law , and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , for one , seemed to indicate his support for a court challenge of last week 's results .
" It 's unfortunate , obviously , but it's not the end , " Schwarzenegger said on CNN .
" I think that we will again maybe undo that , if the court is willing to do that , and then move forward from there . "
Schwarzenegger compared the ban on same - sex marriage to the state 's old antimiscegenation laws , which were overturned by the state 's Supreme Court in the 1940s .
" It 's the same as in the 1948 [ California ] case when blacks and whites were not allowed to marry , " he said .
" This falls into the same category . "
Some civil rights experts , however , argue that the California courts may no longer be the best place to take the fight for same - sex marriage .
A group of activists in southern California is organizing an effort to hold simultaneous protests in every state capital and Washington , D.C. , over the weekend .
As support for that effort grows , some observers have noted that same - sex marriage supporters may have made all the progress they are going to make in the courts .
" I think it would be a real mistake to have a big popular referendum and then tell the people , ' For these technical legal reasons , which none of you will understand , we 're not going to let you have your way , ' " says Michael Klarman , a law professor at Harvard University who has written extensively on the history of civil rights .
Overturning Proposition 8 on a legal technicality might provoke California voters , 52 percent of whom supported the measure last week .
" I do n't blame people for being upset , " says Klarman , who points out that only eight years ago , in 2000 , more than 60 percent of the state 's voters supported a similar measure .
" What is that , a percentage point every year ?
I think the better strategy for gay rights groups is not to try to get the California court to say this is invalid on technical grounds , but rather just accept the loss and say , ' In two years , we 're going to fight again .
We can read the tea leaves and we 're gaining an average of 1 percent a year , so in two years , we 'll fight harder and make better arguments , and we 'll probably win . '
I think if you get the court to strike it down , you 'll just create a backlash . "

From the Financial Times :
Important US research to reduce HIV infection may have been prevented in recent years because scientists have censored their funding requests in response to political controversy , according to a study published on Tuesday .
Writing in PLoS Medicine , the academic journal , Joanna Kempner from Rutgers University identified a “ chilling effect ” on researchers seeking grants from the government - backed National Institutes of Health after their work was questioned by Republican lawmakers and Christian groups .
The findings suggest politics influence scientists ’ willingness to conduct research , and raise warnings at a time of continued sensitivity over medical research topics from sexual behaviour to stem cells .
Among 82 researchers polled by Ms Kempner , who had received money from the NIH , almost a quarter had dropped or reframed studies around sexual behaviour they judged to be politically sensitive , and four had made career changes and left academia as a result of the controversy .
VATICAN CITY -
The Vatican is endorsing new technology that brings the book of daily prayers used by priests straight onto iPhones .
The Vatican 's Pontifical Council for Social Communications is embracing the iBreviary , an iTunes application created by a technologically savvy Italian priest , the Rev. Paolo Padrini , and an Italian Web designer .
The application includes the Breviary prayer book - in Italian , English , Spanish , French and Latin and , in the near future , Portuguese and German .
Another section includes the prayers of the daily Mass , and a third contains various other prayers .
After a free trial period in which the iBreviary was downloaded approximately 10,000 times in Italy , an official version was released earlier this month , Padrini said .
The application costs euro0.79 ( $ 1.10 ) , while upgrades will be free .
Padrini 's proceeds are going to charity .
Monsignor Paul Tighe , secretary of the Vatican 's Pontifical Council for Social Communications , praised the new application Monday , saying the Church " is learning to use the new technologies primarily as a tool or as a mean of evangelizing , as a way of being able to share its own message with the world .

— About 43 million gallons of wastewater run beneath the streets of Raleigh every day .
When something blocks a sewer main , the results can be nasty and expensive .
Raleigh officials can get an up - close look at what 's going on underground with a " sewer cam . "
Robert Smith supervises camera crews that are responsible for keeping track of the city ’s 2,300 miles of sewer lines – enough pipe to run from Raleigh to Las Vegas .
Smith ’s crews send cameras into the sewer mains to look for anything that could stop the flow and cause an overflow .
Fats , oils and grease , for example , can harden and block lines .
" It takes about a year for the camera crews to inspect all of the city 's sewer lines .
When they find a problem , they call out a cleaning truck to flush the line , ” Smith said .
Raleigh has seen dozens of sewer overflows in the past year – more than 1 million gallons of dangerous , disgusting wastewater that workers had to clean up .
Grease caused 40 percent of those overflows , according to city officials .
“ Some are going to occur out there .
We want to minimize those that do occur , ” said Dale Crisp , Raleigh ’s public utilities director .
The public can do a lot to help .
For instance , pour household grease into a container and throw it in the trash , not down the drain .
“ Just think about what you put down up in there .
It only takes a second to pour grease in a bottle and dump it , ” Smith said .
The city pays $ 50 to the first person who reports a sewer overflow .

On a sunny Saturday morning , Mr. McCain ’s audience seemed made up mainly of his base .
They cheered loudly when he mentioned Ms. Palin and “ Joe the Plumber , ” the Ohio man who has become a symbol of Mr. McCain ’s newly fashioned economic message , that Mr. Obama ’s statement about wanting to “ spread the wealth around ” revealed him to be a socialist .
Mr. McCain had spoken briefly the week before in Wilmington ( also Bush country ) , but until then he had not visited the state since the May primaries .

Hitler planned ' Big Brother ' style television to broadcast Nazi propaganda
Adolf Hitler was on the verge of creating a ' Big Brother ' style version of cable television to broadcast Nazi propaganda
Adolf Hitler was on the verge of creating an Orwellian - style cable TV system to broadcast Nazi propaganda around Germany .
Screens would have been set up in public places , including in laundries so housewives could tune in , according to a documentary based on papers and tapes found in his bunker .
When the Allies overran Germany , engineers were on the point of a technological breakthrough to allow TV pictures to be transmitted to screens and sound to radio receivers .
They had also recorded programmes on news , sport and education .
Prototype programmes included Family Chronicles : An Evening With Hans And Gelli , an early reality TV show depicting the wholesome Aryan life of a young German couple for the rest of the population to model themselves on .
Another plan was to show footage of executions of traitors to the Nazis .
The plans first came to light in 1945 , when boxes with tapes were found in the ruins of Berlin by Soviet soldiers , the Russian documentary says .
According to the programme , the engineer Walter Bruch was asked to make ' people 's television ' a reality .
He tabled a document to Hitler called ' Plan to supply people 's transmitter to German homes , ' and the laying of a broadband cable between Berlin and Nuremberg was begun , it claimed .
Mass television broadcasts by Big Brother were a fundamental part of the regime in Orwell 's 1984
A former SS officer , Curt Schulmeitser , told the programme how a relative of Hitler 's mistress Eva Braun was filmed being shot after being caught trying to flee Berlin as the Soviet army advanced .
Schulmeitser said Hitler 's deputy Heinrich Himmler authorised the filming and hinted it was being filmed for Hitler to watch .
He said : ' Himmler wanted somebody else in a different place to see what was going on . '
Josef Hebbels , who masterminded the plan , told Rudolph Hess 's sister Margaret , who was also working on the scheme : ' We 'll be able to show whatever we want .
We 'll create a reality , which the people of Germany need and can copy .
Your task is to teach German women to live this way ' .
Hitler early on realised the power of television propaganda .
His address at the opening ceremony of the Berlin Olympic Games in 1936 was broadcast to system of bulky mobile TV stations where Germans could watch in town squares .
But the programme claims the Nazi leader and his scientists were planning a far more complex series of public TV screens before the allies overran Germany and he committed suicide in 1945 .
The scheme is reminiscent of George Orwell 's novel 1984 , where Big Brother looms out from public screens entreating the subdued populace to work for the state and telling them ' Big Brother is watching you ' .
The reality television show , Big Brother , in which contestants are under constant surveillance , is based on Orwell 's concept .

People collected water from wells in Harare after supplies were cut A cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe has killed at least 484 people since August , according to the UN .
More than 11,700 cases of cholera have been recorded over the same period , an update from the UN office for humanitarian affairs said .
The cholera outbreak has affected most of Zimbabwe 's regions .
Its spread has been aided by the collapse of Zimbabwe 's health and sanitation systems amid a prolonged economic and political crisis .
Previously it had been reported that 425 people had died from cholera , which is spread by contaminated water .
See detailed map of affected areas State media has reported that much of the capital , Harare , has been left without water because of a shortage of purification chemicals .
The World Health Organization has warned that the outbreak " can spread quickly into areas without access to safe water and sanitation " .
" Case fatality rates may rapidly escalate in populations without rapid access to simple treatments , " it said .
Shaking hands Cholera is endemic in Zimbabwe , and there have been outbreaks annually since 1998 , according to the WHO .
Proper hygiene is the best protection against cholera and you can't do that without clean water
Marcus Bachmann
Medecins Sans Frontieres
Harare diary : ' Too much to take ' Hospital death throes Health Minister David Parirenyatwa has said people should stop shaking hands to prevent the disease spreading .
He said it was the worst ever cholera outbreak in Harare .
Cholera can be treated easily but hospitals lack medicines and staff .
The WHO said Zimbabwe 's health facilities face a " massive gap " in required medicines due to a drop in local manufacturing capacity , weakened in turn by a shortage of foreign currency .
Marcus Bachmann from medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres told the BBC that many poorer areas of the capital had been without water for several months and this was a major factor in the severity of the outbreak .
" Proper hygiene is the best protection against cholera and you can't do that without clean water , " he said .
Cases of cholera have been reported either side of Zimbabwe 's borders with South Africa , Botswana and Mozambique , showing the sub-regional threat of the outbreak , it said .
' Sub-regional threat '
The BBC's Peter Biles reports from the South African town of Musina , near the border with Zimbabwe , that cholera patients are being treated at an emergency centre on the lawn in front of the hospital .

The country is dying and people are dying . "
South Africa 's ministry of health has confirmed more than 160 cholera cases , including three deaths .
Zimbabwe 's government has blamed its crisis on Western sanctions it says are aimed at trying to bring down President Robert Mugabe .
But the sanctions imposed after allegations of electoral fraud and political violence are aimed at Mr Mugabe and his close associates and consist of travel bans and a freeze on their foreign assets .
Zimbabwe is facing a severe economic crisis .
The latest estimated annual inflation rate was 231,000,000 % , and just one adult in ten is thought to have a regular job .

Cruz Beckham Incognito ( PHOTOS )
has a real flare for fashion , apparently taking after his famous mother .
The pair were spotted shopping at Saks Fifth Avenue in Los Angeles on Friday .
Masked crusader Cruz was decked out in a Robin costume with no Batman in sight .
VB settled for dark glasses and normal streetwear .
The interesting thing is that Cruz ' mom has always given the impression that being photographed while on her private time is a major intrusion and the source of her usually dour expression .
We begin to wonder if that is really the case .
Actually things have died down for Posh and her soccer phenom husband David Beckham .
The Beckham 's have been in L.A. for 16 months and the honeymoon seems to be over with the U.S. press , although the Pap still manage to snap thousands of boring photos of Becks in his awesome cars .
Perhaps Cruz is Victoria 's little ploy to amp up the media coverage .
Earlier in the week Cruz was sporting a Santa hat and dark glasses .
Check out more photos showing that and other Cruz disguises below .

Why does Google log the details of search queries for so long ?
What does it do with the information ?
Does it combine data from the search engine with information it collects through other avenues - such as its recently released web browser , Chrome ?
Data gathered through most of the company 's services " disappears into a black hole once it hits the Googleplex , " said Simon Davies , director of London - based Privacy International , referring to Google 's headquarters .
" It 's impossible to track that information . "
Google - whose corporate motto is " Do n't Be Evil " - generally sees such concerns as misinformed .
For instance , the company says it stores the queries made through its popular search engine primarily so it can improve the service .
But whether the criticisms are valid or not , they are likely indicative of the battles Google will face as it , like Microsoft in the 1990s , moves from world - wowing startup to the heart of the technology establishment .
The September release of Chrome illuminated the budding conflicts .
To Google , the new browser is a platform on which future web - based software applications might run most efficiently .
It also is a sign that Google understands its growing power , since launching a browser is a direct challenge to Microsoft .
In other circles , Chrome provoked suspicion .
One group , California - based Consumer Watchdog , argues that the browser crosses a new line .
In a mid-October letter to Google directors , Consumer Watchdog said it had " serious privacy concerns " about the browser and the transfer of users ' data through Google 's services without giving people what it sees as " appropriate transparency and control . "
One of Consumer Watchdog 's complaints surrounds Chrome 's navigation bar , which can be used to enter a website address or a search query .
The group points out that as users type in the navigation bar , Chrome relays their keystrokes to Google even before they click " Enter " to finalise the command .
" The company is literally having this unnoticed conversation with itself about you and your information , " Consumer Watchdog President Jamie Court said .
This " conversation " stems from the " Google Suggest " feature , which is built into the browser and other Google products , including its basic internet search engine .
" Google Suggest " sends
Google searches as you type , in hopes of anticipating your desires .
So if you 're keying in " Electoral College 2008 election , " Google will offer multiple search queries along the way .
First you'd be given results related to the term " electoral , " then ones on the Electoral College in general , and finally you 'd get links pertaining to Tuesday 's presidential vote .
This is what worries Consumer Watchdog :
Say you key in something that could be embarrassing or deeply personal , but reconsider before you press " Enter . "
The autosuggest feature still sends this phrase to Google 's servers , tied to your computer 's numeric Internet Protocol ( IP ) address .
Brian Rakowski , the product manager for Chrome , said Consumer Watchdog 's fears stemmed from confusion about the role a Google web browser plays .
" There was some concern that , given a very naive way of how browsers work , you may think , ' Now I 'm using a Google browser - Google must know everything on their servers about me , ' " he said .
Rakowski said queries sent to Google through the autosuggest feature do include data like a user 's IP address and the time at which the queries were made .
But Google logs just 2 per cent of the information brought in through " Google Suggest , " in order to improve the feature , Rakowski said , and anonymises this data within 24 hours .
The anonymisation is accomplished by stripping off the last four digits of the IP address associated with the query .
" You 're flying blind without that information , so we have to collect a little bit , " he said .
" But we 're really ( collecting ) the bare minimum we can to provide that service . "
The autosuggest function can be shut off in the browser or when using Google 's search engine through its home page , but it is not immediately evident how to do so .
One way is through Chrome 's " incognito " tab , which turns off the autosuggest feature and lets users surf the web without revealing their activities to people who have access to the same computer .
However , Consumer Watchdog objects to the design of " incognito . "
The group claims the feature makes users feel that their web surfing is totally private , while in fact Google is still sending some information back and forth between users '
PCs and the company 's servers .
Google takes issue with that complaint , too .
The " incognito " function lets users surf without leaving a trail of pages visited or " cookie " data - tracking files behind , but ca n't entirely cloak someone 's Internet activity from the outside world .
" We try to be very upfront with users when they enter this mode about what it provides and what it does n't provide , " Rakowski said .
Although Chrome is new , Consumer Watchdog is not waiting to see whether it gets too little use to worry about .
In October , Court 's group wrote to U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey to caution him about Google 's plans to sell ads for Yahoo , saying that its fears about Google 's market power have been exacerbated by Chrome 's release .
" It 's about having a monopoly over our personal information , which , if it falls into the wrong hands , could be used in a very dangerous way against us , " Court said .
Google 's senior product counsel , Michael Yang , said the company is not using any data from Chrome to make improvements to its ad services .
But that does n't mollify privacy critics , who fear Google might start doing that someday to best capitalise on its vast audience .
Some 650 million people use Google 's search engine and panoply of web services .
" The way Google has fashioned Chrome , it 's a digital Trojan horse to collect even more masses of consumer data for Google 's digital advertising business , " said Jeff Chester , executive director for the Center for Digital Democracy , a consumer rights organisation .
For now , at least , Google is planning to adopt just one change suggested by Consumer Watchdog .
When users spell a Web site 's address incorrectly , Chrome sends a request to Google to help determine the actual site the user is trying to visit .
This happens even when users are surfing " incognito , " and Rakowski said it was an oversight .
" It 's something we 're prioritizing now that we want to fix , " he said .
This is not to say that Google is avoiding other privacy - related changes .
In July , the company began linking to its privacy policy on its home page .
It also recently began its anonymisation of the data it stores through the " Google Suggest " feature .
But one other privacy - related move might say more about how Google is perceived than anything .
In September , to placate European Union data protection officials , Google said it would maintain its search logs - which track search queries and the IP addresses they came from - for nine months instead of 18 , as it had been doing .
After that time , Google will alter IP addresses to mask their source .
( That probably wo n't provide true anonymity , since an aggregated list of search queries over time will likely reveal clues about who made them . )
Google hoped the move would win it favour .
After all , Microsoft waits 18 months before it anonymises its search engine logs , and Yahoo does so after 13 .
Even so , the EU 's justice and home affairs commissioner said Google should shorten its logs further , to six months .
Davies , of Privacy International , says the change from 18 to nine months was " not meaningful . "
Court says that with all its products , Google has more opportunities than its peers to capture personal information without users realising it .
" Google 's founders may say , ' We 're going to protect that information , ' but no other company , " he said , " is positioned to exploit that information in the way Google is . "

Scientists Reach Hydrogen Storage Milestone
October 6th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Hydrogen cars may be feasible sooner than previously thought thanks to the efforts of a research team at the University of Crete in Greece .
The scientists have developed a hydrogen storage model that can store up to 41 grams of hydrogen per liter — almost matching the US Department of Energy ’s target of 45 grams per liter .
The storage structure consists of graphene sheets that are only one atom thick connected by vertical columns of carbon nanotubes .
Hydrogen is stored in the gaps between the nanotubes and the graphene sheets .
The researchers also added lithium ions to the structure for increased storage capacity .
In the past , one of the major drawbacks in using hydrogen for transportation purposes has been a lack of storage ability .
This new discovery comes close to removing that hurdle .
But since most hydrogen is still produced using fossil fuels , we still have a ways to go before hydrogen - powered cars are ready for commercial use .

I have a confession to make .
I love not one despised style of music , but two : heavy metal , and country& western .
As they scroll down my iPod , my friends weep – and retch .
And it gets worse : I believe these eruptions of noise offer a political parable .
Really : set aside your prejudices and your earplugs and stock up on metal and country .
You will slowly see we have misunderstood two of the most politically charged , politically reviled places on earth : the Muslim world , and the Deep South .
Do n't turn the page over ; stay with me .
I first realised that my never - quite - abandoned adolescent taste for heavy metal had a political edge in – of all places – the Jaballya refugee camp in Gaza .
I was interviewing teenagers about their strangled lives and expected to hear the usual Hamasnik lines reeled back at me .
But instead , they kept using words from Metallica and Slipknot to explain how they felt .
" I am dying to live / Cry out / I'm trapped under ice , " one of them said .
They showed me their carefully - stashed CDs and T - shirts – liable to be seized by Hamas - militia at any time – and begged me to send more .
After I returned home , I discovered this was no anomaly .
It turns out that the biggest market for Heavy Metal outside the US is across the Muslim world .
In underground car parks in Tehran , in barns in Peshawar , in graveyards in Cairo , Muslim mosh - pits are springing up .
We are constantly told that people born in Muslim countries are a homogenous sharia - seeking mass , represented by foul mullahs .
But in his study , Heavy Metal Islam , Alan LeVine gives a startling statistic : in Morocco , only two forces in living memory have brought out crowds of more than 200,000 : the Islamist opposition , and heavy metal bands raging against religion .
To head - bang to a band called Deicide may be inane fun in London ; in Iran or Egypt or Pakistan it is a strikingly brave political act .

At first sight , this seems bizarre .
How did a style of music midwifed into the world by Ozzy Osbourne in the old English industrial town of Birmingham in the mid-1960s become an enemy of jihadism ?
How did a hard , brutal sound designed to mimic the factories of the Midlands become the soundtrack for the children of the Islamic revolution ?
In a region controlled by senile dictatorships and fundamentalist faith , the unemployed young – who make up 65 per cent of the population – have very few windows through which to yell their rage .
Metal gives it to them .
Reda Zine , one of the founders of the Moroccan heavy metal scene , explains : " We play heavy metal because our lives are heavy metal . "
The point of the music is , he says , to rage against " the vampires of intolerance and superstition " .
The guitarist of Iran 's hottest young metal band , Tarantist , agrees : " Metal is in our blood .
It 's not entertainment , it 's our pain , and an antidote to the hypocrisy of religion that is injected into all of us from the moment we 're born . "
The police states are responding by beating heavy - metal fans with heavy metal bars .
In Egypt , the dictatorship of Hosni Mubarak – funded by the US and EU – has ordered mass arrests of metalheads for " undermining the faith of Muslims " , and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is following close behind .
But still millions of young Muslims and atheists defiantly sing along with Metallica : " No need to hear things that they say / Life is for my own to live my own way . "
Next time a Mullah claims to speak for them – or the right implies that all Muslims are represented by fanatics – remember that .
Half a world away , another style of music is equally mocked and misunderstood .
Country has come to be seen as the Bush - chorus , throwing its Stetson into the air at every horror of the past eight years .
It provides the theme songs for Republican presidencies ; its fans are dismissed in language soaked with snobbery : they are " trailer trash " , " white trash " , and " rednecks " living in " the flyover states " .
And the psycho-anthem Toby Keith wrote after 9/11 – vowing " we 'll put a boot in your ass / it 's the American way " – is taken as representative of all country , all the time .
But the story of what happened to country is the story of what happened to the politics of the South .
It was born at the turn of the 20th century as the tubercular music of America 's dirt - poor – so it was the most populist , left - wing music America ever produced .
Music historian Bill C Malone says : " You found a lot of class consciousness in older country music , and a lot of resentment against the rich and privileged . "
There were songs raging against the unregulated horror of the textile mills and the cotton fields .
The South and Midwest voted accordingly : Kansas backed socialist candidates .
So how did Nashville become a Republican heartland ?
Because the Democrats stopping speaking up for the poor and the lower - middle classes – the people Hank Williams sang " had lots of luck , and it 's all been bad " .
Why ?
The party became addicted to donations from the super - rich – so like the Republicans always had , they defended their donors , not their voters .
There were two political parties with one economic policy .
Nobody was left to talk about the economic screwing of the South .
So what was left ?
Cultural differences .
If you stopped talking about rich and poor , you started obsessing about flags and fags .
With no populists left , the old Nashville calls for taking on the rich were replaced by hippy - bashing anthems such " Okie From Muskogee " .
It declared : " We do n't smoke marijuana in Muskogee / We do n't take our trips on LSD / We like livin ' right , and bein ' free . "
( The irony is – he was stoned when he wrote it . )
This trend reached its climax in 2003 when the Dixie Chicks were rail - roaded off country music stations and their albums were burned , just because they said they were ashamed to be from the same state as Bush .
But today , country is beginning to realise it was conned .
The Dixie Chicks are back at the top of the charts .
One of the best country songs of the past few years , by Robbie Fulks , attacks Bush for being " Countrier Than Thou " : " He 's got a ranch , he wears a Stetson / He 's a hip - shootin ' ex-oil king / But wo n't somebody please explain / How you can get a country sheriff / Walkin ' with a frat boy 's brain ? "
Country singers like Darryl Whorley who wrote pro-Bush anthems after 9/11 now have hits with angry anti-war songs .
Even Toby Keith has been praising Barack Obama – who went on stage at the Convention to the country hit " Only in America " .
The South could shift , if only the Democrats will offer them country - economics .
Yes , I know my musical loves are not going to be united any time soon .
I ca n't see Dolly Parton duetting with Slipknot , the heavy metal band who vomit on stage and then eat the vomit .
But if you listen to enough metal and country , you soon learn Muslims and Southerners are not concrete clichés : they are human beings looking for a tune to sing along to .
The path to a better world may just run through a Muslim mosh - pit , or a Nashville ballad for a black President .

After ABC 's recent mass TV execution , the network added some more news regarding their mid-season line up that will begin in January .
The final (? ) season of Scrubs will debut on Tuesday , January 6th .
To start off , ABC will air two Scrubs episodes back to back for two weeks as they decide which other half - hour show will be paired with it .
The leading candidate is Mike Judge 's animated show The Goode Family
We already know that the intent here is to give Scrubs its deserved final season .
Zach Braff is definitely leaving the show after this season , but can , or will , the laugher live on without J.D. ?

The problems of childhood obesity are not exclusive to American soil .
Both the U.S. and many European countries face this crisis .
Various solutions have been proposed and executed .
Everything from promoting exercise to teaching children about the origin of their food to banning candy or sweets on school campuses .
Now the European Commission has put forth a new initiative .
A recent BMJ article , European Commission plans free fruit and vegetable scheme in schools , highlights the commission ’s desire to get kids off to a strong start regarding healthy eating habits .
Although various countries have enacted similar plans , the commission ’s concern is that these plans have holes in them including :
They only cover a small regional area
They only provide healthy food on a short - term basis or every once in a while
There are no guarantees that the program will continue
The commission wants to fix this by providing money to countries that voluntarily participate .
The catch : each participating country must match the money provided by the commission with the exception of some needy areas .
Although I think that efforts to promote healthy habits among children is worthy , I think that this program , and others like it , are really band - aids for the real problem : us adults .
As most of us have humbly learned , children learn from example .
And so the logical explanation for obesity and unhealthy eating habits among our children is nothing less than our own example .
Because of our misguided actions and decisions , governments around the world are having to shell out money to fix our screwed up results .
Not only have we picked up shudder - inducing eating habits ( and hey , I definitely include myself in the “ we ” I blame ) but we have allowed the marketing industry to become corrupt - a - kid renegades .
The combination of our desire for a quick drive - through burger , endless commercials , and colorful “ fruit ” roll - up boxes depicting one beloved cartoon character or another has proven too much for our impressionable children .
If we really want to curb the obesity issue and teach our kids how to eat we have to shun convenience and instant gratification for something else : good food .
We have to pull out the cutting board and cut the orange instead of handing over a packet of sugary fruit chews .
We have to plan meals instead of watching TV .
We have to pass up the quick candy bar we crave so that our kids do n’t get into the habit of thinking that it ’s okay to fill our bodies with sugar .
I cringe at these words .
Alas , I am a sugar - addict and I too know how easy it is to order a basket of fries or reason that a few sips of soda wo n’t hurt .
But I know that each time I hear about another government program aimed at preventing what I ’ve helped start I ’m going to cringe even more .

Verizon said the account has been inactive for several months and was tied to a flip phone , not a smart phone like the BlackBerry .
Obama has been pictured several times talking on a Motorola Razr , a flip phone that is available through Verizon Wireless .
Obama has also been spotted with the BlackBerry and the Apple iPhone .
" All employees who have accessed the account  whether authorized or not  have been put on immediate leave , with pay , " Verizon said .
" As the circumstances of each individual employee 's access to the account are determined , the company will take appropriate actions . "
Employees found to have accessed Obama 's account for legitimate reasons will be reinstated while those who did so without cause will " face appropriate disciplinary action , " Verizon said .
" We apologize to President - elect Obama and will work to keep the trust our customers place in us every day , " the company said .
There has been speculation in the past week about whether Obama will be able to keep his BlackBerry after he is sworn into office .
For security reasons , U.S. presidents have traditionally surrendered their electronic devices while in office , and Thursday 's Verizon incident highlights why that type of precaution might still be necessary .
Christopher Raynor ’s father kicked him out when he was 13 , after his stepmother interrupted an orgy in his bedroom and the teen jammed a broom handle against her throat .
Now 40 , Raynor has lived much of his life in the rough .
His current domicile is a patch of dirt behind some pampas grass and coastal sage scrub where Pacific Coast Highway meets Temescal Canyon Road , in the backyard of Pacific Palisades .
Until a few weeks ago , he dozed on a thin mattress in the open air .
Now he beds down in a snug mobile shelter called an EDAR ( short for Everyone Deserves a Roof ) , a covered contraption that looks like the offspring of a shopping cart and a pop - up camper .
Raynor ’s mother died of stomach cancer , his father was shot to death , and he himself has served time in jail .
He spends much of each day intoxicated and grimy .
He despises most people .
But he likes his EDAR .
“ This is one of the greatest damn gifts you could ever give to anybody , ” he says .
The EDAR is the brainchild of Peter Samuelson , a philanthropist and film producer whose credits include “ Revenge of the Nerds ” and “ Arlington Road . ”
His life could hardly be more different from Raynor’s .
Samuelson grew up in a middle - class London household where performing charitable work was expected .
His father , Sydney , founded Samuelson Film Service , a supplier of film and TV equipment , and in 1995 was knighted for his service to the British film industry .
Peter Samuelson went to Cambridge University on a full scholarship , earned a master ’s degree in English literature and became fluent in French .
He started in the film business as an interpreter for U.S. companies operating in Africa and Europe .
In 1975 , after living off and on in Los Angeles , he settled here permanently , married an accountant and had four children .
“ If you become an American on purpose , it ’s a very special thing , ” Samuelson , 57 , said over breakfast at Nate ’n Al deli in Beverly Hills .
“ America is not just a land of opportunity but also of personal responsibility .
There ’s an obligation to lift up society . ”
In 1982 , that obligation smacked Samuelson in the face when a cousin in London introduced him to a boy with an inoperable brain tumor .
The child ’s great wish was to see Disneyland .
Samuelson and his cousin footed the bill to fly the boy and his mother to Los Angeles for a two - week whirlwind of wish fulfillment .
“ He went back to London clutching his Mickey Mouse ears and died , ” Samuelson said .
The experience prompted Samuelson to start the Starlight Foundation , an international charity that provides psychological and social services to seriously ill children and their families .
In 1990 , he brought together director Steven Spielberg and Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf , among others , to create the Starbright Foundation , which develops software and other products to help children cope with the medical , emotional and social challenges of their illnesses .
In 2004 , Starlight and Starbright merged to become the Starlight Starbright Children ’s Foundation .
Another Samuelson charity , First Star , advocates for abused and neglected children .
Three years ago , on his twice - weekly bike rides to the beach from his Holmby Hills house , Samuelson realized that he was seeing more homeless people .
For three weeks , he interviewed dozens of them -- men , women and children .
“ Where do you spend the night ? ” he asked one woman .
She led him by the hand into the bushes and showed him a large cardboard Sub - Zero box .
“ That was my epiphany moment , ” Samuelson said .
“ I ’ve got the refrigerator .
She ’s got the box .
What is wrong with this picture ? ”
A 2007 homeless census revealed that on any given day there were more than 73,000 homeless people in Los Angeles County .
( Some critics contend the number is overstated . )
Downtown ’s skid row had the greatest concentration , with more than 5,000 .
Samuelson said he was shocked by the demographics : About 60 % of the homeless were men , 24 % were women , and 15 % were under 18 .
( Adult transgender individuals accounted for the rest . )
“ I ’ve always believed society is defined by how we deal with our weakest links , ” he said .
“ The best of America is when we take care of the less fortunate . ”
His first instinct was to build shelters , but then he did the math .
Building a bed in a facility runs $ 50,000 to $ 100,000 .
The cost to house all of the county ’s street denizens would run into the billions .
Besides , many of them resist services .
So he thought :
What is there that ’s better than a damp box on a rainy night even if it ’s not as good as a bed ?
The idea of a mobile , single - person shelter popped to mind .
Samuelson sponsored a contest at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena to design his “ widget . ”
Eric Lindeman and Jason Zasa took the honors , with a mobile shopping cart - like apparatus .
The cart features bins to hold cans , bottles and other recyclables collected by day .
It folds out to create a sleeping platform , topped by a canvas cover with zippers and windows .
Samuelson labeled it an EDAR , and established the EDAR Foundation , whose slogan is : “ Thinking outside the box . ”
With a donation from former EBay President Jeff Skoll , he took the design to Precision Wire Products , a manufacturer of shopping carts in Commerce .
Precision produced a succession of prototypes , at least nine , to address critiques of the device : too big , too small , too flimsy , not readily collapsible .
The units have been thrown down flights of stairs ( they ’re sturdy ) and left in the rain ( they do n’t leak ) .
Three months ago , Samuelson decided to distribute 60 EDARs for testing .
With the help of churches , missions and shelters , he and his assistants identified chronically homeless people who could benefit from an EDAR in the short term and might be willing to develop a lasting relationship with service providers .
After Dehanka Straughter was laid off from her job as a cook at a Compton preschool , she and her two sons , ages 2 and 6 , were evicted from their $ 975 - a- month apartment .
They sold their furniture , stored some possessions in Straughter ’s unregistered car and stayed with family and friends for a few weeks .
When Straughter saw people sleeping on the streets , she thought “ that ’s where we ’d be next . ”
Then a friend told her that women and children could find temporary quarters at the Union Rescue Mission in downtown Los Angeles .
Now the petite Straughter , 27 , sleeps in an EDAR with her boys on the fourth floor of the mission .
They like it better than she does .
“ The kids adjust to anything , ” she said .
“ They think they ’re camping . ”
Still , she says , “ I ’m happy to have a place to bathe and eat and sleep . ”
With the economy sinking , mission Chief Executive Andy Bales is making room for more mothers with children and hopes to provide EDARs -- indoors -- for many of them .
The EDAR Foundation provided 17 units ; the mission has asked to buy 100 more , some for use in its winter shelter .
Bales hopes that with mass production , the price will drop to $ 400 from just under $ 500 .
“ They make a nice cot and provide a lot of privacy , ” he said .
“ I had a 6 - foot - 7 friend lie down in one .
He was comfortable . ”
Raynor learned about EDAR from homeless acquaintances .
A high school dropout and former construction worker , Raynor had spent three years in jail for auto theft and forgery .
With police after him in Texas and his home state of Missouri , he went to Arizona .
He left there in search of more temperate weather and found it next to Pacific Coast Highway .
As traffic rushed by one recent starry Friday night , Raynor reminisced about his brushes with the law .
Beer can in hand , he spoke of jumping a freight train to Texas to search for a friend ’s missing 13 - year - old daughter .
Wielding a sawed - off shotgun , he banged down a door and tied up two men who he thought knew her whereabouts .
“ How was I to know they were cops working on a sting operation ? ” he said .
Recently , a woman he described as his fiancee was struck and killed by a driver on PCH .
Not long after , a male friend suffered the same fate , he said .
The woman he ’d married in Arizona disappeared from his life .
He shares his PCH - adjacent turf with a woman named Yolanda , whose speech has been slurred by alcohol and a head injury .
Raynor said his EDAR is “ very comfortable , ” cooled by sea breezes by day and made cozy by his body heat at night .
“ It ’s about time someone took an initiative for people less fortunate than themselves , ” he said .
In October , the EDAR won $ 10,000 in an innovation contest sponsored by Los Angeles Social Venture Partners , the Social Enterprise Institute and the USC Stevens Institute for Innovation .
The EDAR Foundation ( www.edar.org) is seeking donations to produce more of the mobile shelters .
Students at Rand Corp. , the Santa Monica think tank , are interviewing EDAR users and representatives of shelters and missions to assess how the units might fit into a system of comprehensive care for the homeless .
“ The goal is to find out who will benefit most from this unit and therefore what the distribution plan should look like , ” said Barbara Raymond , a consultant working on the study .
Raymond sees possibilities for EDARs in refugee camps and for victims of natural disasters .
Meanwhile , lawyers are sorting out legal issues .
Will municipal codes allow users to park their units anywhere ?
What about constitutional questions and not - in - my - backyard complaints ?
Erwin Chemerinsky , dean of the UC Irvine School of Law , said police fear the units could constitute dwellings where inhabitants would have a reasonable expectation of privacy .
In that scenario , police would need warrants to search EDARs , which could become havens for drug use or prostitution .
Chemerinsky maintains that cities could allow the units in designated public places as long as users consented to be searched , much like travelers entering an airport .
Samuelson anticipates those and other objections to his invention .
Does the EDAR enable homelessness by making it more bearable ?
No , he insists .
“ Why is the EDAR not regressive ? ” he said .
“ Because it is not nearly as good as a shelter bed .
There ’s no pretense it ’s as good as permanent or temporary brick - and - mortar housing . ”
But it is , he says , “ infinitely better than a damp cardboard box . ”

Sounds of Manifolds
Carolyn Gordon has a paper in the Mathematical Intelligencer ( 1989 , vol 11 , no.
3 , pp. 39 - 47 ) entitled " When You Ca n't Hear the Shape of a Manifold . "
Accompanying this article are a sidebar and floppy vinyl record by Dennis DeTurck .
Reproduced here , with Dr. DeTurck 's permission , are the tracks from the record in .mp3 format ; I 've included his comments from the sidebar with each track .
Two tech - tips : ( 1 ) you might need to turn the volume up ( I forgot to amplify them when I was editing them ) and ( 2 ) if you play more than one of these at once , it sounds really weird .
However , I 'm not going to discuss the mathematics on this page .
Track 1 : Your browser does not support the audio element .
The " harmonic sequence " of the circle S1 ( e.g. , sine tones whose frequencies are integer multiples of the first one heard ) .
Then we build a complex S1 - tone ( e.g. , beginning with the fundamental tone , more and more additional frequencies are mixed in , based on the circle 's eigenvalues ) .
Then the complex tone is repeated , with other characteristics added ( attack and decay envelope ) to get an " electronic piano " sound .
As an example , the Dresden Amen is played on this " circular " piano .
Track 2 : Your browser does not support the audio element .
The analog of 1 for the two - sphere S2 : the " harmonic sequence " of S2 ( just like 1 , but with the sphere 's eigenvalues ) , then we build a complex S2 - tone , repeat it with the piano 's attack - decay envelope , and perform the on the " spherical piano . "
Track 3 : Your browser does not support the audio element .
The effect of dimension : A simple piano exercise is repeated , first on S1 , then on S2 , then on S3 ( which has the same eigenvalues , but not multiplicities , as the complex projective plane C P2 ) , then on S6 ( same as the quaternionic projective plane H P2 ) , and then on S12 ( same as the Cayley plane Ca P2 ) .
Track 4 : Your browser does not support the audio element .
The " Romanza " movement , from Beethoven 's Sonatina in G is performed on various " spherical pianos . "
The first section is played on an S1 - piano , the second on S2 , the next on S3 , the next on S6 , and a codetta back on S1 .
Track 5 : Your browser does not support the audio element .
A chorus of projective planes :
The " Bouree " from Handel 's Fourth Flute Sonata is performed with C P2 playing the flute part , Ca P2 doing the bass line , and H P2 providing the realization ( middle parts ) .
Track 6 : Your browser does not support the audio element .
The piano exercise is played on S1 again , then on various flat rectangular tori .
The first is the square torus T 1:1 , then on tori whose side ratios are 3:5 , 11:13 , 21:23 , and finally 31:33 .
( Hear the effect of the ratio being close to but not equal to 1 ? )
Track 7 : Your browser does not support the audio element .
Torus music : Robert Schumann 's Wild Rider is performed on a piano whose strings are T 3:5 .
Track 8 : Your browser does not support the audio element .
More torus music : J. S. Bach 's Two - part Invention No. 4 in d minor is performed on a T 11:13 piano .
Track 9 : Your browser does not support the audio element .
Spheres and tori together :
The " Presto " movement from Scarlatti's Sonata in C ( Longo S.3 ) is performed , with the upper voice played on T 21:23 and the other parts on Ca P2 .
Track 10 : Your browser does not support the audio element .
A " one - minute quiz " : Chopin's Valse in D - flat , Opus 64 , No. 1 ( " Minute Waltz " ) .
The oom - pahs are performed on a standard S1 - piano .
Can you identify the seven manifolds that play different sections of the tune ?
In the Intelligencer , answers were provided on p. 79 .
However , I did n't look at that page , so if you need to know the answers ... for now , you 'll have to go to the library .

Every weekday morning , between 7 and 8 a.m. , Tom Custard fishes through the trash at the gas station at the Sam ’s Club in Hermantown , Minnesota .
Armed with two shopping carts , the 61 - year - old goes through the six garbage cans by the pumps , sometimes in 40 - below windchills , carefully separating out bottles and cans tossed by customers who ca n’t be bothered to walk to the recycling bin .
But if you figured the man in the gloves and fedora for a scavenger , you ’d be wrong .
Custard is a gas station attendant for the big - box store , which is owned by Wal - Mart ; picking through the trash is a task he thought up himself .
“ I think it ’s the right thing to do , and I feel that I ’m doing something for the environment before I retire , ” says Custard , who is due to hang up his yellow reflective vest at the end of the year .
Custard is one of hundreds of thousands of employees partaking in an initiative Wal - Mart calls the Personal Sustainability Project , a.k.a. psp .
Since 2007 , all Wal - Mart employees in the US have been asked to take a simple , concrete step to benefit their health , their local community , or the earth .
psp pledges , which can involve work or home life or both , have included vows to drive the speed limit ( to save gas ) , clean up trash , quit smoking , switch to a reusable bottle , or turn off the tap when toothbrushing .
Since last year , Wal - Mart claims , 45 percent of its workers in the United States have taken on a Personal Sustainability Project ; workers receive no financial incentive , and many of the projects take place after hours , off the clock .
The project is the brainchild of former Sierra Club president Adam Werbach , who is now ceo of the Saatchi & Saatchi marketing agency ’s green branch .
( Werbach declined to comment for this story . )
It ’s part of a sweeping sustainability effort Wal - Mart launched in 2005 — a campaign that has seen the company do everything from pledging to double the efficiency of its truck fleet to pushing General Mills to shrink Hamburger Helper boxes by replacing crinkly noodles with straight .
So , is the psp one of the quickest ways to get large numbers of people to go green — or just another way for Wal - Mart to extend its tyranny over workers ’ personal lives ?
The answer just might be both .
Wal - Mart ’s enormous impact — via its 1.9 million associates , 200 million customers , and the staggering 10 percent of all retail spending that takes place in its stores — is well documented ; the company literally transformed the business landscape with its ruthless focus on price , notes Charles Fishman , author of The Wal - Mart Effect .
“ If Wal - Mart is serious about sustainability , it can have an incredible impact on how the economy operates , ” he says .
The psp also suggests that Sam Walton ’s successors envision the workplace as more than where you toil to get a ( however meager ) paycheck and ( ditto ) health insurance — as , instead , a catalyst for personal growth and social change , where “ psp captains , ” cheerleading coworkers , spur you on toward your goals .
The program , says Fishman , is an example of corporate America filling a role akin to churches and community organizations — and that ’s not a bad thing in his view : “ As long as it does n’t drift in the direction of being some kind of compulsion , it ’s wonderful . ”
Then again , compulsion is a real concern .
This is , after all , the same company that held mandatory meetings for managers and department heads this summer , warning that Democratic victories would hurt its business by bolstering unions .
Besides , critics argue , if Wal - Mart cares about making employees ’ lives more sustainable , why not start with their paychecks — or its infamous labor practices , which have resulted in lawsuits over sex discrimination , anti-union tactics , mandatory overtime , and more ?
On sites like Wal - Mart Blows , employees can be found announcing that their psp is to get a new job — somewhere else .
The primary gripe on the message boards :
Why should Wal - Mart be telling me how to live my life ?
But that criticism does n’t register with Hope Aubuchon , a 33 - year - old who is a department manager at the Wal - Mart Supercenter in Colorado Springs .
She says she ’s grateful for the psp suggestions offered at daily store meetings ; she and her son Zeno , 10 , and daughter Lacey , 14 , have adopted more than a dozen Personal Sustainability Projects , from packing school lunches in reusable ( and Wal - Mart - branded ) bags to religiously turning off the lights when they leave the room .
“ I have saved so much money just doing the little tips that it makes making it through each month easier , ” says Aubuchon , a single mother who has worked for Wal - Mart for nine years .
“ Buying school supplies this year was n’t as hard . ”
For Wal - Mart itself , the psp s also mean big savings .
Darryl Meyers , who works in the Burlington , North Carolina , store , thought that the 24 - 7 lights inside the vending machines in the break rooms were wasteful .
He suggested turning them off , and the company has saved nearly $ 1 million because of it .
“ When associates get engaged personally , they do start getting more engaged with sustainability at work , ” says Janelle Kearsley , a Wal - Mart executive at company headquarters in Bentonville , Arkansas , who was until recently the director of sustainability and strategy running the program .
Kearsley ’s psp s?
Exercising more and eating local , which has inspired her to grow tomatoes and green beans in her backyard .
Wait .
A Wal - Mart exec who grows her own produce ?
Is n’t that a form of retail heresy ?
It ’s one of the ironic twists of the psp program that it invites employees to reduce use of some of the very products the company hawks , from cigarettes to gasoline — though of course , as Kearsley notes , Wal - Mart also sells bicycles , organics , and reusable shopping bags .

Advertisement The BBC's Natural History Unit cameras are in Kenya 's Masai Mara Reserve for a week of live programmes - and already they have seen some astonishing sights .
On Friday , one of the cameras set up to stream live pictures to the expedition 's website 24 hours a day captured the moment a lion took down its prey .
For daily updates / webcams
It was a remarkable sequence , and one of the few times such an event has been seen on a live webcam .
It augurs well for the Big Cat Live series which returns to UK TV screens on Sunday .
Not that there have n't been some predictable technical hiccups in getting the camera network up and running .
A generator that has spent six weeks on the high seas is still on the high seas , at least as far as anyone knows .
But four live video streams are now online , along with a split - screen view .
Shakira and her cubs could be the story that really hooks people
You can catch all the action - which has so far included lions stalking zebra , playful hyena young , a sleeping hippo and even a bat - eared fox - by going to the Big Cat Live website .
It is all , in part , thanks to some pretty ingenious technical innovation .
Wonderful footage of a hyena den , for example , is coming from autonomous Land Rover camera units - assembled on site - which are driven into prime positions and , to avoid disturbing the animals , pretty much abandoned to the dust , heat and rain of the Mara .
Creating the Land Rover cam was one of many challenges facing the Big Cat team on the ground , but for producer Colin Jackson , it 's a worthwhile investment of time and technology .
" That 's one of the most exciting things this year : the idea that viewers in the UK will be able to watch live film of the animals night and day , " he says .
" That will be a unique experience . "
Big Cat Live promises quite a few of those .
Please turn on JavaScript .

Advertisement Jackson says the footage brought in by camera teams is " already far exceeding expectations " .
Thermal cameras bring a new view to night - time activity
The film of night - time activity , in particular , is a revelation .
" It 's all there , " he says .
" Life and death , lion hunts , unique behaviour only seen at night .
" We 're using a thermal camera that can see even further than infra-red .
We 're seeing the invisible . "
The cameras have already picked out the usual cast of Big Cat characters
The Marsh lions are in rude good health , led by two males in their prime .
Land Rovers have been parked up and left near the cats Bella the leopard , meanwhile , will be familiar to fans of previous Big Cat Diaries .
The pride 's territory is also the fragile home to a female cheetah ( nicknamed Shakira ) and her five cubs , and presenter Jonathan Scott thinks their struggle to survive may grip viewers most of all .
" That story is going to give viewers the most incredible sense of the Mara - and why we love to be here , " he says .
Big Cat Live on BBC
One will be broadcast every evening for the next week , starting on Sunday at 1810 BST ; but the webcams operate all day and all night , and the Big Cat team is sending text message updates to the website throughout the day .

As he prepares to take office , President - elect Barack Obama is relying on a small team of advisers who will lead his transition operation and help choose the members of a new Obama administration .
Following is part of a series of profiles of potential members of the administration .
Name : Timothy F. Geithner
Chosen for : Mr. Obama nominated Mr. Geithner to be Treasury secretary .
Will bring to the job :
As president of the New York Federal Reserve since 2003 , Mr. Geithner has straddled Wall Street and Washington as a central player in trying to resolve the most significant financial crisis in more than 60 years .
He would bring a deep understanding of Wall Street and a close working relationship with Ben S. Bernanke , the chairman of the Federal Reserve , his partner in the $ 700 million bailout , along with Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr.
Though not an economist , Mr. Geithner has a deep understanding of monetary and fiscal policy and broad experience in international trade issues .
Before the current crisis , he was involved in the bailouts of Mexico , Indonesia , Korea , Brazil and Thailand .
Although he served in the Clinton administration , he is not viewed as partisan and enjoys good relations with both Democrats and Republicans in Congress .
Is linked to Obama by : Robert E. Rubin and Lawrence H. Summers , two former Clinton treasury secretaries who have been advising the Obama campaign .
Mr. Geithner was an aide to both men .
Paul Volcker , the former Fed chairman who is also advising Mr. Obama , was on the committee that selected Mr. Geithner for his current job .
( CNN ) --
On Thanksgiving , millions of Americans will see the changes a year makes in their family -- how the children have grown , how relatives have aged .
Engage the person who has Alzheimer 's in conversations even if they do n't seem to respond , experts say .
Some will encounter elderly relatives who have Alzheimer 's disease , a condition that affects 4.5 million Americans .
For many , it 's an awkward trip where they do n't know what to do or say .
Facing the changes that accompany the disease can be devastating .
As the disease progresses , the essence of a person -- memories and traits -- fades as brain cells deteriorate .
Unusual behaviors arise , moods inexplicably vacillate from anger to paranoia , and lapses in people 's memories become more apparent .
This can cause a person to forget his or her children .
It 's a prospect Karen McKeever , whose mother has Alzheimer 's disease , dreads .
" I do n't even want to think about that , " she said .
" I know it 's coming ....
There are things I do n't want to recognize or face . "
Experts say it 's normal to feel sad , abandoned or even angry when a person with Alzheimer 's forgets memories and loved ones .
Talk about your feelings and keep in mind it 's not personal , but the effects of the disease , said Beth Kallmyer , licensed clinical social worker .
Thanksgiving is also an opportunity to look for symptoms among older relatives .
While there is no cure for Alzheimer 's , early detection can improve the quality of life for people affected .
Clues include odd or unusual behavior or details of a family tradition that 's suddenly absent .
About two years ago , McKeever and her four siblings realized their mother , Anne Goins , was repeating the same story to each of them , almost every 20 minutes .
On the advice of a friend , McKeever took her mother to a gerontologist .
The diagnosis was the early stages of Alzheimer 's disease .
" To have someone who is so independent , who takes care of herself , who is such a social person , it 's hard to see her go through losing her independence .
The fact that she forgets , that 's the biggest thing I struggle with , " McKeever said .
Small clues , like mismatched buttons or a house being more of a mess than usual , may be an indication of memory problems , said Eric Hall , the president and CEO of Alzheimer 's Foundation of America .
" There might be hesitancy and awkwardness or trying to cover up a lack of knowledge or things they 've forgotten , " he said .
" People will spend an enormous amount of energy trying to cover up .
You can pick that up in their uneasiness and their language . "
Keep in mind that memory loss is not always Alzheimer 's disease -- it could be issues related to stress or vitamin deficiency , he said .
Experts gave advice about interacting with a person in advanced stages of the disease .
What if the person who has Alzheimer 's disease does n't remember who I am ?
Well - meaning friends and family often pepper the patient with the question : " Do you know who I am ? "
" That 's obnoxious -- you want to avoid that , " said Kallmyer , director of client services at the Alzheimer 's Association .
Rather than quizzing someone 's memory , she recommends introducing yourself with something like , " I'm John , your son " and other relatives by saying , " Here 's my wife , Jane . "
Be reassuring , hold their hands , and smile and remind them who you are .
Rather than trying to figure out what the person remembers , reassure them by calling them by their name , Kallmyer said .
The loved one no longer recognizes me .
What do I do ?
After realizing that the person no longer recognizes his or her loved ones , some visitors are at a loss for words or feel apprehensive .
Hall recommends having a conversation , even if that person seems unresponsive .

" We become uncomfortable doing all the talking , " he said .
" Continuing to talk to them is an important piece .
It 's awkward for us , but if we stay engaged , it means a lot to them . "
Although the patient may not have memory , he or she still has emotions and the ability to pick up vibes and read body language .
Use the person 's name , maintain eye contact and speak slowly , Hall suggested .
Ask one open - ended question at a time , giving adequate time to respond .
He calls it the 4S 's for communicating : simple , slow , show and smile .
" Simple sentences are much appreciated by someone with Alzheimer 's , " Hall said .
" Say it slow to allow enough time to capture words or questions .
Show what you 're saying , using facial expressions , body language and gesturing .
And smile -- it goes a long way . "
What should I do if he or she keeps asking me the same question ?
This is common for people with Alzheimer 's , Hall said .
" The problem is that they can not remember your response .
Instead of answering the question a second or third time , reassure the individual that everything is fine , " he said .
The patient may not be able to remember or process the answer , so they repeat the same question almost 20 to 40 times a day .
" Our first instinct is to answer the question , " Hall said .
" We 're under the assumption that the other person gets it .
But in this regard , it 's not happening .
Instead of becoming frustrated , smile and give an assurance everything is fine and sort of move on . "
What are some habits to avoid ?
One misconception is that amplifying their voice will somehow make it easier for the patient to understand .
" People talk loud , they just assume they have a hearing problem , " Kallmyer said .
" It 's obviously annoying .
They can hear OK .
You do n't need to scream at them .
You do n't want to patronize them .
The biggest thing I can say is slow it down and give them time to answer . "
If a conversation topic seems to confuse the person , move on to a different subject .
If the person with Alzheimer 's says something that 's incorrect , resist the urge to correct them .
" When you 're correcting someone , it agitates them , " Kallmyer said .
" It 's our nature , you want to correct someone when they 've got something wrong , but it does n't matter . "

October 30th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
In our search for new clean technology , it ’s important to pay attention to inventions of the past .
A tiny hydroelectric plant in the Yorkshire Dales area of England is coming out of a 60 year retirement next summer to create renewable energy .
The Linton Falls hydroelectric plant will work with the use of two Archimedean screws .
Originally designed to carry water up as they rotate , the screws will generate renewable energy by spinning at high speeds when river water flows through them .
The plant will generate a reasonable 510,000 kWh of energy each year — not bad considering the structure has been sitting dormant for decades .
Eventually , the Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority wants to use up to 50 sites for similar schemes .
While hydroelectric dams may not be appropriate everywhere , the Linton Falls plant proves that we should pay attention to the tools we already have before building new ones .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
Much has been argued about the housing and subprime crisis .
It would seem from all the media exposure that the housing collapse came on the heels of some unexpected event .
It was not unexpected and many people saw this coming .
I ’ve learned many things from observing the current market forces at work and that is very few people really understand the concept of living within their means .
With access to easy credit and a nonchalant attitude about the future , many people simply mortgaged away their future for instant gratification .
All of sudden we start hearing echoes of a full on bailout of the housing market .
In fact , we are now hearing calls for across the board rate freezes – flipper and speculator alike .
Instead of going after bad behavior , we are rewarding people that took on too much risk .
If we are to let the marketplace work itself out , we are already seeing countless unscrupulous lenders going out of business .
These people were making inordinate amounts of money by putting people into financially dangerous products .
It was a horribly broken model .
There is plenty of blame to go around and we will have plenty of time to assign it .
The major issue I have with this is what about people that actually had some financial discipline and did n’t play this housing bubble game ?
Should they be responsible for the actions of a market they did n’t benefit from ?
Much has been said about the BofA / Countrywide buyout deal .
In fact , there has been speculation that BofA bought out Countrywide knowing that they would be able to write off many of their losses .
BofA is a very profitable company so having these write offs is simply a creative way to avoid paying taxes on their revenue .
Not exactly the definition of a bailout but a clever way to avoid paying taxes ; something that is not available to the general public .
These things are rather disturbing and not much can be done considering the magnitude of the housing mess .
Take a look at this chart that has been floating around the internet regarding the amount of rate resets we will face in the upcoming years :
A couple of things you ’ll notice with the chart .
The first thing you ’ll notice is that we are in the middle of the worst of the mortgage crisis .
2008 will have a much larger number of resets than 2007 and this will be magnified given that housing is already down .
It is also the case that now delinquencies for so - called prime borrowers are now increasing only highlighting my initial premises that all people , not only those labeled subprime have lived way beyond their means .
Do n’t get me wrong , housing is one of the best investments you can make over your lifetime .
That is if you buy at the right price with conventional financing .
I know that may sound simplistic and overly conservative but given that nearly 70 percent of Americans own their home and most of their networth is stored in this singular vehicle , it is important to not rely on only one asset and diversify .
Since many Americans are still not diversified in their investments we will see the wealth effect retrench in the next few years as housing and the credit unwinding take their toll on the American consumer .
What can you do if you are looking at buying a house ?
Should you even consider buying a home in today ’s market ?
This answer may surprise a lot of people but the answer is maybe .
Buying a home is a simple proposition based on these few principles :
1 . Do you have enough income ?
2 . What are local lease rates ?
3 . How is the local economy ?
4 . Are you willing to stay in the property for a few years ?
Let us walk through each one and go a little further into detail why these four areas will tell you whether a home is a good deal or not regardless of all the fireworks or gloom surrounding the housing market .
# 1 – Income is such an absolute cornerstone of buying a home that these stated income and no documentation loans simply baffle me .
How people were able to get $ 500,000 loans without any documentation is criminal .
But that is an entirely different story .
Conventional wisdom has it that you should n’t spend more than one - third of your gross household income on housing .
So for example , say your household brings in $ 75,000 per year .
Your housing payment should not go beyond $ 2,083 .
And this is your combined housing payment including principal , interest , taxes , and insurance .
This translates to a home valued at $ 250,000 or so , a price tag much higher than the national median home price .
But you say you live in an expensive metro area ?
Then you must have an income to meet your targeted price .
As many areas such as California and Florida are now realizing housing prices do not always go up .
# 2 – This leads us into our next issue , local rent rates .
It is not a crime to rent .
In fact , in many expensive metro areas renters out number owners .
You really need to ask yourself what is the reason for buying a home .
If you are looking to flip the home in a few months you will be in for the shock of your life in the next few years .
This housing market is in for a major correction .
Looking at local rent rates also gives you a safety net and idea of what your home would fetch should you need to rent it in the future .
Should money really become a pinch , you can always rent your home and move to a much more downsized place .
These are options that people are realizing are important now in buying a home .
# 3 – This is such a key factor .
With the ease of access looking up data on cities and employment information , there is no reason for you not to know an area .
It is important to see vacancy rates , foreclosure rates , is the economy diverse , is population growing , and other key factors that will determine how healthy the economy is poised to grow .
If you look at Detroit you will see that the economy is having a harder time than say in San Francisco .
These are important considerations in factoring a price of a home .
# 4 – The last point is probably the biggest mental shift and the most altering for many people .
There was a time when people stayed put in their homes .
It would seem that time had come and gone in the 2000s .
Given the uncertainty of the current housing market , it may very well be that even taking the above measures , you can still buy a home that may depreciate in the next few years .
Can you stay put for sometime ?
Is this something you can support ?
If the answer is no you may be better off leasing and waiting till the market recovers .
Finally , buy a home you afford and do it with conventional financing and a down payment .
It is amazing how many people seem resistant to this idea but in all other decades , this is essentially how buying a home was done .
It was a right of passage that you earned and was n’t handed to you on a zero down mortgage platter .
Given the current , atmosphere it looks like many Americans are going to be forced to live within their means .

A.C. Thompson has a devastating piece in The Nation this week describing the all - white militia that took up arms to defend one of the few neighborhoods in New Orleans to stay dry after Hurricane Katrina broke the levees in 2005 :
Facing an influx of refugees , the residents of Algiers Point could have pulled together food , water and medical supplies for the flood victims .
Instead , a group of white residents , convinced that crime would arrive with the human exodus , sought to seal off the area , blocking the roads in and out of the neighborhood by dragging lumber and downed trees into the streets .
They stockpiled handguns , assault rifles , shotguns and at least one Uzi and began patrolling the streets in pickup trucks and SUVs .
The newly formed militia , a loose band of about fifteen to thirty residents , most of them men , all of them white , was looking for thieves , outlaws or , as one member put it , anyone who simply " did n't belong . "
It started out as a classic case of white paranoiac overreaction to fears of looting and rioting and whatever else it is those black people do -- rather like the reaction you saw in sundown towns in the 1920s , which were similar in being " defended communities , " to supposed threats of black depredations -- but quickly morphed into something else altogether :
Fellow militia member Wayne Janak , 60 , a carpenter and contractor , is more forthcoming with me .
" Three people got shot in just one day ! " he tells me , laughing .
We 're sitting in his home , a boxy beige - and - pink structure on a corner about five blocks from Daigle 's Grocery .
" Three of them got hit right here in this intersection with a riot gun , " he says , motioning toward the streets outside his home .
Janak tells me he assumed the shooting victims , who were African - American , were looters because they were carrying sneakers and baseball caps with them .
He guessed that the property had been stolen from a nearby shopping mall .
According to Janak , a neighbor " unloaded a riot gun " -- a shotgun - -" on them .
We chased them down . "
Janak , who was carrying a pistol , says he grabbed one of the suspected looters and considered killing him , but decided to be merciful .
" I rolled him over in the grass and saw that he'd been hit in the back with the riot gun , " he tells me .
" I thought that was good enough .
I said , ' Go back to your neighborhood so people will know Algiers Point is not a place you go for a vacation .
We 're not doing tours right now . ' "
He 's equally blunt in Welcome to New Orleans , an hourlong documentary produced by the Danish video team , who captured Janak , beer in hand , gloating about hunting humans .
Surrounded by a crowd of sunburned white Algiers Point locals at a barbeque held not long after the hurricane , he smiles and tells the camera , " It was great !
It was like pheasant season in South Dakota .
If it moved , you shot it . "
A native of Chicago , Janak also boasts of becoming a true Southerner , saying , " I am no longer a Yankee .
I earned my wings . "
A white woman standing next to him adds , " He understands the N - word now . "
In this neighborhood , she continues , " we take care of our own . "
Janak , who says he'd been armed with two .38s and a shotgun , brags about keeping the bloody shirt worn by a shooting victim as a trophy .
When " looters " showed up in the neighborhood , " they left full of buckshot , " he brags , adding , " You know what ?
Algiers Point is not a pussy community . "
... Some of the gunmen prowling Algiers Point were out to wage a race war , says one woman whose uncle and two cousins joined the cause .
A former New Orleanian , this source spoke to me anonymously because she fears her relatives could be prosecuted for their crimes .
" My uncle was very excited that it was a free - for - all - - white against black -- that he could participate in , " says the woman .
" For him , the opportunity to hunt black people was a joy . "
" They did n't want any of the ' ghetto niggers ' coming over " from the east side of the river , she says , adding that her relatives viewed African - Americans who wandered into Algiers Point as " fair game . "
One of her cousins , a young man in his 20s , sent an e-mail to her and several other family members describing his adventures with the militia .
He had attached a photo in which he posed next to an African - American man who'd been fatally shot .
The tone of the e-mail , she says , was " gleeful " -- her cousin was happy that " they were shooting niggers . "
As the first console to drop below the $ 200 price point , the Xbox 360 will have the privilege this holiday season of being the cheapest , and perhaps , most matured game consoles .
The hardware has been refined over the years , there 's a vast software library of varied titles , and the online service is second to none .
Alas , it seems that the deal is as sweet as it's going to get for at least the foreseeable future , as Microsoft has admitted that the next round of price cuts is a long way off .
Microsoft UK head Stephen McGill sounded off on the advent of further price drops to Videogamer .
" I 'm not dropping the price for many many years in the future I would suspect , " said McGill .
" We 've obviously just reduced the price and that 's because we can pass the costs reductions we have straight on to consumers . "
Given that Sony cannot afford to lower the price of the PS3 anymore at the moment and Nintendo seems content with its unending stream of money , Microsoft looks to stand alone at the $ 200 price point , at least until sometime next year .
And , judging by the company 's reaction , even then it will likely drop down just to win the war for the best price tag .
As far as the cheapest console this generation goes , it looks like Microsoft has the position firmly locked down .

damn , some people got time ...
wow , really impressing ... wish I would have that time !!!

Apple recently held its Let ’s Rock ( cheesy name , nice products ) event in San Francisco .
Apple CEO
Steve Jobs was once again on hand to unveil his company ’s latest products .
The product announced in this video is the new iPod Nano , which is taking its cue from the ultra thin Macbook Air , and becoming the thinnest iPod Apple has ever produced .
More interesting than the new products was the fact that Jobs turned up at all .
Since he missed an investor conference call in the summer , and then appeared looking gaunt at a conference , there have been rumours about the state of his health .
I think Jobs looks okay , not great , but okay .
The only noticeable change in his appearance is how thin he now looks , but maybe that ’s just designed to fit in with the Macbook Air and iPod Nano ?
So , most of the season ’s biggest games have landed on our hard drives by now , which means two things will follow in their wake :
1 ) A torrent of finely - detailed complaints about this , that and the other feature .
With maybe the occasional compliment thrown in for good measure .
2) Patches !
There tends to be this weird two - sided coin for PC versions of big games – on the hand they often do n’t receive quite as much spit ’n’polish as the console versions , which is at least partly because there ’s no Microsoft or Sony certification hoops to jump through .
On the other , that lack of certification means fixing up minor holes can happen a lot more quickly .
Case in point – in the last couple of days , two very recent biggies have already seen their first patches : Fallout 3 and Far Cry 2 .
Let ’s start with the former , because the details are dulldulldull :
Fixed occasional crashes when exiting the game or using Alt F4 to exit .
Fixed crashes when using Alt - Tab while binks or credits were playing .
The game now restarts properly after title updates finish installing .
Which is important stuff even if it ’s not fun to talk about , and hopefully suggests Bethesda should be pretty on the ball about sorting out further bugs .
Have you lot any particular requests ?
Oh – you can grab the 6.59 Mb patch from here .
FC2 ’s sounds a bit more significant , sorting out a whole bunch of stuff in both single and multiplayer , as well as adding 5.1 sound support and a benchmark mode .
There ’s also a list of other issues currently being nosed at here .
Full patch notes below , and again , what bugs / failings d’you reckon especially needs a fix sharpish ?
Australia has been the focus of much tech news recently , as the country struggles with its Internet piracy ' problem ' .
Thanks to the infinite wisdom of ABC , Aussie Doctor
Who fans are left with a tough decision - wait until mid-January to watch the show 's pivotal ' Christmas Special ' - or pirate it with BitTorrent .
The number of people downloading TV shows via BitTorrent is growing .
Our ‘ Top 10 Most Pirated TV - Shows of 2008 ’ list reveals that some shows are amassing downloads in their millions and this will only increase .
Whereas some people may download a movie to avoid the cost , TV shows offer something different .
People are generally able to watch these shows for free on regular TV , but still , due to superior convenience and greater availability , those same people choose to get their fix from BitTorrent instead .
In Australia right now , online piracy is a hot topic , with anti-piracy outfits going as far as trying to hold ISPs accountable for the infringing actions of their customers , and the ‘ firewall ’ of Australia threatening to target BitTorrent .
But when it comes to deterring piracy it seems the big studios are blind to some of the small things they can do to make the situation better , instead of continually going to war with pirates – a war they simply cannot win .
The TV show Doctor Who , like many shows , has a ‘ Christmas Special ’ .
This episode , unsurprisingly , will air Christmas Day on the BBC in the UK .
In it the Doctor will have one of his trademark re-incarnations , a very important event for fans of the series .
The problem for Australian viewers is simple – ABC who have the rights to the show think that Christmas Day falls on January 25th 2009 down - under , as this is the date it will air there , officially at least .
But of course , Doctor Who fans know about BitTorrent , the show has appeared in our most pirated TV show lists and was even subject to a major ‘ leak ‘ of its own .
Thanks to ABC ’s short - sightedness , thousands of Australians will pirate this episode of their favorite show just minutes after it finishes airing in the UK and a month ahead of its official launch .
It ’s not just The Doctor who is capable of time - traveling these days .
Microsoft 's tricky balancing act in 2009 will be to phase out Windows XP while boosting demand for Windows Vista and building anticipation for Windows 7 .
Compounding this challenge is that Vista has been Microsoft 's most embattled operating system , and though recent reports say that Vista has improved over the past year , there are also reports of a growing indifference from users .
Many are sticking with Windows XP for now ( or even requesting to " downgrade " to XP with new computer purchases ) with the hope that Windows 7 will be more nimble and efficient than Vista .
Recent market share numbers from Net Applications Inc. show that Microsoft 's market share is slipping with both Windows and the Internet Explorer browser , while companies like Apple and Mozilla keep making incremental gains .
A silver lining in the Net Applications report is that Vista grew its market share in November and cracked the 20 percent mark for the fist time as Windows XP fell 1.81 percent .
With the definite release of Internet Explorer 8 and the possible release of Windows 7 happening in 2009 , plus Microsoft 's aggressive push into cloud computing with the Windows Azure operating system , the coming year looks to be a pivotal one for the software giant .
Keeping the Windows 7 Hype Machine on Low
So far , the hype surrounding Windows 7 has been kept to a minimum by Microsoft , likely an effort not to repeat the over - hyping that hurt Vista 's release .
Playing it cool with Windows 7 will also give Vista some breathing room as Windows XP slowly becomes less prevalent .
Tim Bajarin , president of consulting firm Creative Strategies , says that the potential conflict of enhancing demand for Vista while raising awareness about Windows 7 " does not seem to be impacting new sales of Vista on PCs .
In fact , pushing Windows 7 appears to be keeping people from downsizing to Windows XP at the business and consumer level as people are now anticipating upgrading to 7 in the near future , and it is not worth the trouble to go back to XP . "
The low - key marketing of Windows 7 is a smart tactic , says Michael Cherry , analyst with Directions on Microsoft , but warns that Microsoft should not become standoffish about the value of Windows 7 .
" They are being much more low - key in discussing the features of Windows 7 to put the Windows team in a position where they have under - promised and hopefully can over - deliver , " Cherry says .
" But Microsoft has to begin to share information with partners and customers to help reduce any potential compatibility issues . "
Though Cherry believes Vista is not as bad as its reputation , he thinks that with Windows 7 Microsoft needs " to do a better job of telling customers what hardware they truly need to run the OS , and they have to be able to articulate the value of upgrading to both consumers and businesses . "
Windows 7 Release : Sooner Is Better
Microsoft has not given an official release date for Windows 7 , but has said publicly that it expects to ship it within three years of the January 2007 consumer release of Windows Vista .
Gartner Research has predicted that Microsoft will ship Windows 7 in time for the 2009 holiday season , which would require shipment to take place around August 2009 .
Gartner analyst Michael Silver expects that Microsoft will try to differentiate Windows 7 from Vista by keeping ship date hype to a minimum and then delivering earlier than anticipated .
" If they do n't give a date , it 's harder for people to say they were late , " Silver says .
Bajarin believes that Microsoft needs to ship Windows 7 as fast as possible and move quickly to start getting all of their PC users to upgrade .
" If it is ready by mid-2009 as many believe it can be , there is no reason to delay it . "
Another benefit of shipping Windows 7 as soon as possible , says Bajarin , is it could quash the lingering stigma of Vista .
He adds , " As long as Windows 7 is rock solid when it is released and gets good reviews , the Vista stigma will most likely fade away quickly . "

Google says WSJ ' confused , ' reaffirms commitment to net neutrality Agence France - Presse
Published : Monday December 15 , 2008
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AFP )  Google on Monday reaffirmed its commitment to " net neutrality " after a newspaper reported the Internet giant was moving away from its support of the principle that all Web traffic should be treated equally .
" Google remains strongly committed to the principle of net neutrality , and we will continue to work with policymakers in the years ahead to keep the Internet free and open , " Richard Whitt , Google 's Washington - based counsel for telecom and media , wrote in a posting on the company blog .
Whitt was replying to a story in The Wall Street Journal which said Google had approached major cable and telecom companies that carry Internet traffic with a proposal to " create a fast lane for its own content . "
Such a move would conflict with the principle of net neutrality , which is backed by the regulatory US Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , under which cable and telecom companies provide equal network access for all content providers .
Cable and telecom companies , with Web traffic soaring , have been seeking ways to get Internet content providers to share in their network costs , the Journal noted , and charging companies for " fast lanes " is one option .
The Journal quoted one major cable operator in talks with Google as saying it has been reluctant so far to strike a deal , however , because of concern it might violate the FCC guidelines on network neutrality .
Whitt , the Google counsel , described the Journal report as " confused " and said what the Internet company has sought to do is to place " edge caching servers " within the facilities of broadband Internet Service Providers ( ISPs ) .
Edge caching on servers near end users allows for quicker delivery of data such as YouTube videos and other frequently accessed content .
Whitt noted that " some critics have questioned whether improving Web performance through edge caching ... violates the concept of network neutrality , " but he argued that it does not .
" Edge caching is a common practice used by ISPs and application and content providers in order to improve the end user experience , " he said , adding that " Google has offered to ' colocate ' caching servers within broadband providers ' own facilities .
" We 've always said that broadband providers can engage in activities like colocation and caching , so long as they do so on a non-discriminatory basis , " Whitt said .
" None of them require ( or encourage ) that Google traffic be treated with higher priority than other traffic , " he said .
During his campaign for the White House , US president - elect Barack Obama came out strongly in favor of net neutrality .

Anti-gay amendments and propositions passed in numerous states - including here in Florida , where Amendment 2 ( the so - called " Marriage Protection " Amendment ) passed with a supermajority of 62 % .
So that leaves many of us here in Florida wondering :
Barack Obama shattered a glass ceiling by becoming the first African - American elected to the office of the Presidency .
But for many in the LGBT community , it was also a day of tremendous setbacks and the installation of a new and more confining ceiling of bigotry .
Looking Back and Learning from our Mistakes
Obviously we are all upset and depressed .
Emotions are running high and the finger pointing has begun .
And while no one person , group , or demographic deserves all the " blame " , we do need to take a serious look as a community at what happened in the campaign and how we can learn from those mistakes .
Giving up the Minority Vote
One of the contributing factors to the passage of Amendment 2 that is already being talked about is the heavy turnout of the African - American and Latino Community and their overwhelming statistical support for Amendment 2 .
It is important to realize that this vote is not the lone cause of Amendment 2 passing , but it is a realistic factor that needs to be looked at and addressed .
I do not think we need to " blame " anyone , but we need to look at strategy and outreach .
I think the failure on this rests squarely on our community 's shoulders , and that of the campaigns waged against Amendment 2 .
We did not , as a whole and as a strategy , reach out and actively engage these communities .
Instead , we gave them over to the religious right , whose case for the Amendment was the only one they ever heard in their churches .
Where we did engage on an individual level ( like Bilerico contributor and Law Professor Anthony Niedwiecki , who went to numerous town hall meetings and debates sponsored by the Urban League ) , our side was listened to and we changed hearts and minds .
By not doing this as a statewide campaign strategy , we let the other side win .
Divided and Conquered
We also allowed ourselves to be divided and conquered .
There were at least two separate campaigns - with different websites , branding , messages , and plans - going on simultaneously in Florida .
This was a waste of time , money , and energy .
How much more could we have done if we were n't wasting money doing the same polling , focus groups , mailers , and websites ?
Meanwhile , our opponents had one group , one message , and one plan .
And they won .
Community and Ally Apathy
We also failed to really get our own community up in arms about this amendment .
There were many dedicated activists working themselves into the ground , but many in the LGBT community where either too embittered by the history of anti-gay legislation in Florida or distracted by other causes and political races to throw their full weight behind Amendment 2 .
We also failed to call in any political capital our community had earned with leaders and allies in the state .
It seems many in our movement are so used to taking whatever scraps are thrown from politicians that they will not reach out , twist some arms , and demand the people we supported support us .
I think Florida failed to really communicate with the national LGBT community and groups .
With the fight for marriage in California getting much of the attention , our state was left behind in funding and support .
I 'm not sure we managed to stress how important the Florida battle was ( we lost not just the right to marry - which we never had here - but perhaps even basic domestic partnerships rights ) .
Where We Stand
So where do we stand right now in Florida ?
Currently what has happened is that the ban on same - sex marriage has been written into the constitution .
Domestic partnerships registries and benefits still stand - for now .
There is sure to be a long legal fight ahead , led by the very same dishonest people behind the " Yes on 2 " who said it would n't affect domestic partnerships .
We have to be ready and able to fight this push that will surely come .
Also , I hope that the people from Florida Red & Blue continue their lawsuit against the illegal campaign tactics of Yes2 Marriage and John Stemberger .
They need to be punished - and kept busy - which might delay or derail their future activities .
Plus , everyone needs to know how this battle was won- by lies , deceit , and illegal activities .
Moving Florida Forward
Where do we go from here ?
One of the first things I think we should do is mirror what is happening in California .
We need to be protesting .
We need to be in the streets and letting people know what has happened .
This is n't the time to sit quietly by and shrug our shoulders at another loss for the LGBT community in our state .
We need our statewide leaders and organizations to step up and galvanize our community and our allies .
And these protests need to extend to the groups ( like the Florida Republican Party , the Catholic League , the Baptist League , and many other groups ) that gave money and support to Amendment 2 .
We need to hold politicians accountable - like Governor Crist and others - and make sure there are consequences for their support of hate and bigotry .
We also need to be having conversations like this - figuring out where we went wrong and how we overcome it .
Not in closed door meetings with the same leaders that ran these campaigns , but with the entire community .
I also think we need to be proactive .
We cannot wait for the religious right to take this to court and try to take away more of our rights .
We need to be shaping the argument now .
Perhaps it is time for a push for an expanded , statewide domestic partnership registry .
Instead of having to fight back and go through the courts to define Amendment 2 , let 's work to get our own progressive bill on the ballot and passed .
If there is overwhelming support for civil unions or domestic partnerships , like emails from the No on 2 Campaign say , then we need to act on it and secure our rights .
One thing is clear - we cannot keep sitting idly by while more of our rights are taken away .
We had our time to mourn this loss , but now it 's time to shake it off and move forward .
We need to regroup , get tough , and keep fighting .
Treasuries staged yet another massive rally today as Helicopter Ben imitates Paulson and pulls out his own bazooka .
Inquiring minds are noting that Treasury Yields Drop to Record Lows as Bernanke Cites Buybacks .
Treasuries rose , pushing yields to record lows , as Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the central bank may purchase Treasuries and target long - term interest rates to combat the deepening recession .
Bonds rallied for a fourth day , sending yields on two- , 10 - and 30 - year debt to the lowest since the Treasury began regular sales of the securities .
Bernanke said he has “ obviously limited ” room to lower interest rates further and may use less conventional policies , such as buying Treasury securities .
“ The thing that was significant is the reminder that the FOMC can buy long Treasuries , ” said Jamie Jackson , who oversees government and agency debt trading at Minneapolis - based RiverSource Investments , which manages $ 90 billion .
“ Bernanke explicitly said they still had more room to go in easing policy . ”
Text Of Helicopter Ben's Speech - December 1 , 2008
The Outlook for Policy
Going forward , our nation 's economic policy must vigorously address the substantial risks to financial stability and economic growth that we face .
I will conclude my remarks by discussing the policy options of the Federal Reserve , focusing on the three aspects of policy that I laid out earlier : interest rate policy , liquidity policy , and policies to stabilize the financial system .
Regarding interest rate policy , although further reductions from the current federal funds rate target of 1 percent are certainly feasible , at this point the scope for using conventional interest rate policies to support the economy is obviously limited .
Indeed , the actual federal funds rate has been trading consistently below the Committee 's 1 percent target in recent weeks , reflecting the large quantity of reserves that our lending activities have put into the system .
In principle , our ability to pay interest on excess reserves at a rate equal to the funds rate target , as we have been doing , should keep the actual rate near the target , because banks should have no incentive to lend overnight funds at a rate lower than what they can receive from the Federal Reserve .
In practice , however , several factors have served to depress the market rate below the target .
One such factor is the presence in the market of large suppliers of funds , notably the government - sponsored enterprises ( GSEs ) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which are not eligible to receive interest on reserves and are thus willing to lend overnight federal funds at rates below the target .
1
We will continue to explore ways to keep the effective federal funds rate closer to the target .
Although conventional interest rate policy is constrained by the fact that nominal interest rates cannot fall below zero , the second arrow in the Federal Reserve 's quiver -- the provision of liquidity - - remains effective .
Indeed , there are several means by which the Fed could influence financial conditions through the use of its balance sheet , beyond expanding our lending to financial institutions .
First , the Fed could purchase longer - term Treasury or agency securities on the open market in substantial quantities .
This approach might influence the yields on these securities , thus helping to spur aggregate demand .
Indeed , last week the Fed announced plans to purchase up to $ 100 billion in GSE debt and up to $ 500 billion in GSE mortgage - backed securities over the next few quarters .
It is encouraging that the announcement of that action was met by a fall in mortgage interest rates .
Expanding the provision of liquidity leads also to further expansion of the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve .
To avoid inflation in the long run and to allow short - term interest rates ultimately to return to normal levels , the Fed 's balance sheet will eventually have to be brought back to a more sustainable level .
The FOMC will ensure that that is done in a timely way .
However , that is an issue for the future ; for now , the goal of policy must be to support financial markets and the economy .
Footnotes
1. Banks have an incentive to borrow from the GSEs and then redeposit the funds at the Federal Reserve ; as a result , banks earn a sure profit equal to the difference between the rate they pay the GSEs and the rate they receive on excess reserves .
However , thus far , this type of arbitrage has not been occurring on a sufficient scale , perhaps because banks have not yet fully adjusted their reserve - management practices to take advantage of this opportunity .
The Theory and The Practice
We will continue to explore ways to keep the effective federal funds rate closer to the target
Bazooka Is Loaded
So what then might the Fed do if its target interest rate , the overnight federal funds rate , fell to zero ?
One relatively straightforward extension of current procedures would be to try to stimulate spending by lowering rates further out along the Treasury term structure -- that is , rates on government bonds of longer maturities .
There are at least two ways of bringing down longer - term rates , which are complementary and could be employed separately or in combination .
One approach , similar to an action taken in the past couple of years by the Bank of Japan , would be for the Fed to commit to holding the overnight rate at zero for some specified period .
Because long - term interest rates represent averages of current and expected future short - term rates , plus a term premium , a commitment to keep short - term rates at zero for some time -- if it were credible - - would induce a decline in longer - term rates .
A more direct method , which I personally prefer , would be for the Fed to begin announcing explicit ceilings for yields on longer - maturity Treasury debt ( say , bonds maturing within the next two years ) .
The Fed could enforce these interest - rate ceilings by committing to make unlimited purchases of securities up to two years from maturity at prices consistent with the targeted yields .
If this program were successful , not only would yields on medium - term Treasury securities fall , but ( because of links operating through expectations of future interest rates ) yields on longer - term public and private debt ( such as mortgages ) would likely fall as well .
Lower rates over the maturity spectrum of public and private securities should strengthen aggregate demand in the usual ways and thus help to end deflation .

I have been watching with concern and alarm for many years now the threat of a Constitutional Convention .
Article V of the Constitution appears to be a part of the document that was poorly written .
Here are some examples :
1 . The failed Equal Rights Amendment caused much confusion when states not only rescinded their approval , but Congress unilaterally extended the approval time .
2 . The 27th amendment took 203 years to approve .
It was a good amendment , but the very fact that there is no time limit on approval is dangerous .
In 1807 Congress passed an amendment making it possible to banish natural - born American citizens .
It has never been approved by a single state , but it is still out there . . . dangling .
3 . If a con-con is called for a specific reason ( balance the budget , outlaw abortion , define marriage , ban flag burning ) , there is no limitation on what is actually discussed or approved in a convention , and then sent to the states .
4 . If a hypothetical 16 states call a con-con to outlaw abortion , 9 to ban flag burning , and 22 to balance the budget , have we then reached the required 34 states ?
Are states that make a call for two different reasons to be counted only once ?
5 . Can states rescind their call , as some have already done ?
The 10th amendment would indicate that they do , but what if Congress does not recognize this , and they call a con-con anyway ?
After all , the ERA did not stop them from making unilateral decisions in the late 70s .
Article V does not answer these questions .
The call for a con-con is upon us again , with Ohio being the focus .
I used to think that this would be a dangerous disaster , but perhaps freedom - lovers ought to rethink that fear , and here ’s why .
Let ’s go back to 1788 when states were asked to approve the new Constitution .
Article VII states that the Constitution would not go into effect unless 9 of the 13 states ( two - thirds ) , meeting in local conventions , approved the document .
This was reached without the influential states of Virginia and New York .
( They later joined , but with the condition that they reserved the right to withdraw should the new government prove not to their liking … but that is a different story ) .
But what if they and the other two states had n’t approved ?
History is unquestioned at this point : they would have gone their separate ways as independent nations , which is what the Declaration announced in 1776 anyway , but has since been smothered by what Southerners used to call “ the late unpleasantness ” .
Let ’s return to our topic at hand : a new constitutional convention .
It is true , the sky is the limit .
A convention could rewrite , fundamentally alter or perhaps even destroy the work of 1787 and the 27 amendments since then .
It could announce just about anything : a president for life , an establishment of a monarchy , a unicameral Congress , mandatory socialism , global government . . . all kinds of mischief .
But such a document would have to be submitted to the states for approval , and 38 would be necessary for ratification .
Please note : there is a bit of inconsistency here with Article V … only two - thirds of the 13 states were required to ratify the Constitution in 1788 , but Article V expects three - fourths of the states ( 38 ) before any con-con ’s recommendations go into effect .
Supposing that 38 states approve whatever comes out of a con-con , what about the 12 that do not ?
Why should they be forced to accept the changed conditions that led them into the union of states in the first place ?
Sure , brute force might do it , but where would the moral issue of slavery be this time around ?
I submit that a new con-con , if indeed its control falls into the hands of the forces aligned against freedom , would in fact provide a mechanism for secession — a mechanism that few would be able to dispute .
This mechanism should always have remained within the prerogatives of states ’ rights , but it could now enter the public mind once again , accepted on its own merits , and with an escape clause for all those states that so desire to use it .
Power usually overreaches itself .
This might be it for the New World Order .

The second presidential debate in Nashville , TN played out much like the first debate .
Republican John McCain focused on character and leadership , while Obama talked about issues and policy .
In an election year where Americans want change and a new direction , McCain missed an opportunity to America exactly what he would do if elected president , while Obama took another step towards the White House .
One of the most telling exchanges of the debate occurred when moderator Tom Brokaw asked the candidates to prioritize between health care , energy policy and entitlements .
McCain gave a one line answer , then launched into talking bipartisanship and energy , “ I think you can work on all three at once , Tom .
I think it ’s very important that reform our entitlement programs .
My friends , we are not going to be able to provide the same benefit for present - day workers that we are going — that present - day retirees have today .
We ’re going to have to sit down across the table , Republican and Democrat , as we did in 1983 between Ronald Reagan and Tip O’Neill . ”
He continued to talk about things that had nothing to do with the question , “ I know how to do that .
I have a clear record of reaching across the aisle , whether it be Joe Lieberman or Russ Feingold or Ted Kennedy or others .
That ’s my clear record .
We can work on nuclear power plants .
Build a whole bunch of them , create millions of new jobs .
We have to have all of the above , alternative fuels , wind , tide , solar , natural gas , clean coal technology .
All of these things we can do as Americans and we can take on this mission and we can overcome it . ”

In contrast , Obama answered the question , “ We ’re going to have to prioritize , just like a family has to prioritize .
Now , I ’ve listed the things that I think have to be at the top of the list .
Energy we have to deal with today , because you ’re paying $ 3.80 here in Nashville for gasoline , and it could go up .
And it ’s a strain on your family budget , but it ’s also bad for our national security , because countries like Russia and Venezuela and , you know , in some cases , countries like Iran , are benefiting from higher oil prices .
So we ’ve got to deal with that right away …
Health care is priority number two , because that broken health care system is bad not only for families , but it ’s making our businesses less competitive .
And , number three , we ’ve got to deal with education so that our young people are competitive in a global economy . ”
Obama won this debate because except for announcing that he wanted the government to buy bad mortgages , most of McCain ’s answers were almost word for word the same as the first debate .
McCain ’s performance and demeanor tonight were much better than in the first debate , but he offered little that was new , absolutely no insight into his policy or how he would govern .
Surprisingly , McCain needed a game changer but stuck to the same game plan that lost him the first debate .
The character and leadership issues are not working for him , so this was his chance to show that he can lead on the economy , and he failed .
Obama stuck to what has been working for him in the past three weeks , and frankly Obama is looking more like a president while McCain comes off as a partisan senator .
At worst , others may view this debate as a draw , which is as good as a loss for John McCain .
Ice on Mars : NASA radar detects vast glaciers on red planet
Vast glaciers , up to a mile thick and tens of miles long , have been discovered on Mars in what scientists believe is the remnants of an ice age .
The ice sheets are the ‘ most dramatic ’ evidence yet of climate change on the red planet , and could help us understand temperature shifts on Earth , the U.S. researchers say .
They detected the sheets beneath a protective layer of rocky debris using a ground - penetrating radar on the NASA Mars Reconnaisance Orbiter .
Revealed :
Huge glaciers have been detected beneath rocky debris that may be the the remnants of ice sheets that blanketed parts of Mars in a past ice age
The discovery reveals a previously untapped source of drinking water and rocket fuel , which promises to aid future manned missions to the planet .
Scientists have previously detected ice on Mars but never in such large quantities away from the poles .
The glaciers were located the Hellas Basin region – an area spanning mid-latitudes in the Southern hemisphere , which is equivalent to the latitude of Australia on Earth .
A similar band with even larger quantities of ice is thought to be awaiting discovery in the Northern hemisphere .
Vast :
The glaciers are up to a mile thick and one is estimated to be as big as Los Angeles
The biggest ice sheets , thought to have formed 100 million years ago , are up to 13 miles long and 60 miles wide , the team revealed in Science magazine .
Experts have already shown evidence of climate change on Mars , but lead author Dr. Jack Holt from the University of Texas in Austin says that this is ‘ by far the most dramatic ’ .
It is likely that the glaciers will have preserved a frozen record of the planet ’s past chemistry , which will give us a snap shot of what the environment and climate was like , he explained .
But Dr Holt is not expecting to find the highly anticipated evidence of life on Mars .
He believes the planet ’s surface could not support life in the ice age .
Then and now :
Three craters containing the glaciers covered by rocky debris , left , and a computer reconstruction of how the planet surface would have looked in a former ice age , right
This discovery is similar to massive ice glaciers that have been detected under rocky coverings in Antarctica .
' Altogether , these glaciers almost certainly represent the largest reservoir of water ice on Mars that is not in the polar caps , ' said Dr. Holt .
' Just one of the features we examined is three times larger than the city of Los Angeles and up to half a mile thick .
' And there are many more .
In addition to their scientific value , they could be a source of water to support future exploration of Mars . '
The ground - penetrating radar previously detected similar craters by the cliffs in the northern hemisphere of Mars , which are believed to conceal more glaciers .
' There 's an even larger volume of water ice in the northern deposits , ' said geologist Jeffrey J. Plaut .
' The fact these features are in the same latitude bands , about 35 to 60 degrees in both hemispheres , points to a climate - driven mechanism for explaining how they got there . '
City News Service is reporting that the L.A. County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously ( the five person board ’s two Republican members were absent ) to join an existing lawsuit against Proposition 8 . that is filed with the CA Supreme Court .
Members ” [ Zev ] Yaroslavsky and [ Gloria ] Molina , both Democrats , want the nonpartisan board to ask a judge to issue an order barring the state from enforcing the same - sex marriage ban until a determination can be made by the Supreme Court regarding the constitutionality of Proposition 8 . ”
Wow .
Yet another devastating story for the McCain campaign .
( Joe calls this story “ luscious . ” )
Politico writes about the GOP “ circular firing squad ” that ’s begun over who lost the election for John McCain .
Here are a few excerpts – but please read the entire story , it ’s a doozy .
Seriously , this story will put such a smile on your face , you ’ll thank me :
With despair rising even among many of John McCain ’s own advisors , influential Republicans inside and outside his campaign are engaged in an intense round of blame - casting and rear - covering — - much of it virtually conceding that an Election Day rout is likely .
The candidate ’s strategists in recent days have become increasingly vocal in interviews and conference calls about what they call unfair news media coverage and Barack Obama ’s wide financial advantage — both complaints laying down a post-election storyline for why their own efforts proved ineffectual .
These public comments offer a whiff of an increasingly acrid behind - the - scenes GOP meltdown — a blame game played out through not - for - attribution comments to reporters that operatives know will find their way into circulation … .
At his Northern Virginia headquarters , some McCain aides are already speaking of the campaign in the past tense .
Morale , even among some of the heartiest and most loyal staffers , has plummeted .
And many past and current McCain advisors are warring with each other over who led the candidate astray .
One well - connected Republican in the private sector was shocked to get calls and resumes in the past few days from what he said were senior McCain aides – a breach of custom for even the worst - off campaigns .
“ It ’s not an extraordinarily happy place to be right now , ” said one senior McCain aide .
“ I ’m not gonna lie .
It ’s just unfortunate . ”
“ If you really want to see what ‘ going negative ’ is in politics , just watch the back - stabbing and blame game that we ’re starting to see , ” said Mark McKinnon , the ad man who left the campaign after McCain wrapped up the GOP primary ….
Offered a chance to respond to the suggestion that the McCain campaign is awash in defeatism , a McCain official delivered a decidedly measured appraisal : “ We have a real chance in Pennsylvania .
We are in trouble in Colorado , Nevada and Virginia .
We have lost Iowa and New Mexico .
We are OK in Missouri , Ohio and Florida .
Our voter intensity is good and we can match their buy dollar for dollar starting today till the election .
It ’s a long shot but it ’s worth fighting for . ”
….A New York Times Sunday magazine piece chronicling McCain ’s campaign featured numerous not - for - attribution McCain staffers participating in what amounted to a campaign autopsy .
Due to a new EU trade rule , wineries can't use the word " port " on their label unless the wine was actually made in Portugal .
California 's Peltier Station Winery , however , discovered ( or should I say invented ? ) a loophole : they called their new dessert wine " USB " and put a tree with USB roots on the label .
And that 's just the beginning of the geekery .
The label maker , 6 West Design , also reveals that the USB - tree on the front is composed of binary code that translates to " Peltier Station . "
And in case you still do n't get the pun , there are several fill - in - the - blanks on the back label like " an im____ant agreement " or " in your ____folio . "
So cheers to " Peltier Stanton " for sticking it to the EU in the geekiest way possible while still getting us drunk with our cigars .
But can we plug in a cooling USA USB fan for the hangover the next day ?
This is American wine after all .

President - elect Barack Obama should embrace an overlooked riskless exit strategy for the war in Iraq that has inflicted more than the equivalent of another Sept. 11 , 2001 , on brave American soldiers .
After Inauguration , he should declare the war illegal because it was initiated by President George W. Bush pursuant to an unconstitutional delegation of power by Congress effectuated by the Authorization for the Use of Military Force Against Iraq ( AUMFAI ) .
Mr. Obama should announce that all combat operations in Iraq will cease 30 days after Inauguration unless Congress enacts a statute directing him to continue the war .
He can depend on congressional inaction .
Members lack both the incentive and political backbone to take responsibility for sending men and women to die on a fool ’s errand to make Shi’ites , Sunnis , and Kurds democrats after 5,000 consecutive years of despotism and vicious tribal , ethnic or religious enmities .
After Congress balks at President Obama ’s challenge , all U.S. combat troops in Iraq would return home in an orderly fashion beginning February 2009 .
President Obama could blame any ensuing Iraqi strife , ethnic cleansing or domination by Iran on Congress for failing to prolong the war .
In any event , if the American military withdrawal aggravated Iraq ’s current convulsions , the subject would be off the media headlines within six months without American deaths or injuries .
That is what happened over Vietnam in comparable circumstances after North Vietnam conquered South Vietnam in April 1975 .
President Obama ’s popularity would soar for bringing authentic change in the Constitution ’s machinery for deciding whether wars are worth fighting .
Ending the American troop presence and terminating the Iraqi war would shave defense spending by more than $ 10 billion monthly .
Those savings should be dedicated to defending Americans in the United States with upgraded intelligence collection , border security and retaliatory capability .
Section 3 of the AUMFAI unconstitutionally delegated to the president unchecked power to decide on warfare against Iraq : “ The president is authorized to use the Armed Forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in order to ( 1 ) defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq ; and , ( 2 ) enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council regarding Iraq . ”
The Constitution , however , unambiguously fastens on Congress the responsibility for directing the initiation of warfare based on its independent evaluation of alleged foreign dangers .
Every Founding
Father agreed that one man or small group of men should never be entrusted with authority to initiate warfare because they would be driven by visions of power and glory into reckless military adventures .
Future Justice of the Supreme Court , James Wilson , at the Pennsylvania ratification convention , explained : “ This system will not hurry us into war ; it is calculated to guard against it .
It will not be in the power of a single man , or single body of men , to involve us in such distress ; for the important power of declaring war is vested in the legislature at large : this declaration must be made with the concurrence of the House of Representatives : from this circumstance we may draw a certain conclusion that nothing but our interest can draw us into war . ”
James Madison , future president of the United States and father of the Constitution , amplified in a letter to Thomas Jefferson : “ The Constitution supposes , what the history of all governments demonstrates , that the executive is the branch of power most interested in war , and most prone to it .
It has accordingly with studied care vested the question of war in the legislature . ”
War crowns the president with secrecy , the control of information , spending , appointments and the intoxicating opportunity to make history .
None of these incentives skews congressional judgments in favor of war .
In Clinton v. New York ( 1998 ) , the Supreme Court held unconstitutional a congressional delegation of line - item veto authority .
That delegation was less damaging to the Constitution ’s text and purpose than was the congressional delegation of warmaking authority in the AUMFAI to the president .
The latter invited an ill - advised war in Iraq that the Constitution ’s makers intended to avoid by preventing the branch of government most interested in war from holding the power to initiate it .
To justify his invasion of Iraq , President Bush predictably inflated the dangers that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction , was collaborating with al Qaeda , and had miniaturized nuclear weapons for which al Qaeda had promised to serve as human delivery vehicles .
President Obama should embrace the unsurpassed wisdom of the Founding Fathers .
As they expressly instructed , the Constitution ’s task is to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity , not to dispatch the military abroad in search of monsters to destroy , to build an empire or to remake the world in our own image .
To achieve that objective , Congress must be forced to assume responsibility for initiating war .
The result would be twice - blessed : it would honor the Constitution ; and , it would make President Obama the greatest statesman of his era .

University of Toronto researchers have uncovered a huge filtering system in China that tracks and keeps records of text messages containing politically charged words sent through the internet phone application Skype .
The system keeps track of text messages , but not voice calls , sent through TOM - Skype , a joint venture between the Chinese wireless company TOM Online — a division of the Hong Kong - based TOM Group Ltd. — and eBay , the web auction company that bought online phone service Skype in 2005 .
The discovery once again shines a spotlight on the collective internet filtering efforts at work in China — known as the Great Firewall of China — and raises the possibility that the data could be used for surveillance .
The report is from Citizen Lab , a group of security researchers and human rights activists who focus on the intersection of civic politics and digital media .
The group is housed at the university 's Munk Centre for International Studies .
The report , entitled Breaching Trust :
An analysis of surveillance and security practices on China 's TOM - Skype platform , was published Wednesday on the University of Toronto 's Information Warfare Monitor website .
Nart Villeneuve , a research fellow at the Citizen Lab , made the discovery .
Villeneuve monitored data generated by TOM - Skype and noted that when offensive words were sent using the service , an encrypted message was sent to an internet address .
The trail led him to TOM Online 's computers , where , due to a security lapse , he was able to read their computer directories over the web .
He and his Citizen Lab colleagues were able to view , download and archive 166,766 unique messages that had been filtered and they successfully translated close to 100,000 .
While some contained obscenity - filled language , many messages appeared to contain keywords related to sensitive topics such as the religious group Falun Gong , Taiwan independence and opposition to the Communist Party of China .
Keywords do not appear to be the only reason why certain messages were flagged , however , as the researchers were unable themselves to trigger the filtering of data by sending messages containing those words .
The researchers suggest geography and known addresses may also play a role in what messages were being filtered .
In addition to keeping track of the text in the messages , the system also recorded Skype caller information .
Further testing would be required to determine conclusively that the messages were being used for surveillance and not just filtering , say the report 's authors .
However , regardless of intent , they say the system could be used for surveillance .
Jennifer Caukin , an eBay spokeswoman , issued a statement to CBC News on Thursday saying in April 2006 , Skype publicly disclosed that TOM operated a text filter that blocked certain words on chat messages but said it did not compromise TOM customers ' privacy .
" Last night , we learned that this practice was changed without our knowledge or consent and we are extremely concerned .
We deeply apologize for the breach of privacy relating to chat messages on TOM 's servers in China and we are urgently addressing this situation with TOM , " she wrote .
The Citizen Lab researchers said the report runs counter to the belief — popular among dissidents in China — that Skype 's encryption technology protects users from government monitoring .
Citizen Lab head Ron Deibert and colleague Rafal Rohozinski said in the report the findings are further proof that even secure chats can leave a trace .
" This is a wake - up call to everyone who has ever put their ( blind ) faith in the assurances offered up by network intermediaries like Skype , " they wrote .
" Declarations and privacy policies are no substitute for the type of due diligence that the research put forth here represents . "

GUANTANAMO BAY U.S. NAVAL BASE , Cuba ( Reuters ) -
The self - styled mastermind of the September 11 attacks and four co-defendants sent a note to a military judge at Guantanamo on Monday saying they wanted to confess and plead guilty .
The judge said he would question the five , including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , the suspected planner of the September 11 attacks , to ensure that was their wish .
The judge , Army Col.
Steven Henley , read from the note , which began : “ We all five have reached an agreement to request from the commission an immediate hearing session in order to announce our confessions ... with our earnest desire in this regard without being under any kind of pressure , threat , intimidations or promise from any party . ”
The note said all five wished to plead guilty and withdraw any pending motions filed by their military - appointed lawyers , whom they do not trust and have tried to fire .
The surprise move by the five defendants came as the U.S. military resumed pretrial hearings at the Guantanamo naval base , in a remote U.S. - controlled corner of Cuba , for the accused plotters of the September 11 attacks .
The hearings went forward as scheduled , even though the pending change in the U.S. administration made it unlikely defendants ’ trials would ever be held at the base .
U.S. President - elect Barack Obama .
who takes office on January 20 , has said he will shut down the widely condemned Guantanamo prison camp and try detainees in the regular U.S. civilian or military courts rather than the special Guantanamo tribunals created by the Bush administration .
He added : " I am very goal - oriented , I know what to do with my life and I am working towards it . "
In his suicide note he wrote : " I have come to believe that my life has all been meaningless .
I keep trying and I keep failing .
I have thought about and attempted suicide many times in the past . ' "

New York , NY – The Toy Manufacturing Association of America ( TMAA ) has filed a lawsuit on behalf of its clients like Fisher Price and Mattel against Santa Claus for giving away countless toys every Christmas cutting in the manufacturer 's profits .
“ We do n't know what he 's doing up there .
He 's got some toy duplicating device and he 's just giving them away for free .
He 's violating trademarks , copyrights , the whole gamut of intellectual property issues , ” said TMAA executive Barry Hamburg .
“ Santa must be stopped . ”
Santa 's magical method for producing infinite copies of toys without use of materials opens up sticky legal issues for the “ Saint ” as well as violates laws regarding the conservation of matter .
Santa said he knew this issue was coming .
“ You cut into these big corporations ' profits and the first thing they do is bring out the lawyers .
Do n't they know I 'm giving them free promotion and getting toys to kids that would n't be able to purchase them anyway ?
They should be paying me , ” said Santa .
If the court rules in favor of the TMAA , this could open the floodgates for lawsuits against the Easter Bunny from the American Egg Board and the Shoe Fairy from the National Shoe Foundation .

Many advocates of the “ free toy ” movement supported Santa in his fight against the TMAA including Free Toy Foundation founder and former Santa elf , Mitch Penman .
“ I think the TMAA is fooling themselves if they think that stopping Santa is going to improve their business .
How are its millions of customers going to feel about them when they wake up Christmas morning and find that Santa has n't arrived ?
Toys just want to be free , ” said Penman .
A federal judge has filed an injunction to stop Santa from delivering any toys this Christmas pending a review of the case .
Santa has filed an emergency appeal with the Supreme Court to remove the injunction .

Children can now trace their biological parents when they are 18 The limit on the number of pregnancies that can be created from the sperm of a single donor should be raised , fertility experts suggest .
Dr Mark Hamilton and Dr Allan Pacey , of the British Fertility Society ( BFS ) , said the UK was struggling with a serious shortage of sperm donors .
Writing in the British Medical Journal , they said radical reform of the current system was needed .
They blamed removal of donor anonymity in 2005 for the donor shortage .
Children can now trace their biological parents when they are 18 .
Overall , the number of sperm donors has fallen by 40 % in 15 years .
Pregnancy limit
The experts warned that many fertility clinics have long waiting lists , or have been forced to stop providing services altogether .
The current shortage means that many of those seeking donor insemination treatment are going to clinics overseas
Walter Merricks
Donor Conception Network
At present around 4,000 UK patients request donor sperm each year .
Under UK regulations , the maximum number of families that can use sperm from the same donor is 10 .
This is to reduce the risk that children born from sperm donated by the same man will have children together in later life .
Therefore , assuming not all donors would consent to their sperm being used in 10 pregnancies , a minimum of 500 new donors are needed every year to meet demand .
But in 2006 there were only 307 new registrations .
Dr Hamilton and Dr Pacey argue that the current limit is arbitrary and not evidence based - and a more flexible approach is needed .
They point out that the size of the UK population is enough for a large safety margin to already exist .
In the Netherlands , which has a smaller population than the UK , the upper limit is 25 offspring per donor , while in France it is five .
The BFS doctors are also touting a possible reorganisation of recruitment services , with donors handled by large regional centres , while smaller local centres deal with recipients .
Currently , up to 35 % of potential donors are lost after their first enquiry and never assessed .

The Dr Hamilton and Dr Pacey said it was vital to try to reduce this number by making services more accessible and efficient .
One possibility would be to set up sperm sharing schemes in which fertile men could donate sperm to partly fund IVF for their partners .
Dr Pacey , who is based at the University of Sheffield , said : " Many clinics have really struggled over the past few years to recruit enough donors to treat their patients and this has caused a lot of anguish amongst both patients and professionals alike . "
However , the doctors said safety concerns ruled out raising the age limit of sperm donors from the present 40 years , or lowering the acceptable levels of semen quality .
Walter Merricks , of the Donor Conception Network agreed that reform was needed .
He said : " The current shortage means that many of those seeking donor insemination treatment are going to clinics overseas .
" The vast majority of our members would far prefer to be treated locally with a UK donor under the protections afforded by Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority ( HFEA ) regulation . "
A Department of Health spokesperson said it would consider the BFS recommendations carefully .
The spokesperson denied the removal of anonymity had led to a drop in donor numbers , but agreed that more were needed .
An HFEA spokesperson said the limit on use of donor sperm was under review .

Scientists : Rocks Could Be Used to Capture CO2
November 5th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
According to researchers at Columbia University , peridotite rocks could be harnessed to capture carbon dioxide in large quantities , potentially offsetting billions of tons of CO2 emissions each year .
The rocks , found in Oman , California , New Guinea and elsewhere , produce calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate rock ( both solids ) upon contact with CO2 .
Previous attempts to transport the rock to power plants and combine it with smokestack gases have been seen as too expensive .
But the Columbia researchers have discovered a high rate of reaction underground — in the Omani desert , peridotite is naturally absorbing 10,000 to 100,000 tons of CO2 each year .
As a result , CO2 could be sent to the rocks at a much lower cost .
Columbia ’s scientists believe that they could speed up the carbon - locking process by 100,000 times by boring into the ground and injecting heated water containing CO2 .
And since the CO2 would be stored in the form of rock , there would be no chance of it leaking out .
The researchers have completed successful tests of their theory in Oman , and now want to test on a larger scale .
Whether they will reap such successful results elsewhere remains to be seen .
Whatever the case , this is a promising development — carbon sequestration techniques currently run the risk of earthquakes or other natural events releasing massive amounts of buried CO2 into the atmosphere .
Eliminating that risk makes the practice seem much more viable in the long term .

By cutting back on spending , the post office had a net operating income of $ 2.7B in ' 08 , but still ended up in the red because of a costly health benefit fund for retirees .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The Postal Service ended its fiscal year $ 2.8 billion in the red , battered by a faltering economy that cut the amount of mail being sent .
Postmaster General John Potter said the agency is making sharp cuts in hours and overtime , but added there are no plans for layoffs .
The mail being sent dropped by 9.5 billion items .
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT : Year opens with $ 237.2B record deficit " We expect the new fiscal year to be another difficult one , " Potter said , adding : " We 're not panicking here . "
By cutting back on spending the post office had a net operating income of $ 2.7 billion in 2008 , but still ended up in the red because of the requirement for a $ 5.6 billion payment to a health benefit fund for retirees .
Even so , the $ 2.8 billion loss was well short of last year 's $ 5.1 billion postal deficit .
The Postal Service does not receive a tax subsidy for its operations Potter welcomed recent reductions in the cost of fuel — a major expense for the post office — and said his agency is continuing to cut overtime and working hours as it seeks to increase efficiency .
He said the agency reduced working hours by 50 million in 2008 and hopes to double that to 100 million hours cut this year .
" We are working hard to do everything that we possibly can to avoid layoffs , " Potter added in an interview following the board meeting .
The post office has been offering early retirement , which has been accepted by 3,685 workers .
Asked about the possibility of cuts in service , Potter was emphatic in saying no : " When you 're in tough economic times , the last thing you want to do is back away from your customers . "
The cost of First Class postage went up to 42 cents in May and Potter said the annual increases for letters will continue to occur in May , with the new price being announced 90 days in advance .
The increase is based on the rate of inflation .
For packages , however , rates will increase in January so the post office will be in step with its major competitors , which generally announce new rates in January , he said .
Planned rate increases are Express Mail , 5.7 % ; Priority Mail , 3.9 % ; parcel select , 5.9 % ; parcel return service , 5.3 % and international shipping , 8.5 % .
Potter said the agency plans to ask Congress to restructure the way it handles payments for retiree health care .
A 2006 law requires the post office to create a fund to cover retiree health care , contributing several billion dollars annually for 10 years .
At the same time the agency is paying about $ 2 billion annually for retiree health care .
The postmaster general said the agency would like to start funding retiree health care from the new account , which it will continue to build up .
But it would like to eliminate the need to pay the extra $ 2 billion for current costs .
Standard mail , mostly advertising and the largest mail category at 99.1 billion items , was down 4.3 % in 2008 .
First class mail dropped 4.8 % to 91.7 billion cards and letters and periodicals fell 2.2 % to 8.6 billion .
Overall , the post office had revenue of $ 74.9 billion , operating expenses of $ 72.1 billion and a health benefit fund payment of $ 5.6 billion for a net loss of $ 2.8 billion .
The fiscal year began Oct. 1 . " This has been a very challenging year for the Postal Service , " chief financial officer H. Glen Walker told the agency 's governing board on Thursday .

Indonesia executes Bali bombers : report Agence France - Presse
Published : Saturday November 8 , 2008
Print This Email This CILACAP , Indonesia ( AFP ) 
Three Islamists sentenced to death for the Bali bombings which killed 202 people were executed by firing squad at midnight Saturday ( 1700 GMT ) , local television reported .
Amrozi , 47 , his brother Mukhlas , 48 , and ringleader Imam Samudra , 38 , were killed with shots to the heart on the island prison of Nusakambangan off southern Java , TV One television reported quoting an official source .
There was no official confirmation but the attorney general 's office in Jakarta has told journalists to expect an announcement .
The bombers were sentenced five years ago for the 2002 attacks on the resort island of Bali which killed more than 160 foreigners including 88 Australians , as well as 38 Indonesians .
They repeatedly said they wanted to die as " martyrs " for their Islamist cause but the executions were delayed by a series of failed appeals and most recently by the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in September .
Security forces are on high alert across the mainly Muslim archipelago amid fears of reprisal attacks .

VIEWPOINT
Oliver Tickell
Little meaningful progress seems to have been made at the UN climate summit in Poznan , Poland , says Oliver Tickell , author of Kyoto2 .
In this week 's Green Room , he calls on world leaders to back a deal that will raise the serious funds needed to deliver a low carbon future .
Developing nations need financial support in order to switch to renewables
Progress at the UN climate summit in Poznan , Poland , appears to have ground to a halt .
As the global gathering enters it second and final week , there has been a dismal lack of progress to date .
One of the key stumbling blocks is how all the things that we need to tackle the climate change problem will be financed .
Here are some of the key topics being debated : Forests and soils Forest destruction and degradation contributes up to 20 % of human greenhouse gas emissions .
Trees are worth more dead than alive
To have a hope of bringing climate change under control we need to bring these emissions to a halt , and make forests ( as well as soils , peatlands and other terrestrial sinks ) into major carbon sinks .
But how can we bring about the change we need ?
The answer has to be to make forests worth more alive than dead to governments and forest owners .
As things stand we are happy to pay for palm oil , beef , soya beans , rubber and timber from deforested land .
To persuade countries like Brazil and Indonesia to change their ways , we need to pay them more keep their forest than we are already paying them to destroy it .
Currently the main idea , which goes under the acronym of REDD , is to create carbon credits by reducing deforestation in poor countries , and selling the credits to rich countries so that they can let their industrial emissions rip .
But this suffers from the grave defect that we need to reduce emissions from both forests and industry at the same time , not trade one off against the other .
Adaptation to climate change
The cost to poor countries of the climate change that is already taking place , no matter what action we take to reduce emissions , is up to $ 100 billion per year .
This cost is incurred in the effort to cope with the consequences of drought , flood risk , rising sea levels , increasing insect - borne disease , and other hazards .
So far , a paltry few percent of this funding has been lined up .
Since the damages are a direct result of the historic emissions of rich countries , and the world 's poorest people are the principal victims , this is nothing short of iniquitous .
Meanwhile , more than $ 60 bn - a- year is sloshing around the world 's carbon markets , such as the European Union 's Emissions Trading Scheme and the " flexibility mechanisms " of the Kyoto Protocol .
It sometimes seems that everyone is making fortunes out of the carbon market , except those who really need it to adapt to the far harsher conditions that climate change is creating .
Renewable energy Renewable energy is a key part of any sustainable future .
But developing and rapidly industrialising countries are generally choosing coal - fired power generation , because it is relatively cheap , it works , and it 's available now .
Every fossil fuel power station built locks in decades of further emissions
This development path will lock these nations into burning coal for up to 75 years , undermining any effort made elsewhere to reduce emissions .
This makes it essential to divert the hundreds of billions of dollars each year that are being invested in fossil fuels in developing countries and put them into renewables .
But in order to make this happen , extra funds need to be found to bridge the gap between the cost of coal fired power stations and renewables .
In the long run , renewables make good economic sense because once they are built there is no need to buy the fuel to keep them running .
But in the short term there is an extra cost to be paid and at the moment , there 's no one to pick up the bill .
Energy efficiency
Vastly improved energy efficiency is absolutely necessary to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to satisfy rising demand for energy around the world .
Even though energy savings can be made for next to nothing , they tend not to take place .
This is usually because the costs are picked up by one person , while another enjoys the benefits .
So how are we to stimulate the revolution we need ?
One answer is to regulate .
EU citizens are already aware of the " energy rating " system that applies to many household appliances , and this approach has been highly effective .
It should now be extended globally to all energy consuming goods , homes , buildings , factories and offices .
Poor countries will of course need extra funding to have their short - term costs covered .
But in the long term , they will also benefit from reduced energy costs .
Powerful industrial greenhouse gases
The hydrofluorocarbons ( HFCs ) are gases used as refrigerants and foam blowing agents .
The use of HFCs , used in fridges and freezers , continues to grow They were introduced by the chemical industry to replace ozone destroying CFCs , which have ( almost ) been phased out by the Montreal Protocol .
However , HFCs are powerful greenhouse gases , and their production is rising by 15 % per year .
The Environmental Investigation Agency estimates that without controls , they could be responsible for the equivalent of about 10 gigatonnes of CO2 emissions per year by 2040 , or about one - third of the world 's current burn of fossil fuels .
The obvious way to control them is in the same way that the Montreal Protocol phased out the CFCs .
This would involve a direct regulatory approach , guided by an expert panel , with funding made available to help developing nations meet the cost of adapting affected industries .
Where is the money going to come from ?
Currently there is no mechanism capable of taking on the problems of climate change .
My own calculations indicate that it will cost the world about one trillion dollars each year .
That is certainly a lot of money , but it is an amount that looks affordable when it is compared to what the world is spending to deal with the global financial crisis .
One obvious way to raise the funds is to sell greenhouse gas emissions permits on a global basis , rather than giving them away as under the current Kyoto Protocol .
With industrial global emissions accounting for about 33 gigatonnes , a $ 30 - per - tonne carbon price would pay the whole bill .
The EU is already going this way .
More and more allowances under the ETS are being auctioned , and the European Parliament is calling for the proceeds to finance climate solutions .
President - elect Barack Obama has a similar national policy for the US , and a new report by humanitarian charity Oxfam calls for this model to be applied to rich country emissions allocations , with auctioning taking over from free allocations .
This general approach has to be the way forward , for the simple reason that there 's nowhere else for the money to come from .
Governmental aid flows remain pathetically insufficient even to deal with all the " old " problems of poverty , never mind the new problems of climate change .
Charities are nowhere near rich enough , and the private sector will only invest where there is profit to be made .
So here is one principle for delegates in Poznan to agree on - the carbon market must be turned into gold , not for carbon traders and financiers , but to finance the world 's transition to a low carbon , equitable future .
Oliver Tickell is author of Kyoto2 - how to manage the global greenhouse , published by Zed Books The Green Room is a series of opinion articles on environmental topics running weekly on the BBC News website Do you agree with Oliver Tickell ?
Do we have to make it more cost effective to protect the planet than it is to pollute it ?
Are carbon markets , like the EU Emissions Trading Scheme , failing to deliver the money where it is most needed ?
Or is there little hope of nations reaching a meaningful agreement on how to curb climate change ?
People like Steve Jones and William Walsh are prime examples of the fools that have let this problem get to the stage it is at .
Anyone who can deny the fact that mans impact on this planet is getting worse and will eventually lead to our demise is the equivelant of those fools who proclaimed the earth was flat and that the sun orbited us .
Mere fanatiscists that will not accept that change is needed and fast .
I fully agree with Oliver .
Paul Reynolds , UK
Why not simply place a direct carbon tax on every barrel of oil and ton of coal , ( Tax the source ) .
The more a country consumes , the more they pollute , the more money they are contributing .
Monies collected could then be allocated to fund climate mitigation programs in the developing world .
Such a fund could be administered via the World Bank and or the UNFCCC .
Geoff Hodges , Indonesia
Our world is doomed already if we have to pay people NOT to destroy it !
Philip Lethbridge , Wakefield I wish people would actually do some research before jumping on the bogus ' carbon footprint ' bandwaggon .
Climate change is a natural cycle mainly caused by solar activity .
By focussing on this red herring , we are ignoring much more important environmental issues , that will have a real effect on us in the long term .
Ben , Guildford Aha !
So according to the author the rich countries should pay poor countires to keep their forests and the rich countries in this way could emitt their emmisions .
In this way , the rich would develope and the poor would be a reservation of wild naives .
My response :
Let the real barbarians , like the Brits , Belgians and Spanish , nations who destroyed their forests , plant trees in their own countries .
Why you Brits destroyed your own forests ?
You are the real barbarians .
Ravi , Turku
More rubbish on how greenhouse gases are catastrophic for our fair planet .
From the whole report , the only item that really stands out for me ( other than the fact that defostiation and land use change is not good for our environment ) is the following two paragraphs ; " Meanwhile , more than $ 60 bn - a - year is sloshing around the world 's carbon markets , such as the European Union 's Emissions Trading Scheme and the " flexibility mechanisms " of the Kyoto Protocol .
It sometimes seems that everyone is making fortunes out of the carbon market ... "
And thats the problem .
There are too many people getting rich off the back of this GW / CC bogeyman .
It is no longer science when people will use all their resources to get rich from proclaiming religious verse on AGW " doom Dooom DOOOOM "
To much money is going to carbon businesses and the government for them to stop funding the pseudo scientists and climate modelers .
It does n't make " business sense "
To get the truth to the people , funding MUST go to real scientists to study changes in our climate and to projects that protect forests , fish stocks , green land etc etc .
Only then will we combat " Climate Change "
Paul Shanahan , Manchester
Ok so let me get this straight .
You make cattle more valuable alive than slaughtered , then no one will slaughter cattle for meat , this reduced supply will drive up the cost of meat , which will make it more vuluable slaughtered than alive .
So again you make it more valuable alive than slaughtered , which will reduce supply and drive up the cost of meat again , making cattle more valauble slaughterd than alive .
Only the wealthy will eat meat ?
Good luck selling this idea .
Also we are going to replace HFC 's with something new ?
Let me guess , Amonia right ?
Amonia was used as a refrigerant before it was replaced by CFC's which were replaced by HFC's which will be replaced by amonia agian .
Do you people actually get paid for this circular thinking ?
Ken , Halifax , canada
Yet another propaganda piece from blinkered environmentalists , and the BBC being the bastion of illuminati propaganda will toe the line and give this guy some space .
Read the FT editorial entitled " And now time for a world government " and you will see where this disinformation is headed .
People do your own research before you accept this rubbish !
Steve Jones , London
Yes , I agree with Oliver Tickell .
I 'm glad he mentioned energy efficiency ( too much energy is being wasted at present ) .
It is one advantage of energy prices increases people may use their energy utilities more wisely .

Micheal O' Conghaile , Campinas , Brazil .
" Progress at the UN climate summit in Poznan , Poland , appears to have ground to a halt " fantastic
oh yes , err yes Anyone who knows the frustration of getting " green " projects off the ground would agree with this report .
We stakeholders ( all of us on earth that is ) will never achieve the ghg reduction goals that are necessary to turn back the anthropogenic emissions clock under the current systems in place .
They were a start , but much more will be required of us .
A Social Carbon
Cost must come into play where a real value is established for gwp=1 .
I also propose that the concept of " additionality " be scrapped entirely and that the qualifying concept be one of " baseline and reduction or performance benefit " which uses the already established methodologies of baseline and offsets .
This way already established formulas and easily available technology can monitor the actual performance results of renewable systems installations or sample representative models of energy efficiency mitigation projects to quantify actual results .
Project applications and verification would be rapidly fast - tracked under such a method , all offsets could be digitally ID'd , secured , tracked , and cleared yearly worldwide .
This would do away with the backlog and expense of the current CDM structure which sets the standard for process .
The new system would be more reliant on an APX - type registry as is used by the VCS .
In essence , keep what is good and scrap what is not working fast enough .
stephen vance , conshohocken , pa , usa I think we do , I agree .
To governments economics and the economy make the world turn and its all about balancing the books .
Giving money to countries like brazil and Indonesia would aid the maintenance of rainforests but then there is the question of how job loss is to be compensated for .
These countries are poor enough already , industries that are creating revenue are n't likely to stop because deforestation is the means of creating the revenue .
Also if there is a demand for mahogany or rubber derivatives who says that persons are going to stop tapping into the market .
A cost effective approach for governments is an active step forward but for people who rely on an industry for income its not .
GDP per capita will decrease inevitably and international competitiveness will be at stake .
What government is going to sacrifice a rise in international competitiveness at present for te sake of preserving the environment for the future .
There are many factors which make this argument complicated and EU not necessarily effective .
Diana Pearce , Wetherby , West Yorkshire Good thinking - you hit the nail front and centre .
I just hope humanity has the will and ability to attain this goal .
Our past history leaves me a little cynical however --- good luck to us all !!!
robert p curtin , santos - brazil Man 's contribution to warming is about one tenth of a percent .
All the rest is part of the natural cycle .
To cure the mythical global warming Tickell et al would bring about global poverty on an apocalyptic scale .
It is a trumped up excuse to institute global government while certain interests become rich while contributing nothing but mischief .

If paying ransom for the natural habitat of future generations of this planet is the ONLY way of preventing more damaging changes to the climate , then I believe we need to offer all we can to those who refuse to cooperate in the conservation of our ecosystem on a environmental level and begin as soon as possible .
However , we will have conceded yet another element of conscience with regards to their stewardship of the planet as we accept the fact that greed really has overcome any compassion to be found in the motivation of the rulers of mankind .
The World 's leaders have bound themselves to the will of the industrial sector who themselves have too much at stake in the old order of energy production to risk the pole - shift in policy those who are serious about climate change propose and , hence , will not be able to form agreements that limit the commercial potential of this super - sector at Poznan or any other summit even if they have the slightest private belief in the proposed solutions openly available to climate change , such as those the energy [ r ] evolution is pleading for the enactment of .
Therefore , we might have to stoop to their level and wave the only carrot they follow at them in a last gasp attempt to stop them destroying the planet we know so well yet take such advantage of .
It 's far from first choice but perhaps it will become the temporary reprieve necessary to allow the advancement in attitudes towards the seriousness of this largely man-made problem to manifest as political decisiveness to act against it .
My real fear is that they will only see this necessity when it is already too late .

It is a pity that the UN Adaptation Fund or an equivalent climate change fund does not to my knowledge allow individual donations .
As i would happily transfer my existing monthly charitable donations if i knew it might help .
Predominantly individuals want to help , however it is finding a way to channel that desire to an effective solution that i think is blocking their good intentions .
anonymous , UK I agree wholeheartedly - and I believe that to really protect life on Earth , we need to go further and ban all use of Fossil Fuels from 2020 - that is for any use at all - ie transport , energy , plastics , agriculture and medicines .
That is what I am going to campaign for .
Melanie Cartwright , london YES YES YES ,
We have to take action now and carbon credits is the way forward , fingers crossed the powers that be will see it this way too .

Poking fun at evangelical Christians , Catholics , creationists , the image of Jesus Christ and , well , anything remotely associated with religion is ...
Although Barker reads
Digg regularly , he does n't submit links very often .
But he had a big hit with a picture he posted of a child 's coloring book showing Jesus riding a dinosaur .
" I found it , and thought , ' God , that 's such a hilarious image , ' " Barker said .
" Digg takes everything religious so lightheartedly . "
But you wo n't find many links to Bible studies on the front page of Digg -- unless it 's about the absurdity of taking Scripture literally .
A 2 - year - old survey of Digg users showed a significant concentration of atheists and agnostics .
Because Digg 's content is submitted and voted on by the users , the stories promoted to the website 's homepage reflect the audience .
The 27 - year - old from Mishawaka , Ind. , abandoned organized religion long ago and now describes himself as agnostic .
For him , time spent in the house of Digg is not unlike a Sunday church gathering .
Groups of like - minded individuals share gossip and stories , and they discuss such topics as politics , sports and , yes , even religion .
Andrew Barker embodies the average Digg user : a white male in his 20s , tech savvy , with a sense of humor that often pushes boundaries into the taboo .
You can find him browsing the social news website a couple times a day , but you wo n't see him at a church , synagogue or mosque .
... commonplace on the website .
An image , titled " The Incredible Jesuc Car : I'm Afraid Of Americans , " was voted to the Digg homepage a few days ago .
The photo shows a Toyota , with the license plate " Jesuc , " blanketed in bumper stickers promoting Christianity , the Republican presidential ticket and anti-gay marriage propositions .
Another image , a clipping from an Alaskan newspaper 's Letters to the Editor section that 's criticizing atheists , hit the Digg homepage the same day as " Jesuc Car . "
( A previous version of this post said the newspaper was from Arkansas . )
It 's already in the top 10 most popular stories of the week -- an impressive feat when considering the other nine stories revolve around the presidential election .
And Tuesday night , a popular item on Digg was news that Elizabeth Dole , whom Digg users criticized for calling her opponent " godless , " was defeated by Kay Hagan for the North Carolina Senate seat .
Users celebrated in the story 's comments section , and one user wrote , " Score one for the Godless Americans ! "
Digg is n't exactly religion - friendly , so it naturally does n't attract a very spiritual crowd .
" If you were into religion and you went to that site , and you thought that you were n't connecting with anyone , then you would n't spend a lot of time there , " said Diane Winston , professor of media and religion at the University of Southern California .
Zak Madden , a 16 - year - old atheist from Battle Ground , Wash. , submitted a picture to Digg last week of a Blu - Ray box for a film called " Jesus Christ : Vampire Hunter . "
It got more than 1,000 votes , called " diggs , " from users .
" Most Diggers are n't very religious and love comedy so it seemed natural that they would enjoy this , " Madden said in an e-mail .
Madden figures that more than half of the site 's users do n't actively practice religion , but says that number could be skewed by a vocal minority .
" There may be more religious diggers than I am guessing , but those who are religious usually are n't very open about it , " he wrote .
Madden says he found the " Vampire Hunter " graphic on a similar website called Reddit .
The audience is much the same , and content critical of religion regularly makes it to Reddit 's homepage as well .
YouTube also has its atheist niche .
A search for " atheist " yields 124,000 results , and several of those videos have been watched hundreds of thousands of times .
Granted , a search for " Christianity " returns 862,000 , but many of those contain content critical of the religion .
Micki Krimmel , a.k.a.
Mickipedia , a popular Twitter personality , says she attributes a part of her Internet fame to her YouTube videos about atheism .
" I made a series of videos that got really popular on YouTube and that generated recognition [ among ] a different group -- apparently there is a big atheist community on YouTube , " she said in an instant message conversation .
Social networks also exist for atheists , including Atheist Passions and Richard Dawkins.net .
Although atheist material and content critical of religion might have a large following on these mainstream websites , just as many websites exist on the Web for religious discussions , said Winston , the USC professor .
ShoutLife is one Christian social network with about 140,000 registered users .
Christian.com , Xianz , Your Christian Space and Holypal are a few popular alternatives .
There 's one for every major religion -- and atheism .
" Just as religious people want to convert people to their perspective , atheist people want to convert people to their point of view , " Winston said .
" The irony here is that atheism is a form of religion .
You 're still in something . "
The Internet is n't killing religion .
In fact , Winston says more Americans attend church today -- about 60 % -- than in the past .
" People have a mistaken notion of history that people used to be more religious , " she said .
The Web merely acts as the megaphone for any message , whether that be for or against religion , to help it reach the masses .
" The Internet has democratized media to a form almost unprecedented , " Winston said .
" So , of course you 're going to see things that you never saw before -- like Jesus riding on a dinosaur . "

On the stock markets , corporate share prices have fallen precipitously .
Unemployment is rising .
Housing construction has declined greatly , and home builders are going bankrupt .
Many homeowners are losing their homes to foreclosure or tax sale .
Many banks and other financial firms are in trouble , and some have already gone under .
Loans are harder to get than they used to be , especially for the least creditworthy borrowers .
At the Fed , the central bankers are baffled , sensing their powerlessness to prevent further economic contraction .
The president is discredited and eager to leave office , passing responsibility for dealing with all the economic problems along to his successor .
Congress has earned the public ’s hostility , and the legislators ’ popularity , like the president ’s , has sunk to an extraordinarily low level .
Desperately , blindly seeking something , anything , anyone to stop the downward spiral , the electorate has chosen a new president , giving him a wide margin of victory .
Awaiting his inauguration , the future chief executive promises to clean house and turn the country around , but the public does not have a clear vision of what is coming .
Yes , in the circumstances just sketched , the year 1932 was drawing to a close , much as the year 2008 is drawing to a close .
Should we expect next year ’s events to resemble those of 1933 ?
Devoutly may we hope they will not .
If they do , we are all in for a great deal of unnecessary trouble .
But when did that bleak prospect ever give pause to a new gang of looters and world - savers ?
People might act to preclude a repetition of the drawn - out wretchedness after 1932 if they understood what happened then and why , but , sad to say , their understanding of that episode is by and large a tissue of myths and mistaken ideas .
In our present fix , then , we may be excused if we conclude with Hegel that “ the only thing we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history . ”
Little comfort may be drawn from Mark Twain ’s observation that “ history does n’t repeat itself , but it does rhyme . ”
Given what I see on the horizon , I expect that our political and economic future will have more rhyme than reason , and that 2009 will have more similarities with 1933 than a well - informed friend of humanity would wish to see .
Beyonce Opens Up About Success and Jay - Z
" I was 18 when we first met , 19 when we first started dating .
There was no rush .
I really do n't believe that you will love the same thing when you 're 20 as you do at 30 .
Before the age of 25 , I would never get married , I feel like you have to get to know yourself , know what you want , spend time by yourself , and be proud of who you are before you can share that with someone else . "
Successful in every way , has always kept her relationship with music mogelprivate .
Now the singer has opened up in Seventeen magazine 's December / January issue and talks about love and success .
Beyonce 's latest album I Am ... Shasha Fierce will hit store shelves on November 17 .
After hearing her first song on the CD it sounds like Knowles has hit gold once again .
The singer cuts herself very little slack and obsesses over past video performances , always looking for ways to improve - forever on a quest to become a better singer .
" I do n't care if you 're picture perfect on every magazine cover , and you 're the most handsome , successful , coolest guy .
You still get sad , and you still get your feelings hurt , and you still get confused and vulnerable and nervous and scared .
You have to find a person you can make it through the tough times with . "
Knowles and Jay - Z were married on April 4th at the rappers Tribecca penthouse in Manhattan .
The wedding was kept very hush , hush and we have yet to see photos of the affair other than a few pics of the famous guests that showed up for the big event .
Check out Beyonce 's " If I Were a Boy " video here .
If you sell it now , you will have succeeded in applying the " buy high , sell low " strategy of investing .
The real question is , why did you buy it , and what did you hope to get out of buying it ?
If you bought it planning to hold it for a long time since , in the long term , stocks ( of stable companies ) go up , then you should probably stick to your plan of holding it .
Assuming , of course , you think that US stocks will recover in the long term ( good bet ) and that you think AutoZone is a stable company that will be around for the long term .
This also seems like a good bet since retail auto parts is not a market that sounds like it 's going away ( especially in a downturn , when people look for ways to save money ) , and AutoZone has a good grip on it .
If you bought it planning to turn around relatively quickly and sell it for a profit , then I have no advice to offer .
I do n't gamble very much and thus do n't have much insight on gambling .
Two final thoughts :
(1) If you were buying for the long term , it seems like you might have also diversified more ( although I do n't know that you did n't -- maybe you have LOTS of money ) .
(2) Sometimes it 's smart to get out while you still can , but do n't let emotions -- specifically , fear -- push you into pulling out of something .
AZO is n't the only stock that has fallen a whole lot .
The Federal Reserve and the Treasury announced $ 800 billion in new lending programs on Tuesday , sending a message that they will print as much money as needed to revive the crippled banking system .
The two new efforts  one mainly to finance loans for consumers , and an even bigger one to push down home mortgage rates  marked the latest but hardly the last of the federal government ’s efforts to shoulder the losses that began with subprime mortgages and have spread throughout the economy .
All told , the government has assumed at least $ 7 trillion in direct and indirect financial obligations in the form of Wall Street bailouts , emergency lending and government guarantees on bank deposits , inter - bank loans and home mortgages .

In December , the Mars Express spacecraft will celebrate the fifth anniversary of its arrival at Mars .
In observation of this milestone the German Aerospace Center DLR has put together a collection of some of the best images from the High - Resolution Stereo Camera ( HRSC ) , the main camera on board the spacecraft .
The stunning , high resolution images this instrument has produced of Mars ’ surface are nothing short of jaw dropping , and they have provided new perspectives and new discoveries about our neighboring planet .
One of the iconic images from Mars Express is the image above of water ice inside a crater near Mars North Pole .
And here ’s more from The Best of Mars Express :
My personal favorite is the image above of Echus Chasma , located in the Lunae Planum high plateau , north of Valles Marineris the ‘ Grand Canyon ’ of Mars .
It does n’t take much imagination to consider the possibility that once , gigantic water falls may have plunged over these 4,000 meter high cliffs on to the valley floor .
See more of Echus Chasma here .
Here ’a another of my favorites , this perspective color view of Coprates Chasma and the “ Grabenkette ” ( a chain of depressions or rifts in Mars ’ surface ) Coprates Catena in an eastern section of Valles Marineris .
The ability of the HRSC to provide “ perspective ” views — images that are not just straight down camera shots — are what sets the Mars Express mission apart from all the other orbiting spacecraft .
When seen in full resolution ( please , go download the biggie image here ) these 3 - D perspective views , are mind blowing !
In March of this year , Ian wrote about these high resolution and 3 - D images from Hebes Chasma , one of the deepest canyons on Mars , so see more images there , along with links to additional images and information .
The HRSC is imaging the entire planet in full color , 3 - D and with a resolution of about 10 meters .
Selected areas will be imaged at two - meter resolution .
One of the camera ’s greatest strengths is he unprecedented pointing accuracy achieved by combining images at the two different resolutions .
Another is its ability for 3 - D imaging which reveals the topography of Mars in full color .
Here ’s another look at Mars north arctic region , with water ice visible in Chasma Boreale .
Below is a view of Aureum Chaos , located in the eastern part of Valles Marineris .
This “ chaotic ” landscape is dominated by randomly oriented , large - scale mesas and knobs that are heavily eroded .
These mesas range from a few kilometres to tens of kilometers wide .
For a little more history on Mars Express , the spacecraft was launched on June 2 , 2003 from Baikonur Cosmodrome on a Soyuz - Fregat rocket .
The goal of Mars Express is to search for water and the possibility of Martian life .
Mars Express is a European Space Agency ( ESA ) mission to the Red Planet involving a consortium of countries ( primarily France , Germany , Great Britain , Ireland , Italy , Japan , the Netherlands , Norway , Russia , Sweden , Spain , and the United States ) .
The mission consisted of the orbiter and the Beagle lander , which unfortunately crash landed on Christmas Day 2003 .
Mars Express is currently in its second mission extension , which goes until May 2009 .
And finally , Mars Express not only takes images the surface of the Red Planet , but also of Mars ’ moon Phobos .
On July 23 of this year , the spacecraft flew only 93 kilometers from Mars ’ moon Phobos , and took the most detailed images ever of the small , irregular moon .

That ’s just a taste of all the wonderful images taken in the last five years by Mars Express .

Many in the gay and lesbian community hoped to celebrate the victory of Barack Obama , but instead of partying they have taken to the streets in fury after California voted to reverse gay marriage .
The vote in favour of Proposition 8 prompted a gay rights demonstrations in Los Angeles last night .
Activist and writer Bill Browning uses the word ' angry ' 17 times in a single blog post to describe his feelings .
" I 'm angry with Americans for transcending race , but not sexual orientation , " he writes .
The vote means that 18,000 same - sex couples who have married in California since June , including a number of celebrities , could have their marriages annulled .
Eatingoutloud.com blogger Allen switched his wedding ring to his middle finger and held it up as a photo jesture to the people of California .
He urges others to do the same .
I awoke this morning to learn that my relationship with my partner is no longer valid .
It 's no longer legal .
It 's somehow sub-par , not equivalent , not worthy of protection .
And you know what ?
I 'm pissed and tired of holding it in .
I welcome supporters of gay rights to snap your own photo showing your wedding ring on your middle finger .
Legal challenges have already been mounted , notably by Robin Tyler and Diane Olson , the first same - sex couple to get married since the gay marriage was allowed in the state .
" It 's never happened in American history where a group of people have been in a constitution and then taken out again , " Tyler told CTV .
But who to be angry with ?
Allen targets the Mormons .
And Bill is cross with African - American voters who backed Prop 8 by 69 % to 31 % .
But Dr Anonymous , " a queer person of color " explains why black people should not be blamed .
Meanwhile , Google has caught up in the row for allowing anti-gay marriage adverts to appear on websites against their owners ' wishes .
Google 's stance prompted a furious post by Peter Kirn , editor of one such site - Create Digital Music .
He wrote :
Google failed to deliver the solution it promises its publishers .
They violated their own policies , violated the principle of their service , violated the trust of their publishers , and then failed to respond to an issue that was deeply time - sensitive .
Michael Arrington on TechCrunch wrote : " We 'll look back on measures like Prop 8 as little different than attempts to stop women 's suffrage or the civil rights movement of the 50s and 60s . "
And then he realised that TechCrunch itself had carried ad links to protectmarriage.com .

By By Sherri Reese Nov 20 , 2008 in Politics Michigan Congressman Knollenberg appeared on Fox News with Neil Cavuto yesterday to discuss the possible bailout of the Big 3 American automakers .
" It is not your money , " said Knollenberg .
Knollenberg went on to blame a credit freeze as the reason for the Big 3's financial crisis .
Knollenberg claims that making credit more available would resolve this issue , but a $ 25 billion dollar bailout would keep the companies alive until the credit freeze ended .
In September , Congress passed a bill to loan $ 25 billion to the Big 3 with the checks scheduled to start flowing in 2009 .
The Big 3 has argued that this is not a " bailout , " but a good investment .
They also claim that they are in such dire straits that they will not make it to the end of 2008 .
According to During the interview with the Republican from Michigan , Cavuto gave a list of industries that could come to Congress making the case for them to receive government help .
" Where do you draw the line with our money ? " " It is not your money , " said Knollenberg .

Kevin Rose is the founder of Digg , and not a co-founder , a Digg PR rep recently informed us , when we mistakenly described Rose as a " co- founder " in a blog post .
It did n't strike us as weird or unusual until we heard from a guy who claims he is Digg 's co-founder , and he wants a little credit for it .
Owen Byrne , a Canadian developer ( and self - described Digg co-founder ) , wrote in to clarify that he's not some hard - up engineer in a developing nation – he's got an MBA and owns equity in Digg .
The issue came up when Rose , while speaking at a conference last week , advised aspiring entrepreneurs to outsource development to help cut costs .
Rose said he considered hiring a developer in India or a developer in Nova Scotia , and ultimately went with the guy in Canada , which saved him buckets of money .
" As the guy Kevin outsourced [ web development ] to , it 's great to see
Kevin bring it up over and over , but never bother to mention my name , " wrote Byrne , in response to a recent Epicenter story .
By some accounts , Byrne is widely acknowledged as a co-founder .
Thomas Hawk , a blogger and photographer , says Kevin Rose personally notified him that he'd made a mistake when he neglected to describe Owen Byrne as co-founder in a blog post he wrote a couple years ago .
But most media mentions – including the famous BusinessWeek cover story on Rose – refer to Rose as the founder of Digg .
A Digg spokesperson was n't available to comment .
Digg 's paternity case is n't all that unique in Silicon Valley , where budding entrepreneurs trample over each other to take credit for the newest , greatest thing .
Hubert Chang , an unknown computer scientist , recently claimed he was the third co-founder of Google , and that he helped design the search engine in 1997 with Sergey Brin and Larry Page .
" It was an intensive and interesting collaboration , " said Chang on a bizarre YouTube video .
Although Chang claims he was introduced to Brin and Page through a Stanford professor Rajeev Motwani , the professor said it was n't true .
" To the best of my knowledge , his claims about being a founder of Google , coming up with the name and / or the business plan etc , are completely unfounded in reality .
I am sure I would have noticed a third founder , if one existed , since I was working closely with Larry and Sergey at Stanford the time , " Motwani told InformationWeek .
And after YouTube was acquired by Google for $ 1.7 billion , a third YouTube co-founder popped up out of nowhere .
Jawed Karim , the third founder , said he did n't begrudge YouTube poster boys Chad Hurley and Steven Chen their fame and fortune , but he wanted a little credit .
" It took the three of us , " Karim told USA Today .
That may be true , but Karim does n't get a mention on the official company bio .

LOCAL CONTRAST ENHANCEMENT
Local contrast enhancement attempts to increase the appearance of large - scale light - dark transitions , similar to how sharpening with an " unsharp mask " increases the appearance of small - scale edges .
Good local contrast gives an image its " pop " and creates a three - dimensional effect — mimicking the look naturally created by high - end camera lenses .
Local contrast enhancement is also useful for minimizing the effect of haze , lens flare , or the dull look created by taking a photograph through a dirty window .
VISUALIZING LOCAL CONTRAST
When viewed at a distance , note how the large - scale features are much more pronounced for the image with high local contrast , despite the lack of resolution .
Both resolution and local contrast are essential to create a detailed , three - dimensional final image .
CONCEPT
The trick with local contrast enhancement is that it increases " local " contrast in smaller regions , while at the same time preventing an increase in " global " contrast — thereby protecting large - scale shadow / highlight detail .
It achieves this feat by making some pixels in the histogram cross over each other , which is not possible when enhancing contrast using levels or curves .
Local contrast enhancement works similarly to sharpening with an unsharp mask , however the mask is instead created using an image with a greater blur distance .
This creates a local contrast mask which maps larger - scale transitions than the small - scale edges which are mapped when sharpening an image .

and Create Mask

Note :
The " mask overlay " is when image information from the layer above the local contrast mask passes through and replaces the layer below in a way which is proportional to the brightness in that region of the mask .
The upper image does not contribute to the final for regions where the mask is black , while it completely replaces the layer below in regions where the local contrast mask is white .
The difference between the original and final image is often subtle , but should show a noticeable increase in clarity .
In order to fully see this effect , one needs to examine the images up close .
Move your mouse on and off of " local contrast enhancement " and then " high contrast " in order to see their influence on the tones within the image below :
Original Local Contrast Enhancement High Contrast
Note how it creates more contrast near the transition between the rocks and dirt , but preserves texture in large - scale light and dark regions .
Pay special attention to the dirt in between the rocks and how this region becomes very dark for the high contrast image , but is preserved for local contrast enhancement .
The effect above is quite strong to aid in visualization ; local contrast enhancement is often less pronounced .
IN PRACTICE
Fortunately , performing local contrast enhancement in Photoshop and other image editing programs is quick and easy .
It is identical to sharpening with an unsharp mask , except the " radius " is much larger and the " percentage " is much lower .
The unsharp mask can be accessed in Adobe Photoshop by clicking on the following drop - down menus : Filter > Sharpen > Unsharp Mask .
Amount is usually listed as a percentage , and controls the magnitude of each overshoot .
This can also be thought of as how much contrast is added at the transitions .
Amount is typically 5 - 20 % .
Radius controls the amount to blur the original for creating the mask , shown by " blurred copy " in the illustration above .
This affects the size of the transitions you wish to enhance , so a smaller radius enhances smaller - scale detail .
Radius is typically 30 - 100 pixels .
Threshold sets the minimum brightness change that will be sharpened .
This is rarely used in local contrast enhancement , but could be set to a non -zero value to only enhance contrast at the most prominent edges .
Threshold is typically set to 0 .
Much more so than with sharpening , the radius setting is strongly influenced by your image size and the scale of the light - dark transitions you wish to enhance .
High resolution images , or those where light - dark transitions are large , require using a larger radius value .
Very low resolution images may require a radius even less than 30 pixels to achieve the effect .
COMPLICATIONS
Local contrast enhancement , as with sharpening , can also create unwanted color changes if performed on all three color channels .
In addition , Local contrast enhancement can increase color saturation significantly .
You can eliminate these unwanted effects by either performing local contrast enhancement in the lightness channel of the LAB color space , or in a separate layer ( while still in an RGB working space ) and blending using " luminosity " in the layers window .
Local contrast enhancement can also clip highlights in regions which are both very bright and adjacent to a darker region .
For this reason , it should be performed before adjusting levels ( if levels are used bring tones to the extreme highlights within the image histogram ) .
This allows for a " buffer zone " when local contrast enhancement extends the lightest and darkest tones to full white or black , respectively .
Care should also be taken when using this technique because it can detract from the " smoothness " of tones within your image — thereby changing its mood .
Portrait photography is one area where one should be particularly cautious with this technique .

The Republican Party REFUSED to truly listen to Ron Paul Republicans .
At every turn they tried to block Ron Paul 's access , During debates they made jabs at him to make him seem incompetent .
SADLY , the Republican Party did not listen .
In fact , even after the election in a special Republican Party GOP meeting , to essentially move forward after a horrible loss , - Ron Paul was not invited !
Ron Paul was correct and this is a HUGE " told you so moment " !
Again will Republicans learn from their mistakes ?
Many die - hard Republicans are having a difficult time seeing the difference between Republicans and Democrats right now .
Listen now Republicans before the economy collapses in 2009 - 10 and rolls into a Great Depression .
Laugh now , make jokes , deny again - Ron Paul Republicans pray that there will never be another " we told you so moment " .
This video is INCREDIBLE .
It starts out slow and then WOW !
Michelle Malkin , Sean Hannity , and many news reporters really look like fools when you compare the time - line ( Before and After ) in this video .
Many believe Ron Paul Republicans were just a craze phase and will disappear .
GOP if you still think this you will once again lose election after election .
While the GOP is still talking Reagan they should have been listening to Ron Paul .

Mr Winters died in 1984 .
' Overwhelmed '
In the summer of 1948 , Charles Winters worked with the two men to transfer to Israel two B - 17s that he had converted for use in his Florida fruit business .
Winters flew one of the two aircraft himself to Czechoslovakia , where they and a third B - 17 were retrofitted to be bombers before being flown to Israel .
There are probably many unsung heroes of America and of Israel , but Charlie Winters is surely one of them
Steven Spielberg
The three aircraft were the only heavy bombers in the Israeli Air Force , and historians say they helped turn the 1948 war against Arab armies in Israel 's favour .
Mr Winters , a Protestant , was hailed a hero in Israel , but in the US he was later convicted of conspiracy to export and the exportation of a military aircraft to a foreign country .
The posthumous pardon for Mr Winters - only the second ever granted by a US president - came after a lengthy campaign by his son , Jimmy .
" I 'm overwhelmed , " he told the Associated Press .
Golda Meir commended Mr Winters for his contribution to Israel 's survival " It happened 16 years before I was born .
He went to jail and he did n't want his kids to know .
He was old - school and proud . "
Jimmy Winters said he first learnt of his father 's famous past after seeing an outpouring of gratitude from the Jewish community after his death in 1984 .
His mother , Joan , was flown to Israel , where she buried half his ashes at a Christian cemetery near the Jewish cemetery of the Knights Templar in Jerusalem .
The other half were scattered from the top of Mount Tabor .
The Hollywood film director , Steven Spielberg , was one of the many people who wrote a letter to President Bush in support of a pardon .
" There are probably many unsung heroes of America and of Israel , but Charlie Winters is surely one of them , " he said .
Mr Winters was among 19 people granted pardons by President Bush ahead of the Christmas holidays .
A 20th person had his prison sentence commuted .

Eventually , the government 's hand was forced by the New Zealand government , which had been informed by the dairy giant Fonterra , a joint - owner of Sanlu , and a growing number of reports in China 's own media which did not say which company was responsible .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
On a misty mountaintop on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi , scientists for the first time in more than eight decades have observed a living pygmy tarsier , one of the planet ’s smallest and rarest primates .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Over a two - month period , the scientists used nets to trap three furry , mouse - sized pygmy tarsiers -- two males and one female -- on Mt. Rore Katimbo in Lore Lindu National Park in central Sulawesi , the researchers said on Tuesday .
They spotted a fourth one that got away .
The tarsiers , which some scientists believed were extinct , may not have been overly thrilled to be found .
One of them chomped Sharon Gursky - Doyen , a Texas A&M University professor of anthropology who took part in the expedition .
“ I ’m the only person in the world to ever be bitten by a pygmy tarsier , ” Gursky - Doyen said in a telephone interview .
“ My assistant was trying to hold him still while I was attaching a radio collar around its neck .
It ’s very hard to hold them because they can turn their heads around 180 degrees .
As I ’m trying to close the radio collar , he turned his head and nipped my finger .
And I yanked it and I was bleeding . ”
The collars were being attached so the tarsiers ’ movements could be tracked .
Tarsiers are unusual primates -- the mammalian group that includes lemurs , monkeys , apes and people .
The handful of tarsier species live on various Asian islands .
As their name indicates , pygmy tarsiers are small -- weighing about 2 ounces ( 50 grammes ) .
They have large eyes and large ears , and they have been described as looking a bit like one of the creatures in the 1984 Hollywood movie “ Gremlins . ”
They are nocturnal insectivores and are unusual among primates in that they have claws rather than finger nails .
They had not been seen alive by scientists since 1921 .
In 2000 , Indonesian scientists who were trapping rats in the Sulawesi highlands accidentally trapped and killed a pygmy tarsier .
“ Until that time , everyone really did n’t believe that they existed because people had been going out looking for them for decades and nobody had seen them or heard them , ” Gursky - Doyen said .
Her group observed the first live pygmy tarsier in August at an elevation of about 6,900 feet .
“ Everything was covered in moss and the clouds are right at the top of that mountain .
It ’s always very , very foggy , very , very dense .
It ’s cold up there .
When you ’re one degree from the equator , you expect to be hot .
You do n’t expect to be shivering most of the time .
That ’s what we were doing , ” she said .

Phineas Gage had a three foot iron rod pierce his skull during an explosion on a railroad job .
The iron rod went clear through his skull and landed around twenty - five yards away .
Phineas survived .
Before the accident he was one of the most even minded and capable workers .
After he healed he could not get his job back because he had become impatient , moody , and even profane .
A computer generated graphic of what happened to his skull is pictured to the right .
In regards to his amazing patient , Dr. Harlow wrote :
Gage was fitful , irreverent , indulging at times in the grossest profanity ( which was not previously his custom ) , manifesting but little deference for his fellows , impatient of restraint or advice when it conflicts with his desires , at times pertinaciously obstinate , yet capricious and vacillating , devising many plans of future operations , which are no sooner arranged than they are abandoned in turn for others appearing more feasible .
A child in his intellectual capacity and manifestations , he has the animal passions of a strong man .
Previous to his injury , although untrained in the schools , he possessed a well - balanced mind , and was looked upon by those who knew him as a shrewd , smart businessman , very energetic and persistent in executing all his plans of operation .
In this regard his mind was radically changed , so decidedly that his friends and acquaintances said he was ‘ no longer Gage ’ .
Nach heftigen Protesten wegen der Sperrung der Webseite wikipedia .de tritt der Bundestagsabgeordnete Lutz Heilmann den Rückzug an : Am heutigen Sonntag erklärte der Politiker , er werde keine rechtlichen Schritte mehr gegen Wikipedia unternehmen .
Ganz ausgestanden ist der Rechtsstreit damit allerdings noch nicht .
Heilmann hatte eine Einstweilige Verfügung gegen den Verein Wikimedia Deutschland erwirkt , weil in einem Artikel über ihn falsche Tatsachenbehauptungen verbreitet wurden .
" Nachdem die falschen , ehrabschneidenden und deshalb mein Persönlichkeitsrecht verletzenden Inhalte weitgehend aus dem entsprechenden Artikel entfernt wurden , habe ich gegenüber dem Wikimedia e.V. erklärt , dass ich keine weiteren juristischen Schritte unternehmen werde und die Weiterleitung auf die Wikipedia - Inhalte unter de.wikipedia.org wieder geschaltet werden kann . " , erklärt der Abgeordnete .
" Der juristische
Weg hat sich dafür insoweit als problematisch erwiesen , als durch die Struktur von Wikipedia die anderen Userinnen und User in Mitleidenschaft gezogen werden .
Das war nicht meine Absicht . "
Gegen einzelne Personen will der Abgeordnete aber weiter vorgehen .
Nachdem wikipedia.de gesperrt wurde , hatten Wikipedia - Autoren den Artikel über Lutz Heilmann weiter überarbeitet .
Sie kamen zu dem Schluss , dass viele Abschnitte , die der gelernte Jurist bemängelt hatte , tatsächlich nicht in den Artikel gehörten , darunter Spekulationen über die Verstrickung in einen Online - Sexversand und die innerparteilichen Auseinandersetzungen rund um Heilmann .
Gegen die Nennung seiner Tätigkeit für das frühere Ministerium für Staatssicherheit der DDR war Heilmann nicht vorgegangen .
Bis wikipedia .de wieder den normalen Betrieb aufnehmen kann , wird es allerdings noch dauern .
Wikimedia - Anwalt Thorsten Feldmann erklärte gegenüber heise online : " Diese Erklärung ist uns nicht direkt zugegangen .
Das gerichtliche Verbot zur Schließung von wikipedia.de wird nicht dadurch außer Kraft gesetzt wird , dass der Antragsteller etwas gegenüber der Presse erklärt . "
Wenn der Abgeordnete Heilmann es ernst meine , müsse er auch die prozessualen Konsequenzen ziehen .
Mit dem Verlauf der Auseinandersetzung zeigt sich Feldmann unzufrieden .
Er beklagt , dass das Gericht entschieden habe , ohne die Argumente von Wikimedia in Betracht zu ziehen .
" Sollte es soweit kommen , dass Herr Heilmann auch seinen Antrag bei Gericht zurücknimmt , befürchte ich , dass sich in der Öffentlichkeit der falsche Eindruck festsetzt , dass jedermann durch eine Einstweilige Verfügung und ohne Anhörung des Vereins wikipedia .de lahmlegen kann . "
Heilmann erklärte gegenüber heise online er werde sobald wie möglich die juristischen Schritte einleiten , um die Einstweilige Verfügung aufheben zu lassen .
Gegen die Falschbehauptungen will er aber weiter rechtlich vorgehen .
" Ich habe Strafantrag und Strafanzeige gegen drei Personen gestellt , darunter gegen einen Wikipedia - Autoren . "
Die beiden anderen Strafanzeigen richteten sich gegen Personen , die auf einem anderen Online - Portal Falschbehauptungen über ihn aufgestellt hätten .
Hendrik Thalheim , Pressesprecher der Linksfraktion im Bundestag , stellt sich hinter den Abgeordneten : " Wenn Menschen über andere wahrheitswidrig ehrabschneidende Behauptungen verbreiten , kann sich der Betroffene unabhängig von der Verbreitungsart des Wahrheitswidrigen auch rechtsstaatlich wehren .
Das hat mit Wikipedia dann gar nichts mehr zu tun . "
Nachdem die Einstweilige Verfügung bekannt wurde , konnte sich Wikimedia Deutschland im Übrigen vor Solidaritätsbekundungen kaum retten .
Dies machte sich auch finanziell bemerkbar : Allein am Samstag nahm der Verein Spenden in Höhe von 16.239,68 Euro ein , viele Spender hinterließen Botschaften , die sich gegen Lutz Heilmann richteten .

The anti-union movement is on , and it all is centered around the automotive industry 's quest for a rescue package / loan from the government .
Limbaugh leads the charge in his Monday , Nov. 17 broadcast .
As the clip unfolds it appears that his own boss was trying to get him to change the topic .
A caller who self - identifies as a Republican tries to shoot down some of the myths of the UAW that Limbaugh pushes on his flock on a daily basis .
When asked about working past 67 , he spins it by saying you should n't retire at 55 .
It 's a long clip , but this is what 's being said .
His boss even freaks out on him at the end :
Limbaugh :
You 're a nice guy and I 'm sure that you are a salt of the earth guy but since you asked , What I am supposed to do , go back to work at 67 ?
No , you 're not supposed to retire when you 're 55 .
You sound to me like you are totally capable of still working .
Unless you work for a place that forces you out and says 55 you can no longer do the job , you got no business retiring at 55 IF you can't afford to retire .
What 's wrong .... My boss is having a conniption there .
What 's wrong ?
Is that the unpolitick thing to say ?
I have not ... the American Dream .
I have not redefined the American Dream .
The American Dream is retire at 65 .
People are retiring now at 50 and 55 and so forth when they are still capable of working .
According to the tables at 55 , you 've got 22 years left ... I have not redefined the American Dream .
I have not redefined it .
... I do n't understand what I said that 's wrong here .
What planet is this man living in ?
He keeps digging deeper and deeper .
Does he even know what the American Dream is ?
h/t to C&Ler Dan for sending in the audio and says :
Rush basically tells auto workers that if their pension plans go bankrupt , they should go back to work .
Limbaugh obviously has no idea what concessions the UAW has already made .
" GM , Union Agree on Contract to End Strike "
And this :
For General Motors ( GM ) , a new labor contract represents a step forward .
For the United Auto Workers , a big step back .
The two sides came to a tentative agreement on a new , four - year labor pact at 3:05 a.m. EDT Sept. 26 , ending a two - day strike .
If UAW President Ronald Gettelfinger can get the deal ratified by his 74,000 GM workers in the coming days , the contract will pull the automaker much closer to Toyota 's ( TM ) cost structure .
But for the UAW , it will roll back contract benefits and wages won over years of collective bargaining .
Many in the progressive movement did not like these concessions , but they happened .
We can debate that later , but to gasbags like Limbaugh , if you work for a company for 30 years , you should n't get a pension and should work till you die .
Does he hate policemen and firemen as well ?
Should they not be able to retire with a pension after trying to keeping us safe for thirty years on the job ?

Oh , wow .
Apparently , in May , a Brit and a Frenchman snuck on to the under - construction Burj Dubai and BASE jumped from it at 650 meters up .
Now , there 's video available of their infiltration , jump and subsequent escape .
The footage from up top and the jump is just incredible stuff .
I wish I had the cajones to do something like this .
Although my favorite part of the video may be the footnote at the end ; wait for it , it 's worth it .

Part three in the on - going saga of posting a paper no one wants to read .
PART THREE : THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM – THE MAGICAL MONEY MAKING MACHINE
“ The world is governed by very different personages from what is imagined by
those who are not behind the scenes . ” – Benjamin Disraeli , English Statesman 1844 .
In the preceding pages , a quick sojourn through time has shown the many seemingly innocuous and worthless items that have been used as money .
We have also taken a brief jaunt alongside the continued attempts to build a centralized banking regime in America and the subsequent fall of each .
In this section , that basic framework becomes the context with which the merits of the Federal Reserve System are called into question .
The question was posed in the opening paragraphs of whether or not there should be an all - mighty arbiter that controls the creation and flow of money .
That is precisely what the Federal Reserve is .
Llewellyn Rockwell , Dean of the Ludwig von Mises Institute , has a less flattering view : “ It ’s no different from a burglar in your home wanting to steal your money – that ’s what the Federal Reserve does .
It depreciates your savings , it takes away your economic security and it ought to be treated as an institution that does that rather than something of alleged benefit . ”
What is the alleged benefit of the Federal Reserve system ?
In October of 1929 , speculators who borrowed heavily on margin to buy stocks saw the market lose one third of its value .
Bank loans totaling more than $ 7 billion were left outstanding .
Stocks bought on margin use that purchased stock as consideration ( collateral ) for the loan .
The dip in stock values prompted the lending banks to call in those margin loans .
As speculators defaulted on loans , bank failures spiraled out of control and the Great Depression began .
The primary alleged benefit of the Federal Reserve system is that it safeguards against a depression by being a lender of last resort .
In case any bank got into trouble , they did n’t have to worry – they could get the money from Washington .
The legitimacy of such an argument is thinly veiled as the artificial fluctuation of interest rates by the Fed result in an initial inflation of the money supply and thus abundant credit , the boom , and the eventual contraction of that credit that creates the bust of the so - called business cycle .
Hans Hoppe , Economics Professor at the University of Nevada Las Vegas , questions whether or not it is even desirable to have such a thing as a lender of last resort .
“ The correct position appears to me , ” he says , “ that every single bank should be responsible for the its own debts and contractual obligations .
And if banks , through imprudent policy , then go bankrupt , this should be considered a magnificent thing because the danger of bankruptcies is precisely what makes banks adhere to sound policies ” ( MBFR ) .
Let us examine how the Federal Reserve system operates .
The previous sections explained the concept of fractional reserve banking .
Initially , all Federal Reserve notes were backed by 40 % gold .
That is to say for every Federal Reserve Dollar in circulation , forty cents of that were represented in their reserves by actual gold .
The other sixty cents were pure faith .
The Federal Reserve is not a government institution , but rather a privately owned enterprise that prints money and loans it to its customer , the U.S. Government , at interest .
Seven presidentially appointed board members oversee the Fed and its twelve regional reserve banks located in San Francisco , Kansas City , Atlanta , Boston , Minneapolis , Chicago , Philadelphia , Richmond , Dallas , St. Louis , Cleveland , and New York .
The creation and distribution of “ money ” follows this course : The U.S. Government sells securities in the form of bonds to the Federal Reserve which then makes a loan for a specified sum – let us say $ 10 billion for this illustration .
Now that money comes bearing interest which must be repaid , but it does not go to the government to disperse as it sees fit .
The $ 10 billion is given to a Federal Reserve member bank and used as the basis for loans to various subsidiary banks that in turn use the money as loans to its customers .
As current regulations stand , the requirement for this banking system is 10 % of total liabilities as the “ required reserve ” ; anything beyond is categorized as “ excessive reserve ” and used as the basis for new loans .
Thus , the initial $ 10 billion can be used to create another $ 9 billion in non-existent money .
One would think that would mean that any loans would come directly out of that $ 10 billion , but that is not the case .
The newly created $ 9 billion is added to the initial principle , inflating that $ 10 billion to $ 19 billion .
( Zeitgeist : Addendum )
The process continues in every bank that money encounters .
Consider the chart below for clarification .
DEPOSIT MONEY CREATION / LOAN CYCLE
$ 10,000,000,000 1 $ 10,000,000,000
$ 9,000,000,000 2 $ 19,000,000,000.0
$ 8,100,000,000 3 $ 27,100,000,000.0
$ 7,290,000,000 4 $ 34,390,000,000
$ 6,561,000,000 5 $ 40,951,000,000
$ 5,904,900,000 6 $ 46,856,000,000
$ 5,314,410,000 7 $ 52,170,000,000
$ 4,782,969,000 8 $ 56,953,000,000
$ 4,304,672,100 9 $ 61,258,000,000
$ 3,874,204,890 10 $ 64,744,784,320
The table illustrates how money creation works within a fractional reserve framework .
Each subsequent loan only requires a 10 % reserve , and the resultant new money is piled on top of every other loan .
By the tenth revolution of the loan cycle , a potential for creating nearly $ 65 billion exists with only about $ 4 billion in reserve to satisfy a demand for withdrawal .
Couple that with the fact only 40 % of that original $ 10 billion was backed by gold , it then becomes glaringly apparent that $ 65 billion in claims exist against $ 1.5 billion in equity .
“ Interestingly , ” says Murray Rothbard , ” while Fed liabilities are no longer redeemable in gold , the Fed safeguards its gold by depositing it in the treasury , which issues gold certificates redeemable in nothing but 100 % gold bouillon from treasury stocks deep within Fort Knox ” ( The Case Against the Fed , p.141 )
In testimony before the House Committee on Banking and Currency on April 27 , 1936 , chairman of the New Economic Group Allen B. Brown made the following critique of the Federal Reserve .
“ The banks manufacture , without borrowing it , the monetary credit which they loan to the Government .
For every dollar they themselves contribute to the loaning process , they manufacture 10 credit dollars , and call them their own , although they base the credit dollars on human sweat and labor and productive genius that is not
their own ” ( Martin ) .
It is imperative to note that this type of lending practice is what created the housing bubble and the financial crisis that plagued Wall Street in the tail end of 2008 .
The “ easy money ” practices of the Federal Reserve system and the irresponsible lending by government backed brokers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are a classic example of what happens when a bank or lender holds a forty - to - one debt to asset ratio and when reserves are over - extended in risky , high interest loans .
The banks pursue a debt - based investment strategy ; their investments are no longer financed by equity but out of debt ; the money created as a loan and dealt out to the customer as a liability is treated instead as an asset and used as the basis for creating even more money .
Does this seem like a rational expansion of the money supply ?
Or is it a pyramid scheme ?
What are the implications of acknowledging that the banking system loans money that is actually does not have ?
Take , for example , the very interesting 1969 case of First National Bank of Montgomery vs. Jerome Daly .
Mr. Daly was the holder of property with a mortgage claimed on it by the bank in question .
Mr. Daly had fallen behind in payments and the bank foreclosed on his house and sold it from under him at auction .
Mr. Daly argued that the contract with the bank required both parties to each put up a legitimate form of property .
This is called consideration in legal terms .
Mr. Daly ’s consideration would be either a down payment as a portion of the loan or the property itself .
The lawful consideration on the part of the bank would be the money they loaned to Mr. Daly , but as demonstrated in the preceding pages , that money was not real property of the bank , nor did it exist in real equity ,
The judge ’s memorandum states that , “ the money and credit first came into existence when they created it .
Mr. Morgan ( president of First National Bank of Montgomery ) admitted that no United States Law or Statute existed which gave him the right to do this .
A lawful consideration must exist and be tendered to support the note .
The Jury found that there was no consideration and I agree .
Only God can create something of value out of nothing . ”
The foreclosure was not only denied by that ruling , but the entire claim to the land or any lien on it declared null and void .
( http://www.constitutionalconcepts.org/creditriver.htm)
Two years later , then president Richard M. Nixon eradicated the convertibility of the U.S. dollar into gold .
In an address to the nation Nixon stated that he “ directed secretary Connelly to suspend temporarily ( time would show this to be permanent ) the convertibility of the dollar into gold or other Reserve assets except in amounts and conditions determined to be in the interest of monetary stability and the best interest of the United States . ”
Bollocks !
Aware of the legislative battles ahead , Senate Democrats said they wanted to adhere to Mr. Obama ’s call for reconciliation and leniency for Mr. Lieberman .
But a pragmatic dynamic was at work as well .
Having added seven new senators to their side , Democrats want to avoid driving Mr. Lieberman into the Republican fold .
Even though they remain short of the 60 needed to cut off filibusters , the Democrats are aiming to keep their majority as large as possible next year when , for the first time since 1994 , they have control of Congress and the White House .
Two other Senate seats , in Minnesota and Georgia , have yet to be decided .
“ We have got some big issues here , and we need all hands on deck , ” said Senator Christopher J. Dodd , Democrat of Connecticut , who had pushed to keep the retribution against his home - state colleague to a minimum .
Democrats voted 42 to 13 to let Mr. Lieberman stay at the helm of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs while removing him from the Environment and Public Works Committee , where he led a subcommittee .
The formal resolution before the Democrats , considered in what was described as an emotional meeting in the Old Senate Chamber of the Capitol , also declared that the Democratic caucus “ rejects and disapproves of Senator Lieberman ’s statements against Senator Obama in the 2008 presidential campaign . ”
Image Senator Joseph I. Lieberman , who supported Senator John McCain in the presidential race , was allowed to keep his committee chairmanship as Democrats sought to strengthen their majority .

Lawmakers who attended the session said that Mr. Lieberman openly discussed the political and personal hurt he had experienced when many of his colleagues campaigned against him after he lost a Democratic Senate primary in 2006 before winning re-election as an independent .
After the vote , he expressed some remorse for his campaign comments but noted that the resolution did not chastise him directly for backing Mr. McCain , who returned to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to resume life as a senator .
Mr. Lieberman , who only eight years ago was the party ’s nominee for vice president , said he could have made some statements “ more clearly . ”
He added : “ And there are some that I made that I wish I had not made at all .
And obviously in the heat of campaigns , that happens to all of us .
But I regret that .
And now it ’s time to move on . ”
An ad from UPS for bike delivery personnel .
Shipping giant United Parcel Service ( UPS ) will add a new weapon to its arsenal in the holiday shipping battle this year — bicycles .
Jeff Grant , the company ’s workforce planning manager for the Oregon district ( that includes Vancouver , WA ) , says UPS plans to hire 28 bike delivery employees this season .
In the Portland metro area , Grant says eight riders will be hired .
I spoke with Grant via phone yesterday .
He said the main impetus for the bike delivery program was to save money .
“ For every three bikes we use for deliveries , we save an average of 17 gallons of fuel per day ( compared to one truck ) .
That ’s about $ 50 in savings . ”
Across the entire district , Grant says for every three bikes used during the holiday season , UPS will save $ 38,000 in vehicle operation and upkeep costs .

UPS has purchased a fleet of mountain bikes outfitted with a 200 pound capacity trailer ( with a cover for rain of course ) and a set of lights .
All bike delivery staff will be uniformed and helmets are required .
Before hitting the road , Grant says each rider will undergo a paid orientation and training session .
The custom - tailored training will focus on operating the bicycle and trailer safely .
“ We realize the riders will be experienced already , ” says Grant , “ but have they ever pulled 200 pounds ?
Do they know the safe following distance in wet weather ? ”
According to Grant , he ’ll ask delivery staff to deliver about 25 - 50 packages per day , compared to 150 stops a day for a normal “ package car ” .
Grant added an interesting historical note to this story : UPS started delivering by bike in Seattle ( where they were founded ) over 100 years ago .
Today , the company once again uses bikes for deliveries up in Seattle and Grant said it went so well they ’ve decided to expand the program .
UPS is looking to hire bike delivery people in Vancouver ( WA ) , Portland , Salem , Corvallis , Eugene , and Medford .

QuakeCon has long been a staple on the esports competitive calendar , providing the community with the last major event to be centered around the cult title .
While several large events do still offer Quake competition , QuakeCon is the only major event to put the game front and center .
The professional tournament will utilize Quake Live , formerly Quake Zero , the latest incarnation of id Software 's Quake series .
The browser - based , free - to - play title has been in closed beta for quite some time , chances are what we 'll see at QuakeCon 2009 will be polished to a mirror shine .
QuakeCon 2009 is a rather important notch in tournament history , as Quake Live is liable to be released publicly somewhere in the same time frame .
QuakeCon has always been used as a platform to promote id Software titles , it 's quite probable that QuakeCon will be one of the main promotional events for Quake Live 's release .
Id Software will try to rebound from last year 's QuakeCon where the 1v1 finals between John " ZeRo4 " Hill and eventual champion Alexei " Cypher " Yanushevsky started hours late .
id Software originally wanted to shorten the number of maps or reduce the timelimit , but the players refused .
The event itself has space for almost 3,000 BYOC competitors as well as tournaments , exhibits , conferences and of course the principal focus not to be lost in all of this , it 's free .
From the BYOC to the conferences , not a pennies charge will come your way .
Online registration for the event begins at 3:30 CET on March 7th , 2009 .
The QuakeCon event itself will take place between August 13th and 16th 2009 , in Dallas , Texas at the Hilton Anatole Hotel .
DETROIT , Oct. 19 ( UPI ) --
The Detroit Free press endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama on Sunday , calling the Illinois senator the stronger candidate .
The newspaper said the choice Americans face in the Nov. 4 presidential election is one between Obama , " who has shown a knack for developing well - reasoned solutions to the nation 's many critical problems , " and John McCain , " a genuine American war hero with a creditable streak of political independence who has shown himself to be erratic , impulsive and bullheaded as a political leader . "

In its endorsement , the Free Press said the nation needs change , and Obama is " not only proposing better ones but is also better suited to the job of getting them done . "
Despite his short time in public office , Obama has outlined a " progressive , pragmatic vision for this country , keyed to opportunities for the middle class , and demonstrated time and again that his approach to things is grounded in deliberation and reflection , " the editorial said .
The Free Press noted that it endorsed McCain for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000 and this year .
" The McCain running against Obama in this general election has not been the same candidate ; he has been nastier , less consistent and , since his acceptance speech at the GOP National Convention , frankly uninspiring , " the newspaper said .

THE English Civil War has always fascinated me .
But romantic images of Cavaliers and Roundheads obscure the reality of a horrible , dirty war that set father against son and neighbour against neighbour .
Some unspeakable horrors were committed in the march to establish the supremacy of parliament and puritan religious ideals .
The English civil wars in the mid 17th century and the Commonwealth period following it can often prove an insurmountable obstacle to those family historians who are lucky enough to trace their roots so far back .
Parish registers were in theory kept from 1538 but such was the turmoil in the Civil War period that you are indeed lucky if the events you are seeking were entered into a parish register at that time .
Self - styled ‘ Lord Protector ’ Oliver Cromwell was then – and remains to this day – something of an enigma .
On the one hand he was at first reluctant to be drawn into the ‘ king v parliament ’ battle which preceded the Civil War , but once involved , the battle became his consuming passion , fired by his puritan zealotry .
The puritan hatred of all Christian images and associated church paraphernalia led to the wholesale destruction of much of England ’s heritage .
Churches were ransacked and priests went into hiding – little wonder that parish records went missing !
Much has been written about this defining time in English history and it is worth reading as much as you can about it to fully understand the scale of the changes which happened as a result of the Civil War and the conditions in which our ancestors lived .
Cromwell died on September 3 , 1658 , and under two years later Charles II was recalled from exile and the English monarchy was restored .
Oliver Cromwell ’s funeral in November 1658 was a magnificent affair , witnessed by thousands and displaying all the trappings of a regal pageant .
Yet less than three years later his corpse was removed from Westminster Abbey in 1661 and ‘ executed ’ at Tyburn along with other dead regicides .
Exhumed under cover of darkness and placed on a traitor ’s spike at Westminster Hall , Cromwell ’s head was to experience some remarkable adventures over the next three hundred years .
Falling into the hands of an opportunistic soldier , a failed comic actor , a money - grabbing publicist and some ‘ cranial detectives ’ , the curio fascinated all who encountered it .
Now , a new book by Jonathan Fitzgibbons , published by The National Archives , tells the story of the head ’s remarkable journey , blending gruesome humour with a compelling portrait of the great parliamentarian in life .
But it also explores his many talents and intriguing contradictions – country gentleman and farmer , brilliant military commander and cavalry leader , loving father and stern Puritan – and pays tribute to the passionate politician who sought to be remembered ‘ warts and all ’ by those he came to serve .
It gives a fascinating new take on Oliver Cromwell who remains the most contentious figure in English history .
Cromwell 's Head by Jonathan Fitzgibbons ( £ 12.99 ) is available from The National Archives on - line bookshop at http://nationalarchives.gov.uk/bookshop

Franken lawyer slams ' cynical and desperate ' attempt to stop vote count Nick Juliano
Published : Monday December 15 , 2008
Print This Email This Al Franken 's team is increasingly optimistic the Democratic candidate will prevail in the Minnesota Senate recount , and the campaign 's lawyer on Monday slammed a lawsuit filed by Republican incumbent Norm Coleman as a " cynical and desperate " attempt to keep votes from being counted .
Coleman 's lawsuit asks Minnesota 's supreme court to set a " uniform standard " for absentee ballots a state canvassing board has ordered included in the recount ; the Coleman campaign also says it is concerned that some ballots have been counted twice .
Franken lawyer Marc Elias , speaking to reporters on a conference call , dismissed those concerns , portraying them as the desperate gasps of a campaign worried at its declining fortunes .
" They are suing because they 're behind , " Elias said , reiterating his methodology that shows Franken with a four - vote lead .
" The numbers are what they are .
...
What we 're seeing is a cynical and despearate attempt by the Coleman campaign . "
While most counts maintain that Coleman holds an edge of around 200 votes in the recount , an Associated Press analysis from over the weekend found that Franken would make up that gap once the board begins deciding on the challenges .
Elias pointed to the article as evidence that the campaign 's count was right all along .
There are about 1,000 more absentee ballots that the board last week recommended adding to the recount because they were improperly rejected .
It is the inclusion of these ballots Coleman 's campaign is attempting to stop -- temporarily it argues , so the court can provide guidance on a unified standard for inclusion .
Such a standard already exists , Elias argued , negating the need for Coleman 's suit .
" There is a uniform standard , " he said .
" There are four reasons for rejecting a ballot and if it does n't meet one of those four reasons , then it should be counted . "
A couple who transformed the infertile soil of their Perthshire croft by adding rock dust to it have developed the process into an export business .
Former schoolteachers Cameron and Moira Thomson saw their first shipment of the crushed quarried rock leave Scotland for Slovakia on Friday .
The Thomsons ' once - exhausted land now produces football - sized cabbages , massive onions and normally delicate fruits the size of a fist .
' The dust we use has more than 78 minerals and trace elements , and that benefits the produce , ' said Moira Thomson , who with Cameron set up the centre for Sustainable Ecological Earth Regeneration ( Seer ) in 1997 .
' It 's been said that we need to eat five apples to get the same nutrients we used to get from one apple 40 years ago .
But when we had one of our carrots analysed and compared with a shop - bought one , it had 10 times as many nutrients . '
Cameron Thomson said using rock dust mimics the earth 's glacial cycles .
' Modern soils are relatively barren and artificial fertilisers are needed , but rock dust accelerates that natural weathering process , ' he said .
Most recently , Ron Paul blasted the Congress regarding their recent multi trillion dollar bailout frauds and the attempted nationalization ( ' bailouts ' ) of industries that he says will destroy the dollar and the American economy .
This issue of sound money is the one that Dr. Paul has been hammering for 21 months now , ever since he started and finished his 2008 Presidential Campaign .
But he began warning Congress on April 26th , 2002 .
Why have n't our leaders heeded his wisdom on sound economic policy ?
Dr. Paul 's financial warnings and messages have a new home , spotlighted at his Campaign for Liberty website .
He continues educating the public on his Constitional views on national issues , and as he has been re-elected as a U.S. Congressman in 2008 , which means he will continue ignoring the GOP establishment and voting along the principle of limited Constitutional federal government .
A plan to Educate Obama
I suggest , Dr. Paul , that you mention on the floor of the U.S. Congress that your short 167 page bestseller book ( “ The Revolution : A Manifesto “ ) should be a half - hour read for Mr. Obama , and a mere $ 14 invested to gain a genuine “ All American ” education … one that he evidently missed under Rev. Wright 's idiot tutelage .
If he can't read all of it in time leading up to his Inaugeration , then mention he should at least read Chapter 6 , entitled : “ Money : The Forbidden Issue in American Politics ”
Dr. Paul knows that we 're all financial slaves to the Fed .
On August 17th I proposed that he educate Obama prior to the DNC convention , and make an appearance on stage to shake hands with Obama , if Obama agreed to make plans to rally the congress and senate to pass Dr. Paul 's ingenious “ No Taxes On Tips ” legislation , within the first week Mr. Obama takes office .
I suggested the Paul / Obama public announcement at the time because 1 ) Paul had youth in his rallies , as did Obama , 2 ) Obama would landslide McCain , and 3 ) the GOP establishment has been ignoring Paul and smearing him for too long , and 4 ) the financial disasters facing America under a new administration would be the very one 's for which Dr. Paul has been proposing solutions since 2007 .
The reason I consider Dr. Paul 's “ No Taxes on Tips ” plan ingenious is that 1 ) it would be extremely popular and easy to pass , 2 ) it helps young people and women , and although the DNC has a lot of those in its demographic , Ron Paul was able to tap into this traditional DNC voting block as well during his campaign .
Thus Obama voters and Paul voters of 2008 would both feel inspired that the political landscape might be reshaped for the better in America .
And they would be more willing to vote in 2010 for more Ron Paul type candidates and ideas .
Ron Paul is the only popular congressman who can can talk sense that both non-extremist left voters and non-extremist right voters understand .
He has begun to bring many Republican party members back to their senses .
President Elect Obama would experience a positive reaction in the 40 and younger audience , if he presented them with a taste of initiating economic liberty in this country .
After passing Dr. Paul's ' No Taxes on Tips ' legislation , perhaps Dr. Paul can stay in the spotlight over the next year to help ensure an Obama Presidency wo n't sink the entire country into a financial fascist disaster .
( REF : “ Liberal Fascism ” by Jonah Goldberg ) .
In this manner , Ron Paul could easily continue his American “ liberty earthquake ” that began in February 2007 .
With the financial disasters looming for America , I know personally of many coworkers who have told me “ should 've nominated Ron Paul ” .
This means that many more Americans will be looking at sound monetary policy as the primary issue in 2010 and 2012 elections .
I tell everyone I know who cares about politics to read Ron Paul 's book .
Perhaps if Ron Paul scolds the U.S. Congress and invites Barack Obama to read his book to start discussing the real issue of sound money , we could have a brave President and Congressman who are n't afraid to take on the financial banking monopolists in 2009 .

For the first time , Apple is recommending the use of anti-virus tools to protect Mac systems .
Long something of a phantom menace , strains of malware capable of infecting Mac machines have gradually been increasing in prevalence over recent months .
In addition , VXers are making more use of web - based attack and applications specific vulnerabilities to infect PCs whatever their underlying operating system might be .
Windows - specific malware attacks are still orders of magnitude greater than assaults on Mac machines , but the risk to Apple fans is now enough for the Church of Jobs to admit a risk exists .
The admission that security scanner software was a good idea for Mac users came in an unheralded update to Apple 's support site made on 21 November , first picked up by Brian Krebs at Security Fix on Monday .
Apple goes further than just recommending the use of one scanner to advise the use of multiple tools .
" Apple encourages the widespread use of multiple anti-virus utilities so that virus programmers have more than one application to circumvent , thus making the whole virus writing process more difficult , " it said .
Quite aside from the expense , the use of multiple anti-virus scanners could affect system performance and smacks of overkill .
Users who use one anti-virus scanner , a personal firewall and keeping up to date with patching would be safer than just relying on two anti-virus scanners to bail them out of trouble , according to general security best - practice .
Using multiple scanners on mail gateways and servers makes sense , but on the desktop the advice is a lot more questionable .
Apple suggests Intego VirusBarrier , Symantec Norton Anti-Virus 11 for Macintosh and McAfee VirusScan for Mac as possible security options .
All these packages come at a price , while AVG is well known for supplying a basic version of its anti-virus software to Windows consumers at home at no charge .
Avast !
Home Edition and Clam AV provide similar options for Mac users . ®

USA '08 Verizon and AT&T have both located temporary cell sites near presidential - candidate John McCain 's Arizona ranch , to better connect the good Senator , his supporters and security staff .
The news comes from the Washington Post , which established that Cindy McCain , the senator 's wife , offered some land on the ranch to Verizon early last year in the hope that it would put a cell there .
Verizon got pretty far with that request , but ended up deciding the planning requirements were too onerous , and the return on investment too nebulous .
But come June the operator was wheeling in a temporary base station to provide coverage , apparently responding to a request from the security services .
In July AT&T noticed , and figured it'd better get in there too , so brought in its own temporary base station .
So both networks now provide superb coverage to the McCain ranch .
These base stations are essentially towers on trailers , powered by a generator and connected to the rest of the world via microwave link .
Where household mains electricity is available the generator is n't necessary , but the company will normally sling a fence around the trailer once it 's deployed to stop children climbing the antenna to fit pirate radio transmitters .
Mike Pratt has a nice photograph of a mobile base station , for anyone having trouble visualising it .
None of this would matter if McCain was n't so closely involved with both Verizon , AT&T , and US regulator the FCC .
Five of his campaign officials have worked as lobbyists for Verizon , and Verizon employees have stumped up $ 155 K to help fund the campaign as well as $ 1.3 m raised by the chief executive and company lobbyists .
AT&T is even more McCain - centric , with the executive vice president raising $ 2.3 m with the help of AT&T lobbyists , and staff chucking $ 325 K of their own money into the pot .
McCain himself is member of the Senate commerce committee , which oversees the FCC .
But despite all this a campaign spokesman told the Post " Mrs McCain 's staff went through the website as any member of the general public would - no string - pulling , no phone calls , no involvement of Senate staff ...
Just because she is married to a senator does n't mean she forfeits her right to ask for cell service as any other Verizon customer can . "
Apparently he said all this with a straight face .
AT&T was less obtuse : " You can't have a presidential nominee in an area where there is no cell coverage . "
Which makes more sense to us .
We 're just grateful that both companies decided to go for temporary stations , rather than anything permanent that might be indicative of their confidence in the result of the upcoming election . ®
A new intelligent pill designed by Philips , the Dutch electronics company , promises to deliver medicine in the right place , at the right time , inside your body .
The company , best known for consumer products like webcams and wireless headphones , is packing some of the same technology into the new pill , known as the iPill .
Containing a microprocessor , battery , wireless radio , pump and a reservoir for medication , the inch - long capsule is designed to treat digestive tract disorders such as Crohn ’s disease and ulcerative colitis [ Times Online ] .
Once swallowed , the iPill allows researchers to keep track of its precise location through a wireless transmitter .
It sends dispatches about the temperature and acidity of its surroundings to an outside receiver as it travels through the GI tract over the course of a day or two .
The acidity , measured by pH , of the gut decreases as the pill gets further from the stomach , and that allows researchers to pinpoint the place where the drug is needed [ San Francisco Chronicle ] .
Researchers can pre-program drug release when certain conditions are met or cue the drug release using a remote controller .
Similar robotic capsules with built - in cameras have been developed for colon endoscopy , but the iPill is the first to have drug delivering capabilities .
Targeting drugs
directly to the location of the disease means doses can be lower , reducing side effects , Philips said [ Reuters ] .
For now , the iPill is still in prototype stage and the company plans to first market the pills to pharmaceutical companies for as much as $ 1,000 per pill .
If the iPill becomes commonplace , the cost would go down significantly .
If the iPill becomes , say , as ubiquitous as the iPod ,
Philips senior scientist Jeff Shimizu can think of one possible problem :
Keeping the minute devices out of our water supply .
To do so , sewage treatment plants might someday have to screen for iPills , he said .
" If we 're selling millions of them , it could be an issue . " [ San Francisco Chronicle ] .

Britney Spears Glamour Photo Shoot and Bizarre Sound Bite
graces the cover of Glamour magazine 's January 2009 issue .
The photos are great , showing a much healthier side of the pop star .
Today marks her 27th birthday and the release of her new album Circus
We suspect that there is a good deal of airbrushing in the pics but she would n't be the first or the last to be tweaked for a photo shoot so we 're not going to stoop to faulting her for that .
We are , however , just a little perplexed by a quote that we lifted from the Glamour article that accompanies her photos .
Just when we thought Spears and K - Fed were mending fences and getting along for the sake of Sean Preston and Jayden James , she threw out a rather odd quote regarding her dream for the future .
She offered :
" In five years , I 'd like to be married and have a father figure for my kids .
Someone who is a provider and can be really stable .
It 's hard doing it on my own . "

Country is Headed to a Constitutional Crisis
( Lafayette Hill , Pennsylvania – 10/06/08 ) - Philip J. Berg , Esquire , the Attorney who filed suit against Barack H. Obama challenging Senator Obama 's lack of " qualifications " to serve as President of the United States , announced today that Obama and Democratic National Committee [ DNC ] filed a Joint Motion for Protective Order to Stay Discovery Pending a Decision on the Motion to Dismiss ( which was ) filed on 09/24/08 .
While legal , Berg stated he is " outraged as this is another attempt to hide the truth from the public ; it is obvious that documents do not exist to prove that Obama is qualified to be President . "
The case is Berg v. Obama , No. 08-cv-04083 .
Their joint motion indicates a concerted effort to avoid the truth by attempting to delay the judicial process , although legal , by not resolving the issue presented : that is , whether Barack Obama meets the qualifications to be President .
It is obvious that Obama was born in Kenya and does not meet the " qualifications " to be President of the United States pursuant to our United States Constitution .
Obama cannot produce a certified copy of his " Vault " [ original long version ]
Birth Certificate from Hawaii because it does not exist .

Dmitry Medvedev ( L ) wants to improve Russia 's presence in Latin America
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has described Russian - Cuban ties as " especially intense " , after meeting Cuban President Raul Castro in Havana .
He also met the president 's ailing brother , former leader Fidel Castro .
Cuba is his last stop on a four - nation tour of Latin America intended to build up Russia 's ties in the region .
Mr Medvedev arrived in Havana from Venezuela , where he and President Hugo Chavez signed a deal on nuclear energy and discussed military co-operation .
The Russian president also visited Brazil and Peru .
After meeting his Cuban counterpart , Mr Medvedev told reporters : " We have a systematic dialogue .
Our relations have been generally good , but in the past six months they have become especially intense . "
Mr Medvedev said he wanted to boost Russia 's presence in a region it had previously neglected - a region traditionally of strategic importance to the US .
Russian companies are interested in drilling for oil in Cuban waters and investing in a nickel processing plant .
Cuba is unlikely to want to antagonise the US with President - elect Barack Obama taking office in January , says the BBC's Michael Voss in Havana .
Naval exercises
In Venezuela , Mr Medvedev signed an accord with Mr Chavez to help Venezuela build a nuclear energy plant .
Joint gas projects were also approved .
Military co-operation was also high on the agenda of Mr Medvedev 's talks with Mr Chavez .
The joint exercises are due to begin at sea on 1 December
Russian and Venezuelan warships are scheduled to hold joint military exercises later this week .
Russia is already a major arms supplier to Venezuela , with contracts worth some $ 4.4bn ( £ 2.39bn ) .
The Russian leader travelled to Venezuela from Brazil , where he and President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva held talks on boosting trade and technical co-operation .
In Rio de Janeiro , the two presidents expressed their view that the " Bric " countries - Brazil , Russia , India and China - should hold their first summit in Russia in 2009 .
Mr Medvedev 's visit takes place just a few days after the Chinese president , Hu Jintao , toured several Latin American nations with a view to strengthening ties .
Economic punditry tends to fall broadly into glass - half - full or half - empty categories .
Then there are those who see a cracked glass , teetering on the edge of a table just moments from a shattering fall .
Enter Peter Schiff , the permabear president of brokerage Euro Pacific Capital and coauthor of last year 's Crash Proof : How to Profit From the Coming Economic Collapse .
Schiff spent the past decade urging brokerage clients to jump ship from the American economy ahead of what he views as inevitable pain caused by a toxic cocktail of lax monetary policy , wayward spending , and tougher competition from all corners of the globe .
Even with some pain already felt as America 's economy stumbles , Schiff saw nothing but downside in a recent chat with U.S. News .
You 'll want to buckle up for some characteristically apocalyptic talk from one of the gloomiest market watchers around .
Excerpts :
Say something positive about the U.S. economy .
There 's nothing good to say about our situation .
The policies both the Fed and government are pursuing are making the situation worse .
We 've been getting a free ride on the global gravy train .
Other countries are starting to reclaim their resources and goods , so as Americans are priced out of various markets , the rest of the world is going to enjoy the consumption of goods Americans had previously purchased .
This is a natural consequence of this phony economy .
If America had maintained a viable economy and continued to produce goods instead of merely consuming them , and if we had saved money instead of borrowing , our standard of living could rise with everybody else 's .
Instead , we gutted our manufacturing , let our infrastructure decay , and encouraged our citizens to borrow with reckless abandon .
So what are you doing about it ?
I 'm getting my clients ' money outside of the United States as fast as they can send it to me .
I 've been recommending that to my clients for close to 10 years .
You 've got to own resources and energy .
I was saying oil was going to $ 200 a barrel in 2002 .
I 've been buying gold , silver , industrial metals , and all kinds of stocks .
My main theme is the global economy will survive and the U.S. economy is a disaster .
Everything is about how you benefit from the increased purchasing power and rising standard of living in the rest of the world .
OK , where are the best non-U.S. markets this year ?
I still like Singapore , Hong Kong .
Asian markets are the place to be .
I like resource markets like Scandinavia .
I 'm spreading my chips around the world .
I 'm just avoiding the United States .
What are your best or worst calls through this downturn ?
I 've been bearish on bonds .
U.S. bonds have lost a lot of real value but not nominal value .
I still think that 's going to be proven to be correct .
While the housing bubble was inflating , I was telling people to rent .
I was telling people to get out of tech stocks in 1998 and 1999 .
They kept rising , but then they collapsed , and I turned out to be right .
The reality is I do n't think I 've been wrong on anything .
Most people disagree with that sort of pessimism .
If you 're staying in the United States , how do you invest ?
If you want to be in U.S markets , you avoid anything connected with the American economy .
You avoid retailers , the home builders , the financials — anything having to do with consumers buying something or paying back the money they borrowed .
If you want to invest in U.S. markets , stick with exporters and resource companies .
I 've been saying that for five or six years ; I have n't gotten anything wrong .
We shorted subprime mortgages .
I have clients that made 10 times their money .
We 've never sold an oil stock .
We 've never sold a gold stock .
Why do n't you think soaring oil , grains , or commodities prices are the next bubble ?
These prices do not constitute bubbles .
They simply constitute the repricing of goods to reflect the diminished value of our money .
The way you can tell there 's not a bubble is that these markets are clearing .
People are buying food and eating it .
They 're buying gasoline and using it .
Speculators are n't buying gasoline and warehousing it in big facilities because they think the price is going to go up .
At the same time , we 've increased the supply of money dramatically , and the Fed is increasing it even faster now to deal with the bursting of the housing bubble .
The only thing that can happen is for prices of commodities to rise to reflect the equilibrium of a greater supply of money .
It 's not even that oil prices are going up .
Oil prices are staying the same .
What 's happening is the value of money is diminishing , so we need more units of currency to buy the same amount of oil or wheat or corn or whatever .
How about some predictions ?
• I think the stock market is headed lower .
Gold is going to be $ 1,200 to $ 1,500 by the end of the year .
That puts the Dow at a less - than - 10 - to - 1 price ratio to gold .
Right now , it 's about 13 to 1 .
That 's another 30 percent drop in the real value of stocks by the end of the year if you price them in gold .
The Dow was worth 43 ounces of gold in 2000 .
It 'll get to 10 by the end of the year and continue to fall from there .
•
Oil prices had a pretty big run and might not make more headway by the end of the year .
But we could see $ 150 to $ 200 next year .
I do n't think oil will hit $ 250 because there will be enough destruction of demand in the United States to keep it from doubling .
The big problem for us is if the Chinese substantially allow their currency to rise .
It could increase at least fivefold against the dollar over the span of a year or two .
That reduces the price of oil by 80 percent for 1.3 billion Chinese .
Consumption would go through the roof , and that will drive prices through the roof for us .
• At a minimum , the dollar will lose another 40 to 50 percent of its value .
I 'm confident that by next year we 'll see more aggressive movements to abandon the dollar by the [ Persian ]
Gulf region and by the Asian bloc .
That 's where the stuff really hits the fan .
You 're a Ron Paul adviser .
He 's out of contention , so who wins the election , and what happens then ?
The Obama presidency will be like the Jimmy Carter presidency on steroids .
I 'm pretty sure it 's Obama because the economy will be so bad into the election that as damaged a candidate as the guy is , I do n't think a Republican could beat him .
I think Ron Paul could 've had a slim chance because he was different enough .
So how bad do you think this economy will get ?
The other problem we 'll have during those years is civil [ unrest ] .
There will be a big increase in crime .
People are going to be hungry .
People are going to be cold .
There 's a sense of entitlement in this country , and when a lot of people used to having things suddenly do n't , everybody looks for someone to blame .
Really ?
Commercial Paper
Financialization ’s ( Latest ) Weak Link
By Max Fraad Wolff | October 29th , 2008
This is a web - only article from the website of Dollars & Sense : The Magazine of Economic Justice available at http://www.dollarsandsense.org
This is a web - only article , available only at www.dollarsandsense.org.
There may be no better illustration of the staggering pain emanating from financial market turbulence than the carnage experienced recently in commercial paper markets worldwide .
Commercial paper ( often abbreviated as “ CP ” in the financial press ) is not a synonym for trade journals or advertising - heavy publications of little intellectual value .
“ Commercial paper ” is the term used for short - term loans — for less than 35 weeks — that are made without needing ( in the United States ) to be registered at the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) .
Companies raise money by selling repayment promises — IOUs — below the full value at the time of repayment .
The difference between the price received by firms in the commercial paper market and the amount they pledge to pay is referred to as the “ discount . ”
You may find large household name firms selling $ 1000 repayments in 90 days for between $ 960 and $ 980 today .
A few months ago , firms were selling $ 1000 in 90 days for $ 990 or more .
The discount has risen , as money has become hard to get .
Most loans are for far less than 270 days , and loans average around one month ’s duration .
Trusted firms with good credit ratings can borrow — nearly at will — for low cost when markets function well .
So commercial paper markets allow corporations fast and easy access to cash for operations , near - term expenses , and even payrolls .
Consequently , commercial paper markets grew to a size of about $ 2 trillion , and this market became essential to the basic functioning of many firms — and hence to the whole economy .
Commercial paper has become an attractive financing option for companies for other reasons , too .
It allows access to large sums with less regulatory hassle , cost , or delay than tends to be the case with bond issuance or traditional commercial bank borrowing .
In addition , as short - term interest rates have been very low in recent years , some companies could n’t resist the temptation to borrow short and cheap with commercial paper and buy longer dated debt that paid higher interest rates .
The difference was then a source of “ earnings , ” or revenue , for firms .
This would turn out to be a dangerous game when short - term rates increased and credit became scarce .
The short - term nature of the loans requires firms to roll them over , borrowing regularly .
In other words , when you borrow for a short time , you need to borrow again soon .
What led to the current meltdown in this market ?
Of course , many factors come into play .
The credit swoon began with a few firms extending ( postponing ) repayment on commercial paper .
A similar situation actually occurred in August 2007 .
Back then , short - term loans in commercial paper markets had been used to finance mortgage - related investments , and the exploding of the subprime bubble triggered selling that drove short - term rates much higher , making continued borrowing or rollovers prohibitively expensive .
But this fear subsided as weaker firms were forced out of the commercial paper market and confidence returned .
The present collapse of the commercial paper market originated with money market mutual funds .
Money market mutual funds have been around for forty years .
These funds manage cash from firms , charities , universities and individuals .
Money market mutual funds make conservative short - term investment to guarantee that money is not lost .
The focus on safety centers on the goal of never returning less than $ 1 for each $ 1 invested .
In industry parlance , returning less than $ 1 is called “ breaking the buck . ”
In the last four decades this has occurred only twice , and one of these times was September 16th , 2008 .
The failure of Lehman Brothers on September 15th , 2008 capped a ten - day period that saw the Bank of America purchase of Merrill Lynch , the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and the bailout of AIG .
The ensuing panic drove the value of a $ 1 investment in a money - market mutual fund called the Reserve Primary Fund to $ .97 .
Seized with fear that day , investors began withdrawing their money indiscriminately from money market mutual funds .
Federal Reserve action led people to seek the safety of FDIC deposit insurance and US Treasuries .
This diverted money from money market funds .
Money market mutual funds were big , big buyers of commercial paper .
Their exit from the CP market meant , in turn , a potential freeze - up in short - term funding for a large number of companies .
Indeed , the situation got so bad that even the most highly regarded companies were largely unable to roll over their debts , and when they could do so , it was only for extremely short periods ( sometimes one day ) .
Such a situation , if prolonged , would bring effective corporate planning to an end .
The discounts required to borrow in the commercial paper market eventually doubled for stronger firms , and moved outside the realm of possibility for weaker or more suspect businesses .
This led to an enormous decrease in the size of the CP market .
From peak through trough , more than 90 % of available funds dried up .
The Federal Reserve is leading the way in an attempt to jump - start the CP market .
On October 7th , the New York Federal Reserve Bank announced the unveiling of its new Commercial Paper Funding Facility ( CPFF ) .
This new program will operate through private primary dealers , and began funding 90 - day loans on October 27th .
The program is set to run through April 30th , 2009 .
A “ special purpose vehicle ” ( SPV ) will buy the 90 - day commercial paper and hold it to maturity .
The funding will come from the New York Federal Reserve Bank , and the Pacific Investment Management Company ( PIMCO ) will manage the accounts .
After a few wild days in the week of October 13th , rates began to slowly return to earth .
This will be pivotal for positive movement in stock markets .
The worst may be behind us ; then again , we ’ve hoped for that before .
The key lesson from the rapid demise of the all - important commercial paper market is that in an interdependent and financialized economy , markets interact .
They can pass along opportunities , but they can also pass along fear , loss , and loathing .
We have learned time and again that no man , market , or industry is an island .
Commercial paper markets offer one more dramatic and violent example of mutual interdependence and risk .

What 's That Stuff ?
Frankincense And Myrrh
Culture and chemistry meet in fragrant plant - based incense
SPICY - SMELLING frankincense and myrrh have been intimately intertwined with humanity throughout recorded history , from the frankincense pellets found in the ancient tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun to the myrrh - infused brandy concoction used to preserve the body of Vice Admiral Horatio Nelson , a 19th - century British war hero .
The substances ' musky plumes of smoke are most often associated with embalming , perfumes , and religious rituals around the world , including ceremonies in the ancient temples of Jerusalem and modern Roman Catholic liturgies .
Beyond those uses , frankincense and myrrh may also have medicinal and psychoactive components .

Both of the earthy entities are gum resins , which are viscous secretions from trees .
Frankincense , also known as olibanum , comes from select trees in the Boswellia genus , and myrrh usually comes from Commiphora trees .
The plants belong to the same botanical family and commonly grow on the Arabian Peninsula , in India , and in northeastern Africa .
" Both trees are usually gnarled and look stunted , without very many leaves , " describes Kerry Hughes , an ethnobotanist and founder of EthnoPharm , a consulting company specializing in plant products .
To access the aromatic resins , locals slice gashes into frankincense and myrrh trees at harvest times and collect the milky resins that ooze from their bark , Hughes says .
Once exposed to air and sun , myrrh dries and hardens to reddish - brown pea-sized chunks , whereas frankincense dries to pale yellow , tear - shaped droplets about half that size .
Because factors such as geography and climate affect plant biochemistry , it 's impossible to precisely pin down an exact chemical composition for myrrh or frankincense .
However , the resins do contain sugar chains , proteins , and steroids , and are mostly a blend of terpenes , a diverse family of hydrocarbons made from five - carbon building blocks .
For example , frankincense contains five - ringed triterpenoids called boswellic acids , as well as an array of mono - and sesquiterpenes that contribute to its scent , including α- and β- pinene , limonene , and 4 - terpineol .
Myrrh 's aroma , meanwhile , comes mostly from furanosesquiterpenes such as furanoeudes ma - 1,3 - diene .
Humans have been investigating frankincense and myrrh for centuries , says Arieh Moussaieff , a postdoctoral fellow in plant sciences at the Weizmann Institute of Science , in Rehovot , Israel .
" The early scientists did not have the chemical and analytical tools that we have today , " so they conducted more straightforward experiments such as dividing the resin into water - soluble and fat - soluble fractions and then looking for desirable bioactivities , he says .
Despite today 's vast improvements in instrumentation , the biological effects of these resins still are n't fully understood .
For instance , the resins ' reputed pain - relieving properties are an active research topic .
A recent study led by an expert at the University of California , Davis , suggested that a frankincense extract provides relief to patients with arthritic knees ( Arthritis Res. Ther. 2008 , 10 , R85 ) .
Such extracts have been used for centuries in traditional medicine to treat a range of conditions .
However , the new study was funded by a company that makes frankincense extract , and the claims have not been evaluated by the Food & Drug Administration .
In another study , researchers at the University of Florence , in Italy , set mice on a hot plate and compared how long it took regular mice and mice fed myrrh to lick their paws , a sign that the heat was causing them pain .
Sure enough , mice dosed with myrrh held out longer .
The team 's additional tests suggested that furanoeudesma -1,3 - diene and another terpene are primarily responsible for the analgesic effects and that the compounds affect opioid receptors in the mice 's brains , which influence pain perception ( Nature 1996 , 379 , 29 ) .
The precise pathways these compounds affect have yet to be determined , however .
Frankincense also affects mouse brains , and in a way that provokes fascinating questions about the intersection of culture and chemistry .
" Most present - day worshippers assume that incense burning has only a symbolic meaning , " Moussaieff says .
But together with his Ph.D. adviser Raphael Mechoulam of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and an international team of coworkers , he found evidence that a compound in frankincense resin exhibits depression - and anxiety - dampening effects in mice ( FASEB J. 2008 , 22 , 3024 ) .
The team also demonstrated that the compound , a diterpenoid called incensole acetate , activates an ion channel involved in warmth perception in the skin .
Although the results have n't been confirmed in humans , " it is possible that incensole acetate augments the euphoric feeling produced during religious functions , " Moussaieff notes .
Given that incense is one of the common threads in most major world religions and that immense symbolism is attached to incense burning , the Israeli team 's findings " do n't surprise me at all , " Hughes says .

Beautiful HTML is the foundation of a beautiful website .
When I teach people about CSS , I always begin by telling them that good CSS can only exist with equally good HTML markup .
A house is only as strong as its foundation , right ?
The advantages of clean , semantic HTML are many , yet so many websites suffer from poorly written markup .
Beautiful and clean HTML is the foundation of a beautiful website .
When I teach people about CSS , I always begin by telling them that good CSS can only exist with equally good HTML markup .
A house is only as strong as its foundation , right ?
The advantages of clean , semantic HTML are many , yet so many websites suffer from poorly written markup .
Let ’s take a look at some poorly written HTML , discuss its problems , and then whip it into shape !
Bear in mind , we are not passing any judgment on the content or design of this page , only the markup that builds it .
If you are interested , take a peek at the bad code and the good code before we start so you can see the big picture .
Now let ’s start right at the top .
Further Reading on SmashingMag :
1. Strict DOCTYPE
If we are going to do this , let ’s just do it right .
No need for a discussion about whether to use HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0 : both of them offer a strict version that will keep us nice and honest as we write our code .
Our code does n’t use any tables for layout anyway ( nice ! ) , so there really is no need for a transitional DOCTYPE .
Resources :
2. Character set & encoding characters
In our < head > section , the very first thing should be the declaration of our character set .
We ’re using UTF - 8 here , which is swell , but it ’s listed after our < title > .
Let ’s go ahead and move it up so that the browser knows what character set it ’s dealing with before it starts reading any content at all .
While we ’re talking about characters , let ’s go ahead and make sure any funny characters we are using are properly encoded .
We have an ampersand in our title .
To avoid any possible misinterpretation of that , we ’ll convert it to & instead .
Resources :
3. Proper indentation
All right , we are about three lines in and I ’m already annoyed by the lack of indentation .
Indentation has no bearing on how the page is rendered , but it has a huge effect on the readability of the code .
Standard procedure is to indent one tab ( or a few spaces ) when you are starting a new element that is a child element of the tag above it .
Then move back in a tab when you are closing that element .
Indentation rules are far from set in stone ; feel free to invent your own system .
But I recommend being consistent with whatever you choose .
Nicely indented markup goes a long way in beautifying your code and making it easy to read and jump around in .
Resources :
4. Keep your CSS and JavaScript external
We have some CSS that has snuck into our < head > section .
This is a grievous foul because not only does it muddy our markup but it can only apply to this single HTML page .
Keeping your CSS files separate means that future pages can link to them and use the same code , so changing the design on multiple pages becomes easy .
This may have happened as a “ quick fix ” at some point , which is understandable and happens to all of us , but let ’s get that moved to a more appropriate place in an external file .
There is no JavaScript in our head section , but the same goes for that .
The title of our site , “ My Cat Site , ” is properly inside < h1 > tags , which makes perfect sense .
And as per the norm , the title is a link to the home page .
However , the anchor link , < a > , wraps the header tags .
Easy mistake .
Most browsers will handle it fine , but technically it ’s a no - no .
An anchor link is an “ inline ” element , and header tags are “ block ” elements .
Blocks should n’t go inside inline elements .
It ’s like crossing the streams in Ghostbusters .
It ’s just not a good idea .
6. Eliminate unnecessary divs
I do n’t know who first coined it , but I love the term “ divitis , ” which refers to the overuse of divs in HTML markup .
Sometime during the learning stages of Web design , people learn how to wrap elements in a div so that they can target them with CSS and apply styling .
This leads to a proliferation of the div element and to their being used far too liberally in unnecessary places .
In our example , we have a div ( “ topNav ” ) that wraps an unordered list ( “ bigBarNavigation ” ) .
Both divs and unordered lists are block - level elements .
There really is no need whatsoever for the < ul > to be wrapped in a div ; anything you can do with that div you can do with the < ul > .
Resources :
7 . Use better naming conventions
This is a good time to bring up naming conventions , as we have just talked about that unordered list with an id of “ bigBarNavigation . ”
The “ Navigation ” part makes sense , because it ’s describing the content that the list contains , but “ big ” and “ Bar ” describe the design not the content .
It might make sense right now because the menu is a big bar , but if you change the design of the website ( and , say , change the website navigation to a vertical style ) , that id name will be confusing and irrelevant .
Good class and id names are things like “ mainNav , ” “ subNav , ” “ sidebar , ” “ footer , ” “ metaData , ” things that describe the content they contain .
Bad class and id names are things that describe the design , like “ bigBoldHeader , ” “ leftSidebar , ” and “ roundedBox . ”
8. Leave typography to the CSS
The design of our menu calls for all - caps text .
We just dig how that looks , and more power to us .
We have achieved this by putting the text in all - caps , which of course works ; but for better , future extensibility , we should abstract typographic choices like this one to the CSS .
We can easily target this text and turn it to all - caps with {text - transform : uppercase} .
This means that down the road , if that all - caps look loses its charm , we can make one little change in the CSS to change it to regular lowercase text .
9. Class / id the
By “ class the body , ” I literally mean apply a class to the body , like < body class= “ blogLayout ” >.
Why ?
I can see two things going on in this code that lead me to believe that this page has a layout that is different than other pages on the website .
One , the main content div is id ’d “ mainContent - 500 . ”
Seems like someone had a “ mainContent ” div at one point and then needed to alter its size later on and , to do so , created a brand new id .
I ’m guessing it was to make it larger , because further in the code we see < class = “ narrowSidebar ” > applied to the sidebar , and we can infer that that was added to slim down the sidebar from its normal size .
This is n’t a very good long - term solution for alternate layouts .
Instead , we should apply a class name to the body as suggested above .
That will allow us to target both the “ mainContent ” and “ sidebar ” divs uniquely without the need for fancy new names or class additions .
Having unique class and id names for the body is very powerful and has many more uses than just for alternate layouts .
Because every bit of page content lies in the “ body ” tag , you can uniquely target anything on any page with that hook ; particularly useful for things like navigation and indicating current navigation , since you ’ll know exactly what page you are on with that unique body class .
Resources :
Kind of goes without saying , but you should run your code through the ol’ validator machine to pick up small mistakes .
Sometimes the mistakes will have no bearing on how the page renders , but some mistakes certainly will .
Validated code is certain to outlive non-validated code .
If for no other reason , seeing that green text on the W3C validator tool just makes you feel good inside .
Resources :
11 . Logical ordering
If it is at all possible , keeping the sections of your website in a logical order is best .
Notice how the footer section lies above the sidebar in our code .
This may be because it works best for the design of the website to keep that information just after the main content and out of the sidebar .
Understandable , but if there is any way to get that footer markup down to be the last thing on the page and then use some kind of layout or positioning technique to visually put it where you need it , that is better .
12 . Just do what you can
We ’ve covered a lot here , and this is a great start to writing clean HTML , but there is so much more .
When starting from scratch , all of this seems much easier .
When trying to fix existing code , it feels a lot more difficult .
You can get bogged down in a CMS that is forcing bad markup on you .
Or , there could be just so many pages on your website that it ’s hard to think of even where to begin .
That ’s OK !
The important thing is that you learn how to write good HTML and that you stick with it .
The next time you write HTML , be it a small chunk in a huge website , or the beginning of a fresh new project , just do what you can to make it right .

Making a Django Uber-Community ¶
My workload at work is about to get a lot less critical and time consuming , so I was looking for a project to start on .
I am really interested in the social aspects of the web , and below I will outline an idea that I think will be my next project .
At Djangocon there was talk by Adrian and Jacob in their Future of Django talk about having a common identity for a person across all Django sites .
I think that this would be a really interesting thing to work on , and make all of our Django sites much more approachable .
So in this post I ’m going to lay out what I think this would look like , how it would likely be done , and then hopefully get some other people that are interested in it to help me brainstorm .
There is a ticket open about it currently .
Information Aggregation ¶
So first off , we need to figure out what this is going to look like .
I imagine there being a central site that would organize all of our Django related activity .
The best option at the moment is Django People , because it already has a lot of that data .
I talked to Simon at Djangocon about his plans for Django People v2 , and it sounds like this is the direction he was wanting to go .
So Django People could serve as a personal aggregator for people .
I view Django People as kind of the “ Profile Page ” of a person in the realm of Django .
The main page could also function as a kind of “ Life stream ” of the project , so people could see what is going on Right now .
I think a killer feature would be to have people be able to join into groups , based on projects , and have a life stream for that project .
This would give people an idea of how active a project is , how many people use and develop it , and other interesting information that weighs into whether we decide to use a project .
Simon in his scary brilliant way already has most of this information on the site .
We just need to build a way to pull information that we care about in , and display it well .
Then we need some kind of large aggregator of content from all of the people in Django .
I think that This week in Django is the place to do that .
The Django Community Aggregator on the official Django site is lacking .
I think this functionality could be pushed off to TWID .
I think that this aggregation site would replace the aggregation of blog posts .
It would hopefully support tagging , syndicated comments , language preferences , and other thing .
I have talked to the TWID guys about doing this , and they said it sounded like a great idea .
I view these 2 sites as the foundation for what I hope to build .
Then the question is , what other sites do we include in this ‘ django information stream ’ ?
I ’m going to list the ones that I think have relevant information , and I would love to have suggestions for other sites that would provide a service .
Visceral Games has had a great job at developing Dead Space 1 and 2 .
In fact , it has helped to revitalize the classic survival horror genre during the time when Resident Evil was chasing more action - style gameplay .
However , it was during its 3rd installment when Dead Space itself has given up to the trend .
Likewise , Visceral has also produced Dante ’s Inferno , which was considered tragically underrated .
Well , the third installment released in 2013 was considered the final game .
The problem with this was Visceral moved on to develop other projects , which led to the delay of the fourth installment Dead Space 4 .
Although there was a lack of promising response to the third installment , Dead Space 4 might still be possible by making a few tweaks to the game .
Perhaps it might even be more exciting to see a new Dead Space to come after a long hiatus .
The fact that Visceral Games was shut down by Electronics Arts , fans are looking forward to the revival of the Dead Space franchise .
Thus , here are some of the reasons why Dead Space 4 should be revived by EA .
Return To Horror
The third release of the Dead Space franchise was said to be disappointing due to the fact that it went away from the original genre .
In fact , many of the elements regarding survival horror disappeared .
The scares that used to be there have gone away , as does the dread after each moment spent on the Ishigura .
Despite the fact that the horror genre has become less famous these days , it may have been making the gaming trends more profitable .
Close Quarter Environments
The claustrophobic environment of most horror genre gaming makes it more appealing to Dead Space fans .
Basically , in the original Dead Space , you can experience the lack of open areas that would be safe to players .
Thus , the players were forced to go through maze - like tunnels and low - level ceilings .
Nevertheless , these may still be a dangerous environment to hide , as necromorphs could come crawling when you least expected it .
To Revive The Psychological Horror
The idea regarding the nightmarish hallucination of the player was clearly experienced in Dead Space 2 .
This was the moment when the hero of the game was having issues with his mind that was slowly deteriorating .
This was less a factor in Dead Space 3 , which should be brought back with real creativity in Dead Space 4 .
Moreover , this should even become more interesting with the addition of twisted apparitions and popup hallucinations .
Isaac The Weapon Crafting Engineer
If you played the game , Dead Space focused on the role of Isaac as an engineer than a soldier .
The tools that Isaac used were lost in the third installment , which should create a more popular plot for the next game .
These are just a few of the many things that EA should look into so that the next installment will be more popular and profitable .
Thus , EA should revive the game because the Dead Space franchise shows a promising future .
The accompanying chart shows the size of national banking systems relative to their countries ’ economies , measured in two ways , and also show how well capitalized the banks appear to be , through the latest reported data .
In general , higher figures in any of the graphics indicate increased danger .
They do not pretend to show what shape the banks are in , but they do reflect the size of the problem each country would face if its banking system did get into trouble .
The first two charts look not at deposits but at short - term debt carried by the banks .
The banks usually have long - term debt as well .
But by its nature , that debt cannot be withdrawn if worries about a bank ’s solvency suddenly increase .
They also have deposits , but deposits are less likely to flee , at least if deposit guarantee systems are trusted .
Short - term debt , on the other hand , matures within a year and may not be available to a bank that is in trouble .
The first comparison  the tinted circles  looks at the size of bank short - term debt as a percentage of a country ’s gross domestic product .
Such figures are not directly comparable , since one is the total amount of income in a country over a year , and the other is the amount owed by banks that may have to be paid over that year .
But the comparisons do show relative sizes .
In the United States , the banks have total short - term debt that is equal to 15 percent of G.D.P .
But in some countries where banking systems have grown to international proportions , the debt exceeds G.D.P .
That is true in Switzerland , Belgium , Iceland and Britain .
The note about anti-virus was posted on 21 November A media storm created by a note on the Apple website has proved to be one in a teacup .
The note urged Mac owners to use anti-virus software which commentators saw as a change in strategy for a firm that had regarded itself as virus - proof .
Media outlets and blogs , including the BBC , saw the advice as a response to the growing and changing cyber threat .
But it emerged the advice was old and Apple has since removed it completely saying it was " inaccurate " .
The note appears to have been an update of one that first appeared on the site in mid-2007 .
The advice has now returned to the more familiar Apple mantra .
" The Mac is designed with built - in technologies that provide protection against malicious software and security threats right out of the box , " an Apple spokesman said .
Mac users have been largely free of the security problems that plague Microsoft 's Windows .
Fresh threat Bloggers and journalists ( and I include myself ) hate to be left out when this kind of storm brews up
Rory Cellan- Jones
BBC technology correspondent
Read Rory 's thoughts in full
The support note recommended that Mac owners install two or more of three anti-virus products .
Advice on the site said : " Apple encourages the widespread use of multiple antivirus utilities so that virus programmers have more than one application to circumvent , thus making the whole virus writing process more difficult . "
Apple recommended users try McAfee VirusScan , Symantec Norton Anti-Virus 11 , or Intego VirusBarrier X5 .
The vast majority of malicious programs circulating online are aimed at Microsoft 's Windows , largely because the software is used by so many people .
A handful of viruses have been written that targets Mac OS X , but most have been demonstration versions only and few have had any significant impact on Apple users .
One piece of malware , known as AppleScript .
THT , could take control of a Mac and grab screenshots or keystrokes .
However , in recent months , hi-tech criminals have signalled a change in tactics away from e-mail borne viruses .
Instead , many are infiltrating popular webpages in a bid to infect the machine of any and every visitor .
Many seek to steal valuable information such as login names , passwords or game accounts instead of trying to install themselves on a machine .

Lobbying by the financial industry before and during the financial crisis has come under criticism from consumer groups , members of Congress and President - elect Barack Obama .
“ It ’s ridiculous that the perpetrators of this mess should be the people dictating to Congress how to get out of it , ” says Kathleen Day of the non-profit Center for Responsible Lending .

President - elect Barack Obama ’s choice for White House chief of staff is one of the biggest recipients of Wall Street money in Congress , according to a Washington , D.C. - based “ money - in- politics ” watchdog group .
The Center for Responsive Politics has issued a report highlighting millions of dollars in campaign contributions that Rep. Rahm Emanuel ( D - Ill. ) has raised from individuals working in the hedge fund industry , private equity firms , and large investment firms .
Emanuel has raised more money from individuals and political action committees in securities and investment businesses than from any other industry .
This comes after a presidential campaign that saw Obama frequently criticize Wall Street and blamed lack of government regulations for the economic crisis that hit the country in mid-September .
Emanuel , a former Clinton White House aide , is chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and received much of the credit for the Democrats winning a majority in the House of Representatives in 2006 – the first time in 12 years .
For his own 2006 re-election campaign , where he faced no serious opposition , Emanuel raised $ 1.5 million from the investment industry .
His other sources of contributions came from lawyers , who gave $ 682,900 , while people working in the entertainment industries gave $ 376,100 .

The McCain health - care insurance tax credit may well be one of the most misunderstood proposals of this presidential election .
Barack Obama has been ruthless in his attacks .
But the tax credit is highly progressive and will provide a powerful incentive for people to purchase health insurance .
These features under normal circumstances should endear Democrats to the proposal .

An Oz driver has been fined AU$ 600 for " offensive behaviour , resisting police and disobeying a police direction " after cracking one off into a pasta sauce jar even as coppers attempted to subdue him with batons and capsicum spray following a " slow - speed " car chase through Newcastle , New South Wales .
The drama began when officers spotted Keith Roy Weatherley , 46 , " parked in a no- stopping zone near Nobby 's Beach on October 26 " .
According to the Newcastle Herald , they thought he " might have a weapon " * since he was " doing something with his hands in his lap " .
He was in fact " partially clothed with his genitals in a jar " , a police report explained .
The perp made a dash for it , was pulled , refused to exit the vehicle and four officers were obliged to persuade him from his car .
The law enforcement operatives identified " a 750 mm ** jar around his penis " and said Weatherley gamely insisted on continuing to pleasure himself " between bouts of wrestling " .
A search of Weatherley 's motor uncovered " pornography , a homemade sex aid , women 's stockings and a Jack Russell terrier " .
He pleaded guilty to the aforementioned raft of charges yesterday at Newcastle Local Court .
The role of the Jack Russell in the incident is not noted . ®

Chancellor Jerry Falwell , Jr. kicked off the voter drive by urging students to register locally .
( UWIRE ) --
The commonwealth of Virginia has traditionally been a Republican stronghold -- the last time a Democratic presidential candidate won the state was in 1964 .
But with recent polls showing Sen. John McCain only slightly ahead of Sen. Barack Obama , Virginia remains up for grabs .
And the last two statewide offices -- for governor and U.S. senator -- have been won by Democrats .
Given the close nature of the presidential race , Jerry Falwell , Jr. , chancellor of Liberty University , recently launched an ambitious effort to register all 10,500 eligible student voters at the fundamental Baptist institution in Lynchburg , Virginia .
Falwell kicked off the voter registration drive September 22 , urging students -- including those from out - of - state -- to register locally .
" Liberty students have never been permitted to register locally in the past .
The recent change in election law is giving Liberty University the chance to make history , " Falwell stated in an e-mail addressed to faculty and staff .
" Liberty University 's 11,000 students and 4,000 faculty and staff could cause Liberty to become known as the university that elected a president ! "
Since the announcement of the registration campaign , students have been offered voter registration forms by resident advisers during residence hall meetings and by professors during class .
Jonathan Woods , a junior at Liberty and resident adviser , said he and fellow RAs were instructed to educate their residents about registering to vote during a regular RA meeting .
" That night , in our hall meetings , we had to explain that it 's a good and unique opportunity , " Woods said , " because not too long ago they [ out - of - state students ] were n't able to register in Virginia . "
Liberty sophomore Zach Rowe said Falwell has been pressuring students not only to vote , but also to register to vote in Virginia .
" It 's definitely been pushed to vote , " Rowe said , " especially to vote locally . "
Rowe noted , however , that he still plans to vote in Pennsylvania by absentee ballot .
" Pennsylvania is a swing state , too , " he said .
In addition to the increased availability of voter registration forms , classes will be canceled on Election Day , and buses will be available to shuttle students to the polls .
" It 's a major election -- they really want students to vote , " Liberty freshman Bethany Hernandez said .
" Some teachers are giving extra credit if you register to vote . "
Falwell 's belief that Liberty could impact the outcome of Virginia 's election may seem like wishful thinking , but Virginia 's 2006 U.S. Senate race was decided by slightly less than 10,000 votes .
" The majority of Liberty students want McCain to win , " Woods said .
" If you have a few thousand people voting for one candidate , who were n't [ initially ] voting in Virginia , it could possibly make a difference . "
Ashley Barbera , communications director of the College Republicans National Committee , said college students have the potential to significantly impact the outcome of this election .
" I think you 're going to see young voters and young activists playing a very important and crucial role , " Barbera said , noting that many of the swing states , such as Virginia and Ohio , are home to a number of large universities .
" They 're states where College Republicans federations are really stepping up to the plate , " Barbera said .
Though the College Republicans National Committee is not working specifically with Liberty University 's administration , Barbera said Liberty 's voter registration efforts are consistent with College Republicans ' national mission .
" Virginia is obviously a swing state , and the polls are showing how close that state is on a day - to - day basis , " Barbera said .
" If you could get potentially an extra thousand votes there , that could swing a state and that could determine an election . "
Though Falwell may believe Liberty students can help to secure Virginia for McCain , College Democrats of America President Katie Naranjo is not worried .
" I feel very comfortable that young people will sway the vote in Virginia , " Naranjo said , " and it will be a victory for Senator Obama . "
Naranjo , referencing recent national polls showing Obama ahead by a few percentage points , suggested , " Maybe that 's why Liberty is scared . "
Jared Leopold , communications director for the Democratic Party of Virginia 's Coordinated Campaign , said the Democratic Party of Virginia encourages all efforts to reach out to college students .
" This is a historic election , " Leopold said .
" For many young people this will be the first election they 'll participate in .
We encourage all college students to get registered . "
Though a majority of the students registered at Liberty will be voting for McCain , Leopold is not concerned .
" We 've seen a lot of college students register across the state , " Leopold said .
" We 're confident that a large majority of college students and young people will side with Barack Obama and the democratic ticket . "
Regardless of whether Liberty voters affect the outcome of this election , Hernandez said the voter registration drive might just be the beginning of Liberty University 's political influence .
" It could be a starting point .
Maybe it wo n't change anything this time , but in the future , " she said .
" If the school keeps up the initiative , even just one little change is probably going to affect the future . "
All About U.S. Presidential Election • College Life
Supercomputer maker Cray today announced a new desk - side , low - end , bladed office supercomputer in conjunction with chip partner Intel and software partner Microsoft .
The new CX1 supercomputer is the first product to come to market after Cray tapped Intel as its future strategic chip supplier , dissing long - time chip partner Advanced Micro Devices .
Cray , which has been struggling financially since clustered Linux boxes became the rage in supercomputing a decade ago , is known for creating the fastest vector and parallel supercomputers in the world , and with the CX1 , it is trying to push down into a market where newbies in life sciences , digital rendering , financial services , and other fields are playing around with supers for the first time .
It 's also attempting to lure scientists and researchers with discretionary IT budgets to forget using shared , giant clusters and get their own box and tuck it in behind their desk where no one can see it to run their workloads locally .
The personal supercomputer is not a new idea , but this is the first time that Cray is trying it out in the market .
If you want to cut off the air that Linux breathes , as Microsoft certainly does , one of the choke points where you try to get your Windows tentacles wrapped around is supercomputing , or what people for some reason now call high performance computing .
But to take on Linux in HPC requires a slightly different tack than what worked for Windows in the data center , and it requires something a little more subtle than the cheap software and portability across architectures that made Linux the darling of academic , government , and corporate supercomputing centers in a mere decade , supplanting Unix .
Microsoft 's strategy - one that no supercomputer maker and no X64 chip maker can ignore - is to attack from the bottom , to find those myriad new HPC users who never learned Unix , never learned Linux , and have no desire to .
This strategy is what moved Windows from the desktop to the data center in the 1990s , and it worked so brilliantly that Windows machines account for more than two - thirds of server revenues each quarter and the lion 's share of shipments .
People use the software they are comfortable with , and Linux was an easy transition for Unix shops , just as moving from a Windows desktop to Windows servers is relatively simple .
While technically speaking , the CX1 minisuper is certified to run Red Hat 's Enterprise Linux 5 and can certainly run Novell 's SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 ( which is the preferred Linux on Cray 's high - end , massively parallel Opteron boxes , the XT4 and XT5 , and which has not been certified on the CX1 ) , Red Hat and Novell were not invited to the CX1 launch party , while Burton Smith , now a technical fellow for parallel computing at Microsoft and formerly the chief scientist at Cray and the company that ate it in March 2000 , Tera Computer , as well as Kyril Faenov , general manager of the Windows HPC business at Microsoft , were given great swaths of time during the launch to espouse the virtues of Windows HPC Server 2008 .
You do the math .
Windows HPC
Server 2008 is the latest implementation of the supercomputer - tuned variant of Windows , which includes support for the Message Passing Interface ( MPI ) protocol used to create supercomputer clusters as well as optimizations in Windows to make it better able to squeeze every ounce of performance out of X64 iron .
Microsoft is poised to announce Windows HPC Server 2008 next week in New York at a supercomputing event hosted on Wall Street - provided any of the big banks and trading houses are still there to host the event .
The CX1 minisuper is really a blade chassis with integrated Gigabit Ethernet and InfiniBand switches that can be loaded up with blades for computing , storage , and visualization - the latter being what you and I would call in the old days " being a graphics workstation . "
The blade chassis has eight slots and runs off normal wall power , not the 240 - volt power required for big iron in data centers .
The CC48 blade has a single Xeon socket and lots of memory expansion for memory - intensive HPC workloads , while the CC54 blade has two Xeon slots and a little less memory .
The CV54-01 blade is what is called a visualization node , and it is basically a workstation on a blade , complete with a high - end nVidia graphics card and an optional GPU to boost display capabilities .
The CS54 - 04 blade is a storage blade that takes up two slots and has four 2.5 - inch SAS drives and the CS54 - 08 blade takes up three slots and offers eight drives .
Using the integrated switches in the CX1 , up to three boxes can be lashed together into a cluster , and for those shops who need to add more power to their clusters , they can use external switches to do the job .
A single chassis can house a maximum of 4 TB of disk or - when using the fastest 3.4 GHz quad - core Xeons Intel has delivered - up to 768 gigaflops of computing power in a single chassis .
( That 's eight two - socket blades using quad - core Xeons , for a total of 64 cores ) .
Obviously , three of these CX1s linked up yields 2.3 teraflops - a nice size for a personal super .
Because the CX1 sits in an office environment , the front of the chassis has an optional noise cancellation add - on , which drops the whirring of fan noise down to the point where it is actually legal to put it in an office environment .
The base price of the chassis with bare bones blades and switches is $ 25,000 .
When the machine is fully loaded , the price tag comes to around $ 80,000 or so .
Cray is selling the CX1 boxes online starting today - the first time a Cray machine has been sold online and directly - and expects to have volume shipments revved up by the end of October . ®
‘ THE PARTY OF HERBERT HOOVER ’….
On Wednesday , Dick Cheney met with Senate Republicans and emphasized the importance of keeping the American automotive industry afloat .
“ If we do n’t do this , we will be known as the party of Herbert Hoover forever , ” the vice president said .
The Neo-Hooverite caucus apparently seems willing to wear the label with pride .
Hilzoy noted the developments overnight , but I have to admit , I ’m still struggling to understand how the Senate GOP could have successfully pulled this off .
Let me get this straight : the Bush White House reached a deal with congressional Democrats on a $ 14 billion rescue package , and the compromise passed the House with a bipartisan majority .
Some Senate Republicans not only opposed the measure , but refused to let the chamber vote on the bailout unless a series of unreasonable changes were made .
Democrats , hoping to stave off disaster , went along , and agreed to Republican demands to reduce the United Auto Workers ’ wages and benefits as soon as the UAW ’s current contract expired in 2011 .
The GOP , led in this case by Sens. Corker , Shelby , and DeMint , said that was n’t good enough — autoworker wages had to be cut in 2009 , or else .
The deal fell apart , the Asian markets tumbled , U.S. futures tumbled , and at least one of the Big Three is poised to collapse .
This , for lack of a better word , is madness .
But what I really do n’t understand is why the rest of the Republican caucus in the Senate went along with this .
Corker , Shelby , and DeMint are three far - right lawmakers from the Deep South , but they were only able to pull this off last night because there were n’t enough reasonable Republicans left .
John Judis noted :
If you look at the history of the Great Depression , what tipped that event from a global recession to depression was precisely a series of dumb , craven — or in Keynes ’ word , “ feather - brained ” — moves by politicians blinded by ideology or by narrow self - interest .
An interest rate hike here , a balanced budget there , a spending reduction or two , and we went from ten to twenty percent unemployment .
Do n’t imagine for a moment that the failure to bailout the auto companies is n’t one of those feather - brained moves .
Put it this way .
What we have learned from the economics of the Great Depression is that in order to end the spiral of unemployment , government has to throw money at companies and consumers .
It should be trying to raise wages , not lower them .
The Wall Street bailout was a fiasco , but it was probably better than nothing .
And the auto bailout was considerably better thought - out .
Now there is a good prospect that two of the Big Three will fail , jeopardizing , perhaps , as many as a million jobs .
That ’s exactly the kind of thing that Americans should not be doing .
But do n’t tell that to those great patriots Corker , DeMint , or Shelby .
They know better .
Harry Reid worked very hard — indeed , he might have been willing to compromise too much — to pull this together , but he noted last night , “ By rejecting every good - faith bipartisan compromise — including those from the White House and Senator Bob Corker — it is now abundantly clear that Republicans have no interest in keeping the Big Three from collapsing ….
Republicans may think that rejecting this legislation sent a message to the auto industry .
Instead , they sent a message to every single American that they are more interested in settling scores than solving problems . ”
The party of Herbert Hoover , indeed .
PRINCETON , NJ -- Barack Obama leads John McCain in Gallup Poll Daily tracking interviewing conducted Wednesday through Friday by an identical 52 % to 42 % margin among both traditional likely voters and expanded likely voters .
Obama leads by a similar 52 % to 41 % margin among all registered voters .
This is the first time since Gallup began estimating likely voters in early October that there is no difference between Gallup 's two likely voter models .
Obama 's lead of 52 % to 42 % using Gallup 's traditional estimate of likely voting criteria takes into account past voting as well as current intentions .
Obama 's identical lead using the expanded model takes into account only current voting intentions .
Both of these likely voter estimates in turn are almost identical to Gallup 's 52 % to 41 % registered voter estimate .
In a general sense , the candidate preferences of the broad group of all registered voters have been remarkably steady for over two weeks now , showing little fluctuation despite both candidates ' intense campaigning , the huge amount of news coverage of the election , and high levels of voter attention to the election .
Obama 's percent of the vote among registered voters has varied only between 50 - 52 % for the last 16 days , and McCain 's has varied only between 41 - 43 % .
Gallup 's estimates of likely voters show more variation ; these calculations take into account not only candidate preferences , but also the individual respondent 's interest in the election , self - reports of intention to vote , and for the traditional model , reports of past voting history and knowledge of voting procedures .
The average Obama lead over McCain among traditional likely voters since Oct. 6 has been five points , but that lead has expanded over the last several day 's reports , and Obama 's current 52 - 42 % lead among this group is the largest to date .
Gallup has increased its estimate of turnout in the election slightly to 64 % ( from the previous 60 % ) , based on internal calculations which point toward the higher turnout number , and this 64 % estimate is reflected in the traditional likely voter calculations .
Gallup 's interviewing conducted Wednesday through Friday shows that 27 % of registered voters who plan to vote have already voted .
The trend in early voting has trended consistently upward on a day to day basis , moving from 7 % of registered voters , who had already voted during the period of Oct. 17 - 19 , to the current estimate of 27 % .
Another 8 % of registered voters still indicate that they plan on voting before Election Day itself .
The vote choices of these early voters -- all of whom are included in the likely voter pool since they are definite voters -- skew more toward Barack Obama than the sample average .
Thus , more and more of these Obama - oriented voters ' choices are being " locked in " to the likely voter pool through early voting , benefiting Obama .

Survey Methods
For the Gallup Poll Daily tracking survey , Gallup is interviewing no fewer than 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The general - election results are based on combined data from Oct. 29 - 31 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 2,847 registered voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
Results based on " traditional " likely voters ( based on the model taking into account current voting intention and past voting behavior ) include interviews with 2,516 voters , and assume a turnout of 64 % of national adults .
The likely voter sample is weighted to match this turnout assumption , so the weighted sample size is 1,947 .
The associated maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
For results based on the sample of 2,480 " expanded " likely voters ( based on the model taking into account current voting intention only ) , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
The expanded likely voter model does not make any assumptions about turnout level .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on landline telephones ( for respondents with a landline telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
Ah , Gotham , the vernacular , everyman sans serif .
It ’s likely to be the Helvetica of 2007 – 08 , or better yet , “ The New Helvetica . ”
It ’s forms are sturdy , and its character distinct ( and I daresay “ American , ” much like how Gill Sans is “ English ” or a Fraktur is “ German . ” )
These alternatives , though , are available when you want something different .
Alternatives
Proxima Nova
Proxima Nova , designed by Mark Simonson , is named for its close proximity to grotesque ( ie. News Gothic , ) geometric sans ( ie. Futura ) and neo-grotesque ( ie. Helvetica . )
It shares the construction , details and stroke constrast of these categories , respectively .
Proxima also takes inspiration from the Federal Highway fonts , and the fact that it was designed ( and redesigned , hence the Nova addition ) over the course of 27 years gives Proxima Nova an American vernacular quality that is reminiscent of Gotham , only more refined .
Bryant
Bryant , by Process Type Foundry .
Bryant is based off the Wrico Lettering Set , a set of pens , rulers and plastic templates that one can trace for use in drafting .
Think of Bryant as a more serious version of Gotham Rounded .
Looking for something more economical ?
The Bryant Condensed family has the width of a grotesque , and would make a fine contemporary substitute for fonts like Benton Sans .
Stag Sans
Stag Sans , by Christian Schwartz .
Stag Sans is Gotham ’s humanist cousin , with higher x -height and softer , more blunt edges .
The capitals are humanist and has higher contrasts , but its lowercase are more akin to Gotham , and thus can be used as an alternative .
Scala
Sans came into wide use in the 90’s , partly because it has a construction reminiscent of a roman typeface , and calligraphic influence ( ie. two - story ‘ a ’ and ‘ g , ’ having true italics instead of sloped roman . )
Besides being one of the first fonts in the second “ wave ” of Humanist sans designs ( the first wave is typified by Gill Sans , the second by Syntax and Frutiger , and the third by Scala Sans and Myriad . )
The fourth wave is a bigger one that lasts until today .
With such wealth of offerings , I ’ll present fonts from new designers that you may not have heard of before .
Alternatives
Xtra Sans
Xtra sans , by Jarno Lukkarila .
This font combines the sturdiness and compactness of a grotesk ( the same category that I mentioned before ) with strong broad - nib pen strokes .
Use Xtra sans if you want to convey a classical yet contemporary quality to your design .
At smaller sizes , the generous counterspace makes this font readable .
At bigger sizes , its calligraphic details gives it enough character to stand on its own .
Fresco sans
Fresco sans , by Fred Smeijers .
This family , like Scala sans , was designed to be used alongside their serif counterparts ( Fresco and Scala , respectively , ) and can be more versatile than sans fonts that are designed by itself .
Using the sans and serif font side by side guarantees headline and body type that aligns well with each other , and can greatly reduce your font matching headache .
Fedra Sans
Fedra sans , by Typotheque .
Fedra sans is one part of a superfamily of fonts that include not only a serif family with lower and higher contrast ( for low - resolution and high - resolution printing , respectively ) , but also a sans display and serif display version ( for use in larger sizes , ) Arabic , monospace and phonetic .
Use Fedra sans when your design requires a varying application of font , from the biggest navigational signage to that footnote in the annual report .
Futura
Futura can look good , but is also tricky to use well ( tip : I like it set bold and loosely kerned . )
These alternatives may not necessarily have a lot of characters , but are probably more adaptable to use in more situations .
Alternatives
Avenir
Avenir , designed by Adrian Frutiger , who proclaimed that “ Avenir is the better Futura ” (!)
This , in my opinion , is true because it maintains Futura ’s geometric construction , normalizes its quirks and expands its width offering .
For instance , the pointed ‘ A ’ and single - story ‘ a ’ that is the hallmark of Futura are gone , but its single story ‘ g ’ and higher ascender / descender are retained .
Use Avenir when your job calls for a more versatile , toned - down geometric sans .
Neutraface
Neutraface , by House Industries .
Neutraface , which comes in display and text flavors , was inspired by signage with linear , geometric construction found on commercial buildings designed by Richard Neutra .
This face , along with Avenir , gain prominence as a Futura alternative from the early 2000’s .
Hint :
If Neutra is too quirky for you ( the low cross - bar on “ A , ” for example , is not to everyone ’s taste , ) use Neutra 2 , its “ normalized ” cousin .
Richmond
Richmond , by Jim Parkinson .
I see this face as Parkinson ’s British and American answer to European Futura .
It shares the same distinctiveness that Futura has , only with with a “ warmer ” geometry construction ( like the London Underground type . )
Use Richmond when you want more character in your design .
Much like its humanist or geometric sans counterparts , square sans serifs took root in the mid 20th century with Eurostile .
But today , fonts like Klavika and Neo Sans came into prominence with the rise of Web 2.0 companies , not surprisingly , because it screams sleek , clean and high tech , thanks to its narrow width , relatively high x -height and squarish letterforms .
Here are alternatives that you could use : some more humanist , some more grotesque , and others geometric — but all distinct .
Alternatives
Relato Sans
Relato sans , by Ricardo Santos Eduardo Manso .
I originally meant to categorize this font as an alternative to Scala sans above .
But Relato ’s italic , though having much calligraphy influence , is still somewhat rigid — not unlike Xtra sans but with more exaggerations — thus making Relato sans an appropriate substitute for both a humanist face like Scala , or a “ techie ” sans like Klavika — something that very few fonts could do .
Helsinki
Helsinki , by Ludwig Übele , is an alternative that ’s sleek and crisp , but retains the width and quality of a grotesque .
The design is based off Finnish highway typeface .
Purista
Purista , by Suitcase Type Foundry , is yet another approach to this category .
It takes the literal definition of a proper square sans ( like Eurostile ) and gives this model even more geometric quality , as well as weight levels , to make it versatile .
Notable Square Sans Alternatives
Caput , by Fontfarm
Sophie , by Fontsmith – more feminine
Stalemate , designed by Stefan Hattenbach
Reykjavik , by PSY / OPS
Up next : Regional Characteristics of Typefaces , From French , English to Catalan ( And Everything Inbetween )
But for now , I hope that you learn a thing or two about fonts , font classifications and foundries that designed them .
What typeface would you like to see the alternative of ?
I ’ll do my best to answer .

Leon Trotsky
On the Suppressed
Testament of Lenin
( December 1932 )
The full text of Lenin ’s testament was first published in English in the New York Times of October 18 , 1926 .
Subsequently it was included by the publishers ( Harcourt Brace and Co. , 1928 ) as a supplement to The Real Situation in Russia by Leon Trotsky .
In 1935 Pioneer Publishers printed the full text in the pamphlet The Suppressed Testament of Lenin , together with Leon Trotsky ’s article On Lenin ’s Testament , which had first appeared in the July and August , 1934 , issues of New International .
The pamphlet has long been out of print .
Foreword
The document later known as Lenin ’s Testament was , as Trotsky says in his biography of Stalin , “ Lenin ’s last advice on how to organize the party leadership . ”
A year before his death Lenin , with his unerring political insight , saw in Stalin ’s policies the beginnings of what Lenin himself called “ bureaucratism not only in the Soviet institutions but also in the party . ”
It was against this danger that he dictated a confidential letter giving his estimate of the leaders in the Central Committee and , ten days later , added a postscript in which he proposed to remove Stalin from his post as General Secretary of the party .
A detailed account of the political background and the circumstances surrounding Lenin ’s testament is given by Leon Trotsky in his article On Lenin ’s Testament – written ten years later in Turkey , where Trotsky had been driven into exile by Stalin .
The authenticity of the testament is unquestioned .
After Lenin ’s death the document became known to so many party leaders that – although it was of course suppressed – to deny its existence would have been impossible .
As late as 1927 Stalin himself , in the International Press Correspondence of November 17 , 1927 , openly accepted the authenticity of Lenin ’s testament , writing about it as follows :
It is said that in the Testament in question Lenin suggested to the party Congress that it should deliberate on the question of replacing Stalin and appointing another comrade in his place as General Secretary of the party .
This is perfectly true .
It was not long , however , before the Stalinists , even in face of the incontrovertible evidence and their own admissions , began to deny the very existence of such a document .
They have of course expunged from their official literature every reference to it .
But their machine of repression and falsification has not been able to bury this last advice of Lenin to the party .
Trotsky wrote about the last period of Lenin ’s life and the origins of the “ legend of Trotskyism ” on a number of other occasions .
The reader is referred especially to My Life , chapters 28 and 38 - 40 ; and the Letter to the Bureau of Party History in The Stalin School of Falsification .
The Testament of Lenin
By the stability of the Central Committee , of which I spoke before , I mean measures to prevent a split , so far as such measures can be taken .
For , of course , the White Guard in Russkaya Mysl ( I think it was S.E. Oldenburg ) was right when , in the first place , in his play against Soviet Russia he banked on the hope of a split in our party , and when , in the second place , he banked for that split on serious disagreements in our party .
Our party rests upon two classes , and for that reason its instability is possible , and if there cannot exist an agreement between those classes its fall is inevitable .
In such an event it would be useless to take any measures or in general to discuss the stability of our Central Committee .
In such an event no measures would prove capable of preventing a split .
But I trust that is too remote a future , and too improbable an event , to talk about .
I have in mind stability as a guarantee against a split in the near future , and I intend to examine here a series of considerations of a purely personal character .
I think that the fundamental factor in the matter of stability – from this point of view – is such members of the Central Committee as Stalin and Trotsky .
The relation between them constitutes , in my opinion , a big half of the danger of that split , which might be avoided , and the avoidance of which might be promoted , in my opinion , by raising the number of members of the Central Committee to fifty or one hundred .
Comrade Stalin , having become General Secretary , has concentrated an enormous power in his hands ; and I am not sure that he always knows how to use that power with sufficient caution .
On the other hand , Comrade Trotsky , as was proved by his struggle against the Central Committee in connection with the question of the People ’s Commissariat of Ways and Communications , is distinguished not only by his exceptional abilities – personally he is , to be sure , the most able man in the present Central Committee – but also by his too far - reaching self - confidence and a disposition to be too much attracted by the purely administrative side of affairs .
These two qualities of the two most able leaders of the present Central Committee might , quite innocently , lead to a split ; if our party does not take measures to prevent it , a split might arise unexpectedly .
I will not further characterize the other members of the Central Committee as to their personal qualities .
I will only remind you that the October episode of Zinoviev and Kamenev was not , of course , accidental , but that it ought as little to be used against them personally as the non-Bolshevism of Trotsky .
Of the younger members of the Central Committee , I want to say a few words about Bukharin and Pyatakov .
They are , in my opinion , the most able forces ( among the youngest ) and in regard to them it is necessary to bear in mind the following : Bukharin is not only the most valuable and biggest theoretician of the party , but also may legitimately be considered the favorite of the whole party ; but his theoretical views can only with the very greatest doubt be regarded as fully Marxist , for there is something scholastic in him ( he never has learned , and I think never has fully understood , the dialectic ) .
And then Pyatakov – a man undoubtedly distinguished in will and ability , but too much given over to administration and the administrative side of things to be relied on in a serious political question .
Of course , both these remarks are made by me merely with a view to the present time , or supposing that these two able and loyal workers may not find an occasion to supplement their knowledge and correct their one - sidedness .
Postscript : Stalin is too rude , and this fault , entirely supportable in relations among us Communists , becomes insupportable in the office of General Secretary .
Therefore , I propose to the comrades to find a way to remove Stalin from that position and appoint to it another man who in all respects differs from Stalin only in superiority – namely , more patient , more loyal , more polite and more attentive to comrades , less capricious , etc .
This circumstance may seem an insignificant trifle , but I think that from the point of view of preventing a split and from the point of view of the relation between Stalin and Trotsky which I discussed above , it is not a trifle , or it is such a trifle as may acquire a decisive significance .
On Lenin ’s Testament
By LEON TROTSKY
The postwar epoch has brought into wide currency the psychological biography , the masters of which art often pull their subject up out of society by the roots .
The fundamental driving force of history is presented as the abstraction , personality .
The behavior of the “ political animal , ” as Aristotle brilliantly defined mankind , is resolved into personal passions and instincts .
The that personality is abstract may seem absurd .
Are not the super - personal forces of history really the abstract things ?
And what can be more concrete than a living man ?
However , we insist upon our statement .
If you remove from a personality , even the most richly endowed , the content which is introduced into it by the milieu , the nation , the epoch , the class , the group , the family , there remains an empty automaton , a psyche - physical robot , an object of natural , but not of social or “ humane , ” science .
The causes of this abandonment of history and society must , as always , be sought in history and society .
Two decades of wars , revolutions and crises have given a bad shake - up to that sovereign , human personality .
To have weight in the scales of contemporary history a thing must be measured in millions .
For this , the offended personality seeks revenge .
Unable to cope with society on the rampage , it turns its back upon society .
Unable to explain itself by means of historic processes , it tries to explain history from within itself .
Thus the Indian philosophers built universal systems by contemplating their own navels .
The School of Pure Psychology
The influence of Freud upon the new biographical school is undeniable , but superficial .
In essence these parlor psychologists are inclining to a belletristic irresponsibility .
They employ not so much the method as the terminology of Freud , and not so much for analysis as for literary adornment .
In his recent work Emil Ludwig , the most popular representative of this genre , has taken a new step along the chosen path : he has replaced the study of the hero ’s life and activity with dialogue .
Behind the answers of the statesman to questions put to him , behind his intonations and grimaces , the writer discovers his real motives .
Conversation becomes almost a confession .
In its technique Ludwig ’s new approach to the hero suggests Freud ’s approach to his patient : it is a matter of bringing the personality to the surface with its own cooperation .
But with all this external similarity , how different it is in essence !
The fruitfulness of Freud ’s work is attained at the price of a heroic break with all kinds of conventions .
The great psychoanalyst is ruthless .
At work he is like a surgeon , almost like a butcher with rolled - up sleeves .
Anything you want , but there is not one hundredth of one percent of diplomacy in his technique .
Freud bothers least of all about the prestige of his patient , or about considerations of goad form , or any other kind of false note or frill .
And it is for this reason that he can carry on his dialogue only face - to - face , without secretary or stenographer , behind padded doors .
Not so Ludwig .
He enters into a conversation with Mussolini , or with Stalin , in order to present the world with an authentic portrait of their souls .
Yet the whole conversation follows a program previously agreed upon .
Every word is taken down by a stenographer .
The eminent patient knows quite well what can be useful to him in this process and what harmful .
The writer is sufficiently experienced to distinguish rhetorical tricks , and sufficiently polite not to notice them .
The dialogue developing under these circumstances , if it does indeed resemble a confession , resembles one put on for the talking pictures .
Emil Ludwig has every reason to declare : “ I understand nothing of politics . ”
This is supposed to mean : “ I stand above politics . ”
In reality it is a mere formula of personal neutrality – or to borrow from Freud , it is that “ mental censor ” which makes easier for the psychologist his political function .
In the same way diplomatists do not interfere with the inner life of the country to whose government they are accredited , but this does not prevent them on occasion from supporting plots and financing acts of terrorism .
One and the same person in different conditions develops different sides of his policy .
How many Aristotles are herding swine , and how many swineherds wear a crown on their heads !
But Ludwig can lightly resolve even the contradiction between Bolshevism and Fascism into a mere matter of individual psychology .
Even the most penetrating psychologist could not with impunity adopt such a tendentious “ neutrality . ”
Casting loose from the social conditioning of human consciousness , Ludwig enters into a realm of mere subjective caprice .
The “ soul ” has not three dimensions , and it therefore lacks the refractory quality common to all other substances .
The writer loses his taste for the study of facts and documents .
What is the use of these colorless evidences when they can be replaced with bright guesses ?
In his work on Stalin , as in his book about Mussolini , Ludwig remains “ outside politics . ”
This does not in the least prevent his works from becoming a political weapon .
Whose weapon ?
In the one case Mussolini ’s , in the other that of Stalin and his group .
Nature abhors a vacuum .
If Ludwig does not occupy himself with politics , this is not saying that politics does not occupy itself with Ludwig .
Upon the publication of my autobiography some three years ago , the official Soviet historian , Pokrovsky , now dead , wrote : “ We must answer this book immediately , put our young scholars to work refuting all that can be refuted , etc . ”
But it is a striking fact that no one , absolutely no one , responded .
Nothing was analyzed , nothing was refuted .
There was nothing to refute , and nobody could be found capable of writing a book which would find readers .
A frontal attack proving impossible , it became necessary to resort to a flank movement .
Ludwig , of course , is not a historian of the Stalin school .
He is an independent psychological portraitist .
But a writer foreign to all politics may prove the most convenient means for putting into circulation ideas which can find no other support but a popular name .
Let us see how this works out in actual fact .
“ Six Words ”
Citing the testimony of Karl Radek , Emil Ludwig borrows from him the following episode :
After the death of Lenin we sat together , nineteen members of the Central Committee , tensely waiting to learn what our lost leader would say to us from his grave .
Lenin ’s widow gave us his letter .
Stalin read it .
No one stirred during the reading .
When it came to Trotsky the words occurred : “ His non-Bolshevik past is not accidental . ”
At that point Trotsky interrupted the reading and asked : “ What does it say there ? ”
The sentence was repeated .
Those were the only words spoken in that solemn moment .
And then in the character of analyst , and not narrator , Ludwig makes the following remark on his own account :
A terrible moment , when Trotsky ’s heart must have stopped beating ; this phrase of six words essentially determined the course of his life .
How simple it seems to find a key to the riddles of history !
These unctuous lines of Ludwig would doubtless have uncovered to me myself the very secret of my destiny if ... if this Radek - Ludwig story did not happen to be false from beginning to end , false in small things and great , in what matters and in what matters not .
To begin with , the testament was written by Lenin not two years before his death as our author confirms , but one year .
It was dated January 4 , 1923 ; Lenin died on January 21 , 1924 .
His political life had broken off completely , in March 1923 .
Ludwig speaks as though the testament had never been published in full .
As a matter of fact it has been reproduced dozens of times in all the languages of the world press .
The first official reading of the testament in the Kremlin occurred , not at a session of the Central Committee , as Ludwig writes , but in the Council of Elders at the Thirteenth Congress of the party on May 22 , 1924 .
It was not Stalin who read the testament , but Kamenev in his then position as permanent president of the central party bodies .
And finally – most important – I did not interrupt the reading with an emotional exclamation , because of the absence of any motive whatever for such an act .
Those words which Ludwig wrote down at the dictation of Radek are not in the text of the testament .
They are an outright invention .
Difficult as it may be to believe , this is the fact .
If Ludwig were not so careless about the factual basis of his psychological patterns , he might without difficulty have got possession of an exact text of the testament , established the necessary facts and dates , and thus avoided those wretched mistakes with which his work about the Kremlin and the Bolsheviks is unfortunately brimful .
The so - called testament was written at two periods , separated by an interval of ten days : December 25 , 1922 and January 4 , 1923 .
At first only two persons knew of the document : the stenographer , M. Volodicheva , who wrote it from dictation , and Lenin ’s wife , N. Krupskaya .
As long as there remained a glimmer of hope for Lenin ’s recovery , Krupskaya left the document under lock and key .
After Lenin ’s death , not long before the Thirteenth Congress , she handed the testament to the Secretariat of the Central Committee , in order that through the party Congress it should be brought to the attention of the party for whom it was destined .
At that time the party apparatus was semi-officially in the hands of the troika ( Zinoviev , Kamenev , Stalin ) – as a matter of fact , already in the hands of Stalin .
The troika decisively expressed themselves against reading the testament at the Congress – the motive not at all difficult to understand .
Krupskaya insisted upon her wish .
At this stage the dispute was going on behind the scenes .
The question was transferred to a meeting of the Elders at the Congress – that is , the leaders of the provincial delegations .
It was here that the oppositional members of the Central Committee first learned about the testament , I among them .
After a decision had been adopted that nobody should make notes , Kamenev began to read the text aloud .
The mood of the listeners was indeed tense in the highest degree .
But so far as I can restore the picture from memory , I should say that those who already knew the contents of the document were incomparably the most anxious .
The troika introduced , through one of its henchmen , a resolution previously agreed upon with the provincial leaders : the document should be read to each delegation separately in executive session ; no one should dare to make notes ; at the plenary session the testament must not be referred to .
With the gentle insistence characteristic of her , Krupskaya argued that this was a direct violation of the will of Lenin , to whom you could not deny the right to bring his last advice to the attention of the party .
But the members of the Council of Elders , bound by factional discipline , remained obdurate ; the resolution of the troika was adopted by an overwhelming majority .
In order to grasp the significance of those mystical and mythical “ six words ” which are supposed to have decided my fate , it is necessary to recall certain preceding and accompanying circumstances .
Already in the period of sharp disputes on the subject of the October Revolution certain “ old Bolsheviks ” from the Right Wing had more than once pointed out with vexation that Trotsky after all had not formerly been a Bolshevik .
Lenin always stood up against these voices .
Trotsky long ago understood that a union with the Mensheviks was impossible , he said , for example , on November 14 , 1917 – “ and since then there has been no better Bolshevik . ”
On Lenin ’s lips those words meant something .
Two years later , while explaining in a letter to the foreign Communists the conditions under which Bolshevism had developed , how there had been disagreements arid splits , Lenin pointed out that “ at the decisive moment , at the moment when it seized the power and created the Soviet Republic , Bolshevism was united and drew to itself all the best elements in the currents of socialist thought that were nearest to it . ”
No current closer to Bolshevism than that which I represented up to 1917 existed either in Russia or the West .
My union with Lenin had been predetermined by the logic of ideas and the logic of events .
At the decisive moment Bolshevism drew into its ranks “ all the best elements ” in the tendencies “ that were nearest to it . ”
Such was Lenin ’s appraisal of the situation .
I have do reason to dispute him .
At the time of our two months ’ argument on the trade union question ( winter of 1920 - 21 ) , Stalin and Zinoviev had again attempted to put into circulation references to the non-Bolshevik past of Trotsky .
In answer to this , the less restrained leaders of the opposite camp had reminded Zinoviev of his conduct during the period of the October insurrection .
Thinking over from all sides on his deathbed how relations would crystallize in the party without him , Lenin could not but foresee that Stalin and Zinoviev would try to use my non-Bolshevik past in order to mobilize the old Bolsheviks against me .
The testament tries , incidentally , to forestall this danger , too .
Here is what it says immediately after its characterization of Stalin and Trotsky :
I will not further characterize the other members of the Central Committee as to their personal qualities .
I will only remind you that the October episode of Zinoviev and Kamenev was not , of course , accidental , but that it ought as little to be used against them personally as the non-Bolshevism of Trotsky .
This remark that the October episode “ was not accidental ” pursues a perfectly definite goal : to warn the party that in critical circumstances Zinoviev and Kamenev may again reveal their lack of firmness .
This warning stands , however , in no relation with the remark about Trotsky .
In regard to him it is merely recommended not to use his non-Bolshevik past as an argument ad hominem .
I therefore had no motive for putting the question which Radek attributes to me .
Ludwig ’s guess that my heart “ stopped beating ” also falls to the ground .
Least of all did the testament set out to make a guiding role in the party work difficult for me .
As we shall see below , it pursued an exactly opposite aim .
“ The Mutual Relations of Stalin and Trotsky ”
The central position in the testament , which fills two typewritten pages , is devoted to a characterization of the mutual relations of Stalin and Trotsky , “ the two most able leaders of the present Central Committee . ”
Having remarked upon the “ exceptional abilities ” of Trotsky ( “ the most able man in the present Central Committee ” )
Lenin immediately points out his adverse traits : “ far - reaching self - confidence ” and “ a disposition to be too much attracted by the purely administrative side of affairs . ”
However serious the faults indicated may be in themselves , they do not – I remark in passing – bear any relation to “ underestimating the peasants ” or “ lacking faith in the inner forces of the revolution ” or any other of the inventions of the epigones in recent years .
On the other side Lenin writes :
Stalin , having become General Secretary , has concentrated an enormous power in his hands ; and I am not sure that he always knows how to use this power with sufficient caution .
It is not a question here of the political influence of Stalin , which at that period was insignificant , but of the administrative power which he had concentrated in his hands , “ having become General Secretary . ”
This is a very exact and carefully weighed formula ; we shall return to it later .
The testament insists upon an increase of the number of members of the Central Committee to fifty , even to one hundred , in order that with this compact pressure it may restrain the centrifugal tendencies in the Political Bureau .
This organization proposal has still the appearance of a neutral guarantee against personal conflicts .
But only ten days later it seemed to Lenin inadequate , and he added a supplementary proposal which also gave to the whole document its final physiognomy :
... I propose to the comrades to find a way to remove Stalin from that position and appoint to it another man who in all other respects [ 1 ] differs from Stalin only in superiority – namely ; more patient , more loyal , more polite and more attentive to comrades , less capricious , etc .
During the days when the testament was dictated , Lenin was still trying to give to his critical appraisal of Stalin as restrained an expression as possible .
In the coming weeks his tone would become sharper and sharper right up to the last hour when his voice ceased forever .
But even in the testament enough is said to motivate the demand for a change of General Secretary : along with rudeness and capriciousness , Stalin is accused of lack of loyalty .
At this point the characterization becomes a heavy indictment .
As will appear later , the testament could not have been a surprise to Stalin .
But this did not soften the blow .
Upon his first acquaintance with the document , in the Secretariat , in the circle of his closest associates , Stalin let fly a phrase which gave quite unconcealed expression to his real feelings toward the author of the testament .
The conditions under which this phrase spread to wide circles , and above all the inimitable quality of the reaction itself , is in my eyes an unqualified guarantee of the authenticity of the episode .
Unfortunately this winged phrase cannot be quoted in print .
The concluding sentence of the testament shows unequivocally on which side , in Lenin ’s opinion , the danger lay .
To remove Stalin – just him and him only – meant to cut him off from the apparatus , to withdraw from him the possibility of pressing on the long arm of the lever , to deprive him of all that power which he had concentrated in his hands in this office .
Who , then , should be named General Secretary ?
Someone who , having the positive qualities of Stalin , should be more patient , more loyal , less capricious .
This was the phrase which struck home most sharply to Stalin .
Lenin obviously did not consider him irreplaceable , since he proposed that we seek a more suitable person for his post .
In tendering his resignation , as a matter of form , the General Secretary capriciously kept repeating : “ Well , I really am rude ...
Ilyich suggested that you find another who would differ from me only in greater politeness .
Well , try to find him . ”
“ Never mind , ” answered the voice of one of Stalin ’s then friends .
“ We are not afraid of rudeness .
Our whole party is rude , proletarian . ”
A drawing - room conception of politeness is here indirectly attributed to Lenin .
As to the accusation of inadequate loyalty , neither Stalin nor his friends had a word to say .
It is perhaps not without interest that the supporting voice came from A.P. Smirnov , then People ’s Commissar of Agriculture , but now under the ban as a Right Oppositionist .
Politics knows no gratitude .
Radek , who was then still a member of the Central Committee , sat beside me during the reading of the testament .
Yielding with abandon to the influence of the moment and lacking inner discipline , Radek took instant fire from the testament and leaned to me with the words , “ Now they wo n’t dare go against you . ”
I answered him , “ On the contrary , they will have to go the limit , and moreover as quickly as possible . ”
The very next days of that Thirteenth Congress demonstrated that my judgment was the more sober .
The troika were compelled to forestall the possible effect of the testament by placing the party as soon as possible before a fait accompli .
The very reading of the document to the local delegations with “ outsiders ” not admitted , was converted into a downright struggle against me .
The leaders of the delegations in their reading would swallow some words , emphasize others , and offer commentaries to the effect that the letter had been written by a man seriously ill and under the influence of trickery and intrigue .
The machine was already in complete control .
The mere fact that the troika was able to transgress the will of Lenin , refusing to read his letter at the Congress , sufficiently characterizes the composition of the Congress and its atmosphere .
The testament did not weaken or put a stop to the inner struggle , but on the contrary lent it a disastrous tempo .
Lenin ’s Attitude Toward Stalin
Politics is persistent .
It can press into its service even those who demonstratively turn their backs to it .
Ludwig writes : “ Stalin followed Lenin fervently up to his death . ”
If this phrase expressed merely the mighty influence of Lenin upon his pupils , including Stalin , there could be no argument .
But Ludwig means something more .
He wants to suggest an exceptional closeness to the teacher of this particular pupil .
As an especially precious testimony Ludwig cites upon this point the words of Stalin himself : “ I am only a pupil of Lenin , and my aim is to be his worthy pupil . ”
It is too bad when a professional psychologist operates uncritically with a trite phrase , the conventional modesty of which contains not one atom of intimate content .
Ludwig becomes here a mere transmitter of the official legend manufactured during these recent years .
I doubt if he has the remotest idea of the contradictions into which his indifference to facts has brought him .
If Stalin actually was following Lenin up to his death , how then explain the fact that the last document dictated by Lenin , on the eve of his second stroke , was a curt letter to Stalin , a few lines in all , breaking off all personal and comradely relations ?
This single event of its kind in the life of Lenin , a sharp break with one of his close associates , must have had very serious psychological causes , and would be , to say the least , incomprehensible in relation to a pupil who “ fervently ” followed his teacher up to the end .
Yet we hear not a word about this from Ludwig .
When Lenin ’s letter breaking with Stalin became widely known among the leaders of the party , the troika having by that time fallen to pieces , Stalin and his close friends found no other way out but to revive that same old story about the incompetent condition of Lenin .
As a matter of fact the testament , as also the letter breaking off relations , was written in those months ( December 1922 to the beginning of March 1923 ) during which Lenin in a series of programmatic articles gave the party the most mature fruits of his thinking .
That break with Stalin did not drop out of a clear sky .
It flowed from a long series of preceding conflicts , upon matters of principle and upon practical matters alike , and it sets forth the whole bitterness of these conflicts in a tragic light .
Lenin undoubtedly valued highly certain of Stalin ’s traits : his firmness of character , tenacity , stubbornness , even ruthlessness and craftiness – qualities necessary in a war and consequently in its general staff .
But Lenin was far from thinking that these gifts , even on an extraordinary scale , were sufficient for the leadership of the party and the state .
Lenin saw in Stalin a revolutionist , but not a statesman in the grand style .
Theory had too high an importance for Lenin in a political struggle .
Nobody considered Stalin a theoretician , and he himself up to 1924 never made any pretense to this vocation .
On the contrary , his weak theoretical grounding was too well known in a small circle .
Stalin is not acquainted with the West ; he does not know any foreign language .
He was never brought into the discussion of problems of the international workers ’ movement .
And finally Stalin was not – this is less important , but not without significance – either a writer or an orator in the strict sense of the word .
His articles , in spite of all the author ’s caution , are loaded not only with theoretical blunders and naivetes , but also with crude sins against the Russian language .
In the eyes of Lenin , Stalin ’s value was wholly in the sphere of party administration and machine maneuvering .
But even here Lenin made substantial reservations , and these increased during the last period .
Lenin despised idealistic moralizings .
But this did not prevent him from being a rigorist of revolutionary morals – of those rules of conduct , that is , which he considered necessary for the success of the revolution and the creation of the new society .
In Lenin ’s rigorism , which flowed freely and naturally from his character , there was not a drop of pedantry or bigotry or stiffness .
He knew people too well and took them as they were .
He would combine the faults of some with the virtues of others , and sometimes also with their faults , and never cease to watch keenly what came of it .
He knew also that times change , and we with them .
The party had risen with one jump from the underground to the height of power .
This created for each of the old revolutionists a startlingly sharp change in personal situation and in relations with others .
What Lenin discovered in Stalin under these new conditions he cautiously but clearly remarked in his testament : a lack of loyalty and an inclination to the abuse of power .
Ludwig missed these hints .
It is in them , however , that one can find the key to the relations between Lenin and Stalin in the last period .
Lenin was not only a theoretician and technician of the revolutionary dictatorship , but also a vigilant guardian of its moral foundations .
Every hint at the use of power for personal interests kindled threatening fires in his eyes .
“ How is that any better than bourgeois parliamentarism ? ” he would ask , to express more effectively his choking indignation .
And he would not infrequently add on the subject of parliamentarism one of his rich definitions .
Stalin meanwhile was more and more broadly and indiscriminately using the possibilities of the revolutionary dictatorship for the recruiting of people personally obligated and devoted to him .
In his position as General Secretary he became the dispenser of favor and fortune .
Here the foundation was laid for an inevitable conflict .
Lenin gradually lost his moral trust in Stalin .
If you understand that basic fact , then all the particular episodes of the last period take their places accordingly , and give a real and not a false picture of the attitude of Lenin to Stalin .
Sverdlov and Stalin as Types of Organizers
In order to accord the testament its proper place in the development of the party , it is here necessary to make a digression .
Up to the spring of 1919 the chief organizer of the party had been Sverdlov .
He did not have the name of General Secretary , a name which was then not yet invented , but he was that in reality .
Sverdlov died at the age of 34 in March 1919 , from the so - called Spanish fever .
In the spread of the civil war and the epidemic , mowing people down right and left , the party hardly realized the weight of this loss .
In two funeral speeches Lenin gave an appraisal of Sverdlov which throws a reflected but very clear light also upon his later relations with Stalin .
“ In the course of our revolution , in its victories , ” Lenin said , “ it fell to Sverdlov to express more fully and more wholly than anybody else the very essence of the proletarian revolution . ”
Sverdlov was “ before all and above all an organizer . ”
From a modest underground worker , neither theoretician nor writer , there grew up in a short time “ an organizer who acquired irreproachable authority , an organizer of the whole Soviet power in Russia , and an organizer of the work of the party unique in his understanding . ”
Lenin had no taste for the exaggerations of anniversary or funeral panegyrics .
His appraisal of Sverdlov was at the same time a characterization of the task of the organizer :
Only thanks to the fact that we had such an organizer as Sverdlov were we able in war times to work as though we had not one single conflict worth speaking of .
So it was in fact .
In conversations with Lenin in those days we remarked more than once , and with ever renewed satisfaction , one of the chief conditions of our success : the unity and solidarity of the governing group .
In spite of the dreadful pressure of events and difficulties , the novelty of the problems , and sharp practical disagreements occasionally bursting out , the work proceeded with extraordinary smoothness and friendliness , and without interruptions .
With a brief word we would recall episodes of the old revolutions .
“ No , it is better with us . ”
“ This alone guarantees our victory . ”
The solidarity of the center had been prepared by the whole history of Bolshevism , and was kept up by the unquestioned authority of the leaders , and above all , of Lenin .
But in the inner mechanics of this unexampled unanimity the chief technician had been Sverdlov .
The secret of his art was simple : to be guided by the interests of the cause and that only .
No one of the party workers had any fear of intrigues creeping down from the party staff .
The basis of this authority of Sverdlov was loyalty .
Having tested out mentally all the party leaders , Lenin in his funeral speech drew the practical conclusion :
Such a man we can never replace , if by replacement we mean the possibility of finding one comrade combining such qualities ...
The work which he did alone can now be accomplished only by a whole group of men who , following in his footsteps , will carry on his service .
These words were not rhetorical , but a strictly practical proposal .
And the proposal was carried out .
Instead of a single Secretary , there was appointed a Collegium of three persons .
From these words of Lenin it is evident , even to those unacquainted with the history of the party , that during the life of Sverdlov , Stalin played no leading role in the party machinery – either at the time of the October Revolution or in the period of laying the foundations and walls of the Soviet state .
Stalin was also not included in the first Secretariat which replaced Sverdlov .
When at the Tenth Congress , two years after the death of Sverdlov , Zinoviev and others , not without a hidden thought of the struggle against me , supported the candidacy of Stalin for General Secretary – that is , placed him de jure in the position which Sverdlov had occupied de facto – Lenin spoke in a small circle against this plan , expressing his fear that “ this cook will prepare only peppery dishes . ”
That phrase alone , taken in connection with the character of Sverdlov , shows us the differences between the two types of organizers : the one tireless in smoothing over conflicts , easing the work of the Collegium , and the other a specialist in peppery dishes – not even afraid to spice them with actual poison .
If Lenin did not in March 1921 carry his opposition to the limit – that is , did not appeal openly to the Congress against the candidacy of Stalin – it was because the post of Secretary , even though “ General , ” had in the conditions then prevailing , with the power and influence concentrated in the Political Bureau , a strictly subordinate significance .
Perhaps also Lenin , like many others , did not adequately realize the danger in time .
Toward the end of 1921 Lenin ’s health broke sharply .
On December 7 , in taking his departure upon the insistence of his physician , Lenin , little given to complaining , wrote to the members of the Political Bureau :
I am leaving today .
In spite of my reduced quota of work and increased quota of rest , these last days the insomnia has increased devilishly .
I am afraid I cannot speak either at the party Congress or the Soviet Congress . [ 2 ]
For five months he languishes , half removed by doctors and friends from his work , in continual alarm over the course of governmental and party affairs , in continual struggle with his lingering disease .
In May he has the first stroke .
For two months Lenin is unable to speak or write or move .
In July he begins slowly to recover .
Remaining in the country , he enters by degrees into active correspondence .
In October he returns to the Kremlin and officially takes up his work .
“ There is no evil without good , ” he writes privately in the draft of a future speech .
“ I have been sitting quiet for a half year and looking on ’ from the sidelines . ’ ”
Lenin means to say : I formerly sat too steadily at my post and failed to observe many things ; the long interruption has now permitted me to see much with fresh eyes .
What disturbed him most , unquestionably , was the monstrous growth of bureaucratic power , the focal point of which had become the Organization Bureau of the Central Committee .
The necessity of removing the boss who was specializing in peppery dishes became clear to Lenin immediately after his return to work .
But this personal question had become notably complicated .
Lenin could not fail to see how extensively his absence had been made use of by Stalin for a one - sided selection of men – often in direct conflict with the interests of the cause .
The General Secretary was now relying upon a numerous faction , bound together by ties which , if not always intellectual , were at least firm .
A change of the heads of the party machine had already become impossible without the preparation of a serious political attack .
At this time occurred the “ conspiratorial ” conversation between Lenin and me in regard to a combined struggle against Soviet and party bureaucratism , and his proposal of a “ bloc ” against the Organization Bureau – the fundamental stronghold of Stalin at that time .
The fact of this conversation as well as its content soon found their reflection in documents , and they constitute an episode of the party history undeniable and not denied by anyone .
However , in only a few weeks there came a new decline in Lenin ’s health .
Not only continual work , but also executive conversations with the comrades were again forbidden by his physicians .
He had to think out further measures of struggle alone within four walls .
To control the backstage activities of the Secretariat , Lenin worked out some general measures of an organizational character .
Thus arose the plan of creating a highly authoritative party center in the form of a Control Commission composed of reliable and experienced members of the party , completely independent from the hierarchical viewpoint – that is , neither officials nor administrators – and at the same time endowed with the right to call to account for violations of legality , of party and Soviet democratism , and for lack of revolutionary morality , all officials without exception , not only of the party , including members of the Central Committee , but also , through mediation of the Workers ’ and Peasants ’
Inspection , the high officials of the state .
On January 23 , through Krupskaya , Lenin sent for publication in Pravda an article on the subject of his proposed reorganization of the central institutions .
Fearing at once a traitorous blow from his disease and a no less traitorous response from the Secretariat , Lenin demanded that his article be printed in Pravda immediately ; this implied a direct appeal to the party .
Stalin refused Krupskaya this request on the ground of the necessity of discussing the question in the Political Bureau .
Formally this meant merely a day ’s postponement .
But the very procedure of referring it to the Political Bureau boded no good .
At Lenin ’s direction Krupskaya turned to me for cooperation .
I demanded an immediate meeting of the Political Bureau .
Lenin ’s fears were completely confirmed : all the members and alternates present at the meeting , Stalin , Molotov , Kuibyshev , Rykov , Kalinin and Bukharin , were not only against the reform proposed by Lenin , but also against printing his article .
To console the sick man , whom any sharp emotional excitement threatened with disaster , Kuibyshev , the future head of the Central Control Commission , proposed that they print a special issue of Pravda containing Lenin ’s article , but consisting of only one copy .
It was thus “ fervently ” that these people followed their teacher .
I rejected with indignation the proposal to hoodwink Lenin , spoke essentially in favor of the reform proposed by him , and demanded the immediate publication of his article .
I was supported by Kamenev who had come in an hour late .
The attitude of the majority was at last broken down by the argument that Lenin in any case would put his article in circulation ; it would be copied on typewriters , and read with redoubled attention , and it would be thus all the more pointedly directed against the Political Bureau .
The article appeared in Pravda the next morning , January 25 .
This episode also found its reflection in due season in official documents , upon the basis of which it is here described .
I consider it necessary in general to emphasize the fact that since I do not belong to the school of pure psychology , and since I am accustomed to trust firmly established facts rather than their emotional reflection in memory , the whole present exposition , with the exception of specially indicated episodes , is set forth by me on the basis of documents in my archives and with a careful verification of dates , testimony and factual circumstances in general .
The Disagreements Between Lenin and Stalin
Organizational policy was not the only arena of Lenin ’s struggle against Stalin .
The November Plenum of the Central Committee ( 1922 ) , sitting without Lenin and without me , introduced unexpectedly a radical change in the system of foreign trade , undermining the very foundation of the state monopoly .
In a conversation with Krassin , then People ’s Commissar of Foreign Trade , I spoke of this resolution of the Central Committee approximately as follows : “ They have not yet knocked the bottom out of the barrel , but they have bored several holes in it . ”
Lenin heard of this .
On December 13 he wrote me :
I earnestly urge you to take upon yourself at the coming Plenum the defense of our common view as to the unconditional necessity of preserving and enforcing the monopoly ...
The previous Plenum took a decision in this matter wholly in conflict with monopoly of foreign trade .
Refusing any concessions upon this question ; Lenin insisted that I appeal to the Central Committee and the Congress .
The blow was directed primarily against Stalin , responsible as General Secretary for the presentation of questions at the Plenums of the Central Committee .
That time , however , the thing did not go to the point of open struggle .
Sensing the danger , Stalin yielded without a struggle , and his friends with him .
At the December Plenum the November decision was revoked .
“ It seems we captured the position without firing a shot , by mere movements of maneuver , ” Lenin wrote me jokingly on December 21 .
The disagreement in the sphere of national policy was still sharper .
In the autumn of 1922 we were preparing the transformation of the Soviet state into a federated union of national republics .
Lenin considered it necessary to go as far as possible to meet the demands and claims of those nationalists who had long lived under oppression and were still far from recovering from its consequences .
Stalin , on the other hand , who in his position as People ’s Commissar for Nationalities directed the preparatory work , was conducting in this sphere a policy of bureaucratic centralism .
Lenin , convalescing in a village near Moscow , carried on a polemic with Stalin in letters addressed to the Political Bureau .
In his first remarks on Stalin ’s project for the federated union , Lenin was extremely gentle and restrained .
He was still hoping in those days – toward the end of September 1922 – to adjust the question through the Political Bureau and without open conflict .
Stalin ’s answers , on the other hand , contained a noticeable irritation .
He thrust back at Lenin the reproach of “ hurriedness , ” and with it an accusation of “ national ’ liberalism ” – that is , indulgence to the nationalism of the outlanders .
This correspondence , although extremely interesting politically , is still concealed from the party .
The bureaucratic national policy had already at that time provoked a keen opposition in Georgia , uniting against Stalin and his right hand man , Ordzhonikidze , the flower of Georgian Bolshevism .
Through Krupskaya , Lenin got into private contact with the leaders of the Georgian opposition ( Mdivani , Makharadze , etc. ) against the faction of Stalin , Ordzhonikidze and Dzenhinsky .
The struggle in the borderlands was too keen , and Stalin had bound himself too closely with definite groupings , to yield in silence as he had on the question of the monopoly of foreign trade .
In the next few weeks Lenin became convinced that it would be necessary to appeal to the party .
At the end of December he dictated a voluminous letter on the national question which was to take the place of his speech at the party Congress if illness prevented him from appearing .
Lenin employed against Stalin an accusation of administrative impulsiveness and spitefulness against an alleged nationalism .
“ Spitefulness in general , ” he wrote weightily , “ plays the worst possible role in politics . ”
The struggle against the just , even though at first exaggerated , demands of the nations formerly oppressed , Lenin qualified as a manifestation of Great - Russian bureaucratism .
He for the first time named his opponents by name : “ It is , of course , necessary to hold Stalin and Dzerzhinsky responsible for all this out - and - out Great - Russian nationalistic campaign . ”
That the Great - Russian , Lenin , accuses the Georgian , Djugashvili , and the Pole , Dzerzhinsky , of Great - Russian nationalism , may seem paradoxical ; but the question here is not one of national feelings and partialities , but of two systems of politics whose differences reveal themselves in all spheres , the national question among them .
In mercilessly condemning the methods of the Stalin faction , Rakovsky wrote some years later :
To the national question , as to all other questions , the bureaucracy makes its approach from the point of view of convenience of administration and regulation .
Nothing better could be said .
Stalin ’s verbal concessions did not quiet Lenin in the least , but on the contrary sharpened his suspicions .
“ Stalin will make a rotten compromise , ” Lenin warned me through his secretary , “ in order then to deceive . ”
And that was just Stalin ’s course .
He was ready to accept at the coming Congress any theoretical formulation of the national policy provided it did not weaken his factional support in the center and in the borderlands .
To be sure , Stalin had plenty of ground for fearing that Lenin saw through his plans completely .
But on the other hand , the condition of the sick man was continually growing worse .
Stalin coolly included this not unimportant factor in his calculations .
The practical policy of the General Secretariat became the more decisive , the worse became Lenin ’s health .
Stalin tried to isolate the dangerous supervisor from all information which might give him a weapon against the Secretariat and its allies .
This policy of blockade naturally was directed against the people closest to Lenin .
Krupskaya did what she could to protect the sick man from contact with the hostile machinations of the Secretariat .
But Lenin knew how to guess a whole situation from accidental symptoms .
He was clearly aware of the activities of Stalin , his motives and calculations .
It is not difficult to imagine what reactions they provoked in his mind .
We should remember that at that moment there already lay on Lenin ’s writing table , besides the testament insisting upon the removal of Stalin , also the documents on the national question which Lenin ’s secretaries Fotieva and Glyasser , sensitively reflecting the mood of their chief , were describing as “ a bombshell against Stalin . ”
A Half Year of Sharpening Struggle
Lenin developed his idea of the role of the Central Control Commission as a protector of party law and unity in connection with the question of reorganizing the Workers ’ and Peasants ’ Inspection ( Rabkrin ) , whose head for several preceding years had been Stalin .
On March 4 , 1923 , Pravda published an article famous in the history of the party , Better Less but Better .
This work was written at several different times .
Lenin did not like to , and could not dictate .
He had a hard time writing the article .
On March 2 he finally listened to it with satisfaction : “ At last it seems all right . ”
This article included the reform of the guiding party institutions on a broad political perspective , both national and international .
Upon this side of the question , however , we can not pause here .
Highly important for our theme , however , is the estimate which Lenin gave of the Workers ’ and Peasants ’ Inspection .
Here are Lenin ’s words :
Let us speak frankly .
The People ’s Commissariat of Rabkrin does not enjoy at the present moment a shadow of authority .
Everybody knows that a worse organized institution than our Commissariat of Rabkrin does not exist , and that in the present circumstances you cannot expect a thing of that Commissariat .
This extraordinarily biting allusion in print by the head of the government to one of the most important state institutions was a direct and unmitigated blow against Stalin as the organizer and head of this Inspection .
The reason for this should now be clear .
The Inspection was to serve chiefly as an antidote to bureaucratic distortions of the revolutionary dictatorship .
This responsible function could be fulfilled successfully upon condition of complete loyalty in its leadership , but it was just this loyalty which Stalin lacked .
He had converted the Inspection like the party Secretariat into an implement of machine intrigues , of protection for “ his men ” and persecution of his opponents .
In the article Better Less but Better Lenin openly pointed out that his proposed reform of the Inspection , at whose head Tsuryupa had not long ago been placed , must inevitably meet the resistance of “ all our bureaucracy , both the Soviet and the party bureaucracy . ”
In parenthesis Lenin adds significantly , “ We have bureaucratism not only in the Soviet institutions but also in the party . ”
This was a perfectly deliberate blow at Stalin as General Secretary .
Thus it would be no exaggeration to say that the last half year of Lenin ’s political life , between his convalescence and his second illness , was filled with a sharpening struggle against Stalin .
Let us recall once more the principal dates .
In September 1922 Lenin opened fire against the national policy of Stalin .
In the first part of December he attacked Stalin on the question of the monopoly of foreign trade .
On December 25 he wrote the first part of his testament .
On December 30 he wrote his letter on the national question ( the “ bombshell ” ) .
On January 4 , 1923 , he added a postscript to his testament on the necessity of removing Stalin from his position as General Secretary .
On January 23 he drew up against Stalin a heavy battery : the project of a Control Commission .
In an article on March 2 he dealt Stalin a double blow , both as organizer of the Inspection and as General Secretary .
On March 5 he wrote me on the subject of his memorandum on the national question : “ If you would agree to undertake its defense , I could be at rest . ”
On that same day he for the first time openly joined forces with the irreconcilable Georgian enemies of Stalin , informing them in a special note that he was backing their cause “ with all my heart ” and was preparing for them documents against Stalin , Ordzhonikidze and Dzerzhinsky .
“ With all my heart ” – this expression was not a frequent one with Lenin .
“ This question [ the national question ] has worried him extremely , ” testifies his secretary , Fotieva , “ and he was preparing to speak on it at the party Congress . ”
But a month before the Congress Lenin finally broke down , and without even having given instructions in regard to the article .
A weight rolled from Stalin ’s shoulders .
At the caucus of the Council of Elders at the Twelfth Congress he already made bold to speak , in the style characteristic of him , of Lenin ’s letter as the document of a sick man under the influence of “ womenfolk . ”
( That is , Krupskaya and the two secretaries . )
Under pretext of the necessity of finding out the actual will of Lenin , it was decided to put the letter under lock and key .
There it remains to this day .
The dramatic episodes enumerated above , vivid enough in themselves , do not in the remotest degree convey the fervor with which Lenin was living through the party events of the last months of his active life .
In letters and articles he laid upon himself the usual very severe censorship .
Lenin understood well enough from his first stroke the nature of his illness .
After he returned to work in October 1922 the capillary vessels of his brain did not cease to remind him of themselves by a hardly noticeable , but ominous and more and more frequent nudge , obviously threatening a relapse .
Lenin soberly estimated his own situation in spite of the quieting assurances of his physicians .
At the beginning of March , when he was compelled again to withdraw from work , at least from meetings , interviews and telephone conversations , he carried away into his sick room a number of troubling observations and dreads .
The bureaucratic apparatus had become an independent factor in big politics with Stalin ’s secret factional staff in the Secretariat of the Central Committee .
In the national sphere , where Lenin demanded special sensitiveness , the fangs of imperial centralism were revealing themselves more and more openly .
The ideas and principles of the revolution were bending to the interests of combinations behind the scenes .
The authority of the dictatorship was more and more often serving as a cover for the dictations of functionaries .
Lenin keenly sensed the approach of a political crisis , and feared that the apparatus would strangle the party .
The policies of Stalin became for Lenin in the last period of his life the incarnation of a rising monster of bureaucratism .
The sick man must more than once have shuddered at the thought that he had not succeeded in carrying out that reform of the apparatus about which he had talked with me before his second illness .
A terrible danger , it seemed to him , threatened the work of his whole life .
And Stalin ?
Having gone too far to retreat , spurred on by his own faction , fearing that concentrated attack whose threads all issued from the sickbed of his dread enemy , Stalin was already going headlong , was openly recruiting partisans by the distribution of party and Soviet positions , was terrorizing those who appealed to Lenin through Krupskaya , and was more and more persistently issuing rumors that Lenin was already not responsible for his actions .
Such was the atmosphere from which rose Lenin ’s letter breaking with Stalin absolutely .
No , it did not drop from a clear sky .
It meant merely that the cup of endurance had run over .
Not only chronologically , but politically and morally , it drew a last line under the attitude of Lenin to Stalin .
Is it not surprising that Ludwig , gratefully repeating the official story about the pupil faithful to his teacher “ up to his very death , ” says not a word of this final letter , or indeed of all the other circumstances which do not accord with the present Kremlin legends ?
Ludwig ought at least to know the fact of the letter , if only from my autobiography , with which he was once acquainted , for he gave it a favorable review .
Maybe Ludwig had doubts of the authenticity of my testimony .
But neither the existence of the letter nor its contents were ever disputed by anybody .
More over , they are confirmed in stenographic minutes of the Central Committee .
At the July Plenum in 1926 , Zinoviev said :
At the beginning of the year 1923 , Vladimir Ilyich , in a personal letter to Comrade Stalin , broke off all comradely relations with him .
( Stenographic Minutes of the Plenum , No.4 , page 32 . )
And other speakers , among them M.I. Ulyanova , Lenin ’s sister , spoke of the letter as of a fact generally known in the circles of the Central Committee .
In those days it could not even enter Stalin ’s head to oppose this testimony .
Indeed , he has not ventured to do that so far as I know , in a direct form , even subsequently .
It is true that the official historians have in recent years made literally gigantic efforts to wipe out of the memory of man this whole chapter of history .
And so far as the Communist youth are concerned , these efforts have achieved certain results .
But investigators exist , it would seem , exactly for the purpose of destroying legends and confirming the real facts in their rights .
Or is this not true of psychologists ?
The Hypothesis of the “ Duumvirate ”
We have indicated above the signposts of the final struggle between Lenin and Stalin .
At all these stages Lenin sought my support and found it .
From the speeches , articles and letters of Lenin you could without difficulty adduce dozens of testimonies to the fact that , after our temporary disagreement on the question of the trade unions , throughout 1921 and 1922 and the beginning of 1923 , Lenin did not lose one chance to emphasize in open forum his solidarity with me , to quote this or that statement from me , to support this or that step which I had taken .
We must understand that his motives were not personal , but political .
What may have alarmed him and grieved him in the last months , indeed , was my not - active - enough support of his fighting measures against Stalin .
Yes , such is the paradox of the situation !
Lenin , fearing in the future a split on the line of Stalin and Trotsky , demanded of me a more energetic struggle against Stalin .
The contradiction here , however , is only superficial .
It was in the interests of the stability of the party leadership in the future , that Lenin now wished to condemn Stalin sharply and disarm him .
What restrained me was the fear that any sharp conflict in the ruling group at that time , when Lenin was struggling with death , might be understood by the party as a casting of lots for Lenin ’s mantle .
I will not raise the question here as to whether my restraint in that case was right or not , nor the broader question as to whether it would have been possible at that time to ward off the advancing danger with organizational reforms and personal shiftings .
But how far were all the actual positions of the actors from the picture which is given us by this popular German writer who so lightly picks the keys to all enigmas !
We heard from him that the testament “ decided the fate of Trotsky ” – that is , evidently served as a cause of Trotsky ’s losing power .
According to another version of Ludwig , expounded alongside of this with not even an attempt to reconcile them , Lenin desired “ a duumvirate of Trotsky and Stalin . ”
This latter thought , also , doubtless suggested by Radek , gives excellent proof that even now , even in the close circle around Stalin , even in the tendentious manipulation of a foreign writer invited in for a conversation , nobody dared assert that Lenin saw his successor in Stalin .
In order not to come into too crude conflict with the text of the testimony , and a whole series of other documents , it is necessary to put forward ex post facto this idea of a duumvirate .
But how reconcile this story with Lenin ’s advice : remove the General Secretary ?
That would have meant to deprive Stalin of all the weapons of his influence .
You do not treat in this way the candidate for duumvir .
No , and moreover this second hypothesis of Radek - Ludwig , although more cautious , finds no support in the text of the testament .
The aim of the document was defined by its author – to guarantee the stability of the Central Committee .
Lenin sought the road to this goal not in the artificial combination of a duumvirate , but in strengthening the collective control over the activity of the leaders .
How in doing this he conceived the relative influence of individual members of the collective leadership – as to this the reader is free to draw his own conclusions on the basis of the above quotations from the testament .
But he should not lose sight of the fact that the testament was not the last word of Lenin , and that his attitude to Stalin became more severe the more closely he felt the denouement approaching .
Ludwig would not have made so capital a mistake in his appraisal of the meaning and spirit of the testament , if he had interested himself a little bit in its further fate .
Concealed by Stalin and his group from the party , the testament was reprinted and republished only by Oppositionists – of course , secretly .
Hundreds of my friends and partisans were arrested and exiled for copying and distributing those two little pages .
On November 7 , 1927 – the Tenth Anniversary of the October Revolution – the Moscow Oppositionists took part in the anniversary demonstration with a placard : “ Fulfill the Testament of Lenin . ”
Specially chosen troops of Stalinists broke into the line of march and snatched away the criminal placard .
Two years later , at the moment of my banishment abroad , a story was even created of an insurrection in preparation by the “ Trotskyists ” on November 7 , 1927 .
The summons to “ fulfill the testament of Lenin ” was interpreted by the Stalinist faction as a summons to insurrection !
And even now the testament is forbidden publication by any section of the Communist International .
The Left Opposition , on the contrary , is republishing the testament upon every appropriate occasion in all countries .
Politically these facts exhaust the question .
Radek as a Source of Information
Still , where did that fantastic tale come from about how I leapt from my seat during the reading of the testament , or rather of the “ six words ” which are not in the testament , with the question : “ What does it say there ? ”
Of this I can only offer a hypothetical explanation .
How correct it may be , let the reader judge .
Radek belongs to the tribe of professional wits and storytellers .
By this I do not mean that he does not possess other qualities .
Suffice it to say that at the Seventh Congress of the party on March 8 , 1918 , Lenin , who was in general very restrained in personal comments , considered it possible to say :
I return to Comrade Radek , and here I want to remark that he has accidentally succeeded in uttering a serious remark ...
And once again later on :
This time it did happen that we got a perfectly serious remark from Radek ...
People who speak seriously only by way of exception have an organic tendency to improve reality , for in its raw form reality is not always appropriate to their stories .
My personal experience has taught me to adopt a very cautious attitude to Radek ’s testimonies .
His custom is not to recount events , but to take them as the occasion for a witty discourse .
Since every art , including the anecdotal , aspires toward a synthesis , Radek is inclined to unite together various facts , or the brighter features of various episodes , even though they took place at different times and places .
There is no malice in this .
It is the manner of his calling .
And so it happened , apparently , this time .
Radek , according to all the evidence , has combined a session of the Council of Elders at the Thirteenth Congress with a session of the Plenum of the Central Committee of 1926 , in spite of the fact that an interval of more than two years lay between the two .
At that Plenum also , secret manuscripts were read , among them the testament .
This time Stalin did actually read them , and not Kamenev , who was then already sitting beside me in the Opposition benches .
The reading was provoked by the fact that during those days copies of the testament , Lenin ’s letter on the national question , and other documents kept under lock and key were already circulating rather broadly in the party .
The party apparatus was getting nervous and wanted to find out what it was that Lenin actually said .
“ The Opposition knows and we do n’t know , ” they were saying .
After prolonged resistance Stalin found himself compelled to read the forbidden documents at a session of the Central Committee – thus automatically bringing them into the stenographic record , printed in secret notebooks for the heads of the party apparatus .
This time also , there were no exclamations during the reading of the testament , for the document was long ago too well known to the members of the Central Committee .
But I did actually interrupt Stalin during the reading of the correspondence on the national question .
The episode in itself is not so important , but maybe it will be of use to the psychologists for certain inferences .
Lenin was extremely economical in his literary means and methods .
He carried on his business correspondence with close colleagues in telegraphic language .
The form of address was always the last name of the addressee with the letter “ T ” ( Tovarich : comrade ) , and the signature was “ Lenin . ”
Complicated explanations were replaced by a double or triple underlining of separate words , extra exclamation points , etc .
We all well knew the peculiarities of Lenin ’s manner , and therefore even a slight departure from his laconic custom attracted attention .
In sending his letter on the national question Lenin wrote me on March 5 :
Esteemed Comrade Trotsky ,
I earnestly ask you to undertake the defense of the Georgian affair at the Central Committee of the party .
That affair is now under “ prosecution ” at the hands of Stalin and Dzerzhinsky and I cannot rely on their impartiality .
Indeed , quite the contrary !
If you would agree to undertake its defense , I could be at rest .
If for some reason you do not agree , send me back all the papers .
I will consider that a sign of your disagreement .
With the very best comradely greetings ,
Lenin
March 5 , 1923
Both the content and the tone of this slight note , dictated by Lenin during the last day of his political life , were no less painful to Stalin than the testament .
A lack of “ impartiality ” – does not this imply , indeed , that same lack of loyalty ?
The last thing to be felt in this note is any confidence in Stalin – “ indeed , quite the contrary ” – the thing emphasized is confidence in me .
A confirmation of the tacit union between Lenin and me against Stalin and his faction was at hand .
Stalin controlled himself badly during the reading .
When he arrived at the signature he hesitated : “ With the very best comradely greetings ” – that was too demonstrative from Lenin ’s pen .
Stalin read : “ With communist greetings . ”
That sounded more dry and official .
At that moment I did rise in my seat and ask : “ What is written there ? ” Stalin was obliged , not without embarrassment , to read the authentic text of Lenin .
Someone of his close friends shouted at me that I was quibbling over details , although I had only sought to verify a text .
That slight incident made an impression .
There was talk about it among the heads of the party .
Radek , who at that time was no longer a member of the Central Committee , learned of it at the Plenum from others , and perhaps from me .
Five years later when he was already with Stalin and no longer with me , his flexible memory evidently helped him to compose this synthetic episode which stimulated Ludwig to so effective and so mistaken an inference .
Although Lenin , as we have seen , found no reason to declare in his testament that my non-Bolshevik past was “ not accidental , ” still I am ready to adopt that formula on my own authority .
In the spiritual world the law of causation is as inflexible as in the physical world .
In that general sense my political orbit was , of course , “ not accidental , ” but the fact that I became a Bolshevik was also not accidental .
The question how seriously and permanently I came over to ; Bolshevism is not to be decided either by a bare chronological record or by the guesses of literary psychology .
A theoretical and political analysis is necessary .
This , of course , is too big a theme and lies wholly outside the frame of the present article .
For our purpose it suffices that Lenin , in describing the conduct of Zinoviev and Kamenev in 1917 as “ not accidental , ” was not making a philosophical reference to the laws of determinism , but a political warning for the future .
It is exactly for this reason that Radek found it necessary , through Ludwig , to transfer this warning from Zinoviev and Kamenev to me .
The Legend of “ Trotskyism ”
Let us recall the chief signposts of this question .
From 1917 to 1924 not a word was spoken of the contrast between Trotskyism and Leninism .
In this period occurred the October Revolution , the Civil War , the construction of the Soviet state , the creation of the Red Army , the working out of the party program , the establishment of the Communist International , the formation of its cadres , and the drawing up of its fundamental documents .
After the withdrawal of Lenin from his work in the nucleus of the Central Committee , serious disagreements developed .
In 1924 the specter of “ Trotskyism ” – after careful preparation behind the scenes – was brought forth on the stage .
The entire inner struggle of the party was henceforth carried on within the frame of a contrast between Trotskyism and Leninism .
In other words , the disagreements created by new circumstances and new tasks between me and the epigones were presented as a continuation of my old disagreements with Lenin .
A vast literature was created upon this theme .
Its sharpshooters were always Zinoviev and Kamenev .
In their character of old and very close colleagues of Lenin they stood at the head of “ the Bolshevik Old Guard ” against Trotskyism .
But under the pressure of deep social processes this group itself fell apart .
Zinoviev and Kamenev found themselves obliged to acknowledge that the so - called “ Trotskyists ” had been right upon fundamental questions .
New thousands of old Bolshevists adhered to “ Trotskyism . ”
At the July 1926 Plenum Zinoviev announced that his struggle against me had been the greatest mistake of his life – “ more dangerous than the mistake of 1917 . ”
Ordzhonikidze was not entirely wrong in calling to him from his seat : “ Then why did you dupe the entire party ? ” ( See the already quoted stenographic Minutes . )
To this weighty rejoinder Zinoviev officially found no answer .
But he gave an unofficial explanation at a conference of the Opposition in October 1926 .
“ You must understand , ” he said in my presence , to his closest friends , some Leningrad workers who honestly believed in the legend of Trotskyism , “ you must understand that it was a struggle for power .
The trick was to string together the old disagreements with new issues .
For this purpose ‘ Trotskyism ’ was invented ... ”
During their two year stay in the Opposition , Zinoviev and Kamenev managed to expose completely the backstage mechanics of the preceding period when they with Stalin had created the legend of “ Trotskyism ” by conspiratorial methods .
A year later , when it became finally clear that the Opposition would be compelled to swim long and stubbornly against the current , Zinoviev and Kamenev threw themselves on the mercy of the victor .
As a first condition of their party rehabilitation it was demanded that they rehabilitate the legend of Trotskyism .
They agreed .
At that time I decided to reinforce their own previous declarations on this matter through a series of authoritative testimonials .
It was Radek , no other than Karl Radek , who gave the following written testimony :
I was present at the conversation with Kamenev when L.B. [ Kamenev ] said he would openly declare at the Plenum of the Central Committee how they , that is , Kamenev and Zinoviev , together with Stalin , decided to utilize the old disagreements between L.D. [ Trotsky ] and Lenin so as to keep Comrade Trotsky from the leadership of the Party after Lenin ’s death .
Moreover , I have heard repeated from the lips of Zinoviev and Kamenev the tale of how they had “ invented ” Trotskyism as a topical slogan .
K. Radek
December 25 , 1927
Similar written testimonies were given by Preobrazhensky , Pyatakov , Rakovsky and Eltsin .
Pyatakov , the present director of the State Bank , summed up Zinoviev ’s testimony in the following words :
“ Trotskyism ” had been invented in order to replace the real differences of opinion with fictitious differences , that is , to utilize past differences which had no bearing upon the present but which were resurrected artificially for the definite purpose mentioned above .
This is clear enough , is it not ?
And V. Eltsin , a representative of the younger generation , wrote :
None of the supporters of the 1925 Group ( the Zinovievists ) who were present raised any objections to this .
Everyone received this information of Zinoviev as a generally known fact .
The above - cited testimony of Radek was submitted by him on December 25 , 1927 .
A few weeks later he was already in exile , and a few months later on the meridian of Tomsk he became convinced of the correctness of Stalin ’s position , a thing which had not been revealed to him earlier in Moscow .
But from Radek also the powers demanded , as a condition sine qua non , an acknowledgment of the reality of this same legend of “ Trotskyism . ”
After Radek agreed to this , he had nothing left to do but repeat the old formulas of Zinoviev which the latter had himself exposed in 1926 , only to return to them again in 1928 .
Radek has gone further .
In a conversation with a credulous foreigner he has amended the testament of Lenin in order to find in it support for this epigonist legend of “ Trotskyism . ”
From this short historic review , resting exclusively upon documentary data , many conclusions may be drawn .
One is that a revolution is an austere process and does not spare its human vertebrae .
The course of subsequent events in the Kremlin and in the Soviet Union was determined not by a single document , even though it were the testament of Lenin , but by historical causes of a far deeper order .
A political reaction after the enormous effort of the years of the insurrection and the Civil War was inevitable .
The concept of reaction must here be strictly distinguished from the concept of counter - revolution .
Reaction does not necessarily imply a social overturn – that is , a transfer of power from one class to another .
Even Czarism had its periods of progressive reform and its periods of reaction .
The mood and orientation of the ruling class changes according to circumstances .
This is true also of the working class .
The pressure of the petty bourgeoisie upon the proletariat , tired from the tumult , entailed a revival of petty - bourgeois tendencies in the proletariat itself and a first deep reaction on the crest of which the present bureaucratic apparatus headed by Stalin rose to power .
Those qualities which Lenin valued in Stalin – stubbornness of character and craftiness – remained , of course , even then .
But they found a new field of action , and a new point of application .
Those features which in the past had represented a minus in Stalin ’s personality - narrowness of outlook , lack of creative imagination , empiricism – now gained an effective significance important in the highest degree .
They permitted Stalin to become the semi-conscious instrument of the Soviet bureaucracy , and they impelled the bureaucracy to see in Stalin its inspired leader .
This ten - year struggle among the heads of the Bolshevik Party has indubitably proved that under the conditions of this new stage of the revolution Stalin has been developing to the limit those very traits of his political character against which Lenin in the last period of his life waged irreconcilable war .
But this question , standing even now at the focus of Soviet politics , would carry us far beyond the limits of our historic theme .
Many years have passed since the events we have related .
If even ten years ago there were factors in action far more powerful than the counsel of Lenin , it would now be utterly naive to appeal to the testament as to an effective political document .
The international struggle between the two groups which have grown out of Bolshevism long ago outgrew the question of the fate of individuals .
Lenin ’s letter , known under the name of his testament , has henceforward chiefly a historic interest .
But history , we may venture to think , has also its rights , which moreover do not always conflict with the interests of politics .
The most elementary of scientific demands – correctly to establish facts and to verify rumors by document – may at least be recommended alike to politician and historian .
And this demand might well be extended even to the psychologist .
Prinkipo , December 31 , 1932

Just as test pilots push planes to explore their limits , researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) are probing the newest microscope technology to further improve measurement accuracy at the nanoscale .
Better nanoscale measurements are critical for setting standards and improving production in the semiconductor and nanomanufacturing industries .
This new microscope technology uses helium ions to generate the signal used to image extremely small objects , a technique analogous to the scanning electron microscope , which was first introduced commercially in the 1960s .
Paradoxically , although helium ions are far larger than electrons , they can provide higher resolution images with higher contrast .
The depth of field is much better with the new technology too , so more of the image is in focus .
“ It is the physics , ” explains Andras Vladar , SEM project leader in NIST ’s Nanoscale - Metrology Group .
“ Ions have larger mass and shorter wavelength than electrons , so they can be better for imaging . ”
The images , he says , appear almost three - dimensional , revealing details smaller than a nanometer — the distance spanned by only three atoms in the silicon crystal .
NIST is working to understand the imaging mechanisms of this new technology .
The clearest advantage of the helium ion microscope is that the images show the actual edge of a sample better than the SEM , which is critical in precision manufacturing .
“ Meeting critical dimensions by knowing where an edge is in high - tech manufacturing can mean the difference of hundreds of dollars per piece , ” explains Michael Postek , chief of the NIST Precision Engineering Division and the nanomanufacturing program manager .
Semiconductor manufacturers have multi-million dollar scanning electron microscopes all along their production lines to help control their microchip manufacturing processes .
NIST received the first - ever commercial helium ion microscope , called Orion , from Carl Zeiss , Inc. , last summer as part of a cooperative research and development agreement ( CRADA ) .
Researchers are test - piloting it in NIST ’s Advanced Measurement Laboratory ( AML ) , one of the most environmentally stable research facilities in the world .
Carefully controlled for vibration , humidity and temperature changes , AML labs are optimal sites to test new microscope technology , say the researchers .
“ What we are learning , ” explains Postek , “ goes directly back to the manufacturers to improve their products , which allows NIST and industry to obtain the most precise measurements possible .
We are transferring NIST technology and sharing our research with the semiconductor industry trade organization , SEMATECH . ”
One such NIST contribution is “ fast imaging , ” a technique Vladar developed to obtain sharper images .
A combination of vibrations at the nanoscale and taking images at high resolutions left certain images fuzzy , similar to what happens when taking a picture of a moving baby with a slow shutter speed .
Instead of collecting the signal slowly and getting a fuzzy image , the NIST technique collects many images as fast as possible and merges them using a clever algorithm to reduce the fuzziness and result in a much sharper image .
Zeiss has recently replaced the original Orion with the first - ever Orion Plus , which incorporates many of NIST ’s suggestions in its design , including an improved cooling system for the helium source for improved imaging
American scientists discovered that the pitch of the voice can tell us about the best days for conception .
The fact is female voice becomes high pitched in the period before and in the time of ovulation – this unconscious “ signal ” perceived by ear of a man enhances sexual attractiveness of the woman .
Researchers at the University of California in Los Angeles asked 69 women to record their voices in different periods of the menstrual cycle .
It turned out that when it was getting on for ovulation the pitches of women ’s voices were getting higher and reached maximum 2 days before ovulation when conception is the most likely .
Certainly , changes in the voice during the cycle are subtle , though it is quite enough for decoding unit or man ’s ear to detect .
Besides , clearly determined increase in the pitch was observed when women pronounced the phrases which they used to introduce themselves or to get acquainted with an imaginary companion .
The scientists suppose that the higher pitch of the voice belonging to the same woman sounds more feminine .
Higher female voice signals about increased sexuality and fertility .
Interestingly , the pitch of male voice is significant , too .
Earlier the researchers found the link between the tone of voice and the number of man ’s children .
According to their data , men with low voices have more children than men with high voices .
It ’s known that men with low voices are traditionally perceived as more aggressive , healthy and sexually attractive partners .

We all create our own reality , and shut out the voices we do not want to hear .
But there is no issue we are less willing to entertain than man-made climate change .
Here , three worlds seem to exist in virtual isolation .
In the physical world , global warming appears to be spilling over into runaway feedback : the most dangerous situation humankind has ever encountered .
In the political world - at the climate talks in Poznan , for instance - our governments seem to be responding to something quite different , a minor nuisance that can be addressed in due course .
Only the Plane Stupid protesters who occupied part of Stansted airport yesterday appear to have understood the scale and speed of this crisis .
In cyberspace , by contrast , the response spreading fastest and furthest is flat - out denial .
The most popular article on the Guardian 's website last week was the report showing that 2008 is likely to be the coolest year since 2000 .
As the Met Office predicted , global temperatures have been held down by the La Niña event in the Pacific Ocean .
This news prompted a race on the Guardian 's comment thread to reach the outer limits of idiocy .
Of the 440 responses posted by lunchtime yesterday , about 80 % insisted that manmade climate change is a hoax .
Here 's a sample of the conversation :
" This is a scam to get your money ...
The only people buying into ' global warming ' have no experience with any of the sciences . "
" If we spend any money or cost one person their job because of this fraud it would be a crime .
When will one of our politicians stand up and call this for what it is , bullshit ! "
" What a set of jokers these professors are ... I think I understand more about climate change than them and I do n't get paid a big fat salary with all the perks to go with it . "
And so on , and on and on .
The new figures have prompted similar observations all over the web .
Until now , the " sceptics " have assured us that you can't believe the temperature readings at all ; that the scientists at the Met Office , who produced the latest figures , are all liars ; and that even if it were true that temperatures have risen , it does n't mean anything .
Now the temperature record - though only for 2008 - can suddenly be trusted , and the widest possible inferences be drawn from the latest figures , though not , of course , from the records of the preceding century .
This is madness .
Scrambled up in these comment threads are the memes planted in the public mind by the professional deniers employed by fossil fuel companies .
On the Guardian 's forums , you 'll find endless claims that the hockeystick graph of global temperatures has been debunked ; that sunspots are largely responsible for current temperature changes ; that the world 's glaciers are advancing ; that global warming theory depends entirely on computer models ; that most climate scientists in the 1970s were predicting a new ice age .
None of this is true , but it does n't matter .
The professional deniers are paid not to win the argument but to cause as much confusion and delay as possible .
To judge by the Comment threads , they have succeeded magnificently .
There is no pool so shallow that a thousand bloggers wo n't drown in it .
Take the latest claims from the former broadcaster David Bellamy .
You may remember that Bellamy came famously unstuck three years ago when he stated that 555 of the 625 glaciers being observed by the World Glacier Monitoring Service were growing .
Now he has made an even stranger allegation .
In early November the Express ran an interview with Bellamy under the headline " BBC shunned me for denying climate change " .
" The sad fact is , " he explained , " that since I said I did n't believe human beings caused global warming I 've not been allowed to make a TV programme . "
He had been brave enough to state that global warming was " poppycock " , and that caused the end of his career .
" Back then , at the BBC you had to toe the line and I was n't doing that . "
This article , on the web , received more hits than almost anything else the Express has published ; so 10 days ago the paper interviewed Bellamy again .
He took the opportunity to explain just how far the conspiracy had spread .
" Have you noticed there is a wind turbine on Teletubbies ?
That 's subliminal advertising , is n't it ? "
There is just one problem with this story : it is bollocks from start to finish .
Bellamy last presented a programme on the BBC in 1994 .
The first time he publicly challenged the theory of manmade climate change was 10 years later , in 2004 , when he claimed in the Daily Mail that it was " poppycock " .
Until at least the year 2000 he supported the theory .
In 1992 , for instance , he signed an open letter , published in the Guardian , urging George Bush Sr " to fight global warming ...
We are convinced that the continued emission of carbon dioxide at current rates could result in dramatic and devastating climate change in all regions of the world . "
In 1996 he signed a letter to the Times , arguing : " Continued increases in the global emissions of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels are likely to lead to climate change at a rate greater than the Earth has experienced at any time during the last 10,000 years . "
In the same year he called for the replacement of fossil fuels with wind power .
In 2000 he announced that he was supporting a plan to sue climate change " criminals " : governments and industries that blocked attempts to stop global warming ( all references are on my website ) .
But Bellamy 's new claims about the end of his career have been repeated as gospel in several newspapers and all over the web .
In his fascinating book Carbon Detox , George Marshall argues that people are not persuaded by information .
Our views are formed by the views of the people with whom we mix .
Of the narratives that might penetrate these circles , we are more likely to listen to those that offer us some reward .
A story that tells us that the world is cooking and that we 'll have to make sacrifices for the sake of future generations is less likely to be accepted than the more rewarding idea that climate change is a conspiracy hatched by scheming governments and venal scientists , and that strong , independent - minded people should unite to defend their freedoms .
He proposes that instead of arguing for sacrifice , environmentalists should show where the rewards might lie : that understanding what the science is saying and planning accordingly is the smart thing to do , which will protect your interests more effectively than flinging abuse at scientists .
We should emphasise the old - fashioned virtues of uniting in the face of a crisis , of resourcefulness and community action .
Projects like the transition towns network and proposals for a green new deal tell a story which people are more willing to hear .
Marshall is right : we have to change the way we talk about this issue .
You do n't believe me ?
Then just read the gibberish that follows when this article is published online .

The World Economic Forum has released its annual Global Gender Gap Report and everyone from Matthew Kirdahy at Forbes to Kate Pickert at Time to Laura MacInnis at Reuters are all over the unsurprising news that the Scandanavian countries do better than the U.S. at gender equity — and the surprising news is that the Philippines , Lesotho ( pictured ) , Mozambique and Moldova do too .
Uh , what ?
The trouble is that the Global Gender Gap Report only takes into account the relative outcomes for men and women across 4 indices : economic participation and opportunity ; educational attainment ; political empowerment ; and health and survival .
It also very heavily weights for a female head of state ( regardless of her political affiliation ) as well as female participation in government .
It ignores what it calls " variables related to country - specific policies , culture or customs , " i.e. , opportunities for women — which would be things like the availability to child care , the stated role of women in society , or their access to birth control or abortion .
In fact , even the ratio of female to male participation in the work force that the study does take into account is the 5th lowest weighted score in the 14 indices the study takes into account .
( By the way , if you were curious about contraceptive use , 68 percent of American women use some sort of " modern " contraceptive ( i.e. , not the rhythm method ) ; in the Philippines , 33 percent do ; in Lesotho , 35 percent do ; in Mozambique only 12 percent do ; and in Moldova , 44 percent of women use modern contraception to prevent pregnancy . )
So , while it 's great — and important — to note the educational gaps between women and men across countries ( we have almost none , by the way ) and women 's participation in the political process as elected officials , is that really indicative of the real gender gap ?
Do women ( or men ) want to be able to stay home with children and is the availability of that opportunity — as supplied or supported by the state — as good or a better indicator than having a female head of state ?
Heck , if Sarah Palin had become our head of state , in fact , we would have vaulted far forward on this list but nothing for women would have substantively changed for the better .
Is access to — and social ability to use or demand the use of — birth control a more important indicator of the gap between the status of men and women ?
What about violence against women ?
And , maybe more importantly , all factors of language and assimilation being equal , do you really think that , as a woman , you 'd be in better shape in the Philippines , Lesotho , Mozambique or Moldova than here ?

You ’ll see why the sustainability experts get their answers from BuildingGreen .
John Clark
you should know about , just because they 're weird .
Did you know that people with diabetes exhale rocket fuel ?
It 's true , but it 'sright ?
And spontaneous combustion .
That 's true , too , apparently , albeit in a bigfoot sort of way .
People just explode .
Mark Roth keeps a file on them , because , well , for one thing , he 's interested in the genetics of spontaneous combustion , and , for another , he 's interested in whatpeople from exploding , like , all the time .
I mean , why should n't they ?
People never askBut then , they never ask a lot of things .
Human beings are 37 degrees Celsius .
That 's pretty much the standard .
But why ?
Nobody ever tells you .
You can read a thousand books on bioenergetics and they wo n't even ask the question .
So it 'sand that 's when you can learn things .
You can learn things when things are unexplained -- when the sword is still in the stone .
Take movement , for example .
We humans are absolutely programmed to be interested in movement .
In fact , if you 're a biologist , you 're really a movementologist ; you study that which moves .
You 're a slave to the animate .
Which , of course , is how Mark Roth got the idea thatreally might be the better scene , and found himself in
Now , Mark Roth is a scientist .
He 's not a philosopher or a crank .
He proves things , experimentally , according to the scientific method .
In 2007 , he got a MacArthur , so he 's a genius , certified .
He 's got this long , narrow oracular head , shaped like a Corinthian column , expanding as it gets to the gray matter .
He 's got a flexible nose , 1 or 2 degrees off center .
He 's got kind , tired eyes -- Vonnegutian eyes -- to which his eyebrows , scroll - shaped , offer fancy punctuation .
He 's got a ginger - colored mustache and ginger - colored hair going gray , now that he 's pushed into his fifties .
He 's got long , skinny arms that he waves around , and long , skinny legs covered with ginger - colored freckles that are available to view because he used to be a runner for the University of Oregon and still wears shorts to work , and blue Converse sneakers , and white socks bright with elastic .
He sometimes gives you a goofy double thumbs - up when he thinks he 's proved his point , when he 's proved that what he 's talking about -- be it ball lightning or the philosopher 's stone -- is not a crazy idea but rather a gamer .
Still , he 's got a lot of ideas , for a scientist , and some of them come from unusual sources , like tabloidy news reports and science fiction .
It 's a weird thing about scientists -- you would think that they would love science fiction .
But they do n't .
To admit that you get your ideas from science fiction , if you 're a scientist , that 's , like , career - threatening , man , just like it might be professionally risky to say you work in Mark Roth 's lab , no matter how outlandish and game - changing its accomplishments .
And so , yes , Mark Roth is a scientist .
But he 's a scientist in the way that you used to want to be a scientist when you were a kid , with weird substances -- dangerous substances , toxic substances , indeed the most toxic substances known to man ! -- bubbling away in his lab , rather than a scientist in the way that most scientists are scientists , with NIH funding , a stack of grant applications to catch up on , and a commitment to pursue the one or two ideas that got them that precious federal funding to the death .
And so last year , when one of his nephews was in a store in South Carolina and his mother -- Roth 's sister -- came by to get him ... when the boy would n't move because he was so engrossed in the latest edition of Ripley 's Believe It or Not !
and his mother finally had to yell at him ... when the boy trudged dutifully out to the car and , when they were on the road , finally told his mother that she should have let him keep reading that book because Uncle Mark 's in it ... well , Uncle Mark was n't exactly displeased when his sister called him later that night to tell him that he 'd made Ripley's .
He 'd had papers published in Science , he'd had papers published in Nature , he'd had papers published in the most prestigious scientific and medical journals in the world , but Ripley 's Believe It or Not ! , for his work making suspended animation possible in human beings ?
He made Ripley's ?
That was cool , man .
That was an honor .
That was science .
The funny thing is , suspended animation was n't even the weirdest idea he had when he made his decision to stop being a reductionist -- which is not only what most scientists are but also what the NIH pays them to be -- and start becoming an expansionist .
And it was definitely a decision , a moment of desperate clarity .
See , he 'd done his share of bricklaying .
He 'd done his share of saying , This is the protein , this is the gene -- you know , sitting around the campfire , warming his hands with the other scientists .
Indeed , he'd had enough success with RNA splicing at the Carnegie Institution in Baltimore to know two things :
First , that some scientists were n't necessarily happy that he'd had success with RNA splicing ; and , second , that the same scientists who were n't necessarily happy that he'd had success with RNA splicing wanted him to do RNA splicing for the rest of his natural life .
Talk about weird ... but that 's not what convinced him to leave the campfire .
No , what convinced him that he had to start going out into the woods and fetch his ideas from the darkness was ... the darkness itself .
In 1995 , Roth 's wife , Laurie , gave birth to his second daughter , Hannah .
She was born with Down syndrome and a heart with one ventricle .
Mark Roth was thirty - eight years old .
He was , by this time , a researcher at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle , and if his daughter survived , he was looking at having a dependent for as long as he was alive .
He met with Laurie and told her , Hey , whatever happens , life as we know it is over .
This being an academic , this bricklaying , this grant - seeking , this paper - publishing , this encoding of proteins , this scientific nut - gathering , this career of increments , this life of the most punishing and irrevocable patience -- well , it 's not going to cut it .
The obligation of Hannah had liberated him to seek the scientist in himself , and the scientist in himself wanted nothing less than to change the world -- to pursue science for the sake of human benefit , not in the long term , but right here , right now , while Mark Roth was still in his breathing period , whether he knew the molecular basis of the benefit or not .
And then Hannah died .
She died after heart surgery .
She was just over a year old .
And then Mark Roth began to fail .
Like , unequivocally .
He was still doing experiments , he was still doing science , but it was as if he were experimenting with failure itself .
He was committed to it .
He did n't think there was enough of it .
He was going to see where failure took him .
John Clark
The first failure ?
Immortality .
He 'd gotten interested in the possibility of immortality .
You know , it 's not like we do n't know the secret of immortality .
We do .
We know where it is , anyway .
It 's in the gonads .
I mean , you have a child , you become immortal -- humans know that , in the same way that fruit flies know that .
It 's intrinsic knowledge , evolutionary knowledge .
But what most people do n't know is that we can sort of see immortality , under an electron microscope .
The immortal cells that are found in the gonads are called germ cells , and what makes them different from all the other cells in the body is that they 're lumpy .
They 've got these lumps inside them called P - granules , so that 's where the secret of immortality has to be -- in the lumps .
So Mark Roth got very interested in the lumps .
But he was n't the only one .
He was racing to identify one of the lump proteins .
And he lost .
He lost to Susan Strome , a scientist now at UC Santa Cruz .
And there was no second prize .
Science is like Glengarry Glen Ross that way .
First prize is the Cadillac , second prize is you do n't get funding .
Second prize is you have to figure out what to do next .
What Roth figured out to do next was to fail again -- to fail again while making good on his promise to create something of immediate benefit to human beings .
See , it 's notoriously hard to diagnose the autoimmune disease lupus .
But back when he was doing RNA splicing , Roth had figured out a way to do it , and now he set about trying not only to develop the test but to take it to market -- himself .
And he did it .
For three years , that 's all he did , nonstop :
He developed the test , got the patent , and then went out and got FDA approval for what he had created .
He was , as far as he knows , the first scientist ever to get FDA approval for a diagnostic test all by himself , without the help of a corporation , in an academic setting .
Now he had just what he wanted -- something that solved a problem , something that actually helped people .
You know how many people it helped ?
Roth makes a steering wheel with his arms to show how many people it helped .
It helped nobody .
It was a big zero .
Not because it did n't work ; rather , because there was no market for it .
Or because there was a market for it , but it was n't big enough to convince any pharmaceutical company to manufacture and distribute it .
A test that helped solve the age - old problem of diagnosing lupus ?
Roth could n't give it away .
He still gets e-mails from people who think that they might have lupus , or that their kids might have lupus , and who want his test .
And he has to answer that his test does not exist .
So there he was , Mark Roth , at the turn of the century , not just an unfunded scientist at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center but a legendarily unfunded one -- the king of interim funding , who told colleagues that he wanted to be the guy who changed medical science forever , and then , in the next breath , told them all about spontaneous combustion .
Or suspended animation .
Brilliant guy , Mark -- but people actually laughed at him , with his weird ideas .
And yet he learned something from his failures , and what he learned was not that he was too weird ; it was that he was n't weird enough .
His thinking was too small .
If you want to change the world , you 've got to change your thinking first .
And the only way to do that is to take refuge in the unexplained , in the places where the sword is still in the stone .
He had a notebook to that effect .
Filled with unexplained phenomena and sci - fi gleanings , and he would page through it to figure out the weird idea he could turn into the big idea .
He was a little like Goldilocks at this point :
This one 's too far out there , this one 's not far out enough .
He was looking for the one that was just right when he started going through the file he'd kept of people who have survived hypothermia .
Skiers in Switzerland , lost in avalanches ; drunks in Chicago who fell asleep in the dead of winter -- for all intents and purposes , they were dead , except that they were n't , except that they could be revived , hardly the worse for wear .
Weird , right ?
Suspended animation .
And that 's the gamer .
See , it was n't like Roth ever let go of the dream of immortality .
He was still obsessed with the lumps .
He just began thinking about them in a different way .
Okay , the lumps are immortal -- so what do they do ; how do they achieve that end ?
And here 's the answer :
They do nothing .
They 're quiescent .
They 're couch potatoes !
They 're immortal , because for all intents and purposes -- in terms of movement -- they 're already dead !
And maybe that 's what immortality is .
People always think of it in terms of living forever .
But maybe it just means not dying -- not dying when you 're supposed to die , surviving the mortal moments .
We do n't know what life is , anyway .
Not really .
We just know what life does -- it burns oxygen .
It 's a process of combustion .
We 're all just slow - burning candles , making our way through our allotment of precious O 2 until it becomes our toxin , until we burn out , until we get old and die .
But we live on 21 percent oxygen , just as we live at 37 degrees .
They 're related .
Decrease the oxygen to 5 percent , we die .
But , look , the concentration of oxygen in the blood that runs through our capillaries is only 2 or 3 percent .
We 're almost dead already !
So what if we turn down the candle 's need for oxygen ?
What if we dim the candle so much that we do n't even have the energy to die ?
And so began Mark Roth 's career as a deanimator .
As a gorker .
Gorking is ... well , gorking .
You take away some creature 's supply of oxygen , you 're gorking it , man .
The trick , of course , is bringing it back .
In the beginning , that was n't so easy , because in the beginning Roth was just free - associating .
He was using heavy water , rat poison , and he was a deanimator without being a reanimator .
Other scientists were laughing at him :
Hey , Roth , did you suspend anything today ?
But then he did .
He gorked some nematodes -- roundworms -- with nitrogen .
An inert gas , sure , but it crowded out the oxygen available to them ; it diminished the atmosphere .
Roth took them to the Death Hole , which was an atmosphere of less than 1 percent oxygen .
They died .
But then he took them beyond the Death Hole , and they came back when oxygen was reintroduced .
There was life beyond the Death Hole !
So he tried carbon monoxide .
Talk about gorking : Colorless , odorless , the agent of choice for many of the world 's yearly cull of suicides , CO is Thanatos in a bottle -- but it did n't kill the worms .
It just dimmed the candle , not by taking away the supply of oxygen but rather by preventing the worms from using it .
And that was the leap that Roth made -- employing toxins for benefit .
Using one of the most toxic substances known to man to interfere with the toxic effects of oxygen .
See , when creatures die of hypoxia , they do n't die because they do n't have enough oxygen ; they die because they 're still burning the oxygen they do n't have enough of .
What Roth did was find a way to turn off -- or turn down -- the fire .
What he did was find a way to separate the living cell not from oxygen itself but from the capacity to use it .
Still , that was worms , and he was looking for human benefit .
It was n't as if he was ever going to convince any sane human being of the benefit of carbon monoxide .
So one night in 2002 , he was watching TV , thinking of what he usually thought of -- what kind of toxins he might be able to use to stop mammals from burning oxygen .
He was watching Nova .
It had a feature on these caves in Mexico that exhaled great lungfuls of hydrogen sulfide , an egg - smelling gas more toxic than carbon monoxide by a factor of ten .
Nothing should live in those caves ; instead , the caves were full of all sorts of fascinating creatures that tempted spelunkers to go down to see them .
And the spelunkers had to be really , really , really careful or else they 'd get gorked .
They had to wear all sorts of special gear or else they 'd get gorked with one breath of hydrogen sulfide .
Deanimated with a single breath !
Roth did n't sleep for three days .
He ran around telling anyone who would listen about hydrogen sulfide , and plenty of people -- his neighbors , mostly -- who would n't .
And by the time he stopped burning , he had figured out not only the utility of hydrogen sulfide as a beneficial toxin but also as a kind of metaphysics , based on the duality of oxygen and sulfur .
Did you know that the existence of DNA -- life -- predated the existence of oxygen ?
Did you know that the earliest life existed not by breathing oxygen but rather by eating rocks ?
Did you know that the rocks were sulfur ?
Did you know that we 're descended from those rock - eating microbes ?
Did you know that our bodies make hydrogen sulfide ?
Did you know that our bodies probably use hydrogen sulfide to keep from burning up on oxygen ?
Did you know that sulfur was also called brimstone ?
That before Jesus was raised from the dead , he went into a cave ?
Of course , Roth was still unfunded .
He was still a failed and unfunded researcher who was now seeking to buy large quantities of poison gas in the year following 9/11 .
He did n't go to the NIH for it , that 's for sure .
He went to Mark Groudine , the head of his department at Fred Hutchinson .
He asked Mark G. for the $ 20,000 that would enable him to buy a few tanks of hydrogen sulfide and the equipment that would allow him to measure the responses of the mice he intended to gork .
Mark G. worked right next to Mark R. and had been listening to two or three ideas a day from Mark R. for years .
He gave him the money .
Roth gorked the mice .
Roth 's lab started gorking everything in sight : yeast , nematodes , mice , rats , dogs , pigs ... but it was the paper Roth published the previous year on zebra - fish embryos that would finally get him federal money .
Not from NIH , though .
The zebra - fish paper was about stopping the heart of zebra - fish embryos .
It was about switching their hearts on and off .
The paper reported that the Roth lab was able to switch off the zebra - fish hearts for , like , nine hours before switching them back on again .
I mean , those fish were dead ....
And so one day in 2001 Roth got a call in his lab .
It was from DARPA .
That 's the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency .
That 's the Pentagon 's arm for applied scientific research and " high risk , high payoff " freethinking .
It 's a strange , oxymoronic place that , aside from the creative lethality of its intentions , might be Mark Roth 's institutional counterpart .
" Did you really do what you say you did ? " the DARPA program manager asked Roth .
When Roth assured him that yes , he did , and that what he was doing was trying to get people not to die when they have heart attacks , the DARPA guy said , Well , we 're trying to get people not to die when they bleed out , and he started working on getting Roth paid .
Roth never did get NIH money , though .
Well , he had some , for some bricklaying work he was doing on chromosomal separation .
But when he published his first paper on suspended animation and thanked the NIH for its support , the NIH freaked .
What 's suspended animation , after all , when you could be putting federal money into advancing our knowledge of chromosomal separation ?
But he never really was an NIH guy anyway , because he was never really interested in the mechanism of suspended animation -- he was interested in the effect .
He was interested in the benefit .
There are people in his lab who are , at this moment , trying to account for the genetics of suspended animation and the role of hydrogen sulfide in the maintenance of metabolic flexibility , but Roth is a pragmatist .
It sounds funny , calling a guy who says that he 's interested in exploring the genetics of spontaneous combustion a pragmatist , but Roth grew up poor outside Philadelphia .
After their father died , he and his brothers grew up in a boys ' school that doubled as an orphanage , and though you lose some things when you get sent away from home at age seven -- you lose love -- you do become pragmatic and self - sufficient .
Which is why once Roth deduced that there was the possibility that his use of hydrogen sulfide to dim the candle could change the standard of critical care not just in warfare but in hospitals around the world , he founded a biotech company in 2005 to market it .
It 's called Ikaria , after the island with regenerative sulfur springs mentioned by Herodotus .
We 're not talking about a company that might market , say , a diagnostic test for lupus here ; we 're talking about a company whose scientific mission is ruthlessly subordinated to the values of human benefit and scalability ; we 're talking about a biotechnology firm that , although started with venture capital , wound up purchasing a company that deals in pharmaceutical gases , such as the nitric oxide used to save the lives of blue babies ; we 're talking about a company with revenues of $ 200 million a year , a company that , until the collapse of the financial markets , was expected to go public with one of the biggest biotech IPOs ever .
Mark Roth is a major stockholder .
He has always considered himself more of a throwback -- a throwback to the days before basic science meant the ferreting out of molecular mechanisms .
Now he wants to be a throwback to the days when scientists were rich men who could fund themselves .
He wants to be a success so he can go back to pursuing failure .
He wants to go away from the campfire , into the woods , and have the option of not coming back .
You know what his problem is now ?
He was , and is , right .
That 's not necessarily a good thing .
He knows a lot of guys who are right .
And it 's all over for them .
The greatest freedom in the world -- and the only real freedom for a scientist -- is the freedom to be wrong .
And that 's the freedom Mark Roth is underwriting , with a company committed to saving the lives of bleeding and burning men .
Mark Roth keeps a little bottle on his desk , a pharmaceutical - sized vial full of clear liquid .
It 's got an orange plastic cap and a gold ribbon wrapped around the neck .
It 's a hydrogen - sulfide derivative , and Ikaria 's first suspended - animation product .
It 's completed Phase 1 trials in Australia and Canada .
It 's being tested on humans , to make sure it 's safe .
He 's gorking people now !
He 's dimming human candles !
It 's also being tested on pigs in Texas .
The military is doing those tests .
They 're doing surgery on anesthetized pigs , and then gorking them , to see if they survive the bleedout .
If it works , it 's going to be considered for emergency use in Iraq .
Would it have saved the life of his daughter ?
It might have .
She died a month after the surgery , but basically she bled out .
She bled out .
You know , a few years ago , Roth went to Alaska on a trip .
He went to Fairbanks , and it was freaking cold , man .
It was 30 degrees below zero , and he saw something that he never forgot .
He saw crows flying .
These were creatures made of feathers and hollow bones .
They had no right even to be alive at 30 below , but there they were , and they were flying .
The image has haunted him to this day , because he can't explain it .
And that 's what science is .
You do the same thing day after day , you see the same thing day after day , and then suddenly you see something unaccountable , impossible -- believe it or not -- and it stays with you .
All creatures die .
But the things that haunt you , they get to live forever .
