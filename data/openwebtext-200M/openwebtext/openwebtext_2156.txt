PRINCETON , NJ -- Barack Obama continues to hold a significant lead over Hillary Clinton , 51 % to 43 % , in Democratic voters ' presidential nomination preferences .
Gallup Poll Daily tracking from April 5 - 7 shows Obama with an eight percentage point advantage , similar to the 9 - point advantage he enjoyed in Monday 's release .
Both days rank among Obama 's best to date , with his high - water mark a 10 - point advantage in March 27 - 29 polling .
( To view the complete trend since Jan. 3 , 2008 , click here . )
The real question is whether Obama can sustain an advantage , something he has been unable to do thus far .
His best stretch was a four - day run of statistically significant leads spanning March 25 - 27 through March 28 - 30 polling , when Clinton came under scrutiny for exaggerating the danger she faced on a trip to Bosnia as first lady .
All three presidential candidates -- Clinton , Obama , and Republican John McCain -- will spend time today in senate hearings questioning Gen. David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker about U.S. progress in the Iraq War .
This will return the Iraq War issue to the forefront of the campaign -- an issue that offers a stark contrast between ardent war supporter McCain and the Democrats , who are critical of the war .
The full impact of the hearings on general election preferences will be known in coming days .
Gallup Poll Daily tracking based on April 3 - 7 data shows slight movement toward the Democrats before the hearings took place .
Obama has nudged ahead of McCain by one percentage point , 45 % to 44 % , after the two were tied the prior three days .
That 1 - point advantage is not statistically significant , but is notable in that it is the first time in almost a month that McCain has not been ahead of nor tied with Obama .
Clinton has also picked up versus McCain in the latest trial heat , which now shows an even race with 46 % of registered voters supporting each candidate .
McCain held a 2 - point advantage for the prior three days .
Today 's results mark the first time in nearly a month that McCain has not held at least a slight edge over Clinton .

It 's amazing how powerful the combining of simple technology with common sense can be .
In business , we used to call it " guerrilla marketing . "
Using low cost , high impact methods to get the message out .
In the land of freeways , what could be a more cost effective method ?
The Highway Blogger makes a good point .
Hundreds of people all over the country could be doing this .
At which point , we transform our nation from a place of silent consent to one of endless activism .
John Adams used to call it " setting bonfire in the mind . "
We need to get back to that .
I see a lot of people are getting the idea .

WASHINGTON – Democrat Barack Obama said Thursday that Wednesday night ’s contentious debate , where he was peppered with questions about his words and associations , was a preview of Republican tactics against him in the fall election .
“ That was the rollout of the Republican campaign in November , ” he said at a town hall meeting in Raleigh , N.C.
“ They will try to focus on these issues that do n’t have anything to do with how you ’re paying your bills at the end of the month . ”
Saying that he has shown “ some restraint ” in running against a rival Democrat , the Illinois senator said , “ If the Republicans come at me , I will come right back at them .
. . .
I wo n’t have as much restraint with the Republicans . ”
At the town hall meeting , Obama said that New York Sen. Hillary Clinton “ looked in her element , taking every opportunity to get a dig in there . ”
Calling her campaign “ a textbook Washington game , ” Obama said , “ That ’s her right , to kind of twist the knife in a little bit . ”
Clinton did not explicitly mention Obama or the debate ’s fireworks at a forum with several hundred students and others at Haverford College in Pennsylvania .
The New York senator , who appeared with her daughter and mother , focused on her proposals to expand federal support for expanded family leave , broader pre-school and tax credits for Americans who care for their parents .
“ We need to look more broadly at how we can help families , ” Clinton said .
Meanwhile on Thursday , Clinton ’s campaign denied that she had referred disparagingly to blue - collar workers after they voted Republican in the 1994 congressional elections , which gave the GOP control of Congress .
The allegation , which surfaced Wednesday on the Huffington Post , is that at a Camp David retreat in January 1995 , then - first lady Clinton told her husband to abandon Southern working - class voters who had deserted his party at the polls .
“ Screw ’em , ” she said , according to several witnesses .
“ You do n’t owe them a thing , Bill .
They ’ve done nothing for you .
You do n’t have to do anything for them . ”
Thursday her campaign denied the charge .
From WikiLeaks
Wikileaks has obtained the " Petraeus doctrine " the Pentagon did n't want to show you .
JULIAN ASSANGE ( investigative editor )
June 16 , 2008 , updated : October 8 , 2008
Nicaraguan civil - war victims , 1978
“ [ T ] he psychological effectiveness of the CSDF concept starts by reversing the insurgent strategy of making the government the repressor .
It forces the insurgents to cross a critical threshold - that of attacking and killing the very class of people they are supposed to be liberating .
„ — US Special Forces doctrine obtained by Wikileaks
So states the US Special Forces counterinsurgency manual obtained by Wikileaks , Foreign Internal Defense Tactics Techniques and Procedures for Special Forces ( 1994 , 2004 ) .
The manual may be critically described as " what the US learned about running death squads and propping up corrupt government in Latin America and how to apply it to other places " .
Its contents are both history defining for Latin America and , given the continued role of US Special Forces in the suppression of insurgencies , including in Iraq and Afghanistan , history making .
The leaked manual , which has been verified with military sources , is the official US Special Forces doctrine for Foreign Internal Defense or FID .
FID operations are designed to prop up " friendly " governments facing popular revolution or guerilla insurgency .
FID interventions are often covert or quasi - covert due to the unpopular nature of the governments being supported ( " In formulating a realistic policy for the use of advisors , the commander must carefully gauge the psychological climate of the HN [ Host Nation ] and the United States . " )
The manual directly advocates training paramilitaries , pervasive surveillance , censorship , press control and restrictions on labor unions & political parties .
It directly advocates warrantless searches , detainment without charge and ( under varying circumstances ) the suspension of habeas corpus .
It directly advocates employing terrorists or prosecuting individuals for terrorism who are not terrorists , running false flag operations and concealing human rights abuses from journalists .
And it repeatedly advocates the use of subterfuge and " psychological operations " ( propaganda ) to make these and other " population & resource control " measures more palatable .
The content has been particularly informed by the long United States involvement in El Salvador .
In 2005 a number of credible media reports suggested the Pentagon was intensely debating " the Salvador option " for Iraq . [ 1 ] .
According to the New York Times Magazine :
The template for Iraq today is not Vietnam , with which it has often been compared , but El Salvador , where a right - wing government backed by the United States fought a leftist insurgency in a 12 - year war beginning in 1980 .
The cost was high — more than 70,000 people were killed , most of them civilians , in a country with a population of just six million .
Most of the killing and torturing was done by the army and the right - wing death squads affiliated with it .
According to an Amnesty International report in 2001 , violations committed by the army and associated groups included ‘‘ extrajudicial executions , other unlawful killings , ‘ disappearances ’ and torture .
. . .
Whole villages were targeted by the armed forces and their inhabitants massacred . ’’
As part of President Reagan ’s policy of supporting anti-Communist forces , hundreds of millions of dollars in United States aid was funneled to the Salvadoran Army , and a team of 55 Special Forces advisers , led for several years by Jim Steele , trained front - line battalions that were accused of significant human rights abuses .
US trained " death squad " victims in San Salvador , 1981
The same article states James Steele and many other former Central American Special Forces " military advisors " have now been appointed at a high level to Iraq .
In 1993 a United Nations truth commission on El Salvador , which examined 22,000 atrocities that occurred during the twelve - year civil war , attributed 85 percent of the abuses to the US - backed El Salvador military and its paramilitary death squads .
It is worth noting what the US Ambassador to El Salvador , Robert E. White ( now the president for the Center for International Policy ) had to say as early as 1980 , in State Department documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act :
The major , immediate threat to the existence of this government is the right - wing violence .
In the city of San Salvador , the hired thugs of the extreme right , some of them well - trained Cuban and Nicaraguan terrorists , kill moderate left leaders and blow up government buildings .
In the countryside , elements of the security forces torture and kill the campesinos , shoot up their houses and burn their crops .
At least two hundred refugees from the countryside arrive daily in the capital city .
This campaign of terror is radicalizing the rural areas just as surely as Somoza 's National Guard did in Nicaragua .
Unfortunately , the command structure of the army and the security forces either tolerates or encourages this activity .
These senior officers believe or pretend to believe that they are eliminating the guerillas . [ 2 ]
Selected extracts follow .
Note that the manual is 219 pages long and contains substantial material throughout .
These extracts should merely be considered representative .
Emphasis has been added for further selectivity .

Counterintelligence
[...]
Most of the counterintelligence measures used will be overt in nature and aimed at protecting installations , units , and information and detecting espionage , sabotage , and subversion .
Examples of counterintelligence measures to use are
Background investigations and records checks of persons in sensitive positions and persons whose loyalty may be questionable .
Maintenance of files on organizations , locations , and individuals of counterintelligence interest .
Internal security inspections of installations and units .
Control of civilian movement within government - controlled areas .
Identification systems to minimize the chance of insurgents gaining access to installations or moving freely .
Unannounced searches and raids on suspected meeting places .
Censorship .
[...]
PSYOP [ Psychological Operations ] are essential to the success of PRC [ Population & Resources Control ] .
For maximum effectiveness , a strong psychological operations effort is directed toward the families of the insurgents and their popular support base .
The PSYOP aspect of the PRC program tries to make the imposition of control more palatable to the people by relating the necessity of controls to their safety and well - being .
PSYOP efforts also try to create a favorable national or local government image and counter the effects of the insurgent propaganda effort .
Control Measures
SF [ US Special Forces ] can advise and assist HN [ Host Nation ] forces in developing and implementing control measures .
Among these measures are the following :
Security Forces .
Police and other security forces use PRC [ Population & Resources Control ] measures to deprive the insurgent of support and to identify and locate members of his infrastructure .
Appropriate PSYOP [ Psychological Operations ] help make these measures more acceptable to the population by explaining their need .
The government informs the population that the PRC measures may cause an inconvenience but are necessary due to the actions of the insurgents .
Restrictions .
Rights on the legality of detention or imprisonment of personnel ( for example , habeas corpus ) may be temporarily suspended .
This measure must be taken as a last resort , since it may provide the insurgents with an effective propaganda theme .
PRC [ Population & Resources Control ] measures can also include curfews or blackouts , travel restrictions , and restricted residential areas such as protected villages or resettlement areas .
Registration and pass systems and control of sensitive items ( resources control ) and critical supplies such as weapons , food , and fuel are other PRC measures .
Checkpoints , searches , roadblocks ; surveillance , censorship , and press control ; and restriction of activity that applies to selected groups ( labor unions , political groups and the like ) are further PRC measures .
[...]
Legal Considerations .
All restrictions , controls , and DA measures must be governed by the legality of these methods and their impact on the populace .
In countries where government authorities do not have wide latitude in controlling the population , special or emergency legislation must be enacted .
This emergency legislation may include a form of martial law permitting government forces to search without warrant , to detain without bringing formal charges , and to execute other similar actions .
[...]
Psychological Operations
PSYOP can support the mission by discrediting the insurgent forces to neutral groups , creating dissension among the insurgents themselves , and supporting defector programs .
Divisive programs create dissension , disorganization , low morale , subversion , and defection within the insurgent forces .
Also important are national programs to win insurgents over to the government side with offers of amnesty and rewards .
Motives for surrendering can range from personal rivalries and bitterness to disillusionment and discouragement .
Pressure from the security forces has persuasive power .
[...]
Intelligence personnel must consider the parameters within which a revolutionary movement operates .
Frequently , they establish a centralized intelligence processing center to collect and coordinate the amount of information required to make long - range intelligence estimates .
Long - range intelligence focuses on the stable factors existing in an insurgency .
For example , various demographic factors ( ethnic , racial , social , economic , religious , and political characteristics of the area in which the underground movement takes places ) are useful in identifying the members of the underground .
Information about the underground organization at national , district , and local level is basic in FID [ Foreign Internal Defense ] and / or IDAD operations .
Collection of specific short - range intelligence about the rapidly changing variables of a local situation is critical .
Intelligence personnel must gather information on members of the underground , their movements , and their methods .
Biographies and photos of suspected underground members , detailed information on their homes , families , education , work history , and associates are important features of short - range intelligence .
Destroying its tactical units is not enough to defeat the enemy .
The insurgent 's underground cells or infrastructure must be neutralized first because the infrastructure is his main source of tactical intelligence and political control .
Eliminating the infrastructure within an area achieves two goals : it ensures the government 's control of the area , and it cuts off the enemy 's main source of intelligence .
An intelligence and operations command center ( IOCC ) is needed at district or province level .
This organization becomes the nerve center for operations against the insurgent infrastructure .
Information on insurgent infrastructure targets should come from such sources as the national police and other established intelligence nets and agents and individuals ( informants ) .
The highly specialized and sensitive nature of clandestine intelligence collection demands specially selected and highly trained agents .
Information from clandestine sources is often highly sensitive and requires tight control to protect the source .
However , tactical information upon which a combat response can be taken should be passed to the appropriate tactical level .
The spotting , assessment , and recruitment of an agent is not a haphazard process regardless of the type agent being sought .
During the assessment phase , the case officer determines the individual 's degree of intelligence , access to target , available or necessary cover , and motivation .
He initiates the recruitment and coding action only after he determines the individual has the necessary attributes to fulfill the needs .
All agents are closely observed and those that are not reliable are relieved .
A few well - targeted , reliable agents are better and more economical than a large number of poor ones .
A system is needed to evaluate the agents and the information they submit .
The maintenance of an agent master dossier ( possibly at the SFOD B level ) can be useful in evaluating the agent on the value and quality of information he has submitted .
The dossier must contain a copy of the agent 's source data report and every intelligence report he submitted .
Security forces can induce individuals among the general populace to become informants .
Security forces use various motives ( civic - mindedness , patriotism , fear , punishment avoidance , gratitude , revenge or jealousy , financial rewards ) as persuasive arguments .
They use the assurance of protection from reprisal as a major inducement .
Security forces must maintain the informant 's anonymity and must conceal the transfer of information from the source to the security agent .
The security agent and the informant may prearrange signals to coincide with everyday behavior .
Surveillance , the covert observation of persons and places , is a principal method of gaining and confirming intelligence information .
Surveillance techniques naturally vary with the requirements of different situations .
The basic procedures include mechanical observation ( wiretaps or concealed microphones ) , observation from fixed locations , and physical surveillance of subjects .
Whenever a suspect is apprehended during an operation , a hasty interrogation takes place to gain immediate information that could be of tactical value .
The most frequently used methods for gathering information ( map studies and aerial observation ) , however , are normally unsuccessful .
Most PWs can not read a map .
When they are taken on a visual reconnaissance flight , it is usually their first flight and they cannot associate an aerial view with what they saw on the ground .
The most successful interrogation method consists of a map study based on terrain information received from the detainee .
The interrogator first asks the detainee what the sun 's direction was when he left the base camp .
From this information , he can determine a general direction .
The interrogator then asks the detainee how long it took him to walk to the point where he was captured .
Judging the terrain and the detainee 's health , the interrogator can determine a general radius in which the base camp can be found ( he can use an overlay for this purpose ) .
He then asks the detainee to identify significant terrain features he saw on each day of his journey , ( rivers , open areas , hills , rice paddies , swamps ) .
As the detainee speaks and his memory is jogged , the interrogator finds these terrain features on a current map and gradually plots the detainee 's route to finally locate the base camp .
If the interrogator is unable to speak the detainee 's language , he interrogates through an interpreter who received a briefing beforehand .
A recorder may also assist him .
If the interrogator is not familiar with the area , personnel who are familiar with the area brief him before the interrogation and then join the interrogation team .
The recorder allows the interrogator a more free - flowing interrogation .
The recorder also lets a knowledgeable interpreter elaborate on points the detainee has mentioned without the interrogator interrupting the continuity established during a given sequence .
The interpreter can also question certain inaccuracies , keeping pressure on the subject .
The interpreter and the interrogator have to be well trained to work as a team .
The interpreter has to be familiar with the interrogation procedures .
His preinterrogation briefings must include information on the detainee 's health , the circumstances resulting in his detention , and the specific information required .
A successful interrogation is contingent upon continuity and a welltrained interpreter .
A tape recorder ( or a recorder taking notes ) enhances continuity by freeing the interrogator from time - consuming administrative tasks .
[...]
Political Structures .
A tightly disciplined party organization , formally structured to parallel the existing government hierarchy , may be found at the center of some insurgent movements .
In most instances , this organizational structure will consist of committed organizations at the village , district province , and national levels .
Within major divisions and sections of an insurgent military headquarters , totally distinct but parallel command channels exist .
There are military chains of command and political channels of control .
The party ensures complete domination over the military structure using its own parallel organization .
It dominates through a political division in an insurgent military headquarters , a party cell or group in an insurgent military unit , or a political military officer .
[...]
Special Intelligence - Gathering Operations
Alternative intelligence - gathering techniques and sources , such as doppelganger or pseudo operations , can be tried and used when it is hard to obtain information from the civilian populace .
These pseudo units are usually made up of ex-guerrilla and / or security force personnel posing as insurgents .
They circulate among the civilian populace and , in some cases , infiltrate guerrilla units to gather information on guerrilla movements and its support infrastructure .
Much time and effort must be used to persuade insurgents to switch allegiance and serve with the security forces .
Prospective candidates must be properly screened and then given a choice of serving with the HN [ Host Nation ] security forces or facing prosecution under HN law for terrorist crimes .
Government security force units and teams of varying size have been used in infiltration operations against underground and guerrilla forces .
They have been especially effective in getting information on underground security and communications systems , the nature and extent of civilian support and underground liaison , underground supply methods , and possible collusion between local government officials and the underground .
Before such a unit can be properly trained and disguised , however , much information about the appearance , mannerisms , and security procedures of enemy units must be gathered .
Most of this information comes from defectors or reindoctrinated prisoners .
Defectors also make excellent instructors and guides for an infiltrating unit .
In using a disguised team , the selected men should be trained , oriented , and disguised to look and act like authentic underground or guerrilla units .
In addition to acquiring valuable information , the infiltrating units can demoralize the insurgents to the extent that they become overly suspicious and distrustful of their own units .
[...]
After establishing the cordon and designating a holding area , the screening point or center is established .
All civilians in the cordoned area will then pass through the screening center to be classified .
National police personnel will complete , if census data does not exist in the police files , a basic registration card and photograph all personnel over the age of 15 .
They print two copies of each photo - one is pasted to the registration card and the other to the village book ( for possible use in later operations and to identify ralliers and informants ) .
The screening element leader ensures the screeners question relatives , friends , neighbors , and other knowledgeable individuals of guerrilla leaders or functionaries operating in the area on their whereabouts , activities , movements , and expected return .
The screening area must include areas where police and military intelligence personnel can privately interview selected individuals .
The interrogators try to convince the interviewees that their cooperation will not be detected by the other inhabitants .
They also discuss , during the interview , the availability of monetary rewards for certain types of information and equipment .
[...]
Civilian Self - Defense Forces [ Paramilitaries , or , especially in an El - Salvador or Colombian civil war context , right wing " death squads " ]
When a village accepts the CSDF program , the insurgents cannot choose to ignore it .
To let the village go unpunished will encourage other villages to accept the government 's CSDF program .
The insurgents have no choice ; they have to attack the CSDF village to provide a lesson to other villages considering CSDF .
In a sense , the psychological effectiveness of the CSDF concept starts by reversing the insurgent strategy of making the government the repressor .
It forces the insurgents to cross a critical threshold - that of attacking and killing the very class of people they are supposed to be liberating .
To be successful , the CSDF program must have popular support from those directly involved or affected by it .
The average peasant is not normally willing to fight to his death for his national government .
His national government may have been a succession of corrupt dictators and inefficient bureaucrats .
These governments are not the types of institutions that inspire fight - to - the - death emotions in the peasant .
The village or town , however , is a different matter .
The average peasant will fight much harder for his home and for his village than he ever would for his national government .
The CSDF concept directly involves the peasant in the war and makes it a fight for the family and village instead of a fight for some faraway irrelevant government .
[...]
Members of the CSDF receive no pay for their civil duties .
In most instances , however , they derive certain benefits from voluntary service .
These benefits can range from priority of hire for CMO projects to a place at the head of ration lines .
In El Salvador , CSDF personnel ( they were called civil defense there ) were given a U.S. - funded life insurance policy with the wife or next of kin as the beneficiary .
If a CSDF member died in the line of duty , the widow or next of kin was ceremoniously paid by an HN official .
The HN administered the program and a U.S. advisor who maintained accountability of the funds verified the payment .
The HN [ Host Nation ] exercises administrative and visible control .
Responsiveness and speedy payment are essential in this process since the widow normally does not have a means of support and the psychological effect of the government assisting her in her time of grief impacts on the entire community .
These and other benefits offered by or through the HN government are valuable incentives for recruiting and sustaining the CSDF .
[...]
The local CSDF members select their leaders and deputy leaders ( CSDF groups and teams ) in elections organized by the local authorities .
In some cases , the HN [ Host Nation ] appoints a leader who is a specially selected member of the HN security forces trained to carry out this task .
Such appointments occurred in El Salvador where the armed forces have established a formal school to train CSDF commanders .
Extreme care and close supervision are required to avoid abuses by CSDF leaders .
[...]
The organization of a CSDF can be similar to that of a combat group .
This organization is effective in both rural and urban settings .
For example , a basic group , having a strength of 107 members , is broken down into three 35 - man elements plus a headquarters element of 2 personnel .
Each 35 - man element is further broken down into three 1 l-man teams and a headquarters element of 2 personnel .
Each team consists of a team leader , an assistant team leader , and three 3 - man cells .
This organization can be modified to accommodate the number of citizens available to serve .
[...]
Weapons training for the CSDF personnel is critical .
Skill at arms decides the outcome of battle and must be stressed .
Of equal importance is the maintenance and care of weapons .
CSDF members are taught basic rifle marksmanship with special emphasis on firing from fixed positions and during conditions of limited visibility .
Also included in the marksmanship training program are target detection and fire discipline .
Training ammunition is usually allocated to the CSDF on the basis of a specified number of rounds for each authorized weapon .
A supporting HN government force or an established CSDF logistic source provides the ammunition to support refresher training .
[...]
Acts of misconduct by HN [ Host Nation ] personnel
All members of training assistance teams must understand their responsibilities concerning acts of misconduct by HN personnel .
Team members receive briefings before deployment on what to do if they encounter or observe such acts .
Common Article 3 of the four Geneva Conventions lists prohibited acts by parties to the convention .
Such acts are -
Violence to life and person , in particular , murder , mutilation , cruel treatment , and torture .
Taking of hostages .
Outrages against personal dignity , in particular , humiliating and degrading treatment .
Passing out sentences and carrying out executions without previous judgment by a regularly constituted court that affords all the official guarantees that are recog-nized as indispensable by civilized people .
The provisions in the above paragraph represent a level of conduct that the United States expects each foreign country to observe .
If team members encounter prohibited acts they can not stop , they will disengage from the activity , leave the area if possible , and report the incidents immediately to the proper in - country U.S. authorities .
The country team will identify proper U.S. authorities during the team 's initial briefing .
Team members will not discuss such matters with non-U.S. Government authorities such as journalists and civilian contractors .
[...]
Most insurgents ' doctrinal and training documents stress the use of pressure - type mines in the more isolated or less populated areas .
They prefer using commandtype mines in densely populated areas .
These documents stress that when using noncommand - detonated mines , the insurgents use every means to inform the local populace on their location , commensurate with security regulations .
In reality , most insurgent groups suffer from various degrees of deficiency in their C2 [ Command & Control ] systems .
Their C2 does not permit them to verify that those elements at the operational level strictly follow directives and orders .
In the case of the Frente Farabundo Marti de la Liberation Nacional ( FMLN ) in El Salvador , the individual that emplaces the mine is responsible for its recovery after the engagement .
There are problems with this concept .
The individual may be killed or the security forces may gain control of the area .
Therefore , the recovery of the mine is next to impossible .
[...]
Homemade antipersonnel mines are used extensively in El Salvador , Guatemala and Malaysia .
( Eighty percent of all El Salvadoran armed forces casualties in 1986 were due to mines ; in 1987 , soldiers wounded by mines and booby traps averaged 50 to 60 per month . )
The important point to remember is that any homemade mine is the product of the resources available to the insurgent group .
Therefore , no two antipersonnel mines may be the same in their configuration and materials .
Insurgent groups depend to a great extent on materials discarded or lost by security forces personnel .
The insurgents not only use weapons , ammunition , mines , grenades , and demolitions for their original purpose but also in preparing expedient mines and booby traps .
[...]
A series of successful minings carried out by the Viet Cong insurgents on the Cua Viet River , Quang Tri Province , demonstrated their resourcefulness in countering minesweeping tactics .
Initially , chain - dragging sweeps took place morning and evening .
After several successful mining attacks , it was apparent that they laid the mines after the minesweepers passed .
Then , the boats using the river formed into convoys and transited the river with minesweepers 914 meters ahead oft he convoy .
Nevertheless , boats of the convoy were successfully mined in mid-channel , indicating that the mines were again laid after the minesweeper had passed , possibly by using sampans .
Several sampans were observed crossing or otherwise using the channel between the minesweepers and the convoy .
The convoys were then organized so that the minesweepers worked immediately ahead of the convoy .
One convoy successfully passed .
The next convoy had its minesweepers mined and ambushed close to the river banks .
[...]
Military Advisors
[...]
Psychologically pressuring the HN [ Host Nation ] counterpart may sometimes be successful .
Forms of psychological pressure may range from the obvious to the subtle .
The advisor never applies direct threats , pressure , or intimidation on his counterpart Indirect psychological pressure may be applied by taking an issue up the chain of command to a higher U.S. commander .
The U.S. commander can then bring his counterpart to force the subordinate counterpart to comply .
Psychological pressure may obtain quick results but may have very negative side effects .
The counterpart will feel alienated and possibly hostile if the advisor uses such techniques .
Offers of payment in the form of valuables may cause him to become resentful of the obvious control being exerted over him .
In short , psychologically pressuring a counterpart is not recommended .
Such pressure is used only as a last resort since it may irreparably damage the relationship between the advisor and his counterpart
PSYOP [ Psychological Operations ] Support for Military Advisors
The introduction of military advisors requires preparing the populace with which the advisors are going to work .
Before advisors enter a country , the HN [ Host Nation ] government carefully explains their introduction and clearly emphasizes the benefits of their presence to the citizens .
It must provide a credible justification to minimize the obvious propaganda benefits the insurgents could derive from this action .
The country 's dissenting elements label our actions , no matter how well - intended , an " imperialistic intervention . "
Once advisors are committed , their activities should be exploited .
Their successful integration into the HN [ Host Nation ] society and their respect for local customs and mores , as well as their involvement with CA [ Civil Affairs ] projects , are constantly brought to light .
In formulating a realistic policy for the use of advisors , the commander must carefully gauge the psychological climate of the HN [ Host Nation ] and the United States .
[...]
PRC [ Population & Resources Control ] Operations .
Advisors assist their counterparts in developing proper control plans and training programs for PRC measures .
They also help coordinate plans and requests for materiel and submit recommendations to improve the overall effectiveness of operations .
They can be helpful in preparing to initiate control .
Select , organize , and train paramilitary and irregular forces .
Develop PSYOP [ Psychological Operations ] activities to support PRC operations .
Coordinate activities through an area coordination center ( if established ) .
Establish and refine PRC operations .
Intensify intelligence activities .
Establish and refine coordination and communications with other agencies .

ADDRESS OF HIS HOLINESS BENEDICT XVI
TO THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE TWELFTH WORLD CONGRESS
OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION
OF CATHOLIC PRISON PASTORAL CARE
Castel Gandolfo
Thursday , 6 September 2007
Dear Friends ,
I am pleased to welcome you as you gather in Rome for the Twelfth World Congress of the International Commission of Catholic Prison Pastoral Care .
I thank your President , Doctor Christian Kuhn , for the kind words expressed on behalf of the Executive Board of the Commission .
The theme of your Congress this year , “ Discovering the Face of Christ in Every Prisoner ” ( Mt 25:36 ) , aptly portrays your ministry as a vivid encounter with the Lord .
Indeed , in Christ the “ love of God and love of neighbour have become one ” , so that “ in the least of the brethren we find Jesus himself , and in him … God ” ( Deus Caritas Est , 15 ) .
Your ministry requires much patience and perseverance .
Not infrequently there are disappointments and frustrations .
Strengthening the bonds that unite you with your bishops will enable you to find the support and guidance you need to raise awareness of your vital mission .
Indeed , this ministry within the local Christian community will encourage others to join you in performing corporal works of mercy , thus enriching the ecclesial life of the diocese .
Likewise , it will help to draw those whom you serve into the heart of the universal Church , especially through their regular participation in the celebration of the sacraments of Penance and the Holy Eucharist ( cf. Sacramentum Caritatis , 59 ) .
Prisoners easily can be overwhelmed by feelings of isolation , shame and rejection that threaten to shatter their hopes and aspirations for the future .
Within this context , chaplains and their collaborators are called to be heralds of God ’s infinite compassion and forgiveness .
In cooperation with civil authorities , they are entrusted with the weighty task of helping the incarcerated rediscover a sense of purpose so that , with God ’s grace , they can reform their lives , be reconciled with their families and friends , and , insofar as possible , assume the responsibilities and duties which will enable them to conduct upright and honest lives within society .
Judicial and penal institutions play a fundamental role in protecting citizens and safeguarding the common good ( cf. Catechism of the Catholic Church , 2266 ) .
At the same time , they are to aid in rebuilding “ social relationships disrupted by the criminal act committed ” ( cf. Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church , 403 ) .
By their very nature , therefore , these institutions must contribute to the rehabilitation of offenders , facilitating their transition from despair to hope and from unreliability to dependability .
When conditions within jails and prisons are not conducive to the process of regaining a sense of a worth and accepting its related duties , these institutions fail to achieve one of their essential ends .
Public authorities must be ever vigilant in this task , eschewing any means of punishment or correction that either undermine or debase the human dignity of prisoners .
In this regard , I reiterate that the prohibition against torture “ cannot be contravened under any circumstances ” ( Ibid. , 404 ) .
I am confident that your Congress will provide an opportunity to share your experiences of the mysterious countenance of Christ shining through the faces of the imprisoned .
I encourage you in your efforts to show that face to the world as you promote greater respect for the dignity of the detained .
Finally , I pray that your Congress will be an occasion for you yourselves to appreciate anew how , in attending to the needs of the imprisoned , your own eyes are opened to the marvels God does for you each day ( cf. Deus Caritas Est , 18 ) .
With these sentiments I extend my heartfelt wishes to you and all the participants in the Congress for the success of your meeting and willingly impart my Apostolic Blessing to you and your loved ones .
The major showstopper before I was seriously considering going to Git was the lack of an darcsum - like interface for Git .
Yesterday night I finally decided to write it .
git-status ( included as git.el in the Git distribution ) is usually good enough to use , but I often like to do partial commits , that is , commit only parts of a file .
Git can do that now for some time , using git add -- interactive or frontends like git - hunk - commit or git - wt - add .
Still , there was no way to do it conveniently in Emacs .
Let me introduce gitsum :
You can freely delete hunks you do n’t want to commit , split big changes , or even edit the patch directly if you feel adventurous .
It also integrates into git -status so you can easily switch between these frontends .
Gitsum is hosted at http://github.com/chneukirchen/gitsum
( which I highly recommend ) and is mirrored at http://git.vuxu.org/, patches and additions are welcome !
It ’s still very fresh and has some rough corners , but I already notice my increase in productivity .
While we wait , and wait ... and wait for manufactures to perfect long - lasting fuel cells , Apple and others are pursuing at least one other approach : solar augmentation .
In a patent application dated April 24 , 2008 and titled " Solar cells on portable devices " attributed to a number of Apple employees , Apple reveals possible plans to integrate solar cells into devices such as iPods and MacBooks .
The application describes a scenario where , " Solar cells are typically stacked with other layers made of transparent or semi- transparent materials ...
Some of these layers may be used for display or input purposes , and some layers may be coated with various materials or they may be etched with product logos or other patterns . "
In other words , Apple is looking to cover the entire device , including the transparent display , with a layer of solar cells -- the latter approach already patented by Motorola .
While the efficiency of solar cells and existing manufacturing techniques call into question the immediate viability of such an approach , it 's intriguing nonetheless as a means to offset any lost battery life on the move to say , 3G . [ Via MacRumors
From the Libertarian Party of New Hampshire :
At their April board meeting , the Libertarian Party of NH officially endorsed NH House Resolution 24 , which calls for impeachment procedures to start against President Bush and Vice President Cheney .
The resolution is based on rules from the Jefferson Manual of Parliamentary Practice , which states that impeachment proceedings may be initiated by the legislature of a state .
The resolution states many reasons to warrant the start of an impeachment including pressuring states to implement electronic voting , violations of FISA and the Geneva Conventions , for advocating the indefinite detainment of American citizens , warrantless wiretaps of American citizens , and for various actions taken during the conflict in Iraq .
A resolution of this form re-asserts the important role that individual states play in our federalist system , placing a further check against federal - level power and actions , in the executive branch or otherwise .
HR24 is currently awaiting a vote by the full House at their next general session .

Ok , I decided to take a step back from my flawed approach in the last post and play with the idea of power series of functors from a different perspective .
I dusted off my copy of Herbert Wilf 's generatingfunctionology and switched goals to try to see some well known recursive functors or species as formal power series .
It appears that we can pick a few things out about the generating functions of polynomial functors .
As an example :
Maybe x = 1 + x
Ok .
We 're done .
Thank you very much .
I 'll be here all week .
Try the veal ...
For a more serious example , the formal power series for the list [ x ] is just a geometric series :
[ x ] = mu y .
1 + x y -- the mu here is a pleasant fiction , more below = 1 + x ( 1 + x ( 1 + x ( ... ) ) ) = 1 + x + x^ 2 + x^ 3 + ... = 1 / ( 1 -x )
Given the power series of a functor , its nth coefficient * n!
tells you how many distinguishable ways its constructors can house n values .
If we see that a list of n values can be permuted n! ways this has some interesting possibilities for linearizing the storage of some functors .
The list case is boring , we can store a finite list of n elements by supplying the length of the array and an array of n elements , hence ( among other reasons ) the mu above .
Lets try decorated binary trees :
data Tree x = Leaf | Node ( Tree x ) x ( Tree x )
Tree x = mu y. 1 + x * y * y = 1 + x * ( 1 + x * ( ... ) ^ 2 ) ^ 2 = 1 + x + 2x ^ 2 + 5 x ^ 3 + 14x ^ 4 + 42 x ^ 5 + ...
It turns out the coefficients of our generating function are the Catalan numbers , A000108 , commonly denoted C( n ) , which happen to be well known for among other things , being the number of ways you can build a binary tree of n nodes .
This tells us we could store a tree by storing a number n of nodes it contains , an array of that many nodes , and an index 0 < = i < C( n ) to tell you which particular tree you selected .
Not that this is likely to be an incredibly time - efficient encoding , but you could then fmap over the tree by just fmapping over your array .
For a formal power series ,
its derivative is given by differentiating the series term by term :
Consequently we can take the derivative of a list :
( [ ] ' ) x = 1 + 2 x + 3x ^2 + ... = 1/(1-x ) ^2 = ( [ ] :* : [ ] ) x
and rederive the notion that a derivative / one hole context of a list can be represented by a pair of lists .
If we step slightly outside of the Haskell users ' comfort zone and notion of a Functor and allow other Species , we get ( as noted by apfelmus the other day ) that Exp a is just a bag of elements with no predetermined order .
Exp x = 1 + x + x^ 2 / 2 ! + x^ 3 / 3 ! + ... = Bag x
Since there are n!
ways to order n elements and Bag manages to forget that information , we can get a feeling for the meaning of division in this setting .
Similarly we can define : < pre lang= " haskell " > Sinh x = x + x^ 3 / 3 ! + ... -- a Bag of some odd number of elements .
Cosh x = 1 + x^ 2 / 2 ! + ... -- a Bag of some even number of elements .
Then by construction :
Exp = Cosh :+: Sinh
The derivative of Exp is Exp , of Cosh is Sinh , of Sinh is Cosh , all as you would expect .
We can handle other species as well :
Cycle a = 1 + x^ 2 / 2 + x^ 3 / 3 + x^ 4 / 4 + ... -- cycles Cycle_n a = x^n/n -- cycles of n elements Bag_n a = x^n/n! -- bags of n elements
That said , there seem to be some problems , not every functor is well behaved in this way .
Lets take for instance the type of natural numbers given by the functor :
data Nat a = S ( Nat a ) | Z
Then the recurrence blows up , the coefficient for 0 is !
Similarly , if we parameterized a functor on another value we have to deal with the number of cases that other value can denote .
Either a x = |a| + x ( a , x ) = |a| x
This is both good and bad , using the above , we can quickly establish an isomorphism between Either ( ) and the Maybe Functor , but we blow up again for Either Integer .
This gets even worse if we allow ' functors in space . ' ( i.e. functors that can contain functions )
On the other extreme , we might modify our tree example and remove the leaves , yielding infinite decorated cotrees .
Tree x = nu y. x * y * y = x * ( x * ( ... ) ^ 2 ) ^ 2 = 0 + 0 x + 0x ^ 2 + 0x ^ 3 + ...
Then a_n = 0 for all n in the natural numbers , so you can't use the coefficients of the generating function to tell you about the behavior of an infinite structure !
It would appear that the generating function of a functor does not capture what happens in the greatest fixed point case , so we can only use generating functions to describe the behavior of data defined with mu , not in general codata defined by nu .
The Bags and Cycles above are nice examples , but if we wanted to rule out the non-polynomial Functors ( from the Haskell perspective ) in the above then we can simply limit ourselves to ordinary generating functions with natural number coefficients , that is to say generating functions of the form :
To choose to admit bags , cycles and other species etc .
then you need merely also permit exponential generating functions with natural coefficients , that is to say , generating functions of the form :
هل سبق لك أن رأيت آلة القمار؟ بالطبع لديك … لن تكون هنا إذا لم تكن كذلك ، لكن هل تعرف ما الذي يوجد في ...

Alton Kelley , a San Francisco graphic artist whose psychedelic posters and album covers captured the mood and music of the Grateful Dead , the Steve Miller Band , Journey and other top rock ‘ n ’ roll groups of the ‘ 60s and ‘ 70s , has died .
He was 67 .
Kelley died Sunday at his home in Petaluma , Calif. , according to publicist Jennifer Gross .
The cause was complications from osteoporosis .
With his creative partner Stanley Mouse , Kelley helped launch a poster art revolution in the mid-1960s , turning out vividly colored works for concerts at the Avalon Ballroom and Fillmore Auditorium , where Jimi Hendrix , Big Brother and the Holding Company , and Quicksilver Messenger Service were among the headliners .
“ Kelley was one of the first to see it coming , the rise of the psychedelic era in San Francisco , ” Paul Grushkin , who wrote “ The Art of Rock , Posters From Presley to Punk ” ( 1987 ) , said this week .
“ He was a pioneer . ”

Using images inspired by vintage prints and lettering that flows like smoke , Kelley and Mouse designed graphics now considered emblems of the psychedelic age .
The best known of them all is a skull and roses design they created for the Grateful Dead .
“ Kelley had the unique ability to translate the music being played into amazing images that capture the spirit of who we were and what the music was all about , ” Mickey Hart of the Grateful Dead said in a statement this week .
The album covers that came out of the Kelley - Mouse collaboration with the Grateful Dead included “ Workingman ’s Dead ” and “ American Beauty ” in 1970 .

The idea for a skull and roses came from an illustration in “ The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam , ” a collection of poems by the Persian poet who died in 1123 .
Kelley once explained that he found the illustration in a library book , enlarged the image , and added color and other details that dramatically changed it .
“ I knew right away it was a classic , " he said in a 1995 interview with the Palm Beach Post .
He and Mouse created several other graphic images that became signatures for certain bands .
Among them is a Pegasus that looms from the album cover of the Steve Miller Band ’s “ Book of Dreams ” in 1977 and a scarab on the album cover of “ Departure , ” by Journey in 1980 .
“ Images Kelley and Mouse put on playbills , posters and album covers became a major part of the music experience of the time , ” Dell Furano of Signatures Network , which merchandises rock artworks , said in an interview this week .
Kelley was born June 17 , 1940 , in Houlton , Maine .
After high school he worked as a mechanic and took art classes but never graduated from art school .
He moved to San Francisco in about 1965 and helped found the Family Dog Collective , a group that produced some of the first psychedelic dance concerts in San Francisco , with light shows , dancing and poster art as part of the program .

He met Mouse about a year after he arrived in San Francisco .
At the time , the Haight - Ashbury district was starting to bubble over .
“ It was really fun .
Everybody was really enjoying themselves , ” Kelley told the San Francisco Chronicle last year .
“ We all came out of the rock ‘ n ’ roll world . ”
When they began working together , “ Stanley and I had no idea what we were doing , ” Kelley told the Chronicle .
“ We had free rein to just go graphically crazy . ”
Their posters combined images borrowed from Native American and Chinese art , Art Nouveau and Art Deco , reworked in acid colors and swirling letters that were a dramatic break with tradition .
“ Before that , all advertising was pretty much just typeset with a photograph of something , ” Kelley told the Chronicle .
“ It was a glory period for record album covers , ” Grushkin said of the artists ’ inventions .
“ Kelley and Mouse created art that captured what the music sounded like . ”

Kelley continued working as a graphic artist throughout his career , sometimes teaming up with Mouse .
Their most recent project was for the March induction ceremony of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland .
Kelley is survived by his wife , Marguerite ; three children ; two grandchildren ; his mother , Annie ; and his sister , Kathy .

When buildings collapse following an earthquake anywhere in the world , the first instinct is to presume Mother Nature is at fault .
The second is to wonder why the buildings were n't built to account for the risk of earthquakes .
The third step is where people go really wrong .
They blame the builders for failing to observe building codes and the government for failing to enforce them .
This is the state of commentary on the hellish situation in Dujiangyan , China , where tens of thousands of people died — including thousands of children in as many as 7,000 schoolrooms .
A particular focus of much coverage has been the Xianjian Primary School , where hundreds of kids died .
A parent of one of the children told the New York Times : " this is not a natural disaster .
This is not good steel .
It does n't meet standards .
They stole our children . "
Now people are demanding that the local government be held accountable .
The problem is that these buildings were not up to standards , but the more fundamental question is why they were not .
It is not merely a matter of obedience .
It is a matter of economics .
The people who build buildings need to be held liable for the structural integrity of the buildings .
But of course a lack of accountability is a famed feature of all governments everywhere , in contrast with private enterprise .
China has undergone a private - enterprise revolution in the last decade and a half , one that has transformed the country and dramatically raised the living standards of the population .
But the system that built the schools that collapsed is as stuck in the past as the system of Chinese communism itself .
The government orders schools to be built and they must be built , period .
What if the resources are n't available ?
What if the workers lack the skill to accomplish the task ?
What if the machines that are to build them do not work properly and lack replacement parts ?
What if resource supply should be allocated differently according to the needs of the people ?
Under socialism , economics is beside the point .
The schools must appear .
This is the way the system works .
Consider the four - story Xinjian school .
The building smashed to the ground , even as a nearby 10 - story hotel was completely undisturbed by the earthquake .
What are the details behind the construction of Xinjian ?
As quoted from the Times :
When Xinjian was built in 1992 , many parents worked for the Dongfeng Cement Factory .
Company bosses donated 40 tons of cement .
But that was not enough .
" Everybody knew they did n't have enough cement , " said Dai Chuanbin , an older man familiar with the project .
" So they used a lot of sand . "
Parents say the township government cut costs further by hiring farmers to do the work instead of trained construction crews .
One former school official recalled that workers poured the foundation during such heavy rains that it collapsed .
Another foundation had to be poured .
The school opened in 1993 and would quickly be overrun with students .
The detached annex was rebuilt in 1998 after inspectors deemed it substandard .
Ms. Deng , the former principal , recalled that nearby construction work in May 2006 caused the flooring in the main school building to shake violently .
But she said she never had reason to believe the building was structurally unsound and never filed any written complaints with higher officials .
Many people in fact complained and suspected grave trouble .
But so far as the government knew , the plan had been fulfilled .
The school existed and that 's all that mattered .
Another problem was introduced by the lack of steel rod reinforcement for the concrete .
It was added according to plan , but the rod was way too thin relative to the thickness of the walls themselves .
When they came under pressure , they bent like paperclips and the concrete crumbled all around .
Looking at the pictures taken by photographers at the Times , one wonders how the building was able to stay up at all .
Conservation is n't always a good thing , now is it ?
But where to use resources and where and how to conserve them ?
This is the essential economic problem that socialism cannot solve .
And why ?
Because , as Mises explained in 1920 , the key to rational economic planning is the price .
And not just any price but a true price brought about via trading under private property .
The price of capital goods like concrete and steel is the tool by which these resources are apportioned .
It is not enough to merely wish something into being .
The project in question must be economically viable , which means that it must be profitable or at least paid for in some way .
When the dictates of government officials replace the price system , the result can appear to be passably presentable .
The schools existed .
The teachers taught .
The buildings stood .
But the earthquake came , and the illusion was revealed at the expense of so many lives .
These are lives stolen by socialist central planning .
We have public schools in the United States , so why do n't we face the same problems ?
One reason has to do with the relative scarcity of materials and skill .
Public buildings in this country are islands of socialism in a sea of free enterprise , so the materials and workers are there .
The plans of central bureaucrats are more realizable simply because there are vast capital reserves on hand , though we should remember that when the politicians speak of our " crumbling " schools and infrastructure that it is the politicians themselves who are responsible .
The public sector ordered them built and built them .
And what about building codes and their enforcement ?
It is a great myth that these are somehow responsible for the soundness of our buildings .
Private enterprise meets the demand for safety as well as it meets any consumer demand .
Your house does n't fall in not because of building codes but because the builders are liable for mistakes and because there is competition among them to build better buildings .
What 's more , private enterprise regulates itself , with a vast array of regulatory codes that are self - enforcing ( Underwriters Laboratory , for example , is entirely private ) .
So why do the government codes exist ?
Mostly they are used by large companies to erect barriers to entry for smaller firms .
But let us not get too far afield from the core point .
The remnants of socialist central planning killed the kids .
Yes , the government is to blame .
The survivors and their families are right about that .
But they have another enemy as well .
It is the deadly ideology that set out to put government in charge of economic life , which includes building structures to house children for educational purposes .
They can add the tragedy of the Xianjian Primary School to the list of deaths caused by socialism .

A swingin ' social scene staves off memory loss in older people , a new study suggests .
One of the features of aging is memory loss , which can have devastating effects on the quality of life among older people .
Harvard School of Public
Health researchers now have found evidence that elderly people in the United States with active social lives may have a slower rate of memory decline .
" We hope this study adds to and advances our growing understanding of the important role that social forces play in shaping health , " said researcher Karen Ertel , a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Society , Human Development and Health at HSPH .
Previous studies have suggested that an active social life may reduce the risk of dementia and cognitive decline among the elderly .
Memory loss is a strong risk factor for dementia , a syndrome estimated to affect up to 10 percent of the U.S. population 65 years and older .
The researchers wanted to test whether memory loss might also be associated with social connectedness .
Ertel and her HSPH colleagues , including Lisa Berkman and Maria Glymour , used data gathered from 1998 to 2004 from the Health and Retirement Study , a large , nationally representative population of U.S. adults 50 years and older .
( Previous studies were conducted outside of the United States or used smaller , non-representative population samples . )
Memory was assessed in 1998 , 2000 , 2002 and 2004 by reading a list of 10 common nouns to survey respondents , then asking them to recall as many words as possible immediately and after a five - minute delay .
Social integration was assessed by marital status , volunteer activities , and contact with parents , children and neighbors .
The results showed that individuals with the highest social integration had the slowest rate of memory decline from 1998 to 2004 .
In fact , memory decline among the most integrated was less than half the rate among the least integrated .
These findings were independent of age , gender , race and health status in 1998 .
The researchers found that the protective effect of social integration was largest among individuals with fewer than 12 years of education .
The researchers found no evidence that the results could be due to reverse causation , that is , poor memory or memory decline causing social withdrawal .
The results are detailed in the July issue of the American Journal of Public Health and in a May 29 advance online edition .
" Social participation and integration have profound effects on health and well - being of people during their lifetimes , " Berkman said .
" We know from previous studies that people with many social ties have lower mortality rates .
We now have mounting evidence that strong social networks can help to prevent declines in memory .
As our society ages and has more and more older people , it will be important to promote their engagement in social and community life to maintain their well - being . "
Memory loss and dementia pose a major public health burden among the elderly U.S. population .
The results suggest that increasing social integration may help slow memory decline among older Americans and could help alleviate the public health burden , particularly because the aging population in the United States is expected to increase substantially .
" We need to understand more about how social integration reduces the risk of memory decline in order to target interventions that can help slow the decline , " said Ertel .
" Future research should focus on identifying the specific aspects of social integration most important for preserving memory . "
CAMBRIDGE , Mass . - May 14 , 2008 - A team composed of Harvard students and alumni was among the winners of the World Bank 's Lighting Africa 2008 Development Marketplace competition , held in Accra , Ghana from May 6 to 8 , 2008 .
The innovation , microbial fuel cell - based lighting systems suitable for Sub - Saharan Africa , netted the group a $ 200,000 prize .
According to the World Bank , as only 26 percent of Africa 's population has access to grid - based electricity most residents rely upon dangerous kerosene lamps and candles for illumination .
To encourage the development of cheaper and safer lighting technologies , the organizers of Lighting Africa 2008 sought practical solutions from around the world , ultimately funding 16 of the original 400 proposals .
The winning Harvard project came to life thanks to an undergraduate course , " Idea Translation " , taught by David Edwards , McKay Professor of the Practice of Bioengineering and author of Artscience : Creativity in the Post - Google Generation .
As part of the course Edwards challenged students to develop an idea that crossed the conventional boundaries of art and science , imagining light engineering as an art form .
" In the course we found what many of us were missing in our lives : A project that combined our love for Africa and our passion for technology , " said Harvard College alumnus Hugo Van Vuuren ' 07 , a South African native who took the course as a senior in the fall of 2007 .
" For all the Pan - Africanism of the last four decades it is quite rare to have young students from South , East , and West Africa , in the same room without a soccer ball somehow involved . "
Joining Van Vuuren , an economics concentrator , were current undergraduate students Stephen Lwendo ' 10 ( computer science and engineering ) and David Sengeh ' 10 ( bioengineering ) , who are both from Africa , Alexander Fabry '09 ( history of science and physics ) , alumnae Zoë Sachs - Arellano '07 ( a philosophy concentrator who co-founded the Namibia Connection Youth Network ) , and Aviva Presser , a graduate student at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences ( SEAS ) .
To translate their idea into a reality , the team collaborated with designer and entrepreneur Richard Kirk .
The founder of the London - based Elumin8 , and more recently , Polyphotonics , is known for his development and use of a new lighting form based on electrically conducting polymers , akin to luminous plastic sheets .
The students then turned to Peter Girguis , Assistant Professor of Biology in Harvard 's Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology , who pioneered a microbial fuel cell ( MFC ) energy source suitable for the developing world .
MFCs capture energy produced by naturally occurring microbial metabolism and can generate electricity from organic - rich materials such as soil , manure , or food scraps .
By contrast , most renewable energy technologies are based on solar or wind power .
Unlike these and other natural solutions for generating electricity , the team says MFCs are more reliable -- working day or night , rain or shine -- and are markedly less expensive .
The further development of the technology was encouraged by the ongoing mentorship of Aviva Presser , who served as a teaching fellow for the course ( and later joined the team as a technology partner at the close of the semester ) and Paul Bottino , co-founder of the Technology and Entrepreneurship Center at Harvard ( TECH ) and the Idea Translation Lab , based at SEAS .
Both Presser and Bottino have been involved with initiating or helping to run start - up ventures .
Such connections inspired the student team to not only enter the World Bank competition , but to go one step further and create a social enterprise , Lebônê Solutions , dedicated to solving the lighting crisis in Africa .
In fact , the journey from concept to application to start - up was not a direct path and continued to evolve more than a year after the course wrapped up .
" The original concept in the course started with an idea of lighting London for the 2012 Olympics and then morphed into lighting Africa with the active role of the various advisors , " explains Edwards , who matches the students with idea generators of all kinds , from scientists to visual artists .
" Aviva played a lead role as mentor and the Idea Translation Lab and Harvard Initiative for Global Health ( HIGH ) continued to support the students after the course ended . "
With the prize money from the World Bank competition and additional funding from Harvard Initiative for Global Health , the team will conduct the first field study in the foothills of Kilimanjaro , Tanzania starting in July .
They then have plans to test and distribute refined prototypes in Namibia in collaboration with Namibia Connection Youth Network .

WASHINGTON  State and local police officers fail to notify federal authorities about encounters with possible terror suspects up to 10 times a day , a senior FBI official said .
The rate of failure represents missed opportunities to verify possible matches to suspects on the government 's terrorist watch list or to remove individuals from the list whose names had been added by mistake , Leonard Boyle , director of the bureau 's Terrorist Screening Center ( TSC ) , said in an interview .
Police are asked to contact the center when routine computerized background checks on individuals — who may have violated traffic rules or been involved in a domestic disturbance — trigger electronic alerts from the TSC .
The alerts indicate possible matches to individuals on the government 's watch list of an estimated 400,000 people .
Police notifications to the center result in the identification of 40 to 50 verified suspects each day .
Of those , Boyle said , a handful result in arrests .
Regular audits of the system reveal that officers do not respond to the alerts 8 to 10 times daily .
Federal authorities are not automatically contacted .
As a result , Boyle said , they are forced to reconstruct the encounters through interviews and local police reports .
The government does not track the rate at which valid watch - list suspects are identified when the initial contacts go unreported , but Boyle said it is fairly common for the unreported encounters to result later in positive identifications of watch - list suspects .
There is no evidence that a local reporting failure resulted in a terrorist act in the USA .
The watch list , however , was used to deny U.S. entry to Egyptian Omar Ahmed Ali , who in 2005 committed a suicide bombing in Qatar , killing one and injuring 12 others , said screening center spokesman Chad Kolton .
The screening center was created in 2003 to fill domestic security gaps exposed by 9/11 .
Two of the hijackers , Nawaf Alhazmi and Khalid Almihdhar , were sought by federal investigators for more than a year before the attacks .
Both went undetected , even though Oklahoma authorities had stopped Alhazmi and cited him for speeding five months before the attacks in 2001 .
Boyle said a basic " unfamiliarity with the notification system and an unfamiliarity with the benefits of reporting " the contacts have been the most common explanations for not acting on the alerts .
" I would like to think that ( compliance ) would be higher , " said Ronald Ruecker , president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police , the nation 's largest organization of law enforcement officials .
Ruecker , public safety director in Sherwood , Ore. , said the lack of reporting could be due to the " cultural shift " in law enforcement 's post - Sept. 11 emphasis on fighting terrorism .
He said that focus has n't completely resonated in police agencies .
" It is a culture not easily changed , " Ruecker said .
Darrel Stephens , former president of the Major Cities Chiefs Association , said the compliance rate suggests that some officers intentionally choose not to contact federal authorities .

Face black with soot , Victoria Ranua strides across a Scott County hillside , painting it with fire .
What begins as a low thin strip of yellow , ignited by her torch , leaps behind her at once into a huge hedge of dancing flames , racing across dry prairie grasses .
The process , Ranua said , helps the native plants survive against invasive species .
" You know , Europeans did n't just come here as people , " she said .
" They brought their own plants and animals , and changed a lot of what was here . "
Ranua works for the casino - enriched Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community , which is recovering , acre by acre in the southwest metro , portions of the land its ancestors once lost to European settlers , and meticulously returning it to age - old looks and uses .
But the tribe 's land purchases , which are surging as the price of land sags , are turning up a different sort of heat in Scott County .
Civic leaders in Shakopee say the pace and pattern of the tribe 's land buys -- it has spent more than $ 100 million -- are making planning a logistical nightmare in the fast - growing community .
And they wonder if the tribe is engaged in a shrewd chess game to block Shakopee 's development plans , then move out into open countryside to start reacquiring vast stretches of ancestral land .
It 's a question emerging from New York to California as tribes riding high on casino profits have begun spending that wealth to reassert control over that ancestral land .
In Shakopee itself , said Mayor John Schmitt , " It appears they 're out to garner as much as they can get , wherever they can get it .
And they have the war chest to do that . "
For his part , however , Stan Ellison , the tribe 's land manager , points to a pile of historic maps as a reminder of who , historically , interfered with whom .
" This land , " he said , " was taken by the point of a gun -- and we are buying it back with American dollars . "
Trend on both coasts
The tribe 's original 250 - acre reservation , in what is now Prior Lake , best known today as the site of its Mystic Lake casino , has grown tenfold .
Nearly 2,000 acres have been stockpiled since the early 1990s .
And that 's a pittance compared with what 's happening in other places .
On the East Coast , the Oneida Nation is trying to place 17,000 acres in central New York State into federal trust , yanking it from the tax rolls and making it independent territory .
And tribes are buying land all up and down the state of California .
" From an original 640 acres we 've probably purchased more than 3,000 additional acres , " said Adam Day , assistant tribal manager for the Sycuan Band of the Kumeyaay Nation , which is roughly as close to downtown San Diego as the Shakopee tribe is to downtown Minneapolis .
" And what we do is , one by one we apply to bring [ the land purchases ] into trust .
San Diego County always opposes us , as they do everyone else .
But we are batting .1000 and we will have more -- including a very big one -- in the future .
" And I could rattle off the names of two dozen others like us all up and down California .
It 's very common .
Throw a dart at a map of California and you 'll hit one . "
In Scott County , the tribe and the city of Shakopee are heading for court action over the tribe 's desire to double its land in trust , to about 1,600 acres .
Blocking growth ?
Tribal leaders say they are just trying to knit together from once - scattered parcels a cohesive base of land that will be able to sustain their community for generations to come .
But Michael Leek , Shakopee 's director of community development , and city administrator Mark McNeill wonder if that 's all that 's going on .
They vividly remember a front page story in the Wall Street Journal 10 years ago , quoting tribal chairman Stanley Crooks : " At one time , my tribe owned the southern half of Minnesota , the western edge of Wisconsin , part of Iowa and part of South Dakota .
So how much land would I like to have ?
I 'd like to have it all back . "
Today tribal administrator Bill Rudnicki dismisses that as " a jest , taken out of context . "
But Leek says that one recent purchase in particular , at the city 's extreme southern edge , creates the impression that the tribe may be advancing its chess pieces toward the rural townships .
The threat of lost income to the county and cities -- offset , the tribe argues , by a multitude of donations and partnerships -- has long been the main focus of public unease about its land base .
But city officials say that some purchases are raising what may be a problem as big as that , or bigger .
In a game that Schmitt calls " one- upsmanship , if you will , " the tribe is able to find out far more about the city 's plans than the other way around , and can acquire key pieces of land that block the city 's growth plans far beyond that one point .
A main sewer line , buried 40 feet below ground , can cost $ 800,000 per half - mile .
The tribe has bought a piece of land at the end of one such line .
Even if the tribe allows the city to cross tribal land to serve a new neighborhood , who would pay for the extra length of the line , or pay the extra cost to reroute the sewer line ?
The tribe is its own entity , with its own water treatment plant , its own fire department and police .
Streets of homes on its land are marked off as private .
Rudnicki stressed that the tribe has been willing to let cities and the county cut through tribal lands in the past .
Indeed , one of the tribe 's environmental specialists , Shawn Kelley , gathering sap from a hillside stand of sugar maples on tribal land , declared it a " dang shame " that the county is being allowed to cut a major new roadway through land that tribal ancestors would have known ages ago .
The goal for tribes in buying up land , said Day , of the San Diego - area tribe , is , " first and foremost , to exercise domain over our aboriginal territory .
But it 's also to preserve and protect resources , including very culturally significant sites [ such as burial grounds ] that have been destroyed over the years or are jeopardized by development . "
Not all of the several hundred federally recognized tribes have the wherewithal to do that -- or the need .
Several already have land holdings bigger than the smallest American states .
The Navaho reservation is twice the size of Massachusetts .
Two reservations in northern Minnesota are roughly 1,000 times as land - rich as the Shakopee group .
A waiting game
The most combustible mixture , experts agree , is what one finds in Shakopee : a small group of members whose own needs are more than taken care of ; gaming facilities close enough to a major metro to be highly profitable ; a minuscule , disconnected land base ; and holdings located close enough to rapid development to create an urgency to nail down raw land while it 's still available .
If there 's an urgency , there 's also patience .
Mayor Schmitt said the tribe will sit and wait as a landowner with deep family ties to a piece of land , opposed to its passing into tribal hands , ages and then dies .
" And the casket is hardly covered with topsoil before the discussions begin with the heirs .
Sometimes the survivors take glee in what they can get out of the natives . "
Ellison concedes the point .
" Often estates are easier to deal with , because personal desires are not part of the deal . "
And he confirms that the tribe will use straw buyers from time to time , disguising its role in a purchase .
But he says that 's needed to keep prices reasonable .
" If we announced a desire to buy parcel X , " he said , " the price would triple overnight . "
Ellison said the Shakopee tribe 's staff is taking enormous care to return much of the land it 's buying to its original state , before Europeans arrived .
" Our staff is going through original surveyors ' notes , establishing old boundaries between prairie , forest , wetlands .
We are returning native grasses to land that has been farmed since the 1870s .
A park , to the tribe , is not a soccer field .
It is restored prairie where members can hunt birds , and forests where we can turn maple sap into syrup , and show our kids that syrup is n't something you buy at Cub . "
The two other governments most affected by the tribe 's moves -- Prior Lake , where purchases also are taking place , and the county -- have opted to try and become partners with the tribe .
With their recent addition to the US Endangered Species Act list , polar bears have sent a wake - up call to water managers in South Florida .
Added to the ESA list on Wednesday , the polar bears will finally receive a measure of official attention and protection , albeit a little late .
However , joining the environmental awareness last Wednesday , South Florida water managers agreed to spend a year looking at how the melting ice that is doing in the polar bear , may be a similarly dangerous problem for South Florida .
The South Florida Water Management District once had anticipated for a maximum sea level rise of only 1 foot by 2100 .
However more recent projections have greatly increased that , by up to 5 times .
Back in late April the Miami - Dade County Climate Change Task Force presented a report that suggested a three - foot rise in sea level could send a high tide well in to downtown Miami , whereas a five - foot rise would swallow up much of the Everglades .
But the problem is n’t consigned to flooding , with the possibility that a sea level rise could infiltrate the states drinking water .
This , according to Jayantha Obeysekera , who will lead the district ’s global warming review .
“ We can not put up walls and stop the sea level , ” Obeysekera said .
“ Let ’s start looking at it [ and ] see what our vulnerabilities are . ”
Carol Ann
Wehle , executive director of the agency noted that a rise of only 2 feet could cause problems for the system of drainage canals that rely heavily upon gravity to keep South Florida dry .
Needless to say , a sea level rise of any magnitude is not going to make for a happy South Florida .

All 29 ports on the West Coast , including the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach , have been effectively shut down this morning as thousands of dockworkers stayed home to protest the Iraq war .
The walkout comes two months before the contract between dockworkers and and port operators expires .
Louis Sahagun has the story :
" We are supporting the troops and telling politicians in Washington that it 's time to end the war in Iraq , " union president Bob McEllrath said .
McEllrath , whose comments came in a press release handed out by union officials in the Port of Los Angeles area , said rank - and - file members decided in early January to stand down on May 1 .
The dockworkers ' action also affected ports in Oakland , Seattle and San Diego , and was expected to last between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m .
The dockworkers do virtually all the work involved in loading and unloading freight between ships and the port , handling containers brimming with toys , clothing , computers and automobiles .
Good question , Marty .
I work in the petroleum industry myself as a geophysicist ( looking at seismic sections and trying to find oil and gas ) .
I 'm not too familiar with refining or compositional analysis but I can offer you the following observations .
Oils from around the world have different compositions ( look up " Brent Blend " or " West Texas Intermediate " ) .
These trade at different prices and have different potential to be refined into the various products .
Some have unwanted contaminants such as sulphur or constituents like wax that require special equipment to handle properly .
Refineries have to be specially designed to run on one type of input product , and be optimised to crack the oils to specific product mixes .
For example , Chinese refineries are optimised to produce diesel , since most of their vehicles use it ( and their local crude oil happens to easily produce it , too ) .
In the USA , refineries produce much more gasoline .
Over the past 20 years or so , refining companies have never made heaps of money .
The margins are fairly slim and the competition heavy .
Anyone can set up a refinery to exploit perceived market opportunities , or transfer products from one state or country to another , so there are very few protected markets and monopolies in that side of the business .
Upstream is a different issue .
Oil can be found for , typically , $ 2.00 per barrel exploration cost , and produced for $ 4.00 development cost .
With the international price of oil around $ 20.00 per barrel , that 's $ 14.00 " profit " i.e. an apparent 14/6 = 233 % return on investment .
Sounds nice , but there are a few snags .
Not all oil is equally cheap to find and produce .
Saudi Arabia produces oil at an incremental cost of $ 0.40 per barrel !
Many wells in the USA , the North Sea , and other parts of the world become uneconomic if the oil price falls below $ 12 to $ 13 per barrel , so some companies and governments make money at low oil prices , some do n't .
Governments also step into the picture .
They do n't like to see companies getting rich on their oil - a national resource .
Most Countries have special taxation rules that take extra tax from oil companies .
It 's common for a government to require that 60 % of all oil produced is given to them for free , as well as the normal corporate taxes on profits .
Even with this tax situation , oil exploration is still attractive , but the best areas in the world are hard to get into .
Some people think that a new oil price boom ( read oil crisis , leading to possible worldwide recession ) is coming .
Many companies are bidding very heavily for attractive areas and the entry cost is getting very high .
Unless the oil price goes up , many of these companies may lose money .
I do n't know what will happen in the future , but it 's a complicated industry and it affects the whole world .
Keep your eyes open over the next few years and you may understand better some of the vagaries of economics .
Nick
The photo greets Lawrence Tynes at work each day .
It sits on a shelf in locker No. 9 , tucked between the showers and the trainer 's room in the bowels of Giants Stadium .
Five faces smile earnestly , a handsome , perfectly nuclear family -- brothers Mark and Jason , mother Maggie and father Larry surround Tynes , who 's wearing a graduation cap and gown and clutching his diploma .
" For that moment in time , they all came up for the weekend , " Tynes says .
" I graduated college and had already signed with the Chiefs , so I was going to leave from there and go to training camp .
It was a good time .
" That is the way I want to remember it . "
The 2000 photo following his graduation from Troy State University also has a place on the bar of his suburban Kansas City townhouse .
His memory of family is deeply comforting , even if it 's no longer his reality .
Once his anchor , the family has disintegrated .
His parents divorced after 28 years , his mother 's health deteriorated , and his brother , Mark , sits in a federal prison cell in Arkansas , sentenced to 27 years for dealing drugs .
Kicking at the NFL level requires a clear head .
Focus is essential .
All of these family issues already were swirling in Tynes ' mind when he was traded to the New York Giants last May .
And then , while he was competing for the place - kicking job during training camp , his wife , Amanda , went into labor two months early .
The last three weeks of her pregnancy , he spent every minute with her in the hospital and did n't kick a single ball .
Somehow , twins Jaden and Caleb were born healthy and , somehow , Tynes entered the 2007 season as the Giants ' kicker .
Considering the distractions , Tynes ' poise during the regular season was remarkable .
He made 23 of 27 field - goal attempts -- 85.2 percent , the best of his career .
In the NFC Championship on Jan. 20 , 2008 , in frigid Green Bay , Wis. , Tynes shanked two fourth - quarter field - goal attempts .
In overtime , with coach Tom Coughlin deciding what to do on fourth down , Tynes just ran onto the field .
He made a 47 - yard field goal -- the biggest kick of his life -- that sent the Giants to Super Bowl XLII .
" I never let the two misses affect me , " Tynes said .
" I think that is what propelled me to make that kick .
I never once got down on myself . "
The first points of the Super Bowl came from a Tynes 32 - yard field goal , and the Giants went on to beat the Patriots 17 - 14 .
Mark Tynes watched the game on TV , behind the walls of the Forrest City Federal Correctional Institution in eastern Arkansas .
" Seeing all the hard work that he has done in his career , and all the perseverance , to me , I am basically living through his eyes , like you would with your child , " Mark told ESPN last month in an hour - long phone interview from prison .
" Me being on the other end of things , the bad side , and him being on the good side , for me it was a great feeling , probably one of the best feelings I have had in a long time . "
Kicker Lawrence Tynes and family members celebrate the Giants ' win against the Patriots in Super Bowl XLII .

Lawrence was rewarded handsomely for that perseverance : a Super Bowl ring , an appearance on " The Late Show with David Letterman , " a trip to Disney World and , most recently , a five - year , $ 7 million contract .
He is grateful , of course .
But the fame and fortune can't fix the family .
It ca n't restore the once - powerful bond with brother Mark , with whom he played soccer and football and did virtually everything together .
It ca n't make whole the shattered spirit of camaraderie -- the football games , fishing trips and sleepovers -- once shared by Mark and Lawrence and a tight group of friends growing up in Milton , Fla .
" It tears you apart at the seams , " Lawrence Tynes said .
" I had a great family .
I had great friends .
I no longer have the relationships that I used to have with those guys .
I still have a mom and I still have a dad , and I still have two brothers .
" But , realistically , I have one brother . "
Different directions
At age 10 , Lawrence moved with his family from Scotland to the Florida panhandle .
All three brothers grew up across the water playing soccer .
Lawrence , the youngest , was a gifted player .
He and Mark , who is 14 months older , were teammates .
As their father recalled , Mark and Lawrence each scored six goals in a game , at the time a Florida 5A state record .
Lawrence says it was seven .
The Tynes brothers , Lawrence , Mark and Jason , spent their early years in Scotland .

As they grew up they developed a close group of friends who called themselves " The BHOYZ , " a nickname birthed in their unique language of pop culture and old Scottish - English .
" The BHOYZ " included Garrett Bagley , David Dejesus , Daniel Duke , Adam Joiner , Lee Massey , Mark and Lawrence Tynes and a few others .
Massey says Mark and Lawrence were very different .
" Lawrence had the work ethic , " Massey said .
" Mark had the brains to try to find the way around the work ethic .
Lawrence knew what it took to get here .
Mark saw what it took to get there and negotiated the way around it . "
Said Lawrence , " Of the three brothers , he was the smartest . "
The friends matured into a brotherhood on the football field at Milton High School .
They called Mark " Prime Tynes " because he wore Deion Sanders ' number and had smooth moves as a defensive back .
Lawrence had a strong leg and was recruited to become the school 's place - kicker .
But coach Mike McMillion said that was n't what made him different .
" It was his mind - set that set him apart from the rest , " McMillion said .
In a kicking camp at Auburn University , Lawrence , then 17 , booted a 55 - yard field goal and left a 60 - yarder just short .
Despite his strong leg , Lawrence received no college scholarships , so he eventually walked on at Troy State .
In college , Lawrence began to realize that Mark , who had dreamed of playing professional soccer but never received his high school degree , was n't following a traditional path to success .
Mark , left , and Lawrence were high school soccer teammates .

" I would come home , and you knew , " Lawrence said .
" I mean , I am not dumb . "
Mark , who had a home and drove , at different times , a white BMW , a silver Mercedes and a blue Yukon , was dealing drugs .
Lawrence drove a $ 600 car ; Mark said the money provided him and his friends the freedom to party .
" We did whatever we wanted , " Mark said .
" We could go anywhere around the country , we could practically buy anything we needed to buy . "
Mark , who already had one felony conviction for drug possession in Texas , again was involved with drugs .
At one point , the brothers ' father , a major crimes detective in the Santa Rosa County Sheriff 's office in Florida , actually called his colleagues in the narcotics division to arrest his own son .
The officers responded , but did n't find enough evidence for an arrest .
" That was the only wake - up call I could think of to have something happen to change his ways , " Larry Tynes said .
Adam Joiner , a member of " The BHOYZ , " called it the wake - up call that " did n't work . "
In May of 2001 , Mark was arrested in Milton , Fla. , for felony possession of marijuana with intent to sell , his second felony .
Authorities seized drug paraphernalia and more than $ 11,000 at his home .
Mark was part of a marijuana distribution network that included several of his high school friends .
Lawrence said he confronted his brother several times about his drug use .
" Mark was the middle child that did his own thing and I spoke to him , " Lawrence said . " That was just him .
That is what he did .
You were n't going to change it .
" I knew that to get to where I wanted to go , I had to stay clear of that . "
A ton of product
NFL kickers are at the bottom of the food chain -- at times seen as interchangeable vagabonds .
Coming out of college , Lawrence Tynes was no different .
He played four seasons at Troy State , converting a school - record 45 of 62 field - goal attempts .
In April 2001 , Kansas City signed him as a rookie free agent .
He was released four months later , signed again after the 2001 season and waived a second time in September 2002 .
He spent the next 18 months kicking around the Canadian Football League with the Ottawa Renegades and NFL Europe with the Scottish Claymores .
In between , Tynes returned to Florida .
On May 3 , 2003 , his 25th birthday , Tynes was looking forward to celebrating with Mark and their friends .
He drove to Mark 's house in Milton .
" I drive over there and you see the SUVs , you see the bags being taken out of his house , " Tynes said .
" You see the DEA , and the ATF and all the federal agencies being represented there that went to his house that day to kick in the door . "
" The BHOYZ " included David Dejesus ( far left ) , Garrett Bagley ( front , striped shirt ) , Mark Tynes ( middle , blue shirt ) , Lawrence Tynes ( upper left , tan shirt ) , Adam Joiner ( gray shirt ) , Daniel Duke ( upper right ) and Lee Massey ( in front of Duke ) .

Dejesus , Duke , Joiner , Massey and Mark Tynes were arrested in a federal drug raid .
Authorities seized 57 pounds of marijuana .
According to court records , the federal government said Mark Tynes oversaw a drug operation that moved " well over a ton " of marijuana over a three - year period from Texas to Florida .
Massey said the men agreed to tell authorities the truth because , Massey said , they realized " there was no way out . "
After they were booked , each man told his story in a separate room , at a separate time , without knowing what his friends were saying .
That is , all but Mark Tynes .
He was facing his third drug felony , and a federal charge of conspiracy to distribute more than 2,200 pounds of marijuana .
He said federal agents offered him life in prison with the possibility of a reduced sentence based on the level and value of his cooperation .
He said he was willing to admit guilt , but not at the level the government was charging him .
Eight days after the arrest , in a phone conversation , Lawrence Tynes pleaded with his brother to take the deal .
" If you go [ away ] for life , then that just crushes me , " Lawrence Tynes said on a tape obtained by ESPN .
" I wo n't be able to kick the ball straight for nothing .
It will be on my mind constantly -- it is now , every day . "
Against the advice of his co-defendants , his father , his brothers and his defense attorney , Mark Tynes refused to cooperate .
Each of his four childhood friends testified against him .
Lawrence Tynes believes in the proverb that blood is thicker than friendship .
He 's struggled with his feelings about his former friends .
" If you want to call them snitches , call them snitches , " he said .
" If you want to call them rats , call them rats .
That is just what they chose to do .
I do n't know why .
I have never been in that situation , so I can't say what I would have done . "
Lawrence 's friends , like Joiner , struggle with the notion that they are forever labeled .
" That 's a terrible name to have , " Joiner said .
" I 'll tell you , you can't live that down .
If today 's lingo is snitch , then that 's what we are .
We did it .
I 'm not denying that .
I sat right in that stand and did my part .
I did n't do it for anybody else but myself and that might be selfish , but everyone else had the opportunity to do the same thing . "
Release date : 2026
The four co-defendants received reduced sentences ranging from 21 to 60 months .
In January 2004 , based largely on the testimony of his friends , Mark Tynes was found guilty on two counts of marijuana distribution .
Based partly on his criminal history , he was sentenced to 324 months , or 27 years , in federal prison .
Mark Tynes , the brother of Giants kicker Lawrence Tynes , is serving a 27 - year federal prison sentence at Forrest City Correctional Institution in eastern Arkansas .
His release date is in 2026 .
Tynes Family
" You just think at that time everything you have ever done in your life , in such a short period of time , and wish you could take it all back , and I can't , " Mark Tynes said from prison .
" It is the regret you feel as you are walking away and you see your family back there and the hurt that they are feeling when they see this happen to you , it is never worth it . "
Mark Tynes said he has forgiven his co-defendants for testifying against him .
They were his childhood friends , his party friends .
He has forgiven , but not forgotten .
" It 's a selfish act to me to do something like that .
We were all guilty , but to take and throw it off on me personally , they are their own men .
They stand on their own two feet , and they made their own decisions .
I did n't force them to do anything . "
One month after Mark 's conviction , Lawrence Tynes signed for a third time with the Kansas City Chiefs .
This time , he made the team and over three seasons became one of the league 's better kickers .
He made 68 of 87 attempts ( .782 ) and averaged 114 points per season .
" I think things in life build character , " he said .
" There are some bad things that have happened , but I do n't look at them negatively at all .
I think they have only helped me . "
By the time the Giants had reached the Super Bowl , each of the four co-defendants had been released from prison .
Mark Tynes is scheduled to be released in 2026 .
Lawrence
Tynes says his brother deserves to be in prison , but he feels strongly that the sentence is too long .
Lawrence says he speaks to Inmate No. 05559 -17 three or four times a week .
They often talk about Mark 's final court appeal to reduce his sentence .
Moving on
Lawrence
Tynes still holds on to that graduation day family photo .
It was difficult on his wedding day several years ago when a picture was taken -- without Mark .
His older brother was n't with him on the field after the Super Bowl win either , another moment lost in Lawrence Tynes ' eyes .

" These are all things that I have to deal with since he has been incarcerated , " Lawrence Tynes said .
" I have had some very bad luck .
Who has n't ?
Mine became very public during the Super Bowl , about my brother and my family , but I would n't change it for the world .
" There are some bad things that have happened , but I do n't look at them negatively at all .
I think they have only helped me . "
Does Lawrence ever think back to that tight group of brothers and think , given different circumstances , that could have been him sitting in jail sometime past his 50th birthday ?
" Yeah , " he said thoughtfully .
" I totally do . "
In his phone interview from prison , Mark Tynes was asked the difference between himself and Lawrence .
" Four inches and one year of age , " he quickly joked .
Several days later , with emotion in his voice , he told his father the answer .
" I made all the wrong decisions , " Mark Tynes said , " and Lawrence made all the right ones . "

Neil Berkett , the new CEO of Virgin Media ( my ISP at home in London , along with BT ) has announced that he considers Net Neutrality to be " a load of bollocks " and he 's promised to put any website or service that wo n't pay Virgin a premium to reach its customers into the " Internet bus lane . "
As a Virgin customer , I 'm not paying to see those services that bribe Virgin to reach me , I 'm paying to reach the entire web , whichever bits I think are useful , as quickly as Virgin can deliver them .
Theoretically , I 'm locked into a Virgin plan for another six months , but as far as I 'm concerned , they 've just announced that they 're violating the agreement by announcing that the services I can reach will be systematically slowed down unless they pay Virgin extra .
That means that we 're now null and void .
I 'll be calling to cancel today .
Who 's with me ?
In an interview with the Royal Television Society 's Television magazine , far from covering up their intentions , Virgin Media 's new incoming CEO Neil Berkett – who joined the Virgin Media Board just a few days ago – has launched an attack on the ideas and principles behind net neutrality .
" This net neutrality thing is a load of bollocks , " he said , adding that Virgin is already in the process of doing deals to speed up the traffic of certain media providers .

Among other minor complaints the report listed were a splinter in the Governor 's his right index finger in 1979 and hoarseness in 1981 that was attributed to the teaching job he held at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University between his two Gubernatorial terms .
Dr. Plotkin also said that Mr. Dukakis had no organic abnormalities and that his blood count , hemoglobin and cholesterol levels and urinalysis were normal .
Mr. Dukakis 's cool handling of the questions about his health today stood in contrast to his abrupt response to a question at a news conference Friday .
Asked then if he intended to release his medical records now that he was the Democratic candidate , Mr. Dukakis replied simply , '' No , I do not . ''
He then turned to the next question .
Refuses to Release Full History
Today Mr. Dukakis repeated his insistence that he was not going to release a full medical history .
'' I do n't think it 's appropriate that a candidate release lifetime medical records , '' Mr. Dukakis said .
Asked if he thought medical records were '' too personal , '' he only repeated that it would be '' inappropriate . ''
At a news conference tonight , Dr. Plotkin said he believed that Mr. Dukakis considered the release of his full medical history to be an invasion of privacy .
But he said the report he prepared today was a complete summary of those records , lacking only the physician 's personal notes to himself .
'' These are the records , '' he said .
In recent years Presidential candidates have come under increasing pressure , and have been increasingly willing , to divulge information about their health in an effort to shed light on their fitness for office .
Vice President Bush issued a statement this week in which his doctor described his health as '' excellent and vigorous . ''
Mr. Bush said he had never been treated for depression or other forms of mental illness .
The report cited a mild arthritis of the hips , for which he occasionally takes an anti-inflammatory drug , and an allergy to bee stings .
As Vice President for eight years , Mr. Bush 's health record has come under continuing scrutiny , and he issued statements about his health when he sought the Presidency in 1980 .

BEIJING  China ’s currency , the yuan , rose against the dollar on Thursday , reaching a milestone that is just the latest sign of this country ’s growing economic power .
For the first time in more than a decade , the dollar bought less than 7 yuan , ending the day close to 6.9920 , a situation that specialists say will probably make Chinese - made goods more expensive for American consumers and possibly contribute to inflation in the United States .
The gains for the Chinese currency have come after Beijing ’s decision to end a longstanding peg to the dollar in July 2005 , when a single dollar bought about 8.3 yuan or renminbi .
Beijing lifted the peg after American and European officials had complained for years that the yuan was set artificially low , making Chinese goods cheaper than they would normally be and giving China an unfair trade advantage .
Last week was the five year anniversary of President Bush landing on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln , striding along the flight deck in flight suit and stating triumphantly that " major combat operations in Iraq have ended " while standing under a banner proclaiming " Mission Accomplished . "
For the neocons and chickenhawks , it was a giddy moment .
Victory was at hand .
But like almost everything else about the administration ’s Iraq policy , it was ultimately nothing more than hubris .
Five years later , White House press secretary Dana Perino offered up this explanation : " President Bush is well aware that the banner should have been much more specific and said mission accomplished for these sailors who are on this ship on their mission . "
( To be fair , the president did not actually say " mission accomplished " in his speech . )
But feeble explanations aside , what has been accomplished ?
Saddam Hussein  demonized as a threat to world peace by President Bush  has been deposed .
So there is one less brutal dictator in the world .
But Saddam was never a threat .
He did not have the dreaded WMDs alleged by the administration .
And even if did , that would not have made him a threat since ( a ) he had no means to deliver such weapons ( the best the administration could come up with was claiming that Iraq possessed unmanned aerial drones that could deliver chemical or biological weapons , but these drones did n’t even pose a threat to Israel let alone the United States ) and ( b ) Saddam would have had to been suicidal to use such weapons knowing that the United States could retaliate with the full spectrum of military force , including the U.S. nuclear arsenal capable of utterly destroying Iraq .
And more importantly , Saddam did not have a hand in 9/11 or any ties to al - Qaeda  which has belatedly acknowledged by the Pentagon , long after Donald Rumsfeld ’s departure .
Hussein ’s terrorist connections that were hyped at every opportunity by the administration and its cheerleaders were to anti-Israeli terrorists who posed no threat to America .
Moreover , the U.S. invasion to rid Iraq of Saddam Hussein and his nonexistent WMDs has led to perhaps the greatest irony of all .
Under the Hussein regime , there was no al - Qaeda presence in Iraq .
In fact , bin Laden viewed Hussein as an apostate Muslim ruler and referred to Saddam ’s Ba’ath Party as " infidels " in a February 2003 videotape .
But the ongoing U.S. military occupation of Iraq has become a cause célèbre for jihadists ( much like the Soviet invasion and occupation of Afghanistan was for the mujahedeen ) and resulted in the formation of Tanzim Qaidat al - Jihad fi Bilad al - Rafidayn , more commonly referred to as al - Qaeda of Mesopotamia or al - Qaeda in Iraq .
Instead of a dictatorship , the Iraqi people are now blessed with a democracy .
In January 2005 , the Iraqi people voted for an assembly to draft a constitution for a new sovereign government .
And in December 2005 , Iraqis elected the members of the first national assembly under the constitution .
But instead of democracy bringing peace and prosperity as promised by the architects of the Iraq War , there has been nothing but discord in Iraq .
In fact , for all the trappings of democracy , Iraq remains a deeply divided country teetering on the verge of civil war .
And Iraq ’s fledgling democratic government seems only able to stand on its own two feet because of the continued U.S. military occupation ( currently nearly 160,000 troops and likely to remain at that level for the foreseeable future ) , which gives the appearance of an installed puppet government rather than an independent , sovereign one .
The fact that Iraqi security forces are less than capable is lost on no one  as demonstrated by the ill - fated March operation against the Mahdi Army in Basra .
Moreover , U.S. military forces in Iraq are sowing the seeds of the discord that plagues the country .
In addition to being a calling card for jihadists to flock to Iraq , the U.S. military presence also fans the flames of anti-American sentiment among Iraqis .
Indeed , U.S. military occupation has been the long - standing grievance of Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr , who last week urged his followers not to fight Iraqi security forces and for Iraqi security forces " to be close to their people and far from the occupier , because we will not be blessed with peace as long as they occupy our land . "
Although progress has certainly been made , Iraq is far from being a reconstructed country .
Because of soaring oil prices ( oil was about $ 30 per barrel when the U.S. decided to invade Iraq in March 2003 and is currently trading at over $ 110 per barrel as this is written ) , Iraq is projected to realize $ 70 billion in oil revenue this year , according to a U.S. government report .
But at the same time the Iraqi Oil Ministry is reporting that 65 percent of the oil pipeline network is idle due to sabotage and lack of repairs , and Iraq has failed to attract much needed foreign investment due to ongoing violence .
According to the special inspector for Iraq reconstruction , Stuart Bowen , the more than $ 20 billion spent on reconstruction ( Congress has appropriated $ 46 billion for reconstruction projects in Iraq ) " has produced mixed results . "
The largest reconstruction project  the Nassriya Water Treatment Plant  is actually considered a failure .
Finally , there are these " accomplishments " to consider :
If it was n’t apparent then , it should be clear by now that the mission in Iraq is far from accomplished .
In fact , the end does n’t appear to be anywhere in sight .
So looking back at President Bush ’s May 2003 victory speech ( he may not have claimed " mission accomplished " aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln , but he did say , " The battle of Iraq is one victory in a war on terror that began on September the 11th , 2002 " ) brings to mind a favorite British phrase :
Well played , sir !
LMFAO
@apeguero :
Maybe some people will not buy his products because of this .
That 's kind of the point of protesting , to make people aware of a particular situation they were previously not aware of and to motivate them to take action .
This guy not buying a copy of Windows will do absolutely nothing to hurt Balmer , but if he can convince tens of thousands of people to think like he does , he has a better chance to put a dent in the company .
The following is a guest post from Lynnae over at Being Frugal .
Be sure to check out her site if you are looking for advice on being more frugal !
Do you ever look back and wonder , “ What if I had known this when I was 18 ? ” I know I do .
It ’s not that I live in the past and berate myself for mistakes that I ’ve made .
The school of hard knocks is a great teacher , and I know there are lessons I learned the hard way that I will always remember .
But if I had to live my life over again , there are a few lessons I would like to have learned a little earlier in life .
1 . Just because you can pay the minimum does n’t mean you can afford the balance .
It took me years to figure that out .
For a long time I was a creditor ’s dream come true .
I carried a large balance on my credit cards , and faithfully paid the minimum balance by the due date every month .
I thought I was doing great , because my credit score was great .
I never thought to add up all the interest I was paying on my purchases .
2 . If you begin investing for your retirement early , you wo n’t have to invest as much .
My husband and I began investing in our retirement when I was 34 .
Yes , two years ago .
Had we known about compounding interest , we certainly would have invested sooner .
I ’m not really that worried about what will happen to us when we ’re older , but things surely would have been easier if we had gotten our financial lives together sooner .
3 . Do n’t spend a ton of money on your education until you know for sure what you want to do .
My major in college ?
Sociology .
Do you know what I ’ve done with that degree ?
Nothing .
How much in student loan debt did that degree cost me ?
$ 4000 .
But wait .
It gets worse .
I went to graduate school .
For what ?
Special Education .
Did I finish the program ?
Nope .
How much did that mistake cost me in student loan debt ?
$ 10,000 .
In retrospect , I should have thought much harder about my education before taking the plunge .
4 . If you ’re going to pay a ton of money for a college education , you should at least show up for class .
I do n’t even want to think about all the hours of class I paid for , but did n’t benefit from .
I went to all of the classes that interested me , but if I found a class boring , I would skip the lecture and skate by on my test taking skills .
I did n’t get nearly everything out of college that I could have .
5 . Spend less than you earn .
I went over this yesterday .
It ’s a concept that I ’ve only recently taken seriously .
When I think about all the money I ’ve blown on going to the movies , eating out , and just basic useless stuff , it ’s kind of depressing .
Obviously I can’t turn back the clock and live my life over .
That ’s OK .
I ’m confident that my husband and I will be alright , despite our mistakes .
Life wo n’t be as easy as it could have been , but we ’ll be OK .
The one thing I can do is make sure my children learn these lessons before they leave home .
Then hopefully they wo n’t make the same mistakes I did .
What lessons do you wish you had learned earlier in life ?

US natural gas production has been flat for a number of years .
We keep hearing that US production is expected to begin declining sometime in the next few years , but it does n't seem to happen .
While it is not obvious from most published data , the reason production remains level is because unconventional gas production has been rising at the same time that conventional production has been declining .
In this post , I will look at unconventional natural gas , since it plays such a pivotal role .
One reason I am writing this post is because only a few days from now ( May 20 - 21 ) , I will be visiting BP 's tight gas facility in Wamsutter , Wyoming on a trip sponsored by the American Petroleum Institute ( API ) .
I may have the opportunity to ask some questions .
I thought that if I put together a post outlining a little about what we know about unconventional gas , and in particular tight gas , it might put me in a better position to ask reasonable questions , if I get a chance to do so .
Also , readers may alert me to some issues I might not otherwise be aware of .
Unconventional Gas and Tight Gas
The major forms of unconventional gas are tight gas , coal bed methane , and shale gas .
The production of all three have been rising in recent years .
Tight gas is the largest of the three .
Production of all three were encouraged under Article 29 of the Internal Revenue Code , Alternative Fuel Production Credit , which became effective in 1980 .
Figure 2
One could write volumes on any of the types of unconventional gas .
To keep this post from getting too long , I will focus on unconventional gas totals and on tight gas .
Production Forecasts
Figure 3 shows a natural gas production forecast that I found on a BP website .
It is not too different from other forecasts that one sees for natural gas : Conventional natural gas production is expected to continue to fall .
The various unconventional sources of natural gas will rise to keep production flat for several years .
Demand for natural gas is expected to be greater than the amount that can be supplied using conventional and unconventional production .
We will try to meet the supply shortfall with imported liquefied natural gas .
Figure 3
We all wonder , " How reasonable is a forecast of this type ? "
Can tight gas production be expected to continue to grow for several more years , or will it quickly reach a peak and decline ?
Should we be concerned in the next few years ?
Will unconventional gas actually do better than forecast ?
I am not sure I have an answer to these questions , but I will try to lay out some of the issues involved .
What has the EIA 's track record on forecasting unconventional gas production ?
EIA 's track record has been one of consistent under -estimation of the amount that would be produced .
This is an exhibit from one of Advance Resources International 's ( ARI 's ) papers showing EIA 's forecasts and the ultimate amount produced :
Figure 4
EIA 's has also tended to miss the decline in conventional natural gas , so that its track record in total has not been as poor as for the pieces .
Going forward , the EIA 's forcast ( from the 2007 Annual Energy Outlook ) is shown in Figure 5 .
It forecasts some increase in unconventional , but not as steep a rise as in the past .
In Figure 5 , NA means not associated with oil production ; AD means associated dissolved .
Figure 5
Does n't natural gas production tend to peak and decline like oil production ?
The United States has different sources of natural gas - conventional gas , both on shore and off shore -- and the various unconventional sources .
Geological factors do play a role , as with oil , but there are other factors that are important as well .
I think of natural gas as more of a " pump what you need each year " endeavor , until the supply runs low , rather than as having the typical peak and decline pattern that we see with oil production .
This is part of the reason production has been flat for many years .
One can see the impact of geological factors when one looks at Figure 1 , which shows the decline in conventional natural gas ( offset by the rise in unconventional ) .
Reserves for conventional natural gas have also been declining , and almost everyone believes that conventional natural gas production will continue to decline in the future .
Price and technology also play major roles in determining the amount of natural gas that is pumped , much more than we think of with oil .
The price of natural gas depends on supply and demand .
Natural gas is fairly plentiful around the world .
While it is difficult to ship natural gas , there are indirect ways the foreign natural gas can compete with US natural gas .
Chemical industries can move to cheaper sources of natural gas .
Also , products like fertilizer can be made abroad , and shipped to the United States .
In recent years , pipeline imports of natural gas from Canada have helped to hold down US natural gas prices .
Price is also affected by availability of pipelines and by competition with coal and with petroleum .
Historically , the price of natural gas has been highly correlated with that of oil ( R squared = .82 for 1986 to 2007 , comparing the wellhead price of gas with the price of West Texas Intermediate ( WTI ) oil . )
On Figure 6 , I show the wellhead price per 1,000 cubic feet of gas and an estimate of the price of gas equal to 10.9 % times the WTI oil price per barrel .
Figure 6 shows annual averages for he years 1986 thorough 2007 .
For 2008 , the amounts reflect recent May 2008 prices ( WTI= 125.83 ; natural gas = 11.71 ) .
Recent natural gas prices seem to be lagging behind their historical relationship with oil , leaving some room for natural gas prices to rise .
Figure 6
Tight gas is natural gas found in reservoirs with low porosity and low permeability ( generally sandstones with less than 1/10th of a millidarcy permeability ) .
Tight gas requires multiple fracturing to in order for any significant amount of gas to be available .
Drilling for tight gas has been compared to drilling a hole into a concrete driveway -- the rock layers that hold the gas are very dense , so the gas does n't flow easily .
Until recently , tight gas was considered non-economic to produce .
Recent technological advances in a number of different directions have made it increasingly possible to extract tight gas .
The higher recent prices of natural gas have also tended to support unconventional natural gas production .
There is a huge amount of tight gas in place .
Even with technological advances , the challenge is finding a way to extract it economically .
Where can tight gas be found ?
This is a map from the Advanced Resources International website .
Figure 7
Based on Figure 7 , one can see that tight gas resources are very widely distributed .
When wells are drilled , there is a very high rate of successful ( not necessarily economic , however ) wells -- approximately 98 % .
With such widely distributed resources , the challenge is finding " sweet spots " that can be more economically extracted , and developing techniques that will do this in a cost effective manner .
I have not shown maps of coal bed methane and shale gas , but they are also very widely distributed .
How does technology come into play ?
Some examples where technology has come into play with tight gas formations include :
• Better technologies to find the " sweet spots " within formations .
• Research on the optimal spacing of horizontal wells .
• Developing fracing fluids and proppants for stimulating the wells , and determining which is right for each well .
• Developing low - energy deliquification methods to separate water from the natural gas .
• Developing ways of reducing the ecological footprint , such as drilling multiple horizontal wells from the same pad .
• Developing methods for drilling wells more quickly and at lower cost .
In presentations , a person sees graphs such as this one , showing efficiency gains .
( EUR is estimated ultimate recovery ) :
Figure 8
The effect of these changes is to improve Energy Return on Energy Invested ( EROEI ) , relative to what it otherwise would have been .
With small changes , the economics can be improved enough to make a larger portions of sites economic , increasing the amount that is economically recoverable .
How has the amount of research on unconventional gas production been changing ?
The amount spent on research and development has been falling .
The amounts in this exhibit represent a summarization by ARI of the expenditures of 29 energy - producing companies .
Figure 9
There is a long lag between research and its widespread benefit -- estimated to average about 16 years by the National Petroleum Council .
During the 1980s and early 1990s , the Gas Research Institute ( a federal program ) and the Department of Energy sponsored research programs .
These programs contributed to the higher level of research spending during these periods .
The research programs of the 1980s and early 1990s are now bearing fruit , in the form of increased unconventional gas production .
These research programs have been discontinued .
Companies are continuing to do some research on their own , but the amount is lower .
There is a very real difference between ( 1 ) a government program , with funding by companies and with applications tested at many different sites , and ( 2 ) each company doing its own research .
If each company does its own research , it can patent the new application , and eventually use it to improve its own results .
The present value of the benefit is relatively small , since it benefits only the company itself , and the timing is quite distant .
It may eventually be able to sell the benefits to others , but this will take time .
If companies can work together on research through an organization such as the Gas Research Institute , the results can be shared widely , more quickly .
These shared results benefit all , not just a single company .
Because of this , the benefit to the industry and society as a whole is likely to come much sooner than with many small patents by individual companies .
Because of the faster timing , the present value of the benefit of the combined research is likely to be higher than the sum of the present values of the independent research of the individual companies .
The cross-fertilization of the combined research programs may also provide benefits .
Anti-trust laws do not permit companies to work together in this fashion , without some federal program .
What are trends in well productivity ?
One exhibit prepared by ARI shows declining well productivity .
Figure 10
Part of this decline in well productivity will be offset by the recent lower cost of drilling wells , because of efficiency gains .
Some of it is expected -- companies are now drilling more closely spaced wells , each draining a smaller area .
The lower well productivity does makes it more difficult to maintain profitability , however .
How is profitability of the unconventional gas industry viewed ?
Figure 11
Figure 11 shows a recent profitability analysis by Goldman Sachs .
It seems to indicate that the profitability of gas projects ( nearly all unconventional ) which are now underway is acceptable .
Production of unconventional gas is viewed as low risk -- the gas is easy to find ; the trick is extracting it without losing money .
Profitability is not expected to be as high as for some other types of ventures , because of its low - risk nature .
What are the prospects for unconventional gas going forward ?
ARI shows this chart of its view of reserves and technically recoverable resources .
Figure 12
ARI characterizes the amounts it shows as merely a " snapshot in time " of its view of how much can be technically recovered , based on what is known about reservoirs today and current technology .
ARI says its estimates are sometimes considered " aggressive " .
ARI has been making estimates of this type for several years , and their estimates have been trending upward .
It seems to me that there is a reasonable possibility that ARI 's estimates will prove to be accurate , or even low , with improving technology .
They seem to have a good understanding of the industry , and the approach they use seems reasonable .
The third layer from the top of the pyramid is the amount ARI estimates to be technically recoverable , but that is not yet included in proven reserves .
This layer totals 580 trillion cubic feet .
The footnote indicates that 260 trillion cubic feet ( of the 580 trillion cubic feet total ) is estimated to be economically recoverable at a price less than $ 5.00 a thousand cubic feet ; 140 trillion cubic feet is estimated to be economically recoverable at a price between $ 5.00 and $ 6.00 a thousand cubic feet ; and 180 trillion cubic feet is estimated to be uneconomic at a price of $ 6.00 a thousand cubic feet .
The current price is over $ 11.00 a thousand cubic feet , so some of the uneconomic layer may now be economic .
Of the 580 trillion cubic feet of technically recoverable resources , ARI indicates 379 trillion cubic feet , or 65 % of the total , relates to tight gas .
Other organizations provide estimates of technically recoverable unconventional gas resources using older data .
In 2003 , the National Petroleum Council put together an estimate using data through 1998 .
Its estimate , comparable to the 580 trillion cubic feet , was 206 trillion cubic feet .
The USGS in 2006 estimated the amount of undeveloped continuous resources to be 306 trillion cubic feet .
How do the reserves and technically recoverable resources for unconventional gas compare to recent US natural gas production ?
The pyramid in Figure 12 shows 105 trillion cubic feet of proven reserves for unconventional natural gas as of December 31 , 2005 , ( second layer of pyramid ) .
This level amounted to a little over half of US total proven reserves of 204 trillion cubic feet as of that date .
The latest date for which proven natural gas reserves are available is December 31 , 2006 .
Proven reserves were then 211 trillion cubic feet , based on EIA data .
Natural gas production for 2006 was 18.5 trillion cubic feet , so proven reserves amount to about 11.4 years of production .
These are the published amounts , without consideration of future " resources " .
In Figure 12 , ARI 's estimate of technically recoverable , but not necessarily economically recoverable , unconventional natural gas resources as of December 31 , 2006 was 580 trillion cubic feet .
If we add this full amount to the proven reserves of 211 trillion cubic feet as of the same date , we get 791 trillion cubic feet of possibly available resources .
791 trillion cubic feet amounts to a little less than 43 years of production at the 2006 level .
If we include only the 400 trillion in resources estimated to be recoverable at $ 6.00 or less per thousand cubic feet , the total is 611 trillion cubic feet , or 33 years at 2006 production levels ( for all natural gas , not just unconventional ) .
Clearly , if these resources are available , it could make a big difference to the amount of natural gas which can be produced going forward .
Where are we headed going forward ?
If peak oil is approaching , the price of oil is expected to rise going forward .
The price of WTI oil is now over $ 120 dollars a barrel , and many are talking about oil at $ 200 a barrel in the next year or two .
If natural gas follows its historical pattern , its price will tend to rise as well .
One might argue that the price of coal will hold the natural gas price down , but with all of the concern about global warming , and all of the electrical power plants that use natural gas , I think there is a good chance that the price of natural gas will tend to rise with oil , especially in North America .
Higher prices will tend to make more of the unconventional natural gas economic .
Improvements in technology have clearly made a big difference in the amount if unconventional gas that can be recovered economically .
With the slowdown in spending on research , technology improvements are likely to be smaller , but there will still be some improvements .
It is unfortunate that the recent energy bills have not included funding for combined unconventional natural gas research , similar to that done by the Gas Research Institute .
Even if 100 % of the funding were from the industry , it would be beneficial from the point of enabling research on a combined basis , so that society could get the benefit of the research more quickly .
Discovery is not really an issue with unconventional -- we already know pretty well where the resource is , and tools are available ( or are being perfected ) to find the sweet spots .
The industry complains that there are considerable problems in actually trying to develop the resources .
According to a presentation by Laramie Energy at an EIA conference , one problem is speculators who lease land with no intention of developing it .
Another is the fact that 50 % of Western land in owned by federal or local governments , and can not be developed .
Another issue is the numerous permitting requirements which delay production .
There are also many restrictions because of endangered species , surface use restrictions , and local ordinances .
We hear the oil industry complaining loudly about access issues .
I think they may really have a point ; it can be very difficult to get access to the land where tight gas is located and take the necessary steps to produce the gas .
If some of these access issues can be resolved , this too will help natural gas production .
Whether on not unconventional natural gas production will grow in the future will depend on price , technology , and access .
Liebig 's Law of the Minimum may also play a role .
While we often write off US natural gas , it seems like there is at least a possibility that the unconventional natural gas will make up for the decline in conventional natural gas .
The rise in unconventional natural gas production may even permit a small increase in total US natural gas production , and reduce the need for imported LNG .
US natural gas production in 2007 was at its highest level in since 2001 , and 2008 production is starting off the year higher than 2007 .
While no breakdown is available into conventional / unconventional , it is pretty clear that it is unconventional production that is giving the production boost .
Natural gas proven reserves have been rising for several years .
I think that production of unconventional natural gas is something we need to be examining more closely .
The EROEI of unconventional natural gas is not very high , but there is a huge amount of it .
Seven highly qualified and carefully vetted Palestinian students from the Israeli - blockaded Gaza Strip will come to the United States for advanced study after all .
After reporting in The Times by Ethan Bronner drew high - level American attention , top State Department officials intervened to restore the students ’
Fulbright fellowships that lower - level functionaries had notified them would be withdrawn .
Israel has agreed to facilitate special exit permits .
It is a welcome victory  for the students ; for Israel , which should want to see more of Gaza ’s young people follow a path of hope and education rather than hopelessness and martyrdom ; and for the United States , whose image in the Middle East badly needs burnishing .
It should not be the end of the story .
There are hundreds of other foreign fellowship winners still trapped in Gaza by the same Israeli policy that nearly blocked the Fulbright Seven .
On Thursday , an Israeli official told The Times that the government would allow a very limited number of additional students to leave Gaza to study abroad .
That is a clear step in the right direction , but not enough .
Gaza is home to roughly 1.5 million Palestinians .
Some 600 foreign scholarship winners have been barred from leaving .

President George Bush lavished anniversary praise on Israel yesterday , as Palestinians commemorated the " Nakba " or " catastrophe " when 700,000 were forced from or fled their homes 60 years ago .
In a special address to the Israeli Knesset , Mr Bush declared that the US was proud to be the " closest ally and best friend in the world " of a nation that was a " homeland for the chosen people " and had " worked tirelessly for peace and ... fought valiantly for freedom . "
And in a speech that linked together Hamas , Hizbollah and al - Qa'ida , the President likened those – including " good and decent " people – who urged negotiations with " terrorists and radicals " , with supporters of appeasing the Nazis before the Second World War .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
On Iran , Mr Bush said that permitting " the world 's leading sponsor of terror " to possess " the world 's deadliest weapon " would be " an unforgiveable betrayal of future generations " .
Mr Bush 's speech was notable for only one reference to Palestinian aspirations for a state .
He did not allude to the current negotiations between the Israeli Prime Minister , Ehud Olmert , and the Palestinian President , Mahmoud Abbas , on the outlines of two - state solution that he himself helped to kick - start at the Annapolis conference last year .
Instead , his only mention was in a passage envisaging Israel 's 120th anniversary – 60 years hence – in which Palestinians would have " the homeland they have long dreamed of and deserved – a democratic state that is governed by law . "
By that time , he prophesied , the Middle East would consist of " free and independent societies " , and Hamas , Hizbollah and al - Qa'ida would have been defeated " as Muslims across the region recognise the emptiness of the terrorists ' vision and the injustice of their cause " .
Nor did Mr Bush make even an oblique reference to the fact that he was delivering his speech on the day that Palestinians annually commemorate the " Nakba " in the 1948 war that left a victorious Israel in control of 78 per cent of mandatory Palestine .
As sirens sounded and thousands of black balloons were released across the West Bank , several thousand Palestinians gathered in Ramallah 's main Manara Square to hear a taped address by Mr Abbas urging reconciliation and an end to Israeli settlement building in the West Bank to facilitate negotiations on a future state .
" Sixty years have passed , " he said .
" It 's time to end the Nakba for the Palestinian people . "
But a Nakba day message from Hamas , which controls Gaza , called on Palestinians to continue " resistance " and urged the Palestinian President to " abandon the illusion of negotiations . "
At least one Palestinian youth was injured in Gaza after several dozen teenagers broke away at the end of a Hamas - organised protest near the northern Erez crossing .
As youths threw stones , Israeli forces fired live rounds and tear gas .
Three Arab Knesset members were led away before the President 's speech by security guards after unfurling a banner saying " We shall overcome . "
Mr Bush repeated the symbolic oath traditionally uttered by Israeli soldiers at Masada , the fortress where 960 Jews in the first century rebellion against Roman rule committed suicide rather than surrender , and which he had visited yesterday : " Masada shall never fall again " .
He added to a standing ovation : " And America will be at your side . "
But his speech did not mention the occupation of Palestinian territory since the 1967 war or restate US and international stances critical of Israel – such as demands for settlement outposts to be removed or for expansion of settlements to be halted .
Nor did he mention that those calling for some engagement with Hamas include some former Israeli military and intelligence figures .
Mr Olmert told parliamentarians that he was confident that a peace agreement would " be approved in the Knesset by a large majority and ... supported by the vast majority of the Israeli public " .
* Reuters news agency renewed its demand yesterday for a prompt explanation of why the Israeli military in Gaza fired on one of its cameramen , Fadel Shana , who was killed a month ago today .
Hello !
My name is Philip .
Previously , I did the 9 - 5 life , or actually , it was more an 8 am to 8 pm kind of life .
A life that did n’t give much back .
It ’s not that I did n’t love my life , but when looking back most days were the same .
Get up , eat , work , eat , work , watch Netflix , sleep .
And repeat .
Not that memorable .
In the past month , two new reports have examined how farm animals are raised in this country .
The report funded by the Pew Charitable Trusts calls the prevailing system “ industrial farm animal production . ”
The report from the Union of Concerned Scientists prefers the term “ confined animal feeding operations . ”
No matter what you call it , it adds up to the same thing .
Millions of animals are crowded together in inhumane conditions , causing significant environmental threats and unacceptable health risks for workers , their neighbors and all the rest of us .
The astonishing increase in the number and size of confined animal operations has been spawned largely by the very structure of American farm supports , which always has been skewed in a way that concentrates farming in fewer and fewer hands .
As both of these reports make clear , the so - called efficiency of industrial animal production is an illusion , made possible by cheap grain , cheap water and prisonlike confinement systems .
In short , animal husbandry has been turned into animal abuse .
Manure  traditionally a source of fertilizer  has been turned into toxic waste that fouls the air and adjacent water bodies .
Crowding creates health problems , resulting in the chronic overuse of antibiotics .
Just as you thought the chances of the United States going to war with Iran were diminishing ( largely because our own Iraqi sock - puppet regime has rejected U.S. accusations that Iran is directly responsible for American soldiers being killed in Iraq and because Director - General ElBaradei continues to report to the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency that he can find " no indication " that Iran now has or ever did have a nuclear weapons program ) Nancy Pelosi , Speaker of the House of Representatives , goes to Israel , presumably to help celebrate the 60th anniversary of al - Nakba , but also to discuss " the threat posed by Iran " to Israel .
Do you copy ?
Iran does not pose a threat to us or our troops in Iraq , but  in Pelosi ’s view  may somehow pose a threat to Israel ?
True , a " breakthrough deal "  reached with the help of Arab mediators  had just been reached in Lebanon between the U.S. - backed government and the Iranian and Syrian - backed Hezbollah , ending the country ’s 18 - month political stalemate , giving Hezbollah something of a victory and " veto " power over future government actions .
And , presumably , that is not good news to the Israelis who had already effectively lost the quasi- war fought two years ago with Hezbollah in Lebanon .
But , never mind that .
According to Haaretz , Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert told Pelosi that the international community " needed to take more drastic steps to stop Iran ’s efforts to obtain nuclear weapons . "
What efforts to obtain nuclear weapons ?
What sections of ElBaradei’s ( apparently null ) reports to the IAEA Board and to the Security Council  the results of years of exhaustive go - almost - anywhere ( including some military installations ) interview - almost - anyone ( including some military officials ) inspections  do the Likudniks not understand ?
What would it take to convince the paranoids in Israel and elsewhere that Iran ’s nuclear programs  which have voluntarily been made more transparent to IAEA inspections than any other country ’s  could never produce a nuclear weapon , so long as those programs are subject to IAEA Safeguards .
Never !
Well , according to Haaretz , Prime Minister Olmert " suggested " that , among other more drastic steps , the US impose a " naval blockade , " using U.S. warships , " to limit the movement of Iranian merchant vessels . "
Now , Iran is already subject to a third " round " of sanctions , preventing the import into or export from Iran , of goods , many of them commercial items , totally unrelated to Iran ’s Safeguarded nuclear programs , imposed by the Security Council " in order to strengthen a global response to this serious challenge and threat to international security . "
What constitutes a serious challenge and a threat to international security ?
Why , Iran ’s IAEA Safeguarded programs , of course .
The threat to international security of Iran ’s Safeguarded programs in which ElBaradei has repeatedly told the Security Council he can find " no indication " that any materials proscribed by the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons have ever been diverted to a military purpose .
The threat to international security of Iran ’s Safeguarded uranium - enrichment program the Iranians were forced to undertake , themselves  mining their own ore , converting it to " yellowcake , " converting the " yellowcake " to uranium - hexafluoride , developing their own supersonic gas - centrifuge uranium - enrichment devices  all because President Clinton strong - armed Boris Yeltsin into canceling the turn - key Safeguarded uranium - enrichment plant the Russians had agreed to provide Iran , and strong - armed the Chinese into canceling the turn - key Safeguarded uranium - conversion plant they had agreed to provide Iran .
Do n’t all members of the UN Security Council know all this ?
Of course , they do .
In his report last November to the IAEA Board and to the Security Council , ElBaradei included the results of his search through Iran ’s records , going back decades , said results not in conflict with the justifications the Iranians supplied for the secretive manner in which they were forced  by " some " Members of the Security Council  to pursue the civilian nuclear power fuel - cycle , which both the IAEA Statute and the NPT assure them is their " inalienable right . "
In his most recent report ElBaradei was “ able to continue to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material in Iran . ”
Even for those nuclear “ weaponization ” studies  alleged to have been done for Iran ’s military , stored on a laptop computer , allegedly stolen from an Iranian engineer , obtained by Israeli intelligence , given by our intelligence community to the IAEA  which the IAEA confronted the Iranians with earlier this year , ElBaradei noted that “ the Agency has not detected the use of nuclear material in connection with the alleged studies , nor does it have credible information in this regard . ”
Okay .
That should do it .
You can study all you want , but you ca n’t make a nuke unless you ’ve got a dozen pounds of weapons - grade plutonium or about ten times that much weapons - grade enriched - uranium .
The IAEA bottom line is that the Iranians have not produced , as yet , any of either , nor do they have the capability , as yet , of producing any of either .
The UN ’s own agency has verified , time and again , that Iranian nuclear programs are entirely " peaceful . "
So , ordinarily it would be all right for Presidential candidates , such as Barack Obama , to visit synagogues in this country and declare , as he did last month in Philadelphia and again this week in Florida ;
" As president , I will do everything that I can to help ( Israel ) protect itself …
We will make sure that it can defend itself from any attack , whether it comes from as close as Gaza or as far as Tehran . ”
But , as Prime Minister Olmert must know , and Speaker Pelosi should have known , a " naval blockade "  which goes beyond the imposition of " sanctions "  involves the interdiction and / or seizure of all civil " merchant vessels " and their cargoes on the high seas .
It ’s an act of war !
Hence , upon Pelosi ’s return to Washington  perhaps after frantic consultation with State Department officials  Pelosi spokesman Nadeam Elsharri denied " there was ever any mention of a US naval blockade of Iranian ports . "
Well , someone ’s lying .
So what the candidates for our presidency must make clear to Americans  most of whom are not paranoid  is actually what they mean when they say will " defend Israel . "
Will our next president be willing to blockade Iran , to starve Iranian women and children , to effectively launch a war against Iran because the Likudnik paranoids , here and abroad , consider Iran ’s Safeguarded nuclear programs a " threat " to Israel ?
Many think that learning how to make clothes will be expensive , but this is not necessarily the case .
Even though the amateur will make many mistakes , certain techniques makes the financial cost of these errors minimal .
And the time you spend messing up and the correcting your mistakes will make you a superior designer .
Flat Patterns
The approach I take to learning how to make clothes is called the flat pattern method , and is the easiest and most fundamental of the three basic methods .
Drafting ( the first alternative ) is highly technical , and draping is the more fluid and creative route .
Draping is how dresses that are gathered and rippled like a Greek goddess are made , but knowledge of the use of patterns makes the transition to draping much easier .
Check out this page from my blog for more information about different techniques .
The flat pattern method is based on the manipulation to the cuts and folds ( called darts ) needed to make a flat pattern curve and conform to a three dimensional body .
I wo n’t go into the details of darts and pattern manipulation here , just the material setup one might use to cheaply and effectively implement designs .
What you will need
So , you will need a sewing machine .
You will also need a pattern .
You can buy a pattern from a store or scale it up from a book .
At first you wo n’t even need fabric , just a roll of thin ( tissue ) paper large enough to trace your pattern onto .
What to do
The pattern can be traced onto this thin paper and then cut out .
Rather than cutting the darts out , as one would do to a final garment , they can be simply folded for right now .
This way , a model can wear your tissue paper mock up , the seams temporarily held by pins , and you can make adjustments .
When a final design is reached , the darts on the paper mock up are marked and the new pattern is cut out of thin cardboard ( not the type used for boxes , but the type resembling thick paper ) .
This is called a sloper .
Why a sloper ?
This way , you have a copy of a pattern you know to work well that will last for a long time .
Also , a sloper is used to generate new patterns in the future .
Check out this page of my blog about using a sloper .
And then came the fabric
Then , the beginner ( and the experienced designer alike ) will want to make a trial out of cloth , which will fit differently than tissue paper .
I suggest using old sheets , which can usually be found around the house or bought cheaply .
Even discounted new sheets are often cheaper than new fabric .
Cut the pattern out of the sheets .
Make sure to leave excess for the seams !
You can pin it up on a model again and see if any changes need to be made , and then sew it .
I ’ve actually seen many beautiful sun dresses that were made from recycled sheets , so you may consider this your final product .
Though , you still have a sloper from which to make many more designs with the same fit .
Finally , you can safely move on to using a fabric bought from a store ( or the internet ) .
Embroider , face the edges , silk screen , add pockets and buttons , do whatever you like .
Your clothes will fit you or your friends or children or clients like only custom clothing can .
I think this process is part of a wonderfully affordable way to learn how to make clothes , and what you can create may surprise you .

THE most interesting election result on May 13th was not Hillary Clinton 's 41 - point victory over Barack Obama in the Appalachians .
It was the Republicans ' loss of an ultra-safe seat in a special election in northern Mississippi .
West Virginia was the swan - song of a dying campaign .
Mississippi was a harbinger of disaster for congressional Republicans in November — and a warning of how difficult it will be for John McCain to win the White House .
It is rare for a party to win a third presidential term .
The only time it has happened since Harry Truman 's time was in 1988 .
Back then the retiring president , Ronald Reagan , had a job - approval rating in the high 50s .
George Bush 's job - approval rating is stuck in the low 30s .
Nearly three in four Americans tell pollsters that the country is on the “ wrong track ” .
The Mississippi result demonstrates that the anti-Republican mood , which gave the Democrats control of both the House and the Senate in 2006 , is getting ever stronger .
In 2004 the Republicans won the seat with 79 % of the vote ; they took it in 2006 by 66 % to 34 % .
This is the third safe seat in a row that the Republicans have lost .
On March 8th they lost Dennis Hastert 's seat in Illinois , a district that George Bush carried by ten points in 2004 .
They lost another safe seat , this one in Louisiana on May 3rd , that they had held for 33 years .
And then they lost the Mississippi seat as well .
Chris Van Hollen , the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , gave warning : “ there is no district that is safe for Republican candidates . ”
But does this mean that the party 's unpopularity will drag down Mr McCain ?
It is true that the senator is no identikit Republican .
He has spent years railing against the pork - barrel spending that has alienated so many rank - and - file Republicans .
He has embraced un -Republican issues such as global warming , speaks to Hispanic groups such as La Raza , and conducted a tour of impoverished America .
He stood in New Orleans 's devastated ninth ward and condemned the Bush administration 's lamentable handling of Hurricane Katrina .
If any Republican can survive an anti-Republican hurricane , it is Mr McCain .
Equally , though , Mr McCain cannot survive without the support of Republican stalwarts .
These are the people who man the phone banks and knock on doors .
They are also the people who fill the coffers .
Accordingly , Mr McCain has abandoned his earlier opposition to Mr Bush 's tax cuts and re-emphasised his support for appointing conservative judges .
But many activists still regard him as a cuckoo in the nest .
Mr McCain has not broken 80 % of the vote in Republican primaries since securing the nomination .
He won only 73 % in the vital state of Pennsylvania .
If Bob Barr , a former Republican turned libertarian , wins the Libertarian Party 's nomination , he could attract disillusioned Republican votes in November .
Mr McCain faces an expanding and energised Democratic Party that is desperate to retake the White House .
In many primary states twice as many Democrats have turned out to vote as Republicans .
And he is on the wrong side of the two biggest issues at the heart of the election .
The first is the war in Iraq .
Mr McCain — or “ McStay ” as the Democrats have taken to calling him — is an instinctive hawk at a time when America has grown weary of foreign entanglements ( 60 % of Americans think that the Iraq war was a mistake , for example ) .
MoveOn.org , a Democratic pressure group , is running endless ads quoting Mr McCain saying that America could be in Iraq for another hundred years , a statement that could come to define him — much as John Kerry 's statement that he voted in favour of funding the war before he voted against it defined him as a flip - flopper in 2004 .
The second issue is change .
For all his maverick reputation , Mr McCain goes into the general election wearing a scarlet “ R ” and tainted by his association with Mr Bush .
The fact that he is 71 also makes it difficult for him to cast himself as an agent of change .
Mr Obama repeatedly says that “ We can't afford to give John McCain the chance to serve out George Bush 's third term . ”
For all his talk of being above partisan bickering , Mr Obama has also been happy to play the age card , accusing Mr McCain of “ losing his bearings ” .
Mr McCain is also up against a formidable political machine .
The McCain camp has repeatedly hinted that they regard Mr Obama as a weaker opponent than Mrs Clinton .
Some conservatives persist in seeing him as a cross between Michael Dukakis and George McGovern .
But they underestimate the Chicagoan at their peril .
Mr Obama has put together the most disciplined and creative Democratic political machine in recent memory — one quite capable of defeating the formidable Clinton machine .
Mr Obama already has a national political apparatus in place , thanks to the prolonged Democratic primary .
He also has money coming out of his ears .
Mr Obama raised $ 41 m in March compared with Mr McCain 's $ 15 m .
Mr McCain 's likely decision to take public funding will limit him to $ 84 m in the two months before the election .
Mr Obama will be able to raise many times that amount .
Mr Obama certainly has weaknesses that the grizzled Republican can exploit .
Mr McCain , a war hero , is up against a man who had doubts about wearing a flag pin .
The Arizona senator is a genuine “ reformer with results ” — a man with a long record of taking on vested interests and working with the opposite party — who is up against a man with the most liberal voting record in the Senate .
With the Democratic nomination all but settled , the real fight is now on .
But Mr McCain is swimming against a mighty tide .
Furthermore , Ecocho's founder , Tim Macdonald , is also the co-founder of Found Agency , a high - profile search engine optimisation company that has been penalised by Google for breaking its rules in the past .
Google Australia spokesman Rob Shilkin said Ecocho was barred because it broke Google 's AdSense policies .
Google 's policy is that publishers running Google advertising must not " compensate users for viewing ads or performing searches , or promise compensation to a third party for such behaviour " .
By promising to plant trees , Ecocho broke those rules .
" The site was in clear violation of our terms of service and we had previously warned the owner of past violations , " Shilkin said .
" We have now stopped serving ads and search results to the owner 's sites . "
An angry Macdonald accused Google of not applying its rules consistently , saying other green search engines using Google technology had been allowed to operate without issue .
However , the other search engines , such as Blackle.com , do not explicitly promise to plant trees in return for searches .
Macdonald said his company met with Google in January and went through the project " in some detail " but was not informed it would be breaking the rules .
He would not say how much profit his company was making from the site but acknowledged the cost of planting the trees would be less than the advertising revenue .
" It is a business , it 's not a not - for - profit , we 've been very transparent about that , " he said .
The benefit of specialist green search engines is questionable because Google itself has invested heavily in green initiatives .
Google claims it is carbon neutral , whereas the servers powering sites such as Ecocho are not .
When questioned over this , Macdonald said : " We 've got a lot of users on the site who are using it from all over the world saying that it's a great idea . "
Another green search engine , Blackle.com , based in Sydney , has also been criticised for cashing in on web surfers ' eco-guilt .
The site is a custom version of Google with a black rather than white background , which its creators said could save thousands of watts of power a year because it takes less juice for a monitor to display black than white .
However , that claim was proved false by extensive testing , which found the power saving benefits were negligible or non-existent .
Like Ecocho , Blackle profits from advertisements appearing next to search results .
In May last year , Macdonald 's company , Found Agency , saw its Google ranking tumble after it was caught unfairly manipulating its search rankings .
At the time , Found 's other co-founder , Zak Asani , admitted to the Search Engine Room website that the company liked to test Google 's boundaries .
" We 've got between 1500 and 2000 websites running at any one time that we use to test the boundaries , " he said .

Energy - hungry cells die if they can't put the brakes on protein production .
Keeping a lid on ribosome activity is key to cells avoiding runaway energy use .
TIM EVANS / SPL
Researchers have found a protein complex that slows down a cell 's protein - production machinery when energy is running low .
The complex , called eNoSC , is critical for cell survival : energy - starved cells that do not have components of this complex rapidly self - destruct .
Proteins are constructed by complex molecular machines called ribosomes , which are made of RNA and protein .
Mammals contain hundreds of copies of the genes that encode ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) so that cells can crank out many ribosomes simultaneously .
Ribosome production is one of the biggest energy investments a cell can make .
Over the years it has become clear that cells do not just blindly churn out ribosomes .
“ It is a major energy drain on the cell , ” says molecular biologist Janet Stein of the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester .
“ It ’s definitely one of those things that a cell does n’t want to be spending ATP on if it is n’t necessary . ”
Instead , complex levels of regulation tweak ribosome production as energy needs fluctuate .
Cells that are growing slowly produce less rRNA than those that are dividing rapidly .
And cells taking on a new identity , to become a bone cell or a muscle cell , for instance , modify rRNA production to accommodate the requirements of the job1 .
“ It ’s such an important part of the cell that you ca n’t just have one way of regulating it , ” says Stein .
Complex machinery
Previous work had shown that rRNA gene expression is in part regulated by chemical changes made to the proteins , called histones , that are associated with DNA .
Now , Junn Yanagisawa of the University of Tsukuba in Japan and his colleagues have identified a complex of proteins that is responsible for these changes2 .
The eNoSC complex contains three proteins , including the SIRT1 protein which is thought to play a part in helping a cell cope when nutrients run low .
The complex reduces rRNA production in glucose - starved cells , providing a way to slow down protein production when energy is in short supply .
ADVERTISEMENT
Furthermore , the researchers found that glucose - hungry cells died more rapidly when production of any of the three proteins within eNoSC was inhibited .
But the death rate of cells grown in medium containing plenty of glucose was unaffected by the loss of eNoSC .
The findings " bring us closer to understanding how calorie restriction or energy level comes to regulate ribosomal gene expression ” , says Stein .
But Yanagisawa ’s work was done in cancer cells , which are easier to grow in culture and which have particularly high energy demands owing to their rapid proliferation .
An important follow - up , says Stein would be to repeat the experiments in non-cancerous cells .
Yanigasawa says that he and his colleagues are now comparing the response of non-cancerous and cancerous cells to starvation .
“ Such studies could provide a basis for a new strategy of cancer therapy , ” he says .

Uncle Sam Wants Your Newborn 's DNA Posted by Pile ( 16044 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
President Bush last week signed into law a bill which will see the federal government begin to screen the DNA of all newborn babies in the U.S. within six months , a move critics have described as the first step towards the establishment of a national DNA database .
Described as a " national contingency plan " the justification for the new law S. 1858 , known as The Newborn Screening Saves Lives
Act of 2007 , is that it represents preparation for any sort of " public health emergency . "
The bill states that the federal government should " continue to carry out , coordinate , and expand research in newborn screening " and " maintain a central clearinghouse of current information on newborn screening ... ensuring that the clearinghouse is available on the Internet and is updated at least quarterly " .
Sections of the bill also make it clear that DNA may be used in genetic experiments and tests .
One health care expert and prominent critic of DNA screening is Twila Brase , president of the Citizens ' Council on Health Care who has written a detailed analysis of the new law in which she warns that it represents the first program of populationwide genetic testing .
Brase states that S.1858 and H.R. 3825 , the House version of the bill , will :
* Establish a national list of genetic conditions for which newborns and children are to be tested .
* Establish protocols for the linking and sharing of genetic test results nationwide .
* Build surveillance systems for tracking the health status and health outcomes of individuals diagnosed at birth with a genetic defect or trait .
* Use the newborn screening program as an opportunity for government agencies to identify , list , and study " secondary conditions " of individuals and their families .
* Subject citizens to genetic research without their knowledge or consent .
" Soon , under this bill , the DNA of all citizens will be housed in government genomic biobanks and considered governmental property for government research , " Brase writes .
" The DNA taken at birth from every citizen is essentially owned by the government , and every citizen becomes a potential subject of government - sponsored genetic research . "
" The public is clueless .
S. 1858 imposes a federal agenda of DNA databanking and population - wide genetic research .
It does not require consent and there are no requirements to fully inform parents about the warehousing of their child 's DNA for the purpose of genetic research . "

It 's entirely possible that they * could * take mandatory samples when we get our kids vaccinated !
Or , it could easily be " required " as a part of regular dental care ( I 'm thinking the swab tests , here ... )
Home births or no , vaccinations are required to get our children into public and private schools - so do we all homeschool ...?
And who goes without dental care for their kids ?
This is very , very disturbing ... the possibilities for abuse are just about endless .
How large of a step would it be to start a little domestic eugenics program ?
It 's not an issue of cloning .... it's more an issue of what sort of manipulations could occur ... yikes .

I think we should put a stop to this , in the most extreme way , stop getting pregnant !
if there is a boycott , if that term may be used to describe the cessation of nationwide pregnancies , then what can they do ?
if there are no newborns to screen , then they lose .
imagine the impact of such a statement .
we have the right to refuse !

Let 's face it folks , the best we can hope for is to delay the inevitable .
We can continue to fight as best we can , but those in power positions in government , business , and even religion will eventually get their way .
All the advantages are on their side .
I happen to be a Christian , not affiliated with any church or denomination .
I believe in Biblical prophesy .
We are being prepared now to accept a one - world government and religion .
Now is the time to choose which side you are on .
God 's or the world's .

Time To Start The Killing

The Atlanta Journal - Constitution
May 9 , 2008
A former Atlanta police officer testified Thursday that narcotics officers routinely lied under oath when seeking search warrants — a practice that led to police killing a 92 - year - old woman .
Former Detective Gregg Junnier told a Fulton County jury that detectives would tell judges that they had verified their informants had bought cocaine from dealers by searching them for drugs before the buy took place .
“ I have never seen anyone searched before they go into the house … I ’ve never seen that done … even though officers always swear to it , ” Junnier said .
“ It ’s done that way in 90 percent of the warrants that are written . ”
But it was n’t just lies to get the warrant to search Kathryn Johnston ’s home that made Junnier uneasy , he said .
He had an inkling something was wrong when he and Officer Jason R. Smith were leading the narcotics team to the front door .
He said the northwest Atlanta house differed from the informant ’s description .
“ I said , ‘ Man , this does n’t look right , ’ and he said , ‘ I know , ’ ” Junnier testified .
” ‘ I said what do you want to do . ’
He said , ‘ Hit it . ' ”
A minute later , Johnston was lying on her floor , dying .

Additional Renting Costs
These are the costs on top of rent , such as the fee you pay to a broker and the opportunity cost on your security deposit .
But these expenses typically have a negligible impact .
The number of months of rent that the landlord will keep as a security deposit .
Methodology
The calculator keeps a running tally of the most common expenses of owning and renting .
It also takes into account something known as opportunity cost — for example , the return you could have earned by investing your money instead of spending it on a down payment .
The calculator assumes that the profit you would have made in your investments would be taxed as long - term capital gains and adjusts the bottom line accordingly .
The calculator tabulates opportunity costs for all parts of the buying and renting situations .
All figures are in current dollars .
Buying
Initial costs are the costs you incur when you go to the closing for the home you are purchasing .
This includes the down payment and other fees .
Recurring costs are expenses you will have to pay monthly or yearly in owning your home .
These include mortgage payments , condo fees ( or other community living fees ) , maintenance and renovation costs , property taxes and homeowner ’s insurance .
Property taxes , the interest part of the mortgage payment and , in some cases , a portion of the common charges are tax deductible .
The resulting tax savings is accounted for in each item ’s totals .
The mortgage payment amount increases each year for the term of the loan because the tax credit shrinks each year as the interest portion of the payments becomes smaller .
Opportunity costs are tracked for the initial purchase costs and for the recurring costs .
The former will give you an idea of how much you could have made if you had invested the down payment instead of buying your home .
Net proceeds is the amount of money you receive from the sale of your home minus the closing costs , which includes the broker ’s commission and other fees , the remaining principal balance that you pay to your mortgage bank and any tax you have to pay on profit that exceeds your capital gains exclusion .
If your total is negative , it means you have done very well :
You made enough of a profit that it covered not only the cost of your home , but also all of your recurring expenses .
Renting
Initial costs include the rent security deposit and , if applicable , the broker ’s fee .
Recurring costs include the monthly rent and the cost of renter ’s insurance .
Opportunity costs are calculated each year for both your initial costs and your recurring costs .
Net proceeds include the return of the rental security deposit , which typically occurs at the end of a lease .
Solar power , the holy grail of renewable energy , has always faced the problem of how to store the energy captured from the sun ’s rays so that demand for electricity can be met at night or whenever the sun is not shining .
The difficulty is that electricity is hard to store .
Batteries are not up to efficiently storing energy on a large scale .
A different approach being tried by the solar power industry could eliminate the problem .
The idea is to capture the sun ’s heat .
Heat , unlike electric current , is something that industry knows how to store cost - effectively .
For example , a coffee thermos and a laptop computer ’s battery store about the same amount of energy , said John S. O’Donnell , executive vice president of a company in the solar thermal business , Ausra .
The thermos costs about $ 5 and the laptop battery $ 150 , he said , and “ that ’s why solar thermal is going to be the dominant form . ”
Solar thermal systems are built to gather heat from the sun , boil water into steam , spin a turbine and make power , as existing solar thermal power plants do  but not immediately .
The heat would be stored for hours or even days , like water behind a dam .

What do Ladybugs Eat & How to Care your Pet Ladybugs
What do Ladybugs Eat & How to Care your Pet Ladybugs
Some pet lovers like to have their own ladybugs because of their beautiful and distinctive colors , though these colors are not only for beautification , instead , these acts as a shield from the attacks of various predators .
The ladybugs or lady beetles secrete a fluid from their leg joints which give them a foul taste .
The distinctive color of them is a reminder to their predators that they have tasted it before and it does not taste good .
A terrorized ladybird beetle can both play dead or secrete the unappetizing substance in order to protect itself .
How To Care Of Your Pet Ladybugs ?
You can find a ladybug in your garden easily .
Use a small net to catch it .
In case you are planning to hold it or catch it with your finger , then be gentle .
Once you catch a ladybug and ready to make it your pet , follow the steps below to look after it properly .
1 . Take a spacious Container
Putting your ladybug in a spacious container is preferable as it will allow it to fly around and also settle when it is tired .
You can add some fresh flowers , tree barks , leaves or small twigs which are its favorite habitat .
Also , they prefer to hide if threatened by your presence , so give them a place to hide .
You can put a hollow twig or a seashell which will both enhance the beauty of your ladybug ’s home and give it a place to hide .
While choosing a container people usually use a glass jar which looks really good but it is not at all suitable for ladybugs as glass will catch the heat and certainly you do not want to burn your pet .
Hermit crab houses are recommended if you are keeping the bug for more than 24 hours .
You can get a small terrarium that suits the needs of your ladybug if you are planning to keep it as a pet in your house .
Changing the flowers and twigs before they get rotten is also necessary as the fresh environment will help your bug to thrive well .
2. Feeding Your Ladybug
Remember , what you feed your ladybug and how often , both depend on the size of the bug .
Too much feeding is highly discouraged .
You can use a small container like a cap of the bottle to feed the bug .
Feed a small amount of honey to your ladybug with the help of the cap , or you can feed it lettuce which is favorable to them .
Feeding raisins will also add a special taste to their tiny mouth .
Feeding twice a day is just enough .
3. Giving Water to your Bug
They do need water regularly , and giving it to them is very easy .
Just add two to three drops of water in a cotton ball or a small tissue and put it inside the container .
The bug will have it according to its need .
Just do not put a large container filled with water as there ’s a possibility that your bug might drown .
4 . Whether to release or not ?
In case you like your ladybug too much then you can keep it , but releasing it into the wild is recommended if you cannot look after it daily to keep it alive and healthy .
What Do Ladybugs Eat - In the Wild ?
There are more than 5,000 different species of ladybugs , all of which are omnivorous in nature .
They can sustain on both plants and smaller insects .
Most of the people who love ladybugs for their beauty do not know that they are very useful to the gardeners too .
Farmers love these bugs for their appetite as they voraciously eat plant - eating insects .
Aphids are their special favorites ; they lay hundreds of eggs in the aphid colonies and when the eggs hatch they start to feed on them .
Though there are some ladybugs which feed on crops , like the Mexican bean beetle and the squash beetle .
So choosing the right bugs over the destructive ones is necessary .
This weekend is a weekend for discussion here at ProBlogger and I ’m posting some questions submitted by readers via Twitter .
jophllips asks :
“ should you add keywords to the name field when you leave comments ”
So another way to put it – should you leave your name , blog name or some other keywords in the ‘ name ’ URL when you leave comments on a blog ?
This is a question we ’ve debated previously here on ProBlogger and it generated some great discussion .
Looking forward to hearing your answers .
It is a fact of neuroscience that everything we experience is a figment of our imagination .
Although our sensations feel accurate and truthful , they do not necessarily reproduce the physical reality of the outside world .
Of course , many experiences in daily life reflect the physical stimuli that send signals to the brain .
But the same neural machinery that interprets inputs from our eyes , ears and other sensory organs is also responsible for our dreams , delusions and failings of memory .
In other words , the real and the imagined share a physical source in the brain .
So take a lesson from Socrates : “ All I know is that I know nothing . ”
One of the most important tools used by neuroscientists to understand how the brain creates its sense of reality is the visual illusion .
Historically , artists as well as researchers have used illusions to gain insights into the inner workings of the visual system .
Long before scientists were studying the properties of neurons , artists had devised a series of techniques to deceive the brain into thinking that a flat canvas was three - dimensional or that a series of brushstrokes was indeed a still life .
Visual illusions are defined by the dissociation between the physical reality and the subjective perception of an object or event .
When we experience a visual illusion , we may see something that is not there or fail to see something that is there .
Because of this disconnect between perception and reality , visual illusions demonstrate the ways in which the brain can fail to re-create the physical world .
By studying these failings , we can learn about the computational methods used by the brain to construct visual experience .
Brightness , color , shading , eye movement and other factors can have powerful effects on what we “ see . ”
In this series of images , we showcase several basic categories of visual illusions and what they can teach us about perception in the brain .
Look at him .
You look at him and think about what you did .
Look at his little frown .

Another question that day : “ I was on an Airbus yesterday that was extremely dirty .
The headrests on the blue fabric seats were a grayish brown color .
Several seats were ripped .
The seat cushions had no cushion left .
Are we the 99 - cent store airline ?
How do I take pride in this product ? ”
Airline mergers may be profitable but , in the short term at least , they are rough on passengers .
“ The only success so far has been on the financial side , ” John McCorkle , a US Airways flight attendant and union officer based in Philadelphia , said in an interview .
“ It was an absolute disaster for our employees and our customers . ”
Mr. Parker said the merger saved two troubled airlines from potential financial ruin and that , over time , service would improve .
In the meantime , blunt employee input “ keeps management extremely honest , ” he said .
Last March , when US Airways combined its two reservations systems into one , it was a mess .
Kiosks that dispense about half of the boarding passes did not work properly .
Neither did the Web site , where 16 percent of passengers check in .
That left ticket counter agents , who normally handle the other third of check - ins , to process nearly 100 percent in some locations .
And many of them had not received adequate training on the new system , so they were moving more slowly .
It amounted to triple the work for a temporarily less efficient group .
The reservations mess , though in a sanitized way , had been explained to Scott Kirby , the airline ’s president .
“ I certainly knew we had issues , ” Mr. Kirby said .
“ But until I went out and met with employee groups , I did n’t appreciate the problems we were having . ”
Spending a day at the hub in Charlotte , N.C. , about one week into the mess “ really was an epiphany , ” Mr. Kirby said .
“ I wrote a diatribe on my BlackBerry on my way back to Phoenix . ”
Because of the reservations problems , just 55.5 percent of US Airways ’
March domestic flights got to the gate within 15 minutes of scheduled arrival times , an industry low that month .
Distrust between the sides of the 2005 merger  old US Airways is known among the rank and file as East , America West as West  has in some ways grown worse , not an encouraging sign in an industry contemplating other mergers .
SHANGHAI , China–Landing here a week ago , he hit the ground running .
Yesterday he bolted to the airport in a blur , travelling at 440 kilometres per hour onboard Shanghai 's sleek , ultra- modern Maglev rail link .
Toronto Mayor David Miller wound up his seven - day trade mission to China yesterday , in the very same way he began – at high speed .
While others on his staff will stay on today , Miller decided to return a day early , rather than run the risk of getting grounded by an approaching typhoon .
With a possible TTC strike looming , Miller wants to be sure he 's back by tomorrow .
" It 's just prudent , " he said yesterday .
Toronto's trade mission here began last week on a note of controversy over its timing in the wake of the Tibet crisis .
But Miller seemed to turn what could have been a negative on the mission into a plus .
He took citizens ' concern about human rights and Tibet right to the Politburo , the Communist Party 's most powerful body , addressing the issue in a meeting with Politburo member Bo Xilai .
Then he got down to business .
Was the trip worth it ?
" Tremendously worth it , " said Miller during an interview on the 54th floor of Shanghai 's Grand Hyatt Hotel , overlooking the vast expanse of skyscrapers that dominate China 's most modern city .
" Given the importance China will have over the next 20 to 50 years , it 's very clear – once you 've been here a couple of days – that it 's going to have tremendous influence over our future .
" We 've got to engage .
The longer we wait , the more disadvantaged Toronto and Canada will be . "
Miller said it was " very important to see it with my own eyes .
There is just no substitute . "
The mayor said he was confident that a series of letters of agreement between private businesses and government - to - government between Toronto and Chongqing would lead to cross-country investment and job creation .
A Chongqing mission will be visiting Toronto next month , he added .
The 22 - year - old sister - city relationship Toronto shares with Chongqing – the fastest growing city in the world – is something he intends to nurture , Miller said .
York University professor David Lumsden , an anthropologist who is finishing up a sabbatical in Chong - qing , dismissed skeptics who question the value of trade missions and sister - city relationships .
" It 's not about junkets and never has been about junkets , " Lumsden said .
" It 's about talking to each other , learning from each other and bringing home tangible results .
" Do you value international understanding ?
Do you believe that China is important to the future of the world ?
" If you do , then of course these missions are worth it . "
Miller , on his first trip to China , said he was " surprised " by the pace of China 's development , by its enormity – an official said Beijing has 1.4 billion square feet of construction on the go – and by how modern and efficient the best factories are .

" I do n't believe that we in Canada really know how modern China is , " Miller said .
" It was an eye - opener . "
Touring a series of motorcycle parts and assembly factories in Chongqing , which supply both BMW in Germany and Harley Davidson in the U.S. , Miller said he was impressed by the quality of production .
" I toured an Italian - Chinese joint venture too that had the most modern equipment I 've ever seen in a factory , " he said .
The mayor said he was also impressed by the tremendous sense of " energy " in China , and its ability to draw up plans and get things done .
" The Chinese do n't wait , " he said .
" They act . "
That ability to act , especially in China 's four major centres of Beijing , Shanghai , Chongqing and Tianjin , is because of a minimum of red tape and an abundance of money – the kind of which that Miller can only dream .
Each city not only has a high degree of autonomy , reporting only to the central government , but each also receives nearly 50 per cent of all tax revenues raised in its jurisdictions .
By comparison , Toronto directly receives just 6 per cent .
" Once a decision is made here , " Miller mused , " the city has both the power and money to act . "
It would be fantasy to think that Ottawa would adopt a similar approach , Miller said .
But it could act as a spur for Ottawa to think of innovative ways to help Canadian cities compete in an increasingly competitive world .
Miller noted he was overwhelmed by the generosity and warm welcome his mission received here .
Last week , national carrier Air China extended a greeting to him over the in - flight public announcement system while en route to Chongqing .
But yesterday , flying into Shanghai , Air China went one step further : they turned the public address system over to the mayor allowing him to extend his greetings to everyone on board .

I am not certain whether the ability to retry a code block when encountering exceptions was a feature available in Ruby , but I certainly could n't find anything on that topic ( what I did find were mostly about the retry keyword for iterator loops ) .
Before you ask why I need this , the motivation for this was because I was getting intermittent HTTP errors ( 503s mostly ) trying to connect to a web service .
Turns out it 's really easy in Ruby to implement a retryable method that does something like this :
retryable ( : tries => 5 , :on => OpenURI ::HTTPError ) do open ( ' http://example.com/flaky_api')
#
Code that mashes up stuff for your " social networking " site .
end
Here are the Kernel #retryable specs ( pastie ) .
And the code :
# Options : # * : tries - Number of retries to perform .
Defaults to 1 . # * : on - The Exception on which a retry will be performed .
Defaults to Exception , which retries on any Exception .
# # Example # ======= # retryable ( : tries => 1 , :on => OpenURI ::HTTPError ) do # # your code here # end # def retryable ( options = {} , & block ) opts = { : tries => 1 , :on => Exception }.merge( options ) retry_exception , retries = opts [ : on ] , opts [ : tries ] begin return yield rescue retry_exception retry if ( retries -= 1 ) > 0 end yield end
It 's not hard to implement the same for checking return values as well , i.e .
retryable_deluxe( : tries => 5 , : on => { : return => nil } ) { puts " working ... " } retryable_deluxe( : on => { : exception => StandardError , : return => nil } ) do # your code here end
Ruby is nice .
When programmers disagree , generally one of two things happens .
One , they talk it over like mature adults and agree on a solution that works for everybody .
Two , they have a swearing match that ends on an angry compromise , then the programmers go off and do their own thing anyway and blame the whole mess on a " miscommunication . "
Guess which path was taken by Skip S.'s predecessors .
Skip was close to graduating with an advanced degree in Computer Science , when he picked up a job as a C developer .
The company had stumbled onto success against all odds when writing an application for a claims adjuster .
The sweet taste of accidental success roused their ambition , so they decided to scale up and port it to the then - cutting - edge Windows platform .
The Right Way(s )
The existing software had been assembled by a team of * NIX developers who knew a little X .
They all sat in close proximity to one another , which initially fostered productivity , but eventually fostered hatred .
Internal conflicts over minor issues divided the team to the point that communication effectively broke down , aside from quietly , angrily muttering to onesself .
Each programmer knew The Right Way , and that each other programmer on the team was a drooling moron that did nothing but pollute the code .
One would angrily check a code file out , make a change that would n't change the code aside from supporting the developer 's ego , and check it back in .
This eventually gave way to programmers making their own versions of a class so that they would n't have to use code that they had n't written personally .
After a year or so of arguing , duplicating functionality , and arguing some more , the team started disappearing .
And it had worn down to the point that there was just one guy left .
This when Skip joined the team , and got to know " Lars . "
Lars filled Skip in on all the background .
" And good riddance to the team !
I was the only one that knew how to code , that 's why I rewrote so many of their stupid modules . "
Although things were almost entirely in Lars 's control , he had chosen to leave as well .
He'd be around long enough to train Skip and then hand over the reins .
The training process was , in a word , useless .
Lars spent hours explaining their source control system ( which Skip was already familiar with ) , explaining how to use vi ( Skip already knew ) , how MAKE commands work ( Skip already knew how to type " make " ) .
After the training , Lars left for good .
The Backup Plan
The only part of Skip 's training that was remotely useful was when Lars showed him how to make a backup .
" You take a tape from here , " he said , pointing to a pile of tapes , " then you do this , " he said , typing on the keyboard , " then you put the tape here , " he said , pointing to a neatly arranged stack of tapes .
When Skip asked how the tapes were arranged and if they had any labels , Lars said they did n't need them , since the stack was always kept in order .
When a client noticed several newer features disappear from the application , it did n't take long for Skip to find out that someone had restored from the wrong tape .
Returning to the room , the once well - maintained stack was now a disorganized pile .
Skip 's boss had tossed all the tapes into a box prior to a big client 's visit , and just dumped the tapes back on the table afterwards .
This is when Skip learned a valuable lesson — often , the best solution to a problem is adjusting the client 's expectations .
Skip had inherited two things with Lars 's departure : around 100,000 lines of passive - aggressive C code , and a number of customers that he could count on one hand , even if said hand only had three fingers .
The Message Queue
One thing the previous team had agreed on , apparently , was that the built in wprintf ( ) and wsprintf ( ) functions were no good .
Specifically , while these functions were designed to output characters to a buffer , the team decided that they should instead pop up a dialog box and have some additional functionality .
And they'd each agreed to create their own functions named wprintf ( ) and wsprintf ( ) — not to be confused with wprintf ( ) and wsprintf ( ) .
Each of these functions , in their own unique way , would instantiate a dialog box and , optionally , any number of buttons and input boxes .
With this implementation , though , they had to figure out a way to show multiple dialogs at once .
At first , opening a dialog while another was open would just replace the contents of the existing dialog .
Somehow , the team agreed on a solution — they 'd create a stack , push data on to it from the previous dialog , then grab it back when the user returned to the dialog .
Simple !
But what about going back and forth between dialogs ?
Make the dialogs modals !
That way , the user has to deal with the dialog in front of them before the next is displayed .
Simple !
One problem , though ; computers are slow !
The team agreed that a linked list would be too slow , so they 'd make an array of pointers of a reasonable size for the dialog data .
Six ought to be enough for anybody .
If more than six dialogs appeared , something was probably wrong .
Out in the real world , though , take this hypothetical situation .
Mom , dad , their four kids , and grandpa need coverage .
You enter the names and information for everyone , then get to grandpa .
You keep clicking OK , OK , OK , OK , OK , etc. until finally the system hangs .
Grandpa filicided dad right off the stack .
And dad 's the policy holder .
And now things get confusing .
Somehow , Skip managed to keep the code going for a few years .
Surprised ?

ABC News is , but I do n’t know what channel they ’re watching …
Surprising Political Endorsements By U.S. Troops … these soldiers spoke out about their personal endorsements , and their opinions are likely to matter .
In 2004 , 73 percent of the U.S. military voted for a presidential candidate , and officials believe it may be even higher this time around .
so here comes the surprise …
PFC Jeremy Slate said he supported Sen. Barack Obama … SFC Patricia Keller also expressed support for Obama… Spc. Imus Loto said he supported Obama … 1st Sgt. David Logan said , “ I am leaning toward Hillary … ” Spc. Joseph Lindsesdt ’s pick is Obama …
I know , I know .
There ’s a soldier who is ‘ leaning ’ towards Hillary .
But combat stress is a real issue for the military , and nothing to make light of .
Sgt. Cory Messingham from Lewisville , Texas , said he was n’t following the race , but he was concerned about candidates ’ paying attention to the emotional toll that the war has taken on soldiers .
“ My biggest issue is support for the military , military funding and our deployments , not having long deployments anymore .
Because [ the ] majority of us are doing … 15 - month deployments .
So , it ’s tough on the soldiers and tough on the soldiers ’ families .
Those are really my biggest issues . ”
But just in case anyone is keeping track of the numbers …
House prices are falling more rapidly than at any time since the early 1990s property crash , according to figures released by the Halifax yesterday .
Amid City fears that the Bank of England 's decision yesterday to peg the cost of borrowing at 5 % could push the economy into recession , the Halifax , Britain 's biggest mortgage lender , reported that the cost of a home fell by 2.4 % in May , wiping almost £ 5,000 off the cost of an average house .
Last month 's decline marked the seventh fall in nine months .
In the past three months , prices have dropped by 6.1 % - faster than at any time since the bank began publishing data in 1983 .
The biggest fall during the downturn of the early 1990s was the 3.8 % decline between August and October 1992 , a period which included Black Wednesday .
Roger Bootle , economic adviser to Deloitte , said the 8 % drop in house prices since their peak was likely to turn into a fall of 20 % by the end of 2009 , with knock - on effects on consumer spending .
" The UK economy is on course for a very deep and prolonged economic downturn , if not an outright recession , " he added .
According to Halifax 's data , the average house now costs £ 184,111 , down from £ 189,027 in April .
A year ago it cost £ 196,893 , showing that prices are down by 6.5 % in the past year .
" It 's now very clear that house prices are in vertical decline , with our worst expectations being confirmed every month , " said Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman Vince Cable .
He said the Bank 's decision to keep rates on hold will mean little to large numbers of families who are having to remortgage at significantly higher rates of interest .
Cable called on the government to give the Bank of England a measure of inflation which " takes full account " of what is happening in the housing market , saying that had ministers allowed interest rates to reflect the overheating of the housing market several years ago , the bubble would not have grown so large .
Martin Ellis , chief economist at Halifax , said the slowdown was partly caused by the tightening of the mortgage market , due to the credit crunch , and the increased pressure on consumer spending .
The latest figures from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors ( Rics ) showed that first - time buyers were particularly thin on the ground .
The number of new buyers showing an interest in buying a house has fallen for the last 17 months running .
Despite evidence that the manufacturing , construction and services sectors of the economy are struggling , the decision by the Bank 's monetary policy committee to keep the bank rate at 5 % came as no surprise to the City .
The Bank is concerned about the cost of living , with inflation on the government 's preferred measure already standing at 3 % and likely to go higher over the coming months .
Mervyn King , the Bank 's governor , is obliged to write an explanatory letter to the chancellor , Alistair Darling , if inflation deviates by more than one percentage point from its 2 % target , something analysts believe may happen this month .
Ellis pointed out that the drop in house prices comes after several years of growth , with the average home rising £ 88,000 between August 2002 and August 2007 .
The gloom in the housing sector was accentuated by Bellway , the UK 's fourth - largest builder , which reported a 31 % drop in home reservations .
It now expects to sell up to 15 % fewer homes this year than in 2007 .

Google ’s New Favicon
This is one of the smaller changes to Google – at least if measured in pixels !
Google changed their “ Favicon.ico ” , the 16x16 image file that usually shows in the browser address bar or in bookmarks .
The old icon used a square with red , green and blue edges , wrapping an upper - case “ G ” .
The new logo is a bit more open , showing just the lower - case blue “ g ” from the Google logo , without borders , and a bit of shadow .
To see this , visit Google.com ( or images.google.com , Google Product Search and so on ) , empty your browser cache and reload the page .
Tony Ruscoe in the forum wonders , “ Is Google undergoing a rebranding exercise ...? ” and adds , “ Maybe they ’re going to be known as ’ the little g’ rather than ’ The Big G ’ from now on ... ” .
Google continues to grow and grow , but one of their self - proclaimed core values is “ Think and act like an underdog ” .

Peanut Butter and Deadly Taunts
A combination of bullying and peanut allergies may put some kids in the ER .
April 17 , 2008  --
Late last spring , 14 - year - old Sarah VanEssendelft of Mastic , N.Y. , experienced bullying worthy of a teen movie .
" There was a group of five girls ... and they decided they did n't want me sitting at their lunch table anymore , " said VanEssendelft .
To get her to leave , they all brought in peanut butter and jelly sandwiches .
For VanEssendelft , it might as well have been arsenic .
Two weeks later , a boy in the back of her class opened up a peanut butter cup .
The smell was enough to trigger VanEssendelft 's peanut allergy and send her to the emergency room with breathing problems .
" My throat felt tight and my lips were getting really swollen , really fast , " said VanEssendelft .
" I looked like Angelina Jolie . "
On the one hand , mean tricks or sneaking candy looks like mild behavioral problems to school administrators .
On the other hand , given VanEssendelft 's serious peanut allergy , those sandwiches might very well have been weapons .
Allergy As Target
Severe bullying and food allergies have emerged as troublesome issues for educators in recent years .
The number of reported food allergies doubled among young children in the last five years , according to researchers at the University of Chicago .
In response , legislators in New York and five other states have passed laws to protect food - allergic kids .
Educators in some East Coast cities have outright banned peanuts in elementary schools .
But even with restrictions in place , schools have to find new ways to control the ever - growing problem of bullies .
Despite recent high profile school shootings , the National School Safety Center reports school violence has actually decreased since 1993 .
But bullying is on the rise .
Between 1999 and 2003 , the NSSC reported an increase of the student population who were bullied across grades 6 - 12 .
As VanEssendelft knows , when bullies target food allergies , kids and schools face a serious problem .
After the peanut butter cup reaction , some of VanEssendelft 's classmates did n't believe that her peanut allergy was triggered by smell .
" They said , 'oh , you just want attention , there 's no way you can be allergic to the smell , this is n't true , ' " said VanEssendelft .
The five girls then held a meeting in the bathroom .
Luckily , VanEssendelft got wind of the secret conference when one girl pulled her out of class to warn her .
" She said , ' You ca n't come to lunch tomorrow ... because they 're going to have a peanut party with everything peanut they can find , to watch your face blow up , ' " VanEssendelft recounted .
Her family reported the plot to administrators who , according to the VanEssendelfts , said , since the girls had never been in trouble before , the school would n't punish them or search their lockers .
The principal of VanEssendelft 's school did not respond to repeated phone calls and messages requesting an interview .
In Children 's Minds
VanEssendelft reports that she grew up with these girls , attended birthday parties and play dates , and had always kept a careful eye out for peanuts .
Yet , still , the girls tried to test her allergy .
" It 's a bizarre concept in general : how can a food hurt you ?
Everyone eats food , " said Dr. Scott Sicherer , associate professor of pediatrics at the Jaffe Food Allergy Institute at Mount Sinai School of Medicine .
Sicherer , who has conducted workshops for teens with food allergies , found most teenagers have been bullied because of their allergy in the past .
VanEssendelft 's 13 - year - old brother , David , also has a peanut allergy and is also frequently bullied .
" Recently , I had a kid in the locker room say , ' I 'm going to put peanut butter on the ball and I 'm going to serve it to you so you have to set it , ' " said David , who added this kid frequently makes peanut butter jokes and wants to see David inject himself with an epinephrine pen to stop a reaction .
" I think a lot of times kids get wrapped up in the experience and they do n't think , " said Susan Swearer , associate professor of school psychology at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln .
" Actually , it 's true they do n't think — they 've done studies , the whole myelination in the brain is not complete . "
The best way to tackle the thinking problem in adolescents , Swearer explained , is to repeat conversations .
" Say it 500 times : someone can die of a peanut allergy . "
Policy , Disability or Both ?
Despite an initial reluctance to punish bullying , the VanEssendelfts report that the school began an intensive peanut watch after Sarah had a reaction that landed her in the hospital for four days .
Sarah 's mother , Lisa , also applied for a 504 plan — a consideration under the Americans with Disabilities Act — to have the school treat her food - allergic children the same way it treats children with other disabilities .
Now , all of Sarah 's classrooms have no-eating policies , she gets a chaperone in charge of her medical issues on field trips , and if she rides a school bus , it must be swept out and cleaned for peanut residue .
" So , now , if kids give Sarah a hard time , it 's considered a discrimination against a disability , " said Lisa .
However , whether or not adults and teachers recognize a " hard time " may be hard to tell .
The NSSC reports 75 percent of children claim to have been bullied at one time or another during school , yet 49 percent of parents did not recognize bullying as a problem .
Teachers may also have a problem recognizing bullying , especially if the bullying is verbal and not physical .
" Schools do a much worse job of consequating verbal bullying , " said Swearer .
" Adults will tell us , ' We 're not sure if the kids are joking around or not . ' "
Yet , verbal abuse , including verbal threats , may be more serious than physical bullying .
" The psychological consequences are the most severe , " said Pamela Cantor , a psychology professor in the department of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School .
Cantor noted that verbal taunts with a peanut allergy are essentially physical threats , as well .
" That 's a physical attack , these kids could die . "
" The Mall Is n't Peanut - Free "
Allergists say there are no studies to quantify the mortality risk of a person with a severe food allergy .
However , " there is a theme for people who have died : [ they 've been ] teenagers and young adults who have asthma , people who know they are allergic , " said Sicherer .
To stop an anaphylaxis reaction ( hives , swelling , vomiting and breathing problems ) someone must inject an epinephrine pen at the first sign and then go to the emergency room .
" What happens is not predictable , " said Dr. Kathy Sheerin , of the Atlanta Allergy and Asthma Clinic .
" You can have a near - death experience , and the next time , it may not be as bad — but , if you 're standing there thinking of using it [ epinephrine pen ] , you probably should have used it already . "
It might be tempting for schools to do away with peanuts altogether , but Sheerin , who is also a mother of a child with a tree nut allergy , has different ideas .
" I think it 's great that day cares and up to kindergarten are peanut - free , " said Sheerin .
" But the mall is n't peanut - free , the movies are n't peanut - free , your next door neighbor 's house is n't peanut - free .
The kids are going to have to learn to deal with it . "
Most kids , in fact , want other kids to learn to deal with it , as well .
Sicherer recently gave a survey to about 70 teens , asking what they wished for most in school .
The vast majority of teens wanted their peers — not adults — to be educated about food allergies .
" Whenever we talk about kids with food allergies in schools , their friends are a huge influence and can keep them safe , " said Anne Munoz - Furlong , founder and CEO of the Food Allergy and Anaphylactic Network .
" We have very often had teenagers tell us that their friends are their body guards , their friends are their eyes and ears . "

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Despite all the hype for electric cars and hydrogen fuel cells , experts say we 'd better get used to pumping gas , but we can look forward to much better fuel economy down the road .
" For the foreseeable future , the gasoline engine will stay the predominant power source , " said Uwe Grebe , General Motors ' executive director for advanced powertrain engineering .
That 's because , despite its imperfections , the internal combustion engine has a lot of inherent advantages but plenty of room for improvement .
As those improvements are made , future gasoline engines will be more and more fuel efficient , making it tougher for competing technologies to show a big benefit .
Another reason is the fuel itself .
Whether we 're talking about diesel fuel or gasoline , it 's hard to beat hydrocarbons for delivering energy in a potent , easy - to - handle package .
Small non -hybrid gasoline engine cars already get more than 35 miles per gallon on the highway .
But only about 15 percent of the energy in gasoline actually makes its way to the wheels , said Fedewa .
That leaves plenty of upside potential , he said .
Gas / electric hybrid technology is a major step in boosting efficiency , but it 's complex and expensive .
Smaller changes are also squeezing out more of internal combustion 's wasted power at lower cost .
Engineers are working on some of the subtler aspects of the engine 's inner workings :
The timing and spacing of the opening of valves , when and how fuel is injected into the cylinders and when the spark goes off are just some of the things that can be tweaked to extract more motive power from gasoline .
Combining all of these technologies , several car companies are working on something called " homogenous charged compression ignition " - HCCI for short - that allows gasoline engines to mimic the behavior of diesel engines .
In an HCCI engine , gasoline is ignited inside the cylinder using compression and the engine 's own heat without the need of a spark .
( Spark plugs are still used when the engine is cold . )
While there are differences in how the engines work , this is essentially the same way that a diesel engine ignites diesel fuel .
Diesel - powered cars go up to 35 % farther on a gallon of fuel than similar gasoline - powered cars .
The downside of diesels is that they create more pollution , and the exhaust - cleaning technology needed to deal with that pollution is expensive .
That 's why HCCI engines seem like an attractive option , provided engineers can get all the bugs worked out .
HCCI engines still wo n't go as far on a gallon as diesel engines , in part because diesel fuel puts out more energy , but they should get about 15 percent better fuel economy than current gasoline engines , said Grebe .
Electrifying technology
Another process that 's already well underway is the " electrification " of more systems within the car .
In most cars now on the road , power steering and brakes get a boost from hydraulic pumps or vacuums powered directly by the car 's engine .
Air - conditioning compressors are also powered directly by the engine .
Many new cars now use electrically - assisted power steering and power brakes as well as electrically operated air conditioning compressors .
These sorts of systems are an absolute necessity in gas / electric hybrid cars .
Without them , the power steering and brakes as well as the air conditioning would stop working whenever the engine stopped .
Electrification of these accessories could add up to 10 % to a vehicle 's fuel economy said Nick Cappa , an advanced technology spokesman for Chrysler .
The final big step in the electrification of the car will be to remove the gasoline engine from the job of moving the car 's wheels .
That 's the benefit of a so - called range - extended electric vehicle like GM ( GM , Fortune 500 ) 's planed Chevrolet Volt .
While the Volt will get enough power to drive 40 miles or so just by plugging into a socket for a few hours , for longer trips extra power would come from a small gasoline engine .
The engine would produce electricity that would be stored in a battery to drive the car .
Freeing the engine from directly driving the car has another big benefit .
With the engine no longer connected to the wheels , it becomes easier to install entirely different powerplants in what is otherwise the same vehicle .
Hydrogen alternative
That could make vehicles like these the next step to hydrogen fuel cell cars .
Both Ford ( F , Fortune 500 ) and GM have created range - extended plug - in vehicles with hydrogen fuel cells to generate additional power instead of internal combustion engines .
Hydrogen fuel cells combine hydrogen with oxygen to create water while giving off energy .
The hydrogen fuel cell itself is nearing commercial viability , said GM 's Grebe .
The problem now is that there is n't much " hydrogen infrastructure " yet .
In other words , if you were given a hydrogen fuel cell car today , finding a place to fuel it would be tough .
But talk of pumping hydrogen gas into electric cars brings to mind one of gasoline 's big advantages .
The reason range - extended electric vehicles need their ranges extended in the first place has to do with " energy density . "
That 's the amount of energy stored in a given amount of space within the vehicle , including both the fuel and whatever it 's kept in .
The low energy density of batteries is what limits the range of electric vehicles .
A battery big enough to take a long trip could be as big as the car itself .
Compressed hydrogen , including the thick - walled tank needed to store it , is better than a battery .
But it 's still not nearly as good as a simple plastic bladder filled with gasoline .
If you want to go somewhere far away , there 's still nothing better than gas .
At least not for now .

Crazy Rich Californians !
It 's a good thing all you " expensive gas is awesome " nutters live in climates where you do n't have to worry about snow and icy roads .
Because in places where water freezes and snow falls , vehicles which were built to handle more than dry roads on sunny days come in quite handy .
( Even if just in extracting from ditches people who think 4 - wheel drive makes them invincible . )
But then , I wish they 'd stop plowing / salting roads around here and say " Hey , we have winter here .
Buy a vehicle which can handle that . " .
Of course , I also wish driver 's ed taught people how to drive on icy roads -- and they do n't do that , either .

June 19 , 2008  -- Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , now under investigation for allegedly politicizing the Justice Department , ousted a top lawyer for failing to adopt the administration 's position on torture and then promised him a position as a U.S. attorney to placate him , highly placed sources tell ABC News .
Gonzales , who was just taking over as attorney general , asked Justice Department lawyer Daniel Levin to leave in early 2005 , shortly after Levin wrote a legal opinion that declared " torture is abhorrent " and limited the administration 's use of harsh interrogation techniques .
At the time , Levin was in the middle of drafting a second , critical memo that analyzed the legality of specific interrogation techniques , like waterboarding .
Gonzales , however , was concerned about how it would be perceived if Levin were ousted immediately after issuing the opinion — and just before he finished another — so he offered Levin a less significant job outside the Department of Justice at the National Security Council , sources tell ABC News .
Gonzales then assured Levin he would , at some point , recommend him for a plum job as the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles , sources tell ABC .
A spokesman for Gonzales , Robert Bork Jr. , called it " simply untrue " that Levin was fired for his work on the torture opinion .
" Judge Gonzales denies the contention that Mr. Levin was ' placated ' with an offer of the U.S. attorneys slot in Los Angeles , " Bork said , adding that Gonzales considered him " extremely well qualified for such a role " and that Levin had expressed an interest in it .
Bork said Levin was appointed to his Justice Department job in a " temporary " capacity for " a short period of time " and was offered a " critical legal position " in the NSC after a " permanent nominee " at Justice was identified .
Bork said Gonzales " has the greatest respect " for Levin .
Levin took the NSC job in March 2005 .
The U.S. attorney position never materialized , and sources close to Levin say he never believed Gonzales was serious .
He went on to take a job in private practice .
Testifying before Congress Wednesday , Levin , who had been the Department of Justice 's acting head of the Office of Legal Counsel , said he had hoped to remain in the post after writing the torture memo .
" You were asked to go because you were at odds with administration 's policies , " said Rep. Artur Davis , an Alabama Democrat .
" I think there is a pattern here .
A lot of the people who got it right have been asked to leave by this administration . "
Levin acknowledged in the hearing that he was asked to leave after he wrote the December 2004 memo on torture .
He refused to speculate on why Gonzales asked him to leave the Office of Legal Counsel , which issues legal opinions and provides guidance to the White House .
" I would have preferred to have stayed , " he said .
The allegation that Gonzales dangled a U.S. attorney 's job in front of a top official he was ousting connects two investigations that have monopolized the Justice Department in recent years .
Just a few weeks before Levin was asked to leave , White House Advisor Karl Rove and Gonzales were involved in discussions over the dismissals of several U.S. attorneys .
Nine were dismissed the following year , and the matter erupted into a scandal , with critics alleging the administration saw the US attorney posts as patronage positions .
Congress held hearings to explore whether the attorneys had been dismissed for improper political considerations , and the matter now is under investigation by the inspector general of the Department of Justice .
Although Gonzales denied ever asking for resignations for " partisan political gain , " he and several top officials at the Department of Justice ultimately resigned in the wake of the controversy .
Months later , after Levin left DOJ and took the NSC job , Gonzales ' chief of staff wrote a memo that included Levin 's name as a possible replacement for the U.S. attorney position in San Francisco , not Los Angeles .
But sources say Levin would never have been a serious contender for that office because of earlier work he had done there .
He worked in the office in 1999 , as counselor to then - U.S. Atty .
Robert Mueller , during an extensive and highly contentious effort to reshape it .
Levin could not be reached for comment .
Late Wednesday , one former senior official says Levin was forced out at DOJ , in part , because the administration believed his torture opinion was too critical .
Levin had criticized an earlier Justice Department opinion on interrogation techniques written by former Office of Legal Counsel Deputy John Yoo .
That controversial memo narrowly defined torture as only techniques that result in " death , organ failure or the permanent impairment of a significant body function . "
In June 2004 , the Justice Department 's Jack Goldsmith withdrew Yoo 's opinion , finding it flawed and poorly reasoned .
When Goldsmith resigned , Levin was tasked to write a new memo on torture policy to replace Yoo 's original one .
A former administration official said Levin pulled no punches in his memo — even referencing liberal scholar Anthony Lewis , a harsh administration critic , in a footnote .
Yet , within weeks of releasing it — and while drafting a second , major memo that analyzed whether specific techniques like waterboarding were legal — Levin was asked by Gonzales to leave the Justice Department .
Sources say the administration believed Levin could not be counted on to " come out the right way " on interrogation issues , as well as another controversial anti-terrorism program involving warrantless wiretapping .
Levin , a graduate of Harvard University and the University of Chicago Law School , was seen by some in the administration as too independent , sources said .
For example , while analyzing specific interrogation techniques , he went to a military base outside Washington and personally underwent waterboarding , which he concluded qualified as torture , unless done in a narrow way with close supervision .
Levin refused to discuss the waterboarding experience in his congressional testimony Wednesday .
Levin was replaced at DOJ by Stephen Bradbury , who remains today as " acting " head of the Office of Legal Counsel because the Senate has refused to confirm his nomination .
Bradbury ultimately wrote the second memo on specific interrogation techniques that Levin had been working on before his ouster .
Former administration officials say Levin 's ouster was not an isolated one .
Months after Levin was let go , Patrick Philbin , a former top Justice Department lawyer , also was blocked from promotion within DOJ former senior administration officials say .
Philbin , too , had sided with moderates in the Department and took issue with some of the legal reasoning used to authorize interrogations and warrantless wiretapping .
Ironically , it was Philbin who was the first to alert Goldsmith of possible problems in several legal opinions written in the years after Sept. 11th .
Although a solid conservative on national security issues , Philbin , like Levin , was aligned with the more moderate Deputy Atty .
General James Comey .
Philbin was at Comey 's side during the infamous hospital visit in March 2004 , when then - White House Counsel Gonzales and Chief of Staff Andy Card rushed to the hospital room of a gravely ill Attorney General John Ashcroft to persuade him to reauthorize the wiretapping program after Comey refused .
In Senate testimony last year , Comey was asked what person he was referring to when he said , in a farewell address to DOJ , that some people " did pay a price " for their commitment to " getting it right and doing the right thing , whatever the price . "
" I had in mind one particular senior staff of mine who 's been in the hospital room with me and had been blocked from promotion , I believed , as a result of this particular matter , " Comey said , under questioning from Sen.
Russell Feingold , the Wisconsin Democrat .
" It 's Mr. Philbin . "
Less than a year after the hospital visit — in early 2005 , as Levin was getting shown the door … Paul Clement was nominated solicitor general and sought to make Philbin his principal deputy .
The two had gone to Harvard Law School together , clerked for conservative icon Judge Laurence Silberman and gone on to clerk at the Supreme Court , Clement for Justice Antonin Scalia and Philbin for Justice Clarence Thomas .
But David Addington , Vice President Cheney 's top legal adviser , furiously objected to the promotion , sources said .
Gonzales refused to go against the White House , sources said , and Philbin was denied the post .
The job ultimately went to Gregory Garre , a lawyer in private practice who had clerked for the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist .
Philbin , like Levin , is now in private practice in Washington .
So first of all , I apologize for posting this on this crappy - ass blog I just made .
But this really would n’t work as a reddit comment , and this was the easiest way for me to throw something like this up .
Recently , I ’d noticed that stories on reddit were behaving differently than I remembered them doing so in the past .
There were less net votes for stories , and more downvotes for stories .
So I went back to 3 months ago , to see if my memory was accurate , or I was just being an idiot .
Here is the latest 25 number one stories on reddit ..
As you can obviously see , no stories have more than 400 net votes .
Compare this to 3 months ago where you can see that , in fact , no story has less than 400 net votes .
If you go into a little more detail comparing the stories now versus then , it also appears that stories had less total downvotes back then , than they did now .
Now , I used to do a lot of fooling around and experimenting , to get a sense of how reddit worked .
At around the time that I first noticed that stories had less total votes and such , two major changes had been made to the way reddit worked .
One , the algorithm for how stories got onto the front page , and how long they stayed on the front page was changed .
Two , a new protective feature was implemented to cancel out people running scripts , or acting like bots .
You see , this was around the time where people were complaining incessantly about “ vote - up ” posts – all that fun stuff .
People had started even started writing greasemonkey scripts to automatically downvote every post by certain users , or with certain words in their headlines .
Now this was obviously unfair , and counter to what reddit stood for ( and in fact , potentially destructive to the nature of reddit itself ) .
So ( I ’m assuming ) in response to this , any account that was acting ‘ suspiciously ’ had it ’s votes instantaneously cancelled out .
If you voted a story up , a downvote would automatically appear at the same time , and vice versa .
This feature is still in effect today on reddit , to the best of my knowledge .
With this in mind , I hypothesized that the reason why stories were getting less net votes , and more total downvotes , was due to a combination of these factors .
But first , I had to test whether there was actually a statistically significant difference between then and now .
So I did some good old fashioned t- testing .
I took the total number of upvotes , downvotes , net votes , and total votes from the 25 sequential most recent number one stories , and 25 sequential number one stories from about 2.5 months ago ( almost 3 months ) .
I then calculated the average , and standard deviations for each one of these categories .
Using these values I performed either a simple T - test , or a Welch ’s T - test , where appropriate , to compare the averages , and see if there was a statistically significant difference .
This is my raw data ( recent data on the left , older data on the right ) :
The results were ( with an alpha value of 5 % ) :
Probability of 0 % ( p=0.00 ) that the observed decrease in average upvotes was due to chance .
( significant , as 0 0.05 )
Probability of 1.29 % ( p=0.0129 ) that the observed increase in average downvotes was due to chance .
( significant )
Probability of 0 % ( p=0.00 ) that the observed decrease in average net votes was due to chance .
( significant )
Probability of 9.02 % ( p=0.0902 ) that the observed decrease in average total votes was due to chance .
( not significant , as 0.0902 > 0.05 )
This disproves the hypothesis that the observed change was due to votes being cancelled out , as it would be predicted that there would be an increase in the number of total votes ( as now , people would be getting two votes , one up , one down ) .
The observed numbers showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the net number of votes for stories .
I ’m not sure if this proves or disproves the hypothesis that the change is due to the change in the front page algorithm , as it ’s impossible to predict what the results of that change would be .
It ’s possible that this is the reason why , but for some reason , I do n’t think so .
Or at least I do n’t think that explains all of it .
If you look at the numbers , you ’ll see that the major difference is that relative to a couple of months ago , there is a significant decrease in upvotes , and a significant increase in downvotes .
The question is still up in the air then – why did this happen , and why did it happen so suddenly ?
Yahoo's shares are expected to fall when markets open on Monday Software giant Microsoft has dropped its three - month - old bid to buy internet firm Yahoo because the two sides cannot agree on an acceptable sale price .
Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer formally withdrew the offer in a letter to Yahoo chief executive Jerry Yang .
Mr Ballmer said Microsoft had raised its original offer from $ 44.6 bn to $ 47.5 bn ( £ 24.1 bn ) - $ 33 per share .
But he added that Yahoo had insisted on at least $ 53bn , or $ 37 a share - more than Microsoft was prepared to pay .
The software giant had wanted to do a deal to be able to compete with Google , which dominates the lucrative market for internet advertising .
Microsoft 's new leadership will have to prove it can deliver a web offering that can ultimately substitute the profits generated by cash cows Windows and Office
Tim Weber , Business editor , BBC News website
Analysis : Microsoft with Yahoo dot. life blog Q&A : End of Microsoft 's bid
This market was worth $ 40bn in 2007 and is predicted to double to $ 80bn by 2010 .
' Distraction '
In his letter to Mr Yang , which has been posted on the Microsoft website , Mr Ballmer said : " We continue to believe that our proposed acquisition made sense for Microsoft , Yahoo and the market as a whole .
" Despite our best efforts , including raising our bid by roughly $ 5bn , Yahoo has not moved toward accepting our offer .
" After careful consideration , we believe the economics demanded by Yahoo do not make sense for us , and it is in the best interests of Microsoft stockholders , employees and other stakeholders to withdraw our proposal . "
Mr Ballmer also told Yahoo's boss that he would not pursue his original plan B of launching a hostile takeover battle , because Mr Yang would " take steps that would make Yahoo undesirable as an acquisition for Microsoft " .
Mr Ballmer told his own employees that Microsoft could achieve its goals without Yahoo , albeit at a slower pace .
Yahoo maintained that Microsoft had offered too little to buy the company .
In a statement issued after Microsoft 's withdrawal , Yahoo chairman Roy Bostock dismissed the unsolicited bid as a " distraction " .
Microsoft 's shares closed on Friday virtually unchanged at $ 29.24 .
Yahoo's shares were $ 1.85 higher at $ 28.67 amid expectations of a higher Microsoft offer .
The BBC's Peter Bowes says analysts believe the breakdown in talks may have an adverse affect on Yahoo shares and generate uncertainty among investors about the company 's management .
Disappointment Sir Martin Sorrell , the chief executive of advertising group WPP , said his clients would be disappointed that Microsoft had abandoned its bid for Yahoo .
" A combination of Microsoft and Yahoo would have provided balance to the online advertising market place , " he told the BBC News website .
However , he said that Microsoft was a " resourceful and innovative company " and might still be able to provide a challenge to Google 's market dominance .

What are these ?
In Korea they call them halmoni or grandmothers – although many are so scarred mentally and physically that they have never married or had children .
In Japan , they are known as " comfort women " , a hated euphemism for their forced role of providing " comfort " to marauding Japanese troops in military brothels .
But around the world , another , altogether starker term will follow them to their graves : sex slaves .
Kang il - chul is one of a handful of the surviving women living their final days in the Sharing House , a museum and communal refuge two hours from the South Korean capital , Seoul .
It is a stark , concrete building in a sparsely populated area of rice fields and scraggly mountain forests .
But she says she has found some peace here .
" I am among my friends , who treat me well , " she says .
At the age of 15 , she says she was taken and sent to a Japanese base in Manchuria .
On her second night , before her first menstru-ation , she was raped .
Soldiers lined up night after night to abuse her .
She has scars below her neck from cigarette burns and says she suffers headaches from a beating she took at the hands of a Japanese officer .
" I still have blood tears in my soul when I think about what happened , " she says .

Like many of the women , she finds it traumatic to recall the past , crying and knotting a handkerchief , and swaying as she talks .
But she gets angry and slaps the table in front of her when the former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe is mentioned .
" That horrible man , " she spits .
" He wants us to die . "
Last year , Mr Abe stunned the Sharing House by claiming there is " no evidence " to prove the women were coerced , reversing Japan 's position .
Amid a political storm and pressure from Japan 's US allies , he backtracked in a series of carefully worded statements that took the heat out of the controversy .
But the denial " terrified " Kang .
" I felt that my heart had been turned inside out , " she says .
" The women 's greatest fear is that when they die , the crimes against them will be forgotten , " said Ahn Sin Kweon , director of the Sharing House .
Thousands of Asian women – some as young as 12 – were " enslaved ... and repeatedly raped , tortured and brutalised for months and years " , according to Amnesty International .
Sexual abuse , beatings and forced abortions left many unable to bear children .
Most survivors stayed silent until a small group of Korean victims spoke out in the early 1990s .
Among the first was Kim Hak - soon , who was raped and treated , in her words , " like a public toilet " .
" We must record these things that were forced upon us , " she said before she died .
The call was taken up by about 50 women , recalls Ahn Sin Kweon .
" Many were n't married or were living alone in small towns , barely able to scrape a living . "
A Buddhist organisation helped construct Sharing House on donated land in the 1990s .
" They were initially reluctant because the more they were out in the spotlight , the more people knew that they were raped .
It is very difficult for women of that generation to discuss sexual matters openly , let alone these experiences . "
Japan officially acknowledged wartime military slavery in a landmark 1993 statement , followed by the offer of compensation from a small private fund , which expired last year .
But the so - called Kono statement has long baited Japanese revisionists , who deny the military was directly involved .
" The women were legal prostitutes , earning money for their families , " claims the revisionist academic Nobukatsu Fujioka .

Although Mr Abe is gone , replaced by Yasuo Fukuda , Kang il - chul and her fellow victims fear it is only a matter of time before the denials return , perhaps with the next Japanese prime minister .
The struggle defines the final years of their lives : if they lose , they will in effect be branded prostitutes .
When her health allows , the 82 - year - old drags herself to a weekly demonstration outside the Japanese embassy in Seoul .
The former sex slaves have been coming here since the early 1990s and marked their 800th consecutive demonstration in February .
Their demands , including the punishment of those who raped them , an apology from the emperor and the building of a memorial in Japan , are angrily hurled against the walls , but are unlikely to be won .
The Wednesday protest , as it is known , has become ritualised and tinged with sadness as the already small group of survivors is reduced by illness and mortality .
Of 15 former residents of Sharing House , just seven remain , most in poor health .
But the women are heartened by small victories .
Last year , the US congress passed Resolution 121 , calling on Tokyo to " formally apologise and accept historical responsibility " for the comfort women issue .
Kang il - chul was one of the women who travelled to Washington to testify .
The resolution , sponsored by the Japanese - American politician Mike Honda , was fought hard by Tokyo .
An editorial in Japan 's largest newspaper , Yomiuri , said there was not " one shred of evidence to substantiate " the claim that the Japanese government systematically coerced and recruited the women .
Today , a large banner showing a beaming Honda is draped across the main courtyard of the commune .
A copy of Resolution 121 , signed by Honda and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi hangs in Ahn Sin Kweon 's office .
" The resolution was very important for us because our priority is to keep the memory of the women alive , " he says , recalling Honda 's reception when he visited here last November .
" He was treated like a hero . "
Surprisingly , perhaps , Mr Ahn reserves much anger for his own government .
Like many activists , he believes Seoul bartered away any compensation claims when it signed a friendship treaty with Japan in 1965 , in return for millions of dollars in soft loans and grants .
He says it is also up to the Japanese people to criticise their government .
Every year , he says , about 5,000 Japanese travel to his office .
Their encounter with the former sex slaves is often wrenching and tearful .
Some stay as volunteers to work at the centre .
But Kang il - chul is deeply suspicious of Japanese journalists .
" They want to show us weak and dying , " she cries , again slapping the table in anger .
" Especially the camera crews .
They follow the oldest , sickest women around . "
Later , she stops me taking pictures of a frail woman blankly watching television .
" You must show us strong , " she demands and we take pictures of her posing , like a boxer , beside a monument to the sex slaves .
She recalls the day she was taken .
" The soldiers had a list with my name on it .
They put me in a truck .
My nephew came out to look at them .
He was just a baby .
The soldiers kicked him and he died . "
Memories like that make her strong , she says .
" Future generations will call us prostitutes .
Either they [ the Japanese government ] save their faces , or we save ours . "
NEW YORK , April 8 ( Reuters ) - U.S. retail gasoline demand sank to its lowest level since April 2005 as the average retail price of the motor fuel jumped to a new high , MasterCard Advisors said Tuesday .
Motorists pumped an average of 9.043 million barrels per day in the week ended April 7 .
That was 2.5 percent lower than demand in the previous week and 6.8 percent below year - ago levels , according to MasterCard ’s weekly SpendingPulse report .
“ Part of this year - on - year decline was in fact due to pre-holiday pumping in 2007 , ” said Michael McNamara , vice president of MasterCard Advisors .
Easter fell on April 8 in 2007 , a few weeks later than it did in 2008 .
“ But the other half of the story was a lack of the typical seasonal lift in pumping in 2008 .
This is unusual for the month of April where we typically see seasonal increases in week - to - week demand , ” McNamara said .
The national average price of gasoline climbed 3 cents to $ 3.30 per gallon , up about 22 percent from the same time last year and the highest recorded by the MasterCard report .
The 4 - week average U.S. gasoline consumption rate dropped 1.2 percent to 9.201 million bpd , according to the report .
Meanwhile , a Reuters poll of energy analysts called for domestic gasoline stocks to have fallen for the fourth week in a row when the U.S. Energy Information Administration releases its report on nationwide fuel inventories on Wednesday .
Analysts said economic run cuts , planned maintenance and unplanned outages have cut into gasoline stocks by keeping refinery utilization rates from increasing .
On average they forecast a drop of 2.5 million barrels .
MasterCard Advisors estimates retail gasoline demand based on aggregate sales activity in the MasterCard payments system coupled with estimates for all other payment forms .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - People across China have opened their wallets to give earthquake aid -- and fraudsters have swung into action to capitalise on the burst of generosity .

Police issued a warning after a flurry of text messages hit mobile phones , soliciting disaster assistance in emotional appeals , only asking that funds be deposited in private accounts .
“ My family was in the earthquake .
Dad and mum urgently need money .
Send whatever money you can .
Deposit it in our friend ’s account , ” read one text in the southern province of Guangdong proven to be fake by local reporters .
Chinese web chat rooms , which have been full of sympathy and grief for the quake ’s victims , exploded in fury .
“ Anyone who steals this kind of money will be cursed , ” said one person on sohu.com , a popular web portal .
Another wrote : “ I ’m truly speechless .
Why must there always be bad guys among our people ? ”
Many of the comments were more aggressive , wishing the swindlers meet violent ends .

The “ black - hearted text messages ” , to use the Shenzhen Economic Daily ’s phrase , stand in rare contrast to the outpouring of goodwill in China after the quake that may have killed as many as 50,000 people .
Domestic donations in both cash and goods to the quake - stricken areas reached 1.3 billion yuan ( $ 186 million ) by Thursday , the Ministry of Civil Affairs announced .
The generosity is all the more striking for a country without a long tradition of philanthropy and whose citizens are themselves often only a generation removed from poverty .
People have thronged clinics to give blood for victims , with some turned away after queues grew too long .
And the Chinese Red Cross Foundation had to suspend its normal website ( www.crcf.org.cn) after it was flooded by visitors looking for ways to help .
In its place was a single page of text , listing the bank account details for an earthquake relief fund .
“ Donors should go through our official website , ” a Red Cross spokeswoman said .
“ Do n’t trust random messages or emails . ”
Charitable fraud is not unheard of in China .
On Thursday , the Beijing Times reported the Chinese Care for Growth Society had been repudiated by 10 government ministries , which it claimed as backers .
Most of its purportedly charitable activities were commercial in nature , the newspaper said .
And disasters have proved fertile ground for con artists around the world .
Nearly three years after Hurricane Katrina devastated the U.S. Gulf Coast , authorities there were still sifting through a pile of fraud cases in which people allegedly bilked the government out of $ 500 million in disaster aid .

It died yesterday , apparently of natural causes .
I called Fish & Game to come and get it .
Apparently , moose are a natural resource and belong to everybody , until they die , then they belong to whoevers property they die on .
So , according to Fish & Game , the moose now belongs to me .
Sweet !!
So , if you want a free moose , please come and get it before the bears do .
You could use it for dog food , or stuff it and put it your front yard , bear bait , whatever .
If you live in the lower 48 , this might be your best opportunity to get a free Alaska moose .
I dont really care , I just want it out of my yard .
Please reply via email , I dont need all the animal rights folks calling me , its dead , and according to Fish & Game , its got no more rights ...

Posted on April 1 , 2008 , Jon Soucy Xbox Moron Covered on Fox News
Ah , this story just gets more and more hilarious .
Odds are you ’ve heard the tale of the Xbox burglar who was dealt a solid hand of internet justice after the console ’s rightful owner , Jesse McPherson , posted the culprit ’s Xbox Live Gamertag online .
The ensuing harassment from the internet community eventually prompted the kid to return the ill - gotten system .
If you have n’t heard the story yet , well then Philadelphia ’s local Fox News recently ran a segment on it , which you can view above .
For some reason , it always warms my heart a little when tales of the internet community putting their collective efforts to good use are picked up by the mainstream media .
Also it ’s kind of funny to hear a TV news reporter refer to the kid as a “ wise ass . ”

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
As the first splinters of sunlight spread their warmth on the south bank of the River Thames on Thursday , it became clear that after more than a century , the vision of Victorian engineer Alexander Stanhope St. George had finally been realized .
The Telectroscope lets Londoners and New Yorkers see each other in real time .
In all its optical brilliance and brass and wood , there stood the Telectroscope : an 11.2 - meter - ( 37 feet ) long by 3.3 - meter - ( 11 feet ) tall dream of a device allowing people on one side of the Atlantic to look into its person - size lens and , in real time , see those on the other side via a recently completed tunnel running under the ocean .
( Think 19th - century Webcam .
Or maybe Victorian - age video phone . )
And all the credit goes to British artist Paul St. George .
If he had not been rummaging through great - grandpa Alexander 's personal effects a few years ago , the Telectroscope might still exist only on paper , hidden away deep inside some old box .
But fortunately , St. George could not bear that thought and thus decided he should be the one to finish what his great - grandfather had started .
It was quite simply the right thing to do .
Plus , it would make a pretty cool public art exhibit .
Send us your videos , images or stories
During the twilight hours Tuesday , massive dirt - covered metal drill bits miraculously emerged -- one by the Thames near the Tower Bridge and the other on Fulton Ferry Landing by the Brooklyn Bridge in New York -- completing the final sections of great - grandfather Alexander 's transatlantic tunnel .
The drills were removed Wednesday night and replaced with identical Telectroscopes at both ends , allowing Londoners and New Yorkers to wake up Thursday , look over to the far and distant shore and stare at each other for a while ( the telescope - like contraption permits visual but not vocal communication ) .
Of course , only part of this story is true .
St. George is an artist in Britain who does have a grandfather -- minus the great prefix -- named Alexander .
And the trans -Atlantic tunnel is really a trans -Atlantic broadband network rounded off on each end with HD cameras , according to Tiscali , an Italian Internet provider handling the technical side of the project .
As for the Telectroscope , well , it was a fanciful idea that , according to St. George , came about from a typo made by a 19th - century reporter who misspelled Electroscope , a device used to measure electrostatic charges - as Telectroscope .
" The journalist also misunderstood what it was about and wrote in the article that it was a device for the suppression of absence , " St. George said .
" The accidental hope captured their imagination , and lots of people at the end of the 19th century thought it was a great idea . "
The Telectroscope captured St. George 's imagination five years ago , when he began pondering how to do a project on the childhood fantasy of digging a hole to the opposite side of the Earth .
And because the artist also happens to have an expertise in Victorian chronophotography -- a precursor to cinematography -- he had a slight idea of where to look for the proper equipment .
" We all have that idea in our head if we could make a tunnel to the other side of the Earth , " St. George said .
" But we are not all crazy enough to actually try and do it . "
St. George was crazy enough to actually try and do it , but he realized he could not do the digging alone .
So about two years ago , he pitched the idea to Artichoke , the British arts group responsible for taking the Sultan 's Elephant -- a 42 - ton mechanical creature -- for a stroll through central London in 2006 .
The company was immediately taken by St. George 's idea .
" The whole thing is about seeing what is real and what is n't real and how the world is , " said Nicki Webb , a co-founder of Artichoke .
" Is it nighttime when we are in daytime , and does it look familiar to us or not ? "
When the sun illuminated the lens of the Telectroscope next to the Thames , it was , of course , still nighttime in New York .
So the screen inside the scope broadcast back only an empty sidewalk silently framed by the Brooklyn Bridge and the Manhattan skyline .
But then something miraculous occurred .
A police officer and a street cleaner walked into the frame .
Stopped .
And waved .
The Telectroscope will be on display and open to the public 24 hours a day in London and New York until June 15 .
Artichoke is arranging requests to synchronize special reunions between friends and family or , the company hopes , maybe even a marriage proposal .
JAKARTA ( Reuters ) - Hackers have defaced the Web site of Indonesia ’s information ministry in response to a government move to restrict access to pornographic material on the Internet , an official said on Friday .
A screen grab of http://www.depkominfo.go.id.
REUTERS/www.depkominfo.go.id
Indonesia ’s parliament on Tuesday passed a new information bill that criminalises the transmission of pornographic material on the Web .
The Southeast Asian country has had a vigorous debate over pornography in recent years , exposing deep divisions in the Muslim - majority nation .
Hackers on Thursday posted a message on the information ministry 's Web site ( www.depkominfo.go.id) saying : " Prove that the law has not been made to cover government stupidity . "
The message was accompanied by a mocked - up photograph of a local information technology expert , who has been advising the government on the new law , depicted with a bare chest .
Screenshots of the hacked page were posted on the Detik.com news Web site and a cyber chat forum .
The message had been removed and the Web site was now running normally , said Gatot Broto , an official at the ministry .
The ministry said the law was a response to concerns in society about the negative impact of pornographic and violent sites as more Indonesians gain access to the Internet .
Under the law , anyone found guilty of transmitting pornographic material , false news or racial and religious hate messages on the Internet could face up to six years in prison or a fine of 1 billion rupiah ( $ 109,000 ) .
Indonesia ’s parliament has yet to pass a controversial pornography bill , which aims to shield the young from pornographic material and lewd acts .
Earlier draft versions contained provisions that could jail people for kissing in public and criminalize many forms of art or traditional culture that hinge on sensuality , sparking criticism it could curb freedoms and hurt Indonesia ’s tolerant tradition .
Blind spots are the stuff of ever - rising insurance premiums .
So Ford is bringing out two technologies that will help drivers see what they can't see .
Both technologies will become standard equipment on certain models beginning in 2009 , though Ford has not announced which cars will get them .
The Blind Spot Mirror ( pictured here ) features a secondary convex spotter in the top out corner , which is aimed exclusively at the driver 's blind spot .
Unlike similar after - market products , it uses a single glass surface .
The cross-traffic alert system with blind - spot monitoring uses radar to detect objects in a blind spot as a driver backs out of parking spaces –where vision can be blocked by other parked cars .
The system has two multiple - beam radar modules in the rear quarter panels .
When a vehicle enters the blind spot , an indicator alerts the driver .

About Us
One of the greatest speeches by Martin Luther King , Jr. , " A Time to Break Silence , " was delivered at Riverside Church , New York City , on April 4 , 1967 .
It is a statement against war in principle , in the same sense in which King ’s " Letter from Birmingham City Jail , " published four years earlier , had been a statement against social injustice in principle .
Yet like that extraordinary earlier appeal , " A Time to Break Silence " is also addressed to the evils of a particular time and place .
It protests the command and deployment by Lyndon Johnson of almost unlimited violence against the people and the land of Vietnam for the declared purpose of protecting them from the menace of world communism .
King began by acknowledging his solidarity with the organizers of Clergy and Laymen Concerned about Vietnam ; and he pledged himself in full accord with their recent statement : " A time comes when silence is betrayal . "
In Vietnam , says King , " that time has come for us . "
Yet to support concrete acts of nonviolent protest or non-cooperation remains a difficult choice .
" Even when pressed by the demands of inner truth , men do not easily assume the task of opposing their government ’s policy , especially in time of war .
Nor does the human spirit move without great difficulty against all the apathy of conformist thought within one ’s own bosom and in the surrounding world . "
The trouble is all the greater in a case like this , where evil is on both sides but where America ’s violence has greatly exceeded that of the enemy , since American resources for violence through the use of air power are so much greater .
In such a situation , says King , " we are always on the verge of being mesmerized by uncertainty ; but we must move on . "
This speech was King ’s public announcement of his opposition to the war .
Moral protest , which said " The war is wrong , " was still , as it would remain , very much a minority position .
Even the tactical objection that said , " The war can not be won , " was still a marginal view , though now steadily gaining adherents .
King knew that his uncompromising dissent would draw bitter attacks .
Members of the black community would charge that by his new commitment he was diluting the single - minded pursuit of civil rights for which he was known to stand .
" Some of us , " he confesses , " who have already begun to break the silence of the night have found that the calling to speak is often a vocation of agony , but we must speak . "
Here King arrives at the heart of his subject :
" Over the past two years , as I have moved to break the betrayal of my own silences and to speak from the burnings of my own heart , as I have called for radical departures from the destruction of Vietnam , many persons have questioned me about the wisdom of my path .
At the heart of their concerns this query has often loomed large and loud : ‘ Why are you speaking about the war , Dr. King ? ’
‘ Why are you joining the voices of dissent ? ’
‘ Peace and civil rights do n’t mix , ’ they say .
‘ Are n’t you hurting the cause of your people , ’ they ask ?
And when I hear them , though I often understand the source of their concern , I am nevertheless greatly saddened , for such questions mean that the inquirers have not really known me , my commitment or my calling .
Indeed , their questions suggest that they do not know the world in which they live .
In the light of such tragic misunderstanding , I deem it of signal importance to try to state clearly , and I trust concisely , why I believe that the path from Dexter Avenue Baptist Church  the church in Montgomery , Alabama , where I began my pastorate  leads clearly to this sanctuary tonight . "
His aim is to unite the protest against civil injustices with the protest against a policy of violence and domination abroad .
You may ( King seems to have thought )  you may , in some imagined logical universe , combine the domestic good and the foreign evil ; but that is not how the minds and feelings of people in practice function .
If it is logically possible to envisage a government that is wise and just to its own people while being cruel and oppressive toward others , still , in actuality this is not possible .
It does not happen , because human nature is not formed for such double bookkeeping .
People who fancy they can act the two parts at once are imagining a form of conduct beyond their psychological means .
King turns now to a practical observation .
War is an enemy to the poor in America .
By a terrible compensation we are sending blacks to fight in Vietnam when we cannot find jobs or justice for them at home .
How can he preach non-violence in America while this process goes forward ?
" For those who ask the question , ‘ Are n’t you a civil rights leader ? ’ and thereby mean to exclude me from the movement for peace , I have this further answer .
In 1957 when a group of us formed the Southern Christian Leadership Conference , we chose as our motto : ‘ To save the soul of America . ’
We were convinced that we could not limit our vision to certain rights for black people , but instead affirmed the conviction that America would never be free or saved from itself until the descendants of its slaves were loosed completely from the shackles they still wear .
In a way we were agreeing with Langston Hughes , that black bard of Harlem , who had written earlier :
" O , yes , I say it plain ,
America never was America to me ,
And yet I swear this oath 
America will be !
" Now , it should be incandescently clear that no one who has any concern for the integrity and life of America today can ignore the present war .
If America ’s soul becomes totally poisoned , part of the autopsy must read : Vietnam .
It can never be saved so long as it destroys the deepest hopes of men the world over .
So it is that those of us who are yet determined that America will be are led down the path of protest and dissent , working for the health of our land . "
Accordingly , he argues , it is fitting for him to dedicate part of his energy in the coming months to the protest against the war .
Some people thought his recent statements in criticism of American foreign policy were an abuse of the impartial honor of his Nobel Prize for Peace .
A man so distinguished , they said , ought not to join a protest movement that might be seen as fractious or merely parochial .
King replies now by saying that
" the Nobel Prize for Peace was also a commission  a commission to work harder than I had ever worked before for “ the brotherhood of man . ”
This is a calling that takes me beyond national allegiances , but even if it were not present I would yet have to live with the meaning of my commitment to the ministry of Jesus Christ .
To me the relationship of this ministry to the making of peace is so obvious that I sometimes marvel at those who ask me why I ’m speaking against the war .
Could it be that they do not know that the good news was meant for all men  for Communist and capitalist , for their children and ours , for black and for white , for revolutionary and conservative ?
Have they forgotten that my ministry is in obedience to the One who loved his enemies so fully that he died for them ? "
And he goes on to explain his motives in explicitly Christian terms :
" Beyond the calling of race or nation or creed is this vocation of sonship and brotherhood , and because I believe that the Father is deeply concerned especially for his suffering and helpless and outcast children , I come tonight to speak for them .
" This I believe to be the privilege and the burden of all of us who deem ourselves bound by allegiances and loyalties which are broader and deeper than nationalism and which go beyond our nation ’s self - defined goals and positions .
We are called to speak for the weak , for the voiceless , for the victims of our nation and for those it calls “ enemy , ” for no document from human hands can make these humans any less our brothers .
" And as I ponder the madness of Vietnam and search within myself for ways to understand and respond in compassion , my mind goes constantly to the people of that peninsula .
I speak now not of the soldiers of each side , not of the ideologies of the Liberation Front , not of the junta in Saigon , but simply of the people who have been living under the curse of war for almost three continuous decades now .
I think of them , too , because it is clear to me that there will be no meaningful solution there until some attempt is made to know them and hear their broken cries . "
Thus in a way exceptional for an American , and for any social critic or prophet , King moved beyond a protest within his country to a work of conscience he knew must cross all national boundaries .
As Jesus Christ spoke from a care for what was done to " the least of these , " King looks to a subject neglected by Americans : the history of suffering by the Vietnamese people .
" They must see Americans as strange liberators .
The Vietnamese people proclaimed their own independence in 1945 , after a combined French and Japanese occupation and before the communist revolution in China .
They were led by Ho Chi Minh .
Even though they quoted the American Declaration of Independence in their own document of freedom , we refused to recognize them .
Instead , we decided to support France in its re-conquest of her former colony .
Our government felt then that the Vietnamese people were not ready for independence , and we again fell victim to the deadly Western arrogance that has poisoned the international atmosphere for so long . "
In a short summary , he recounts the history of the Vietnamese battle for independence from 1945 to 1965 .
What astonishes King about America ’s conduct after the French defeat at Dien Bien Phu in 1954 , is that , under cover of a client state with a sham democracy , we chose to make ourselves the successors of the departing French colonists :
" Now they languish under our bombs and consider us , not their fellow Vietnamese , the real enemy .
They move sadly and apathetically as we herd them off the land of their fathers into concentration camps where minimal social needs are rarely met .
They know they must move on or be destroyed by our bombs .
" So they go , primarily women and children and the aged .
They watch as we poison their water , as we kill a million acres of their crops .
They must weep as the bulldozers roar through their areas preparing to destroy the precious trees .
They wander into the hospitals with at least twenty casualties from American firepower for one Vietcong - inflicted injury .
So far we may have killed a million of them , mostly children .
They wander into the towns and see thousands of the children , homeless , without clothes , running in packs on the streets like animals .
They see the children degraded by our soldiers as they beg for food .
They see the children selling their sisters to our soldiers , soliciting for their mothers .
" What do the peasants think as we ally ourselves with the landlords and as we refuse to put any action into our many words concerning land reform ?
What do they think as we test out our latest weapons on them , just as the Germans tested out new medicine and new tortures in the concentration camps of Europe ?
Where are the roots of the independent Vietnam we claim to be building ?
Is it among these voiceless ones ? "
Martin Luther King ’s striking comparison of the Americans in Vietnam to the Germans in Europe was " extreme " by the standards of American opinion in 1967 ; as it would be extreme in our own time to suggest that a similar comparison is warranted by the use of phosphorous bombs in the second siege of Fallujah and of psychotropic drugs on terrorist suspects in Guantanamo .
To King , the truth of a perception mattered more than its happy or disagreeable effect on the listener .
This comparison did not , in fact , constitute for him a special provocation .
He presents it as matter of fact : a truth about the way power and technology , once possessed , are inevitably used in the modern age .
The lights of perverted science assist the experiments and protract the dominance of a military power that recognizes no restraint .
But King also here implies a subtler thought  implies it so clearly that it need not be spoken .
Unlimited power will do everything it can against those it has once dehumanized as a " total " enemy ( an enemy that is a beast and also a thing ) .
The brutalization of mind always takes place before the atrocity in which it proves itself .
Nor is the capacity for such acts the attribute of a single nation or race .
The same part of the mind that invented Zyklon B invented napalm .
The same human nature that wanted to use the poison gas as soon as it saw the ingenuity of the thing also wanted to use the lethal burning jelly .
Destruction has its own momentum and its own fascination .
Things built over ages can be made to vanish in an instant under its annihilating stroke .
That is what happened to the ancient culture , the farms , and the forests of Vietnam under the unleashed assault of American air power  which , by the end of the war , would subject a country the size of Italy to more than three times the tonnage of bombs dropped in all of the Second World War .
" We have destroyed their two most cherished institutions : the family and the village .
We have destroyed their land and their crops .
We have cooperated in the crushing of the nation ’s only noncommunist revolutionary political force , the unified Buddhist Church .
We have supported the enemies of the peasants of Saigon .
We have corrupted their women and children and killed their men .
" Now there is little left to build on , save bitterness .
Soon the only solid physical foundations remaining will be found at our military bases and in the concrete of the concentration camps we call ‘ fortified hamlets . ’
The peasants may well wonder if we plan to build our new Vietnam on such grounds as these .
Could we blame them for such thoughts ?
We must speak for them and raise the questions they cannot raise .
These , too , are our brothers . "
Thus far , the condemnation has been general , but King now moves to speak of the National Liberation Front and North Vietnam  both , in 1967 , still considered off limits in public discussion , even though it was generally known that a negotiated settlement without their participation would be meaningless .
Whatever our actions might say , American intentions , as all Americans agreed , were unselfish ; and , though Vietnam might be the home of the Vietnamese , millions of them had been grossly deceived and misled .
As for the North Vietnamese and the NLF , no good would ever come from them .
Martin Luther King offered a radical challenge to each of these premises ; yet the method ( King believed ) for showing America the false conceit of its innocence was to acknowledge the harm done to Vietnam alongside a catastrophe nearer to home .
He speaks of what this war is doing to the American soldiers who have to fight it :
" I am as deeply concerned about our own troops there as anything else .
For it occurs to me that what we are submitting them to in Vietnam is not simply the brutalizing process that goes on in any war where armies face each other and seek to destroy .
We are adding cynicism to the process of death , for they must know after a short period there that none of the things we claim to be fighting for are really involved .
Before long they must know that their government has sent them into a struggle among Vietnamese , and the more sophisticated surely realize that we are on the side of the wealthy , and the secure , while we create a hell for the poor .
" Somehow this madness must cease .
We must stop now .
I speak as a child of God and brother to the suffering poor of Vietnam .
I speak for those whose land is being laid waste , whose homes are being destroyed , whose culture is being subverted .
I speak for the poor of America who are paying the double price of smashed hopes at home , and death and corruption in Vietnam .
I speak as a citizen of the world , for the world as it stands aghast at the path we have taken .
I speak as one who loves America , to the leaders of our own nation :
The great initiative in this war is ours ; the initiative to stop it must be ours . "
King ends this penultimate section by quoting a Buddhist leader who had once admired the United States but who , from his experience of the war , concluded that America could never again be a revolutionary country for freedom .
Its fate after Vietnam would be chiefly to be known and feared for its relentless use of military power .
Having turned from inquest to prophecy , the speech concludes with five specific proposals .
End the bombing ; commit the U.S. to a unilateral cease - fire ; curtail the build - up of American troops in Laos and Thailand ; recognize the NLF as a legitimate party in negotiations ; and set a date for withdrawal .
It took enormous courage , a now almost unimaginable independence , for a leader so close to established opinion in America to say these things in April 1967 .
One year ahead lay the withdrawal of Lyndon Johnson from the presidential campaign of 1968 , after a primary in New Hampshire in which the insurgent candidate , Eugene McCarthy , said far milder things about the Vietnam war than King in " A Time to Break Silence . "
How would our history , and Vietnam ’s , have changed had Martin Luther King ’s advice been followed in 1967 ?
Many who are dead would have lived .
An environment and a way of a life would have been spared a depth of destruction whose effects have yet to be fully measured .
And the truth of the warning that followed his proposals would not have become a truth of history : that America ( as King put it ) was placing itself on the wrong side of the revolution for freedom throughout the world .
He summoned the words of John F. Kennedy : “ Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable . "
The truth of that axiom seems hardly to have diminished forty years later .
With one notable difference : a substantial portion of American policy makers have now inherited the Jacobin and Soviet ambition to be the fomenters of violent revolution abroad .
We would know the great Riverside Church oration of April 1967 as the work only of an inspired reformer and protest leader  not of the moral leader that Martin Luther King always also was  had it closed with this comment regarding the ultimate cost of America ’s policy .
Yet the speech looks beyond the Vietnam war and asks us to consider the wrong of war itself .
An end to wars is a cause to which at least all Christians are called to dedicate themselves .
For war is always the instrument of the powerful .
It sharpens the sting of inequality , and by destruction it steals from the poor the lives they have built .
As Christians , therefore ,
" we are called to play the Good Samaritan on life ’s roadside , but that will be only an initial act .
One day we must come to see that the whole Jericho Road must be transformed so that men and women will not be constantly beaten and robbed as they make their journey on life ’s highway .
True compassion is more than flinging a coin to a beggar .
It comes to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring .
" A true revolution of values will lay hands on the world order and say of war , ‘ This way of settling differences is not just . ’
This business of burning human beings with napalm , of filling our nation ’s homes with orphans and widows , of injecting poisonous drugs of hate into the veins of peoples normally humane , of sending men home from dark and bloody battlefields physically handicapped and psychologically deranged , cannot be reconciled with wisdom , justice , and love .
A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death . "
The doctrine is Christian ; and yet King in this speech made sure not to claim that it was exclusively Christian :
Love is somehow the key that unlocks the door which leads to ultimate reality .
This Hindu - Muslim - Christian - Jewish - Buddhist belief about ultimate reality is beautifully summed up in the first epistle of Saint John : “ Let us love one another , for love is God .
And every one that loveth is born of God and knoweth God .
He that loveth not knoweth not God , for God is love . ”
“ If we love one another , God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us . ”
Let us hope that this spirit will become the order of the day .
Will Americans ( King wondered ) live according the morality of the Good Samaritan ?
Or will we continue on the path we have taken , and live by the ethics of the Caesars ?
" There is an invisible book of life that faithfully records our vigilance or our neglect .
Omar Khayyam is right : ‘ The moving finger writes , and having writ moves on . ’
" We still have a choice today : nonviolent coexistence or violent co-annihilation .
We must move past indecision to action .
We must find new ways to speak for peace in Vietnam and justice throughout the developing world , a world that borders on our doors .
If we do not act , we shall surely be dragged down the long , dark , and shameful corridors of time reserved for those who possess power without compassion , might without morality , and strength without sight . "
With that final evocation of crisis  adding some favorite verses from James Russell Lowell about the choices both men and countries face 
King left his audience to their thoughts .
One year , to the day , after he delivered this speech , on April 4 , 1968 , Martin Luther King was assassinated .
Ask an American about the anti-war speech in Riverside Church  as surprising in its range of thoughts and as closely argued as anything ever written or spoken by Martin Luther King  and you are likely to find only the vaguest of recognitions .
Few know more than that there was such a speech .
In fact , " A Time to Break Silence " marked a crossroads in the life of Martin Luther King .
President Johnson never forgave him for breaking ranks ; pro-war liberal Democrats afterward often dissociated themselves from his actions ; and a large part of the civil rights movement deplored his stance as a violation of an unspoken contract .
Civil rights , they thought , was about black Americans , and the cause of black Americans was civil rights .
The violence of the cities had nothing to do with the violence of the war .
Even some advisers close to King , as Taylor Branch recounts in At Canaan ’s Edge , believed that the speech was impolitic  " too advanced , " " not so balanced " as it should have been ; while the political counselor of President Johnson , John P. Roche , wrote a confidential memorandum saying that King had " thrown in his lot with the commies . "
As for the press , the New York Times judged that King ’s protest against the war was " wasteful and self - defeating " and likely to be " disastrous for both causes . "
The Washington Post went further .
It predicted that many who had once listened to King with respect " would never again accord him the same confidence " ; and it concluded : " He has diminished his usefulness to his cause , his country , and his people . "
Recall that , in his speech , King said that concern for black Americans had led him to concern for America as a whole , and for the people of the world .
The Post , by its gesture of severance , was returning the black minister to " his people " with the considered judgment that he was no longer of much use even to them .
Martin Luther King was disturbed , but cannot have been surprised , by the tenor of these responses ; and in a " Face to Face " television interview on July 28 , when asked directly about the supposed contradiction between his efforts on behalf of civil rights and in the anti-war movement , he gave his reply :
" I have worked too long now , and too hard to get rid of segregation in public accommodations to turn back to the point of segregating my moral concern .
Justice is indivisible .
Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere .
And wherever I see injustice , I ’m going to take a stand against it whether it ’s in Mississippi or in Vietnam . "
He had said something like these words before , but never before so piercingly
Moral courage is rare .
Still rarer is the courage to oppose a president who has helped your cause and the consensus of a party that has supported your cause .
But in April 1967 , King had reached a point where he knew that " silence is betrayal , " and he knew that he had to act .
He saw that conformity to the dogma of anti-communism had muffled free discussion in the United States ; that the excuse of ideology had blinded Americans of all colors to the infectiousness of the violence we practiced .
King ’s greatness , at that moment , did not take the form of simple civic courage , the performing of a public duty you have come to expect of yourself .
Rather , his was that " more lonely courage " William James once spoke of  courage which shows itself in leaving a secure post and taking up one more exposed , because the time and place require your presence .
For a country once described by Napoleon as a nation of shopkeepers it is perhaps fitting that the future king today opens his own shop on the high street of Tetbury , his adopted home town .
Highgrove , named after Prince Charles 's Gloucestershire house , will sell items from organic carrots to breakfast bowls painted with pictures of the royal hens .
Shoppers will be able to buy into the prince 's lifestyle by snapping up his range of gardening tools , Aga oven gloves and even a brand of Lebanese soap said to feature in his ablutions .
Honey lovers will have to move fast .
The wet weather last summer was bad news for the prince 's bees and supplies are expected to run out fast .
" It is a large open shop space in a Cotswold stone building and we have placed the kitchenwares , china and so on at the front , the children 's items behind and the vegetables and fruit at the back , " said Christine Prescott , the shop 's commercial director .
" The prince is really looking forward to getting customers through the door . "
Many of the products are already available as mementos at Highgrove 's private shop used by invited visitors to the house .
The new store will feature 700 lines and profits will go to the prince 's charities , a Clarence House spokesman said .
If Highgrove is a success , the prince has not ruled out starting a chain , his aides said .
On behalf of the American people , today I step forward and extend my thanks to you .
During your two terms in office , you 've worked very hard to help the average American 's life .
I 'd like to take a moment or two and specifically thank you for the following : * The stress of going to work for millions of Americans has been greatly relieved by your diligent efforts by sending all those terrible sources of income toChina .
*
Now that we have Homeland Security we can all sleep better knowing that when the doors of our homes are kicked in at night , it will be only for our protection and our own good .
We trust you implicitly to do the right thing .
* Millions of Americans , who have been stressed out for years by living the American Dream of owning a home , will no longer have these worries .
Living in a car or RV is so much simpler , and far more comfortable .
*
The mice , ants , roaches and other pests brought on by having food in American cupboards and pantries has finally been brought under control .
The New America you 've given us has made that happen , by emptying pantries and cupboards all across America .
Companies like D - Con , Rent - A - Kill and Orkin may have their very existence in peril with the lack of food .
*
Your 100 year war you have bestowed upon the American people and indeed , all of the western world to fight terrorism will provide jobs for all .
All those children from your wonderful " No Child Left Behind " public school policy that are now graduating from high schools everywhere are unfit for college .
But they will find food , shelter , training and employment under the loving organization of Homeland Security .
*
You have shown us you must be a God , for you could see the first plane crashing into the World Trade Center which was never televised .
You were so humble that you did n't want to admit you could see it without the aid of television , so you stated you saw it on television .
*
We all thank you for your gift of the Patriot Act .
Since the 1200 + page document was all ready to sign the same week as 9 - 11 , clearly you have the gift of foresight and had it all ready ahead of time .
You saw that terrible evil coming on 9 - 11 , but you did n't stop it because all those deaths were good forAmerica .
*
Your quiet , diligent work to take down America 's borders by leaving them effectively undefended to allow millions of illegal aliens to enter America and burden her down in her time of need , is a love for America beyond compare .
*
We all understand even another way you show us love , by the special protections you give to corporations like Blackwater that help destroy America 's reputation .
We realize that it 's for our own good .
*
We 're all so sorry that those six nuclear weapons that reached Barksdale , Louisiana last year ( the logistics staging airbase for the mid-east war ) were stopped by those annoying patriotic Americans .
They should have been allowed to proceed to destroy Iran and officially start WW3 .
After all , you know what 's best for America .
* All Americans everywhere want to join together and thank you for the highest fuel prices in the history of the planet .
It took you considerable hard work and the courage to give away all the Iraqi oil to foreign corporations that many thousands of American soldiers died for , to make this gift become a reality .
Because of this wonderful gift , millions of Americans will no be troubled by making vacation plans .
And they will not have to endure all that stress relief that goes with a nice vacation .
*
We all want to extend a special thank you for staging not one war , but two wars without any means to pay for them .
Foolish people on Capitol Hill during WW2 wasted so much time selling war bonds to pay for that war .
Perhaps by the end of 2008 , you can get a third front started for us to enjoy with no possible way to pay for it .
* Millions of homeowners everywhere are so grateful that you have pulled funding from minor projects like rebuilding America 's aging infrastructure .
Cities and towns everywhere have created tremendous tax increases , and homeowners everywhere are so happy about it they have used garage and yard sales to display and celebrate their gratitude for taxes they cannot afford .
*
We 're all grateful for you not working too hard to find your arch enemy and supposed architect of 9 - 11 , Bin Laden .
We understand your need for him , and that finding him would end all justification for the mid-east conflict .
No one wants to let the air out of your war tires .
*
There all are those careers you 've so graciously destroyed in the military to protect yourself .
These patriotic men and women have no business upholding the Constitution like they have , despite their oath when each was sworn in at the induction center .
Their allegiance must be to you , not the Constitution .
You have stated to us that the Constitution is " just a God - Da ..d piece of paper " and this is how we know that you are where everyone 's faith must be centered .
*
Surely there are many more gifts you 've given America , and we 're terribly sorry if we have omitted them .
And we 're all sure , that the coming atrocities you 'll bestow upon us and the world before you leave office will be for the good of America , and the entire world .
In closing , I 'd like to say that destroying America with a carefully crafted plan is a dirty job , but somebody has to do it .
Certainly , you make Mike Rowe proud .
But I do n't think he'd be able to do your dirty job in a short segment on his cable show , " Dirty Jobs . "

Britain will not ratify the EU treaty until the High Court has ruled on a bid to force a British referendum , Prime Minister Gordon Brown has said .
A judgement on the High Court bid by tycoon Stuart Wheeler is due next week .
But a judge in the case earlier expressed " surprise " ministers were going ahead with ratification and asked that they " stay their hand " .
Mr Brown said the request " fits in with our timetable " and " of course " it would not be ratified before the ruling .
The bill that would ratify the Lisbon Treaty passed its last Parliamentary hurdle in the House of Lords on Wednesday and gained Royal Assent on Thursday .
But the process is not technically completed until the " instruments of ratification " are deposited in Rome .
Referendum case Government officials say the judge 's letter and Mr Brown 's comments do not change the original timetable to complete ratification and say it was always the aim to complete ratification in July , after the court judgement .
Friday 's direction from High Court judge Lord Justice Richards appears to have been prompted by a letter from Treasury lawyers .
THE RATIFICATION PROCESS Parliament approves bill to ratify treaty The Queen gives Royal assent The " instruments of ratification " are drawn up by the Foreign Office
These documents - three pages of goatskin parchment - are sent to the Queen The Queen signs the front page and a warrant authorising them
The documents return to the Foreign Office and are signed by the foreign secretary
They are sent to the Crown Office in the House of Lords who affix the great seal
The documents return to the Foreign Office , are tied in a blue ribbon and bound in blue leather
They are sent to the British Embassy in Rome and then to the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs
Only then is ratification complete After the EU ( Amendment )
Act gained Royal Assent , they wrote to the High Court saying : " The government is now proceeding to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon . "
In a direction published on Friday , Lord Justice Richards said : " The court is very surprised that the government apparently proposes to ratify , while the claimant 's challenge to the decision not to hold a referendum on ratification is before the court .
" The court expects judgement to be handed down next week .
The defendants are invited to stay their hand voluntarily until judgement . "
He warned that if they do not , Mr Wheeler will be invited to seek an injunction to stop ratification going ahead .
The prime minister , who is at an EU summit in Brussels , was quick to respond to the letter saying the steps between Royal Assent and actual ratification could take weeks .
He added : " The judge has now replied that he expects to give his judgement next week and of course that fits in with our timetable .
" Having had Royal Assent we have got to go through all the different procedures before ratification - so ratification will not take place of course until we have the judgement . "
But Mr Wheeler told the BBC that while Mr Brown said the timetable had not changed , that was " not consistent with what he was saying earlier " .
Clearly the court ruling is an embarrassment for the prime minister and the government
Mark Francois
Conservatives
He said the government 's solicitors had been " very relaxed in casually telling the court yesterday afternoon ( Thursday ) that they intended to ratify without bothering to wait for the court judgement " .
He added : " The reaction from the court , not surprisingly , was very strong indeed . "
If the High Court judgement goes against him next week , he said he would " very likely " appeal and hoped ratification would be delayed further .
Shadow Europe minister Mark Francois , for the Conservatives , told the BBC : " Clearly the court ruling is an embarrassment for the prime minister and the government . "
Mr Brown has been discussing the future of the treaty - which was thrown into question after it was rejected in an Irish referendum last week - with other EU leaders .
Czech doubt
The treaty must be ratified by all 27 states to come into force - Ireland was the only country to hold a referendum .
EU leaders at the two - day summit in Brussels agreed to give Irish PM Brian Cowen until their next meeting in mid-October to consult at home and abroad on the possible next steps forward .
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said he is still confident it will be ratified .
But the Czech Republic may not be able to ratify the Treaty either , it has emerged .
The declaration from the Brussels summit notes that the Czech process is on hold due to legal difficulties .
Mr Wheeler had brought his own High Court case arguing that the British government had promised a referendum " and should keep its promise " .
Labour promised a referendum on the EU Constitution - but that was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and the EU Treaty was drawn up to replace it .
Ministers say it is substantially different to the EU Constitution so a referendum is not needed .
Conservative MP
Bill Cash launched a separate bid for a judicial review of the ratification process - which was rejected by the High Court .

What are these ?

Billionaire investor George Soros has given his gloomiest assessment of the state of the US and world economies .
He told BBC business editor Robert Peston that the " acute phase " of the credit crunch may be over but effects on the real economy are yet to be felt .
He warned the " financial bubble " of the last 25 years could be drawing to an end and the post World War II " super - boom " era could also be over .
He predicted a " more severe and longer " US slowdown than most people expect .
And he said that the UK was worse - placed than America to weather the coming economic storm , because it had such a large financial sector and has had the biggest increase in house prices .
Gloomy bankers
Mr Soros said that the current mandate of most of the world 's leading central banks - where their main focus was fighting inflation - meant there was limited scope for cutting interest rates to help economies recover .
As for the Bank of the England , he said , " it was like a Greek tragedy " , because they " could n't do a U - turn " until there was a full - blown recession , which would finally take away the price pressures .
The Bank of England is warning of higher inflation and slower growth
It was " inevitable " that they would keep rates too high for the good of the economy , he added .
In part , Mr Soros is echoing the gloomy forecast of the world 's central bankers in recent weeks .
The head of the European Central Bank , Jean - Claude Trichet , recently told the BBC that the " market correction was still on - going " .
Mervyn King , the governor of the Bank of England , warned in the Bank 's inflation report that UK inflation would rise above its target while the economy would slow sharply .
Moral hazard Mr Soros believes that central bankers are partly to blame for the credit crunch because of their past behaviour in bailing out the financial sector whenever it got into trouble for over - lending , the so - called moral hazard problem .
In the US Bear Stearns has had to be rescued He said that the central banks should explicitly target asset bubbles such as housing booms and try to stop them getting out of control , which is something they have resisted doing so far .
And he said that tougher but smarter regulation would be needed in the future in order to reduce the excess supply of credit in the economy .
These could include measures to force banks to put aside more reserves in good times to help cushion them in bad times .
Misguided markets
Mr Soros believes that oil and other commodities are over - priced , but he sees little chance of the price of oil coming down until there is a big slowdown in the richer economies .
Oil prices have risen relentlessly this year
He sees the price of oil as being driven by higher demand in developing countries such as China , where subsidised energy costs mean there is less price - sensitivity .
He also said that stock markets are still underestimating the severity and length of the economic downturn , especially in the US , and are now having a " bear market rally " .
Profiting from the crisis Mr Soros has credibility partly because he is prepared to invest his own money to back up his convictions .
The private investment fund he has resumed managing made a return of 34 % last year betting that the credit crunch was more severe than many people expected .
Mr Soros was the man reported to have made $ 1bn in September 1992 , betting correctly that the British currency would have to be devalued and leave the European Exchange Rate Mechanism .
Mr Soros has devoted much of time since then to philanthropy , especially in Eastern Europe .

The US court order shutting down the website Wikileaks today appeared to backfire on the Swiss bank that sought the legal action , as bloggers and other fans of the site gave new life to leaked documents the bank was working to suppress .
In addition to international Wikileaks versions that were unaffected by the shutdown order , " mirror " copies of the website sprouted like weeds thanks to supporters of its mission .
Run anonymously , Wikileaks aims to publish sensitive documents that often prove incriminating for governments and corporations .
Swiss - based Bank Julius
Baer obtained the order on Friday to stop Wikileaks from disseminating internal company documents that purported to show the bank 's Cayman Islands branch involved in money laundering and tax evasion .
But the overwhelming online response to Wikileaks 's demise made the bank — and the documents themselves — the talk of the internet .
" Clearly , the court and Bank Julius Baer underestimated the ingenuity of the web development community , " the whistleblower protection group Project on Government Oversight wrote on its blog .
David Ardia , director of the Citizen Media Law Project at Harvard University , said the situation had " gone 180 degrees wrong for the bank " .
" What this is done is , it 's really struck a chord for publishers , both online and offline , " Ardia said .
" If a federal judge in California can , on the arguments of one party , order that an entire website be taken down , that 's a very scary proposition .
What if these documents were n't on Wikileaks [ but ] they were on YouTube , MySpace or Facebook ? "
US district court judge Jeffrey White , appointed in 2002 by George Bush , ordered the San Francisco - based web server for Wikileaks to block the domain name during an " ex parte " hearing , with the website not represented by counsel .
The web server company , Dynadot , said today that it is remaining neutral on the bank 's lawsuit .
" However , if Julius Baer is concerned with the posting of its confidential documents on the wikileaks.org web site , it could have sought a more narrow remedy than seeking to have the entire wikileaks.org web site shut down , " Kathryn Chow - Han , in - house counsel for Dynadot , said in a statement .
The next hearing in the case is scheduled for February 29 , although Ardia said Wikileaks could move for an earlier court date after presenting new legal representation .
The bank has retained Los Angeles lawyers Lavely & Singer , the favourite firm for celebrities aiming to quash publication of unwelcome photographs .
CHICAGO - In the Second City , the buzz is all about first place .
The Cubs are on top .
So are the White Sox .
And starting Friday , they play each other six times in 10 days .
Somehow , maybe , this could be a preview of a Windy City World Series .
Just imagine fans of the teams who do n't exactly love one another jamming the Red Line train that runs the eight miles between Wrigley Field and U.S. Cellular Field .
The last all - Chicago World Series saw the White Sox , known as the " Hitless Wonders , " beat the favored Cubs four games to two , after the Cubs went 116 - 36 during the regular season of 1906 .
Two years later , the Cubs won the World Series and have n't captured one since , a 100 - year stretch of futility that White Sox fans are quick to point out when there 's a debate over who 's the best team in town .
The White Sox , meanwhile , ended an 88 - year drought of their own by winning the World Series in 2005 , an accomplishment that apparently did n't impress some Cubs ' backers .
" It 's so different .
You might as well build a border , a Great Wall of China on Madison ( Ave. ) because we are so different , " White Sox general manager Ken Williams said this week in an interview with the Chicago Sun -Times .
" We might as well be in two different cities .
" The unfortunate thing for me is that it 's a shame that a certain segment of Chicago refused to enjoy a baseball championship brought to their city .
The only thing I can say is Happy anniversary . ' "
When they meet Friday at Wrigley Field , it will mark the latest date both teams have been in first since Sept. 9 , 2003 .
The Cubs won the NL Central that season before falling apart in the NLCS and losing to Florida after being five outs away from the World Series .
The White Sox finished second to Minnesota in the AL Central .
And since interleague play started in 1997 , it 's the first time the White Sox and Cubs will meet as first - place teams at the start of the series .
" It 's great for the fans , it really is .
It 's great for the city , " Cubs manger Lou Piniella said of the series , which he managed in for the first time a year ago , winning five of six .
" Both teams have played well this year , which adds to it .
We look forward to the challenge of facing them . "
Even though the Cubs have the home - field advantage for the first three games - and they are 29 - 8 at Wrigley Field this season - they could be the wearier team Friday .
While the White Sox wrapped up a three - game series Thursday afternoon at home against the Pirates , the Cubs had to play a night game in St. Petersburg , Fla. , before Friday 's 1:20 p.m. series opener at Wrigley Field .
" I 'm going to talk to a few people in Tampa and make sure they delay that plane until 7 a.m , " White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen said .
" You never have an advantage against the Cubs in Wrigley Field . "
In the past , Guillen has expressed his dislike for the Cubs ' home ballpark .
He was especially unhappy one season when he was forced to park in a fast - food restaurant lot across the street from the stadium .
Guillen 's major complaints have been Wrigley 's small and cramped visitor 's clubhouse and a long twisting tunnel to get to the field .
He was in a foul mood last year when his team played on the North Side , calling up a radio talk show from his car on the way to the park and unleashing a profanity - filled tirade after the host questioned why A.J. Pierzynski was n't in the starting lineup .
And emotions do surge during the series as players on both sides feel the rush of a playoff - like atmosphere where fans are roaring on every pitch .
" You learn the whole situation of how passionate the fans really are here in Chicago .
Both teams are in first .
It adds even more excitement , " White Sox third baseman Joe Crede said .
" Both teams could be in last place and there will still be brawls and all that stuff , " said White Sox outfielder Brian Anderson , who drew a suspension two years ago when a melee ensued after then - Cubs catcher Michael Barrett punched Pierzynski after a collision at the plate .
Both teams will be less than full strength .
The White Sox are without first baseman Paul Konerko , who has 14 career homers against the Cubs , but is on the disabled list .
Cubs star Alfonso Soriano , who homered in three straight games against the White Sox at U.S. Cellular last season , is also sidelined .
And Cubs ace Carlos Zambrano - who was not scheduled to pitch this weekend - had to leave his start Wednesday night with a sore shoulder .
So far , the series is about even as it gets .
It 's tied at 30 - 30 and each team is 16 - 14 on its home field .
" When you see the enthusiasm in the street and the people in the stands you get pumped up , " Guillen said .
" I do n't care what you 're doing or saying .
You get into it . "

On the Alex Jones Show today , Dr. Ibrahim Dremali , Director of the Islamic Center of Greater Austin , described the condition of Riad Hamad Esolh ’s body after he allegedly committed suicide by trussing himself in duct tape and throwing himself in the Colorado River in Austin , also known as Lady Bird Lake .
Islamic law requires the deceased be washed prior to burial and this was what Mr. Dremali did less than 24 hours after Mr. Hamad was pulled from the Colorado River and after an autopsy , although it appears Hamad ’s family did not give permission for an autopsy .
Normally , according to Dr. Dremali , the “ police contact Islamic Center before they do anything ” and they did not do this in the case of Mr. Hamad .
Dremali described to Alex Jones the condition of Hamad ’s body .
It appeared as if he had been “ attacked by an animal in the jungle , ” Dremali said .
Hamad was cut from the shoulder to the stomach ; his arms were cut and his face was bruised and the rear of his skull was bashed in .
Dremali said Hamad ’s brain was missing .
Alex speculated Hamad ’s brain was missing because he may have been shot in the head .
Dremali stressed that suicide is forbidden under Islamic law .
Moreover , the claim Hamad committed suicide is specious because he had children and was in the process of obtaining a doctorate degree .
Dr. Dremali would not speculate if Riad Hamad was assassinated , although it is now obvious , considering the condition of the body , he did not commit suicide .
If indeed Riad Hamad was assassinated , this would dovetail with Israel ’s declaration they will target assassinate “ Palestinian extremists , ” apparently including American school teachers who send textbooks to Palestinian school children , obviously a terrorist event .
Israeli intelligence , according to United Press International , considers violating U.S. sovereignty and murdering U.S. citizens as “ operational maneuverability . ”

JENA , Louisiana ( CNN ) --
Thousands of protesters clogged the tiny town of Jena , Louisiana , Thursday to show their indignation over what they consider unjust , unequal punishments meted out in two racially charged incidents .

They swarmed over the grounds of Jena High School , where nooses were hung from a tree in early August 2006 , about three months before six black teens known as the " Jena 6 " were accused of beating a white classmate .
While the tension was palpable , news broke Thursday afternoon that the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeal ordered a hearing within 72 hours to determine if the only one of the six still behind bars can be released .
The order has " got to be good , " Mychal Bell 's attorney , Bob Noel , told CNN .
" It means we have a day in court .
Any day in court is going to be a good day . "
Earlier , there was an aura of a pilgrimage at the site where the controversial tree once stood before school administrators had it removed .
Many people touched the ground and some retrieved a lump of dirt , said CNN 's Eric Marrapodi .
He said the part of the town he was in was ill - prepared for the crowds -- no water or toilets were available .
In the background , groups shouted " Black power " and " No justice , no peace . "
The estimated 15000 to 20,000 demonstrators shut down the town of 3,000 in central Louisiana .
Many residents left for the day , and government agencies , businesses and schools were closed .
Sgt. Tim Ledet of the Louisiana State Police said protesters in buses were still bringing people to town at midday because of the gridlock , but many protesters got off and walked into town on foot .
" There is just no room to maneuver in this small town , " he said .
Jena resident Terry Adams disagreed with any accusations that there might be a black - white divide in the area .
" We are not a racial town .
We get along with each other , we get along fine .
This is something that got out of proportion .
It really has . "
Jena 's racial tensions were aggravated in August 2006 , when three white teens hung the nooses the day after a group of black students received permission from school administrators to sit under the tree -- a place where white students normally congregated .
The guilty students were briefly suspended from classes , despite the principal 's recommendation they be expelled , according to Donald Washington , U.S. attorney for the Western District of Louisiana .
A member of the LaSalle Parish School Board -- which had a role in supporting suspension instead of expulsion -- insisted the board is not prejudiced .
The panel felt it took the appropriate action , Jonny Fryar said .
" I talked to one of the parents , who called me and said their son thought it was a prank and naive to the fact of what it meant and he was sorry , " he said .
" I hate to see people label us as something we are not .
Because we have black students and white students playing football together .
They shake hands , get along .
This is an unfortunate incident .
We hope that the community can heal . "
Although Washington acknowledged the FBI and other investigators thought the noose incident bore the markings of a hate crime , a decision was made not to press federal charges because the case did n't meet federal criteria .
The students were under 18 and had no prior records , and no group such as a Ku Klux Klan was found to be behind their actions .
On December 4 , about three months after the nooses were discovered , six teens , dubbed the Jena 6 , were accused of beating classmate Justin Barker .
The six -- Mychal Bell , Robert Bailey Jr. , Carwin Jones , Bryant Purvis , Theo Shaw and Jesse Ray Beard -- were originally charged with attempted second - degree murder and conspiracy , according to LaSalle Parish District Attorney Reed Walters .
Bell , the only one of the six who remains in jail , was to be sentenced Thursday after convictions for aggravated second - degree battery and conspiracy to do the same , but both charges have been vacated , awaiting further action by the district attorney .
Charges for Bailey , Jones and Shaw also were reduced to battery and conspiracy when they were arraigned , while Purvis still awaits arraignment .
The charges for Beard , who was 14 at the time of the alleged crime , are unavailable because he 's a juvenile .
Tina Jones , Purvis ' mother , condemned Walters .
" I hope that the D.A. will wake up and realize that he 's doing the wrong thing , and to release these kids , " she said .
" It 's not equal .
The black people get the harsher extent of the law , whereas white people get a slap on the wrist per se .
So it is not equal here . "
Jones maintained that her son was not involved in the beating , but watched from a railing , and was not arrested that same day .
" We have a long fight ahead of us , and we 'll keep fighting until justice prevails in Jena , " the mother said .
Purvis , who accompanied her , was asked how he 's faring .
" I 'm doing pretty good .
I hope there is a pretty good outcome of what 's taking place today , " he said .
Watch an interview with one of the Jena 6 and his mom »
President Bush , who was asked about the rally at a news conference , said , " The events in Louisiana have saddened me .
I understand the emotions .
The Justice Department and the FBI are monitoring the situation down there .
" All of us in America want there to be fairness when it comes to justice . "
He advised whoever is elected next year to " reach out to the African - American community . "
Hundreds of college students from historically black schools such as Howard University in Washington traveled to Jena , along with civil rights activists such as Al Sharpton and the Rev. Jesse Jackson , who helped organize the event .
Martin Luther King III also attended , saying , " This is about justice for the six young men . "
Sharpton called Jena the beginning of the 21st century civil rights movement .
" There 's a Jena in every state , " Jackson told the crowd in Jena on Thursday morning .
JoAnn Scales , who brought her three teenage children on a two - day bus journey from Los Angeles , California , to Jena , made the same point .
" The reason I brought my children is because it could have been one of them " involved in an incident like the one in Jena .
" If this can happen to them [ the Jena 6 ] , it can happen to anyone , " Scales said .
Ondra Hathaway was on the bus with Scales .
" If this young man [ Bell ] was railroaded to do time as an adult , how many more people has that happened to ? " she said .
Jackson said on CNN's " American Morning " on Thursday that the charges against the black youths , their possible jail terms if convicted and their bail amounts are " excessive . "
Punishing the teens with probation would have been sufficient , Jackson said .
Bails for the Jena 6 were between $ 70,000 and $ 138,000 , and all but Bell have posted bond .
Bell , 17 , has been in prison since his arrest .
The judge has refused to lower his $ 90,000 bail , citing Bell 's record , which includes four juvenile offenses -- two simple battery charges among them .
Bell was 16 at the time of the attack ; 17 is the legal adult age in Louisiana .

Solomon Asch , with experiments originally carried out in the 1950s and well - replicated since , highlighted a phenomenon now known as " conformity " .
In the classic experiment , a subject sees a puzzle like the one in the nearby diagram :
Which of the lines A , B , and C is the same size as the line X ?
Take a moment to determine your own answer ...
The gotcha is that the subject is seated alongside a number of other people looking at the diagram - seemingly other subjects , actually confederates of the experimenter .
The other " subjects " in the experiment , one after the other , say that line C seems to be the same size as X .
The real subject is seated next - to - last .
How many people , placed in this situation , would say " C " - giving an obviously incorrect answer that agrees with the unanimous answer of the other subjects ?
What do you think the percentage would be ?
Three - quarters of the subjects in Asch 's experiment gave a " conforming " answer at least once .
A third of the subjects conformed more than half the time .
Adding a single dissenter - just one other person who gives the correct answer , or even an incorrect answer that 's different from the group 's incorrect answer - reduces conformity very sharply , down to 5 - 10 % .

when subjects can respond in a way that will not be seen by the group , conformity also drops .

I just read a study which says that evendissenting voice can give people permission to think for themselves .
Specifically
Get it so far ?
People tend to defer to what the herd thinks .
But here 's the good news :
Why is this important ?
Well , it means thatwho publicly speaks the truth can sway a group of people away from group - think .
If a group of people is leaning towards believing the government 's version of 9/11 , or believing the official mythos of the war on terror , or that the U.S. holds " free and fair elections " , or that impeachment should " stay off the table " , aperson who speaks the truth can help snap the group out of its trance .
There is an important point here regarding the web , as well .
The above - cited article states that : What does that mean ?
Well , on the web , many people post anonymously .
The anonymity gives people permission to " respond in a way that will not be seen by the group " .
But most Americans still do n't get their news from the web , or only go to mainstream corporate news sites .
Away from the keyboard , we are not very anonymous .
So that is where the conformity dynamic -- and the need for courageous dissent -- is vital .
It isthat we apply the same hard - hitting truthtelling we do on the Internet in our face - to - face interactions ; because it isthat dissent is urgently needed .
Bottom line :'s voice has the power to snap entire groups out of their coma of irrational group - think .
So go forth and be a light of rationality and truth among the sleeping masses .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Mendocino County ’s reputation as a marijuana haven of California may be going up in smoke .

Voters on Tuesday leaned toward repealing a law allowing home marijuana growing , according to preliminary results of a ballot measure vote released on Wednesday .
Critics say a cottage industry had grown out of control .
California in 1996 voted to allow possession and cultivation by residents of marijuana for medical purposes , despite federal law which declares it illegal .
Mendocino , a rural county north San Francisco , in 2000 approved marijuana cultivation for recreational use as well , voting to let residents grow up to 25 marijuana plants , compared with the state limit of six .
With about a third of the vote counted , 52 percent supported repeal , the county clerk said .
The tally may not be complete for up to four weeks .
“ We thought Ma and Pa growers would be able to grow a little bit , ” said Dave Bengston , the county ’s agricultural commissioner , who supported the repeal .
“ The legalization of marijuana sent a message to organized crime that they could set up shop here , and we got people with automatic weapons growing marijuana in large quantities . ”
Supporters of local marijuana growing say repeal will hurt legitimate growers , while organized drug cartels will be ignored .
“ ( The measure ) does n’t target the problem of criminals growing , ” said Laura Hamburg , a spokesperson for a campaign against repeal .
Mendocino Sheriff Thomas Allman said local law enforcement officers seized 334,000 marijuana plants last year .
“ We ’re not trying to break last year ’s numbers , ” Allman told Reuters .
“ We are not targeting legitimate growers , just commercial marijuana . ”

Update : Sean clarifies :
It 's important to note , however , that this service does n't illustrate * first - hand * violence reports , as you state in the boingboing post …
It shows incidents reported in the media .
As the map site stipulates :
" The breaches shown on this map represent a small sample of those gathered during our Zimbabwe Election Watch ( ZEW ) project , which set out to monitor the Zimbabwean government 's compliance with the SADC Principles and Guidelines Governing Democratic Elections .
The breaches identified under ZEW are based on information derived from media sources .
It is very important that the map is viewed with this in mind .
Zimbabwe has a highly restricted media environment , and fuel shortages make remote rural areas inaccessible to journalists who do manage to circumvent the legislation and report regardless .
This means that urban areas have a greater representation on the map .
Blank areas on the map do not indicate ' uneventful ' areas ; they are more likely to represent stories we are unable to tell and incidents that have not been reported .
The map aims to give an impression of the scale and range of challenges facing Zimbabweans as we head towards the March 29th elections .
Even though this is based on a small sample of information we have logged since July 2007 , it clearly shows that conditions in the country are not conducive for a free and fair democractic elections . "

I did NOT , he came that way .
Jaleh A. , NOTHING beats an awkward ' n ' gangly baby llama with leetle leeps
Now that spring is here , lots of homeowners are thinking about ways to freshen up their home in 2019 .
If you have ideas for renovations , though , whether they ’re to help you sell your home more effectively or to make the space more appealing for yourself and your family , it ’s wise to be strategic so you do n’t waste money .
Remodels often end up costing thousands and thousands of dollars , and regularly go over budget .
This in turn can lead to more stress you really do n’t want .
Before you begin any renovation work on your home , then , it ’s important to do certain things to make the project go ahead smoothly and economically .
Here are five key steps to take .
Work Out Finances
Take the time to work out your finances in advance .
Rather than starting remodel work and then discovering , halfway through , that you ’ve spent more money than you can afford , it ’s best to get clear up front about how much you can budget for the work .
Once you know the final total amount you feel comfortable spending , work back from there to see how much you can afford to put into each part of the renovation ( such as materials , labor , legal fees , insurance , council permits etc. ) , and where you may need to make sacrifices to stay on budget .
If you think you ’ll need to get a loan for the work – perhaps a draw down on your mortgage or a separate personal loan – do this ASAP to be sure you will actually get access to the funds you require .
Put Together a Plan
Once you ’ve sorted finances , work on putting together a plan for the remodel work .
Plan out the entire project as much as you can in advance so that you are clear about which contractors you need to have on site , in what order , and when .
This may change a bit during the life of the project , but thinking about things in advance like this will help you to feel more in control , and less stressed .
Planning is also beneficial when it comes to keeping renovation work coming in to schedule , both with regards to workers and with the ordering and delivery of materials .
Investigate Which Changes will Add Value
Something else to do before you start remodeling work is to investigate which changes will really add value to your property .
You do n’t want to spend money on renovations only to find that the investment was n’t worthwhile because you ’ve made changes which are n’t of interest to potential buyers , whether now or later on down the track if you ’re not planning to sell anytime soon .
The fact is that different things will add value , and to differing levels , in every suburb .
This all depends on who the main buyers are and what they look for in the houses they buy .
For example , retiree couples will be after different features to young families or professional working couples .
Some people will be interested in pools or more bedrooms while other will be keen to have large gardens or office space .
Chat with real estate agents who specialize in your area to see what they find comes top of the list for buyers in the suburb .
You should also attend open homes and auctions and read recent sales data to get a feel for the prices houses sell for and what they include .
Select the Best Contractor(s )
To have your remodel work completed for a good price and to a top quality , select the best contractor (s ) for the work .
Research potential options ASAP so you give yourself the best chance of hiring the person at the top of your list ; the more notice you can give popular contractors the better .
Whether you ’re after an experienced Washington handyman or a licensed electrician in Las Vegas , or any other service in any other location , put together a shortlist of people who specialize in the kind of work you need done ; with the qualifications and experience to do the job ; who charge within your budget ; and who are available within the necessary timeframe .
Where possible ask friends , family members and colleagues for recommendations so you know you ’ll end up using someone reputable .
Consider Possible “ Hidden ” Costs
Lastly , consider possible “ hidden ” costs involved in your remodel work , too .
If you have n’t made allowances for a decent - sized buffer in your budget , you could end up in financial strife if additional costs make the final expenses blow out .
Try to think about things which could go wrong or which could be charged as extra fees by contractors , so that you ’re prepared if it happens .
For example , there are things like the discovery of termite damage , faulty wiring , leaking pipes , or asbestos which must be removed .
Once you ’ve followed the steps listed above you will be in a much better position to complete remodeling work efficiently and cost - effectively .
The time taken to complete these things now will save you not only time through the length of the renovation project , but also stress , money and energy .
Every few weeks Gordon Elliott drives 22 miles to the Hare and Hounds pub in Marple , Cheshire , collects a barrel of waste cooking oil from his stepdaughter and takes it back to his personal oil refinery in his garage in Leigh , near Bolton .
The retired construction site manager then decants the liquid into a machine and adds a few chemicals .
Twenty - four hours later the waste oil has been purified , filtered and refined and is ready to be used in one of his family 's two diesel cars .
Instead of paying £ 1.25 p a litre at the local supermarket , he has paid 15 p to make his own biodiesel .
He says he is saving nearly £ 100 a month - as well as 90 % of the greenhouse gases he would normally emit from driving .
The cars perform perfectly , the equipment will be paid for within a year and the pleasure of making his own fuel is intense .
" It 's the principle .
I do it for the environment and to spite the exchequer , " he said .
Elliott , 79 , is part of a cottage industry of people who have turned to making their own recycled " biodiesel " in response to the doubling of fuel prices in just over a year .
Companies making biodiesel " reactors " report booming sales and demand for cheaper diesel is outstripping anything they can produce .
" Our business has doubled in size in just the last six months , " said David Taylor of Ecotec Resources , the Lancashire company which sold Elliott his machine and which also makes 100,000 litres a year of recycled fuel .
" If you can collect your own oil it works out at about 15 p a litre .
Otherwise you can buy in your waste oil for about 30 p , so you are getting diesel for about 45 p .
That 's a big saving on the forecourt price . "
He is selling 15 - 20 biodiesel machines a week and has sold 800 in under a year to taxi firms , hauliers , restaurants and others .
DIY diesel is seen by many as the revenge of the little man on the government , oil companies and the authorities .
No one knows how many backroom refineries there are in Britain , but a government study suggested there were around 1,400 small scale plants producing a few thousand litres a year in 2005 / 6 .
Since then the price of diesel has more than doubled and the market for machines has risen .
People in the industry suggest there are 35 companies refining recycled oil commercially and perhaps 20,000 individuals making private arrangements to collect and process oil from local restaurants , chip shops and food manufacturers .
Since the law was relaxed to allow people to make 2,500 litres a year for their own use , most are working legally , but as the price of fuel rises inexorably , so criminal elements are moving in .
" There are wars going on in London to get the oil , " said Tom Lasica , who runs Pure Fuels , London 's largest refiner of vegetable oil .
" Spanish and German companies are moving in to buy up British used vegetable oil .
People are stealing it from each other and selling it abroad .
We heard that one fish and chip shop in Southend was broken into just to steal the waste oil . "
" A lot of people are making the diesel for new cars .
A year ago most people were putting it into old cars .
Now the quality of the oil is critical , " said Kym Leatt , a director of Envirogroup , which collects , refines and sells 7,500 litres a week in Kent .
" If we could produce five times as much biodiesel we could sell it just like that , " said Leatt .
" Demand has grown exponentially .
Every day we have two or three new businesses asking us .
Some companies are saving £ 25,000 a year .
Were selling it to hauliers , taxi firms , fleets of tipper trucks .
In the past it would either go down the drain or go to landfill .
This is true recycling . "
He is selling for 98 p a litre compared with £ 1.18 - £ 1.25 at the pumps .
" Demand is going through the roof .
We 're selling biodiesel machines to the average Joe , universities , schools , restaurants , taxi drivers , absolutely anyone , " said James Hygate , a director of GreenFuels .
" We 've noticed a surge of people driving company cars .
They are making their own and then claiming 45 p a mile from their firms .
" It 's a true grassroots industry .
The better quality oil is being taken at source by the small guys .
Home scale production is definitely growing fast .
Groups of farmers are beginning to grow the crops and make their own diesel . "
Demand is growing from institutions and local authorities .
The borough of Richmond is this week putting out a tender for a £ 3.5 m contract to run all its 300 council vehicles on recycled vegetable oil for the next three years .
The council says it could save nearly £ 100,000 and reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by several thousand tons .
Back in Marple , Elliott will this weekend be heading for the Hare and Hounds to pick up another barrel .
" Everyone wants it .
But if I have any left over I 'll give it to the lad , " he says .
I decide to rig a clothesline as an experiment .
My mother died many years ago and the idea of hanging laundry with my own daughter , Isabel , who is 13 and always busy at the computer , is oddly appealing .
I ’m also hoping to use less energy and to reduce our monthly electric bills which hit the absurdly high level of $ 1,120 last summer .
That simple decision to hang a clothesline , however , catapults me into the laundry underground .
Clotheslines are banned or restricted by many of the roughly 300,000 homeowners ’ associations that set rules for some 60 million people .
When I called to ask , our Rolling Hills Community Association told me that my laundry had to be completely hidden in an enclosure approved by its board of directors .
I briefly considered hanging our laundry in the front yard , just to see what would happen , but my family vetoed this idea .
Instead , I settled on stringing two lines in a corner of the backyard , a spot not visible to neighbors or officials .
I ’m supposed to submit a site plan of our property and a photograph of my laundry enclosure .
But I do n’t have an enclosure , unless the hedge qualifies .
Looking for fellow clothesline fans , I came across the Web site of Alexander Lee , a lawyer and 32 - year - old clothesline activist in Concord , N.H. In 1995 Mr. Lee founded Project Laundry List , a nonprofit organization , as a way to champion “ the right to dry . ”
His Web site , laundrylist.org , is an encyclopedia on the energy advantages of hanging laundry .

[ pagebreak : BlueFire to Break Ground ]
BlueFire Ethanol plans to break ground on its first commercial cellulosic - ethanol plant in the next few months .
The Irvine , Calif . - based company is in the final stages of obtaining building permits and expects to begin construction this quarter or the beginning of the third quarter , CEO Arnie Klann told Greentech Media .
In April , the company announced it had selected Brinderson as its contractor for the project .
The facility , which will be adjacent to a county landfill in Lancaster , Calif. , will have the capacity to produce 3.1 million gallons of ethanol from garden and wood waste and nonrecyclable paper , he said .
BlueFire expects to begin operations at the plant next year and to sell ethanol from the facility starting around June , he said .
It also hopes to double the plant ’s capacity in a few years as the amount of biomass coming to the new landfill grows , he said .
“ We ’re excited about the ability to take the materials that we as a society value the least and convert them into a value - added product , ” Klann said .
“ It helps us as a country reduce our imports from foreign oil and become more self - sufficient , and it benefits the communities that we ’re in , not only in terms of job creation , but because we ’re creating a cleaner - burning fuel that lowers the greenhouse gases . ”
Last year , BlueFire , which is traded over the counter under the ticker “ BFRE , ” won a $ 40 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy to develop a 19 - million - gallon - per - year plant at another landfill in Corona , Calif .
The company expects that second commercial facility to be up and running by 2010 ( it previously had announced an expected start - up date of 2009 ) .
The company expects that facility to convert about 700 tons of biomass into ethanol each day , while the Lancaster plant will consume about 175 tons per day .
Ethanol companies have faced some financial difficulty , as prices for corn has increased , and controversy as scientists have questioned biofuels ’ environmental impact , energy use and effect on land use and food .
Advocates hope that cellulosic ethanol -- which is made out of nonfood materials such as switchgrass , wood chips and corn cobs -- could help temper those concerns , reduce costs and make ethanol mainstream .
But the technologies have n’t yet lived up to their promise .
So far , cellulosic ethanol remains more costly to produce and manufacturing plants have n’t reached mass production .
The difficulty of economically harvesting and collecting enough cellulosic material to continuously run a large plant is another challenge , as most of the material is spread around instead of gathered into one place ( see Q&A : Harvesting Cellulosic Ethanol ) .
BlueFire plans to circumvent that difficulty by locating its plants at landfills that already separate out green waste such as tree and bush trimmings .
The company uses a “ concentrated acid hydrolysis ” process based on technology licensed from Arkenol , and says it has developed a number of its own improvements .
The technology has been tested in three pilot plants : one in Orange County that BlueFire operated for five years to develop its intellectual property , and two that the Japan Gas Co. built in Japan four years ago as part of a licensing agreement .
According to Klann , the company begins by grinding the waste down to a certain particle size .
BlueFire then combines the particles with sulfuric acid , which breaks down the biomass and releases the lignin structures , he said .
The lignin is screened out , using a sugar press , and burned to provide electricity back to the facility .
The acid is separated from the sugar ( and reused ) , and the sugar is converted into ethanol using a standard yeast - fermentation process .
The process delivers about 70 gallons of ethanol per ton of green waste , Klann said .
The company has designed modular plants so they can be produced in a factory and put together “ like an erector set , ” he said .
“ It ’s like doing a pre-fab home , only for a process plant . ”
The Lancaster design represents the smallest module that BlueFire expects to sell .
“ It ’s the smallest [ Blue Fire ] plant you can build that ’s actually economically viable , ” Klann said .
“ We designed it that size because that ’s the amount of feedstock that ’s available , and we see it as a standard design that we ’re going to deploy around the world in areas that are limited in terms of how much [ feedstock they can collect ] . ”
The company also plans to sell a 19 - million - gallon - per - year module , such as the one it is building in Corona , and has designed a 55 - million - gallon - per - year plant , he said .
And BlueFire expects even its smaller first plant to make money , he said .
[ pagebreak : BlueFire : Continued ]
Aside from selling ethanol , BlueFire plans to bring it revenue by selling carbon credits .
It expects even its smaller project to make money , Klann said .
The company plans to develop , own and operate its facilities – not a small goal in a market where financing can be hard to get – and plans to build about 50 plants in the next 10 years , he said .
It also aims to grow its revenue to between $ 4 billion and $ 5 billion by then , he said .
And BlueFire later hopes to expand into other feedstocks , including forest thinnings and crop residues , such as rice straw , corn stover and sugarcane bagasse , he said .
Nobody can accuse the company of aiming low .
But James McMillan , a manager at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory ’s National Bioenergy Center , said it does face some risks and potential challenges in reaching its lofty goals .
Because green waste is so diverse , BlueFire could find itself dealing with many different types of sugars , some of which might not get broken down as part of standard fermentation , he said .
The risk is that other organisms that eat those sugars could enter and contaminate the process , he said .
“ Not only will you decrease yield , but you may have another operational issue to deal with , ” he said .
The process also requires the fuel to be reconcentrated , in which water is evaporated out of the mixture , and that can use up a lot of energy , he said .
Wastewater treatment also could prove challenging , he said .
Finally , even though BlueFire expects the green waste to be separated out in advance , it could run into some logistical issues , McMillan said .
“ There would be some issues with construction debris – how do they deal with nails , metals and things like that ? ” he said .
“ The same thing with yard waste – what about rocks and dirt that might come along with it ?
There ’s a question about how much source separation is going on and how they screen , if they only can take a portion of [ the waste they get ] . ”
Still , he said , the news is good for BlueFire and for cellulosic ethanol .
“ It is a very robust approach and it ’s good to see it moving , ” McMillan said .
“ Los Angeles certainly has a lot of waste and with [ this approach ] , instead of just burying it all , you ’re tapping into it .
Organ donation is usually regarded as the ultimate in altruism .
But over the last few months , the reputation of the American system for gathering organs has been tarnished .
In the most dramatic story , an Oklahoma man recovered four hours after doctors had pronounced him " brain - dead " and were preparing to harvest his organs .
Zach Dunlap , 21 , sustained severe head injuries after a car accident last November .
Since he was a registered organ donor , his parents gave permission for his organs to be used .
No brain activity was evident on a PET scan .
Fortunately , relatives noticed small signs of life just as his tubes were being removed .
Despite a grim prognosis , he walked out of a rehabilitation unit .
Four months later he was well enough to appear on the NBC Today show in New York -- where he claimed that he heard the doctors pronouncing him dead .
A San Francisco transplant surgeon is also in the news , charged with illegally hastening the death of a prospective organ donor .
Dr Hootan Roozrokh , 34 , has been accused of using drugs to speed the death of Ruben Navarro , a 25 - year - old man with severe mental and physical disabilities .
The doctor 's surgical team was hoping to harvest his organs after cardiac death , but the man did not die as planned when his ventilator was removed .
This is the first time that a transplant surgeon has been charged in the US and his colleagues are worried that the case could hurt the case for organ donation .
Still worse was the revelation that the list of 98,000 Americans awaiting organ transplants -- a potent marketing tool for transplant doctors -- has been inflated by as much as one - third .
The Washington Post discovered that thousands of patients on the list are " inactive " .
That is , they could not be given an organ because they are too sick , or not sick enough , or for other reasons .
A nurse who used to serve on the board of directors of the United Network for Organ Sharing ( UNOS ) , Donna L. Luebke , told the Post that the list was " dishonest " .
" Part of the argument for the push to get more people to be donors , and for expanding the types of procedures that we do to get organs , is there 's all these people waiting for organs and dying in the meantime , " said Joan McGregor , a bioethicist at Arizona State University .
" If the number is not accurate , that 's giving people the false impression that the situation is more serious than it is .
It 's deceptive . "
The proportion of ineligible patients varies with the organ .
Only 26 % of heart - lung patients are inactive , compared to 69 % of those waiting for a pancreas .
One - third of kidney patients , the largest group , are inactive .
UNOS responded by noting that many patients are only inactive for short periods of time .
In any case , says the president - elect of UNOS , Robert Higgins , " Whether it 's 75,000 or 100,000 , there are still far more people who need transplants than can get them .
None of this changes the fact that there is a significant number of people who die waiting . "
However , the length of the list changes public perceptions .
Because there are so many , some doctors want to expand the pool of potential donors beyond live donors and brain - dead donors to donors after cardiac death , or donors who were HIV - positive or who had cancer or other health problems .
" The push for [ donation after cardiac death ] is based solely on the idea that we have a huge disparity of organs , " said Gail Van Norman , an anesthesiologist and bioethicist at the University of Washington .
" But if 30 percent of the names are the list are inactive , the data is n't a true reflection . "

Royal Marriage Proposals
The royal family has little use for last names - after all , everyone knows who they are .
Princess Diana did not take back her maiden name , Spencer , after her divorce ; she continued to be known simply as Diana .
The Queen signs official documents " Elizabeth R. "
The R stands for Regina , which means " queen . "
( Regina is not one of her given names ; she was baptised Elizabeth Alexandra Mary . )
But the royal family does have a last name , and they do use it from time to time .
This was n't always the case .
Queen Victoria 's husband , Prince Albert , was a member of the House of Saxe - Coburg - Gotha , so her descendants were part of that dynasty .
This , however , was not the family 's last name .
They did n't have one , because they did n't need one , so they did n't worry about it .
Experts later worried about it for them and decided their name was probably Witten ( or maybe even Wipper ) .
The royal family 's official name , or lack thereof , became a problem during World War I , when people began to mutter that Saxe - Coburg - Gotha sounded far too German .
King George V and his family needed a new , English - sounding name .
After considering everything from Plantagenet to Tudor - Stuart to simply England , the king and his advisors chose the name Windsor .
To this day , the British royal family is known as the House of Windsor .
When Princess Elizabeth ( the current queen ) served as a subaltern in the Auxiliary Territorial Service during World War II , she was called Elizabeth Windsor .
Elizabeth married Prince Philip of Greece , whose family name was Mountbatten , and eventually she decreed that most of her descendants would be called Mountbatten - Windsor .
Princess
Anne used this name in 1973 when she married Captain Mark Phillips .
However , according to statements made by the queen , it appears that Windsor is still the official family name for any British royal who is styled Royal Highness .
The queen 's youngest son , Prince Edward , the Earl of Wessex , has used the name Edward Windsor professionally .
His wife , the Countess of Wessex , has been known professionally as Sophie Wessex .
Previously , males took precedence over their older sisters in the line of succession .
The Succession to the Crown Act 2013 has given royal daughters the right to inherit the throne before their younger brothers .
The previous line of succession has not been altered , however , meaning that Queen Elizabeth 's younger sons , Prince Andrew and Prince Edward , ( and their children ) continue to rank ahead of their older sister , Princess Anne , in the line of succession .
The current order of succession
Prince Charles , the Prince of Wales
Prince William , Duke of Cambridge
Prince George of Cambridge
Princess Charlotte of Cambridge
Prince Louis of Cambridge
Prince Harry , Duke of Sussex
Archie Mountbatten - Windsor
Prince Andrew , Duke of York
Princess Beatrice of York
Princess Eugenie of York
Prince Edward , Earl of Wessex
James Windsor , Viscount Severn
Lady Louise Windsor
Princess Anne , the Princess Royal
Peter Phillips
Savannah Phillips
Isla Phillips
Zara Phillips
Mia Tindall
Lena Tindall
The 1701 Act of Settlement made it illegal for a Roman Catholic , or anyone married to a Roman Catholic , to inherit the throne .
The Succession to the Crown Act 2013 removed the disqualification for those who marry Roman Catholics , but Roman Catholics still cannot succeed to the throne .
The royal family uses , but does not own , Buckingham Palace , Kensington Palace , St James 's Palace , Hampton Court , Windsor Castle and other residences .
Balmoral and Sandringham are the queen 's personal property .

President George W. Bush and Democratic and Republican luminaries broke ground recently at the future gleaming home of the United States Institute of Peace on the National Mall .
After absorbing the speeches and , on the same day , the rather partisan Senate Intelligence Committee ’s report that concluded the Bush administration lied to the United States regarding its ill - fated invasion and occupation of Iraq , one needs to dig just a bit to see what a bipartisan policy of interventionism the United States really has .
The existence of bipartisan support for meddling in the business of other countries stands in stark contrast to the President ’s remarks , which stated that he feared the U.S. was becoming " isolationist and nervous . "
Despite attending the launch of a government - funded organization ostensibly dedicated to peace , former Republican Secretary of State George P. Shultz praised President Bush ’s policy of preventive war , saying , " In your time , I think this is one important idea that has real legs and staying power . "
But the international community has long dreaded such wars because threats are often invented or wildly exaggerated to justify questionable " preventive " aggression , as demonstrated by the Senate Intelligence Committee ’s findings about the inflated threats during the run up to the U.S. invasion of Iraq .
At the groundbreaking , Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) made an attempt to make us believe the two parties have opposing foreign policies .
Quoting Democratic President John F. Kennedy ’s 1963 words , " The United States , as the world knows , will never start a war , " was a veiled jab at the President ’s Iraq policy .
Of course , Pelosi did n’t mention that in 1961 , Kennedy himself orchestrated the botched CIA attempt to invade Cuba and overthrow Fidel Castro .
Later , in 1962 , he nearly initiated a nuclear world war for no strategic reason after the Soviets installed missiles in Cuba , a move intended to counter future U.S. invasions of the island .
The Senate Intelligence Committee ’s report on the Bush administration ’s misuse of intelligence  a Democratic project signed by two Republicans  correctly criticized the administration for fabricating a connection between Saddam Hussein and al - Qaeda .
Additionally , the government lied about the likelihood that Saddam would give weapons of mass destruction to anti-U.S. terrorists .
Finally , the administration falsely claimed that many such weapons were stored underground in Iraq and could not be destroyed by air attacks alone , implicitly suggesting the necessity of a ground invasion .
The report also rightly pinged the administration for failing to reveal greater skepticism by some members of the U.S. intelligence community regarding the claimed existence of Saddam ’s chemical arsenal and nuclear weapons program .
The alleged connection between al - Qaeda , an organization dedicated to attacking corrupt secular regimes in the Middle East , and Saddam , a corrupt secular dictator , was always far fetched .
Hussein ’s alleged willingness to transfer unconventional weapons to anti-U.S. terrorists was debunked by the U.S. intelligence community before the invasion and was made public at that time .
Finally , even in an absolute worst case scenario , if the Iraqi leader obtained a few nuclear weapons and long - range missiles to deliver them to the United States ( which no one believed he had ) , the U.S. could have deterred an attack with its massive nuclear arsenal , just as it did with the more radical Mao Tse- tung when he got nuclear weapons in the 1960s .
In short , no one bothered to ask what real threat Saddam posed to the United States  instead focusing on his much lesser threats to U.S. allies and vague notions of " U.S. interests " and " stability " in the Middle East .
The problem with the Democratic Intelligence Panel ’s critique is not its criticism of administration lying , which is if anything understated .
Partisanship arose when the report failed to mention that key Democrats , some of whom ran for president in the 2008 primaries , also made pre-war statements echoing the administration ’s line that Saddam ’s unconventional weapons were a threat to the United States .
Although it ’s true that the Bush administration instigated the flawed Iraq invasion and subsequent occupation , most Americans  politicians of both parties and the public  looked the other way as the administration marched the nation over the abyss .
Of all the many crimes of this administration , its success in blatantly lying the nation into war may have done the most to undermine the principles of the Republic .
Unfortunately , Nancy Pelosi and John F. Kennedy were wrong .
Especially in the post - Korean
War era , the United States has departed from the founding principles of the country , adopting a bipartisan militaristic foreign policy and starting and participating in many unneeded wars .
Thus , the real danger is not that the United States is becoming " isolationist and nervous " as the President frets , but in fact , quite the opposite .
Hillary ’s aides were grumbling last week that Obama had no rationale to offer but himself .
Perhaps that was true when he started .
People usually run for president because somebody tells them they should and then graft on the reasons afterward .
But on Thursday , Obama ’s vague optimism and smooth - jazz modernity came together in a spectacular fusion with the deep yearning of Democrats who have suffered through heartbreaking losses in the last two elections with uninspiring candidates .
Often unable to surf the electricity he sparked over the last year , Obama has now put on his laurel wreath and dropped his languid pose , tapping directly into what he calls the “ fire burning ” across the country  the dream of a cool , smart , elegant , reasonable , literary , witty , decent “ West Wing ” sort of president who wo n’t bankrupt us or endanger us or co-opt our rights or put a black hood on the Constitution .
“ I want to go before the world and say , America ’s back , ” he told cheering Democrats in Milford , N.H. , adding : “ We are one nation .
We are one people .
And our time for change has come . ”
Even though Obama was wooing the young demographic so coveted by Hollywood , he took a page from J.F.K. and avoided the casual look last week .
There were no jeans or snow boots .
Just dark suits , stylish ties and dress shoes .
By the time she got to New Hampshire , Hillary was reduced to urging voters not to buy into “ false hopes . ”
At a hangar in Nashua , with chatty Bill and chatless Chelsea , Hillary tried to purloin more of the Obama message .
Besides saying the word “ change ” as often as possible , she said she was particularly reaching out to young people to help them “ reclaim the future . ”
She claimed that she disliked the red state , blue state terminology 
“ We are one country , ” she said , echoing Obama  even as she added that she should be the nominee because she ’s the best one “ to withstand the Republican attack machine . ”
Ms Suu Kyi remains a focal point of opposition to Burma 's junta
The US Senate has voted to award Burmese pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi its highest honour - the Congressional Gold Medal .
The bill , which was approved by the House of Representatives last December , was passed unopposed in the Senate .
US - based Burma campaigners welcomed the move , saying the imprisoned opposition leader " richly deserves " the award .
Burma 's generals have held Ms Suu Kyi for more than 12 of the past 18 years , mostly under house arrest .
Her National League for Democracy ( NLD ) won polls in 1990 but the junta never handed over power .
' Courage and kindness ' Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein , who proposed the legislation with Republican Mitch McConnell , confirmed the bill 's approval .
AUNG SAN SUU KYI 1989 : Put under house arrest as Burma 's leaders declare martial law 1990 : National League for Democracy ( NLD ) wins general election ; military does not recognise the result 1991 : Wins Nobel Peace Prize 1995 : Released from house arrest , but movements restricted 2000 - 02 : Second period of house arrest May 2003 : Detained after clash between NLD and government forces Sep 2003 : Allowed home after medical treatment , but under effective house arrest " This Congressional Gold Medal is a tribute to Suu Kyi's courage and conviction , and a symbol of solidarity with the oppressed people of Burma , " she said .
Aung Din , of the US Campaign for Burma , said Burmese people would be proud that Ms Suu Kyi was being honoured in such a way .
" The Burmese military generals have tried to isolate Aung San Suu Kyi from her own people and from the international community by keeping her under house arrest for over 12 years , " he said .
" However , the generals , who control over 400,000 soldiers , are losing a battle with a single , unarmed woman .
Her only tools are courage and loving kindness . "
It was not clear when , or how , Ms Suu Kyi would be presented with the medal .
More than 300 individuals and groups have received the Congressional Gold Medal .
George Washington was awarded the first medal , which originally was given to military heroes but was later expanded to include prominent humanitarians , scientists , explorers , artists and others .
Non-American recipients of the medal include Winston Churchill , Pope John Paul II , Nelson Mandela , the Dalai Lama and Mother Theresa .

BOSTON — By now the Tale of Lilly Ledbetter is beginning to sound like the Perils of Pauline or the Pre-Feminist Follies .
At 70 years old , she ’s the star of a long - running drama about how hard we have to run to keep from slipping backward .
The Alabama woman was just 26 when Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed to enforce equality in the workplace .
The old stalwart — equal pay for equal work — is so universally accepted that we choose to believe it ’s not just a law but a fact of life .
Our gal Ledbetter , however , worked for two decades in the not - so - female - friendly ranks of Goodyear .
Only when she neared retirement did an anonymous tipster slip her a reality check about her paycheck .
It turned out that as a female supervisor , she was earning less than her male counterparts .
She was paid on average 79 cents for every male dollar , a figure suspiciously close to the national wage gap .
Ledbetter sued and won her case .
But Goodyear appealed all the way to the Supreme Court , where Samuel Alito had just replaced Sandra Day O’Connor .
Last year , in one of the backward flips that characterize the court , a 5 - 4 majority went against Ledbetter on the grounds that she had n’t sued in time .
The justices read the law through their retro lens and decided a worker has to sue within six months after her first unequal pay .
It does n’t matter whether she knows she ’s being treated unfairly and it does n’t matter if she keeps getting underpaid .
In essence , as Marcia Greenberger of the National Women ’s Law Center said , if a company could pull the wool over an employee ’s eyes for the first six months it ’s free .
An outraged Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg called the decision “ totally at odds with the robust protection against workplace discrimination . ”
She concluded her ringing dissent with an appeal to Congress to “ correct this court ’s parsimonious reading of Title VII . ”
Well , the House of Representatives did just that and pretty promptly .
They passed a bill to restore the rules to allow an employee to sue up to 180 days after the latest unequal paycheck .
But when the bill bearing Lilly Ledbetter ’s name got to the Senate , the Republicans balked .
There were n’t enough Republican defectors to overcome a filibuster and get the bill on the Senate floor .
Not only did Bush threaten to veto the restoration act , his would - be Republican successor did n’t even take time off the campaign trail to vote .
John McCain let it be known that he opposed the Ledbetter legislation because it “ opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems . ”
This is a little like saying we should n’t have any laws because they only clog up the courts .
So Lilly lost again .
Welcome to 2008 .
Or is it 1964 ?
If you ’ve been listening lately , the reasons for the tenacious wage gap between men and women in the 21st century have been dropped on the lap of working women .
Women are n’t paid equally because they have this nasty habit of giving birth .
Or they “ opt out . ”
Or they choose jobs that let them get home before the kids ’ bedtimes .
Or they do n’t know how to negotiate .
The fault is not in our workplaces but in ourselves that we are paycheck underlings .
The idea that the wage gap might be because of , um , sex discrimination seems soooo 20th century .
In fact , the Supreme Court implied that Lilly Ledbetter ’s lower paycheck was her own fault because she did n’t start investigating her employer for sex discrimination as soon as she started her job .
Today women are a mainstay of family income and often the whole income .
But an entire agenda of work and family issues is stalled while we ’re forced to protect — and sometimes lose — the gains won 44 years ago .
As for the conductor of the Straight Talk Express ?
McCain said he was all in favor of equal pay for equal work , but that women do n’t need lawsuits , they need “ education and training . ”
So let ’s begin with a couple of basics .
Lesson One :
An unequal paycheck is a thief that keeps on taking .
Even in retirement , Ledbetter is still , in her own words , “ a second - class worker ” with a pension and Social Security check that carry Goodyear ’s bite marks .
Lesson
Two :
In 2008 , the Republicans are partying — political partying — like it ’s 1964 .

India : BJP seizes on Jaipur bombing to promote communalism and social reaction
By Deepal Jayasekera
20 May 2008
India ’s official opposition , the Hindu supremacist Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) , has seized on the recent terrorist atrocity in Jaipur , the capital of the northwestern Indian state of Rajasthan , to promote anti-Muslim and anti-Bangladeshi prejudice and to press for a further strengthening of the repressive powers of the state .
At least 63 people , Hindus and Muslims alike , were killed and 200 injured by a series of bomb blasts that occurred in quick succession in Jaipur on the evening of Tuesday , May 13 .
The attack , which reportedly consisted of seven separate explosions — an eighth bomb failed to go off — was planned to produce a massive loss of life .
Bicycles laden with bombs were placed at locations where large numbers habitually congregate .
One blast occurred near a Hindu temple dedicated to the Hindu god Hanuman , and Tuesday is the traditional day of worship to him .
The coordinated bombings are India ’s deadliest terrorist attack since the July 2006 bombing of Mumbai commuter trains , which killed almost 200 people .
Whoever carried out the bombings , it was a criminal attack on innocent civilians designed to whip up communal animosity in India and embitter relations between India and Pakistan , which are set to resume their comprehensive ( peace ) dialogue this month .
The BJP state government of Rajasthan along with sections of the police - intelligence establishment and the press were quick to blame , without offering any tangible proof , the attack on a Bangladeshi - based Islamicist militia , the Harkat - ul - Jihadi Islami .
BJP leaders and sections of the press have harped on a police claim that a bicycle shop owner , to whom the police traced several of the bikes used in the attack , said that a group of young Bengali - speaking men had purchased them .
Bengali is the main language of both Bangladesh and the east Indian state of West Bengal .
Meanwhile , a little - known group that terms itself either the Indian Mujahedeen or Guru - al - Hindi has claimed responsibility for the Jaipur blast .
It has sought to substantiate its claim by e-mailing video - clips that purport to show one of the bicycles and a bag used in the bombing to two Delhi - based media organizations .
Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundara Raje has expressed skepticism about the authenticity of the video - clips .
But there are press reports that claim the police are now considering them genuine because the frame registration number of the bicycle in the video matches that on one of the mangled bicycle - bombs .
Raje , her government , and the national BJP are bent on using the alleged Bangladeshi connection to the Jaipur atrocity as a pretext for a foul communal campaign against Bangladeshi migrant workers .
Without presenting any evidence , K.L. Charuvedia , the BJP ’s publicity chief in Rajasthan , declared the blasts were “ the handiwork of Bangladesh immigrants living unlawfully in Jaipur as laborers . ”
Then last Friday Rajasthan ’s parliamentary affairs minister , Rajendra Rathod , told a press conference that the BJP state government is giving district collectors 30 days to compile comprehensive lists of Bangladeshis living “ illegally ” in the state , as a prelude to their deportation .
“ District authorities , ” said Rathod , “ have been issued orders to compile data on the Bangladeshis in their areas .
They have also been directed to initiate the process for retrieval of ration cards of those who have managed to get them [ and to ] cancel their names from the voters list . ”
Police have launched house - to - house searches in neighborhoods with large concentrations of Bangladeshi migrants .
Dozens have been taken into custody , but none has been charged , at least with anything connected to the Jaipur atrocity .
Declared police spokesman Jeewan Bishnoi , “ We must verify that every single person here is registered with us . ”
According to an Indian press report , eight Bangladeshi migrants were arrested last Friday in the city of Ajmer near a shrine to a famous Sufi ( Muslim ) saint “ after they were found moving under suspicious circumstances . ”
The report added that a police officer had said that “ the eight had come from Dhaka eight years ago and were working as servants . ”
Understandably , the Bangladeshi migrants , who are poor and denied citizenship rights in India , are scared .
Daulat Khan , a 60 year - old man who earns his living by picking up scraps and garbage , told reporters : “ We are a poor community .
We do n’t have the funds to orchestrate this kind of thing or the time .
. . .
They hassle us just because we are Muslims .
It ’s very wrong . ”
According to a BJP state government representative the number of Bangladeshis in Jaipur has grown substantially in recent years , rising from 2,500 in 2004 to more than 10,000 today .
The BJP has long complained about Bangladeshi migrants , claiming that there are as many as 20 million in India , and attacking the Congress Party , the dominant partner in India ’s ruling coalition , for being “ soft ” on Bangladeshi migration because it wants to court the Muslim vote .
The figure of 20 million Bangladeshis in India is a gross , communally - inspired exaggeration .
But undoubtedly millions have sought to escape poverty and communal and ethnic strife in Bangladesh by coming to India .
The 1947 communal partition of the subcontinent carried out by India ’s departing colonial overlords and the bourgeois Congress Party and Muslim League defied economic logic and the history of India , and has served only to perpetuate imperialist oppression and institutionalize communal conflict .
The BJP ’s claim that Bangladeshis living in India are “ foreigners ” is a communal slur , based on the championing of the 1947 communal partition .
But the entire Indian establishment endorses it .
Citing concerns about terrorism , India ’s government — with the enthusiastic support of the Left Front government of West Bengal — recently completed construction of a fence along the entire Indo - Bangladeshi border .
Whipping up anti-Bangladeshi prejudice and terrorizing Bangladeshi migrants is only one plank in the BJP ’s response to the Jaipur atrocity .
In the wake of last week ’s bombings , the BJP has amplified its denunciations of the Congress - led United Progressive Alliance ( UPA ) central government for “ failing ” to fight “ terrorism . ”
“ There is a complete failure of central intelligence and UPA policies in tackling terrorism , ” said BJP spokesman Prakash Javadekar .
“ The UPA government failed to treat terrorism as a national menace . ”
The BJP is now going to convene its national executive on May 31 in Jaipur , where , according to senior party leader M. Venkaiah Naidu , it will “ discuss the menace of terrorism faced by the country and decide the future course of action . ”
The BJP has never agreed to the UPA ’s decision to rescind a draconian anti-terrorism law that the BJP - led National Democratic Alliance government pushed through parliament in the wake of the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the US and the December 2001 attack on the Indian parliament buildings .
The Prevention of Terrorism Act ( POTA ) granted sweeping powers to the military and police to detain “ terrorist suspects ” for 30 days without producing them in courts , and for 90 days without formal charges .
Due to public opposition , the UPA government , which came to power in May 2004 , was forced to replace it in September 2004 with another law , which retained many of the repressive and arbitrary powers of POTA , thus making its repeal largely cosmetic .
But the BJP has repeatedly demanded the restoration of POTA and clearly hopes to use the issue in next year ’s general election as part of a double - pronged reactionary attack in which the Congress will be assailed for “ coddling ” Muslims and being soft on terrorism .
Demanding the UPA government revive POTA , BJP prime ministerial candidate L.K. Advani said : “ It ’s not about an anti-terror law alone .
It reflects the attitude of the government and the people ...
It is about the ability of the state to pre-empt such strikes . ”
The initial response of the UPA government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to the Jaipur bombing was cautious .
Singh made a statement condemning the attacks and asking the people to stay “ calm ” without blaming anyone .
Pointing the suspicious finger was left to the junior Home Minister Shriprakash Jaiswal , who declared , “ the people responsible for these attacks have foreign connections . ”
But not only did Jaiswal fail to provide any evidence , he refused to specify what country he was referring to when he used the term “ foreign . ”
When asked specifically at a news conference , Jaiswal said it could be any of the neighboring countries — Bangladesh , Pakistan , Nepal and Myanmar — that had been gripped by internal turmoil .
On May 18 , further adapting to BJP ’s barrage against his government , Prime Minister Singh called for the creation of a federal agency — an Indian FBI — to deal with “ terrorist ” crimes .
On the same day , India ’s chief justice K.G. Balakrishnan , addressing a seminar in New Delhi , demanded special new anti-terror laws .

Another company , the Science Applications International Corporation of San Diego , is one of the top five C.I.A. contractors and a particularly favored vendor of the National Security Agency , the book says .
Mr. Shorrock says that “ so many N.S.A. officials have gone to work for S.A.I.C. that intelligence insiders call it ‘ N.S.A. West .’ ”
Mr. Shorrock has a major concern with the sheer extent of intelligence outsourcing and whether it increases the potential for sensitive information to fall into the wrong hands .
Even the task of administering the government ’s database for tracking outside contracts , he says , has been outsourced to a private - sector contractor .
But the government has yet to identify which intelligence functions are safe to outsource and which are n’t , he says .
“ As a result , ” he writes , “ decisions about contracting are still being made on the fly with little regard to their short - and long - term consequences . ”
MUCH of Mr. Shorrock ’s terminology may seem to have a left - wing taste to it , but plenty of it comes directly from conservatives .
In fact , he says the term “ intelligence - industrial Complex ” was coined ( with a nod to Dwight D. Eisenhower ’s 1961 reference to the nation ’s “ military - industrial complex ” ) by Herbert A. Browne .
Mr. Browne is a retired vice admiral turned AT&T executive and a former executive director of the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association , an industry trade group .
“ The fact that we can have a professional intelligence organization outside of the government to support the government is no more offensive to me than the fact that we have 80 percent of our military communications traveling on commercial satellites or commercial fiber optics , ” Mr. Browne tells the author .
“ In fact , I find it very healthy for the nation . ”
Mr. Shorrock unequivocally believes otherwise .
“ In the end , if America is to reform its intelligence apparatus , decisions about resources and structure must be made by its citizens through the government they elected  not by outside contractors like Booz Allen Hamilton and S.A.I.C. , ” he writes .
“ The spies for hire may not like the idea of subjecting the intelligence process to more oversight , but they ’re not the ones paying the bill .
It ’s high time that we returned intelligence to its rightful owners , the American public and its representatives in Congress . ”
Meanwhile , it appears that there ’s no business like the spy business , and the spy business is nobody ’s business but its own .
BOZEMAN , Mont . 
The long , lonely howl of a wolf shatters the early morning stillness .
But is it real ?
Beginning this June , it might be hard to tell , even for the wolves .
One of the most famous sounds in nature is going digital .
Under a research project at the University of Montana in Missoula , scientists are betting that the famous call - and - response among wolves can be used to count and keep track of the animals .
Tricked by technology , scientists say , wolves will answer what amounts to a roll call triggered by a remotely placed speaker - recorder system called Howlbox .
Howlbox howls , and the wolves howl back .
Spectrogram technology then allows analysis that the human ear could never achieve  how many wolves have responded , and which wolves they are .
Image A prototype of a Howlbox , technology being developed to elicit and identify howls from wolves .

“ With audio software , we ’ll be able to identify each wolf on a different frequency , so we can count wolves individually , kind of like a fingerprint , ” said David Ausband , a research associate at the University of Montana Cooperative Wildlife Research Unit , where Howlbox was developed .
Poor water quality is already hitting GDP , the World Bank says Governments in the Middle East and North Africa need to invest now if they want to avoid severe water shortages in the future , the World Bank has warned .
The amount of water available per person in the arid region will halve by 2050 , a report from the bank estimates .
It blames climate change and population growth for new pressures on supplies .
Governments in the region should tackle water waste , build more efficient networks and reduce water use , the World Bank says .
Farming challenge
The bank 's report suggests agriculture is a key target area .
With 85 % of water - use devoted to agriculture , the report suggests countries such as Morocco will have to cut back on irrigation and switch to crops that require less water but earn more money .
If we plan for the future , it 's a lot simpler than crisis management further down the line
Julia Bucknall ,
World Bank According to its figures , declining water quality has already knocked around 1 % off gross domestic product in Morocco , Algeria and Egypt , and nearly 3 % in Iran .
" We 've simply got to reduce the amount of water used , especially in agriculture , " said Julia Bucknall , natural resource management specialist at the World Bank , addressing reporters Rabat , Morocco .
She added that water firms needed to cut water lost by evaporation .
" If we plan for the future , it 's a lot simpler than crisis management further down the line , " said Ms Bucknall .
Governments must increase public education projects on water and develop new infrastructure projects , including desalination plants , the bank 's report says .
Bank officials identified Tunisia and Jordan as being strong performers in managing water demand and making the most of available water resources .
Morocco has invested in dams to catch water but in farming regions around Agadir , the water table is seven times lower than in 1982 .
The BBC's James Copnall in Rabat says North African and Middle Eastern countries have had years of experience in coping with water shortages , but the challenge , it seems , is about to get much harder .

Multiplayer missions provide unexpected and seemingly endless ways to experience Liberty City .
Rockstar Games Liberty
City has always been a strangely lonely place .
Sure , there have always been plenty of virtual citizens in the various Grand Theft Auto cities crafted for consoles by Rockstar Games .
You were constantly running into caustic gangsters , cynical cops and old folks with walkers who dove out of the way when you rolled up on the sidewalk .
But there were never any other real people there – no live humans .
In meatspace terms , when you played GTA on a console , you played alone .
It was always a single - player game : no multiplayer mode , and not even an option to engage in co-op thuggery alongside a friend .
When you think about it , this is superweird .
The first GTA debuted in 2001 , right around the time that games were moving aggressively online .
We were constantly told that artificial - intelligence characters were too stilted – that the only way to have realistic , unpredictable play was to let gamers engage with other folks online .
Hey , Halo proved that online play could extend the shelf life of a console game for , like , 19 years or something , right ?
Yet GTA remained stubbornly , even defiantly , single - player .
It was as if the Rockstar designers were so proud of their painstakingly crafted metropolises that they did n't want any other messy , mostly - big - bags - of - water humans in there screwing things up .
Until GTA IV arrived – and Liberty City went online .
So I duly logged in , wondering , What the heck is this going to be like ?
Do I need other people in here ?
Do I want other people in here ?
It turns out that I do , and I do .
For my first game , I headed into Hangman 's Noose mode , where you team up with other players to accomplish a mission – in this case , meeting up with a crime boss at the airport and keeping the cops away from him .
It felt like being in a Twilight Zone version of Grand Theft Auto .
Everything was the same , but ... different .
Much as aficionados of multiplayer gaming would have predicted , my teammates pulled off some hilariously unexpected moves :
They 'd drive in more spastic or more cunningly accurate patterns than I 'd ever seen – or attempted – inside the game ; they 'd perform seemingly kamikaze moves with an AK - 47 that the artificial intelligence would never have dared .
Better yet , multiplayer missions give you some subtle yet fascinating new ways to experience the city .
At one point , two partners and I piled into a Ferrari while another of my teammates raced across the city .
Since I did n't have to drive , I was able to enjoy some sightseeing – zooming my camera around to different , Hollywood - like angles – that was never possible when I was the one steering .
The sheer scale of Liberty City makes for online console play that 's far more open - ended than anything I 'd ever before seen .
Most console multiplayer gaming takes place on fairly small maps .
But with the mission modes of GTA IV , you 're given a really big chunk of sandbox to play in , so there are seemingly zillions of different ways your teammates can accomplish a mission .
This leads to some quite funny incidents .
During one mission , one of my partners and I arrived at a waterfront checkpoint – him in a battered van , me in a sports car .
We got out of our vehicles wondering , Hey , where 's the third member of our team ?
So we stood around for two or three minutes , puzzled , admiring the morning sunshine .
Suddenly , off in the distance , we saw a car racing toward us .
It was a cop car – and it was on fire .
Our third team member emerged triumphantly .
I 'm still wondering what the hell happened to him .
There are 15 different modes of online play , most of which are pretty good .
One clear winner is GTA Race , which blends car racing with combat :
You can assault one another 's vehicles , and even carjack one another .
The result is exquisite madness , with drivers jumping out of wrecked compact cars and in 18 - wheel trucks , then tearing off down crowded sidewalks while followed by lowriders hurling Molotov cocktails .
If , like me , you 're a subpar driver , you can simply abandon the goal and become a machine of revenge – setting up a roadblock , waiting for other drivers to approach , then blasting them to pieces .
This is food for the soul .
Other modes , however , are more of a letdown .
I found the death - match games underwhelming , in part because GTA 's targeting system is n't very fluid , but also because the maps were n't well designed .
They possess few of the nooks and crannies you get in a great Call of Duty or Halo map .
Overall , though , GTA IV will make you glad that Rockstar finally let other people into Grand Theft Auto 's world .
This city 's big enough for the both of us .

Last Sunday , on " Live from the Left Coast " on KPFK in Los Angeles , Ian Masters had on James Moore the co-author of " Bush 's Brain : How Karl Rove Made George W. Bush Presidential " and , more recently , " The Architect : Karl Rove and the Dream of Absolute Power . "
I decided to call up and draw out the connections among the allegations made in Philip Shenon 's book " The Commission , " and the follow up by Philly 9 - 11 Truth ( see : Karl Rove Is Questioned About His Involvement With the 9/11 Commission by Philly 9/11 Truth )
The show recording is here : http://www.ianmasters.org/left_coast.html -under March 30th , 2008 - My question is at the 41:10 mark .
Me : " ... I think that this is a very crucial sort - of connection for Karl Rove , because that Commission was highly manipulated and , if it was manipulated and it was a cover - up , then , under Article III Section 3 of the Constitution , I think we can consider it a treasonous cover - up . "
James Moore : " I do n't have any doubt that Karl was running the 9 - 11 Commission .
And , obviously , the people who were the key people on that , Jeremy , were appointed by the Bush administration , were beholden to the Bush administration , obviously there were some Democrats on there .
But the people in charge , the people who were issuing and writing the reports and saying " let 's look at this evidence and let 's not look at this evidence , " were people who reported to Karl . "
Another caller , at about 50:15 , asks : " To the degree , as was pointed out , the 9 - 11 Commission was basically answering to Karl Rove , does n't that , again , cause us to want to look more deeply at what the hell were they covering up ? "
Moore responds : " Well it certainly should .
I want to know .
You know , I do n't buy into the conspiracy theories obviously and I do n't think most folks do .
But the more the 9 - 11 Commission covers up and redacts information about Saudi Arabia and the money for these terrorist groups and saying it 's going to harm our relationship with an important ally , the more that the 9 - 11 Commission covers up , just as the more people the Warren Commission failed to interview in the Kennedy assassination , the more it gives life to conspiracy theory and urban myth .
And ultimately the truth can come up and whack us upside the head and we do n't believe it anymore .
So , you know the 9 - 11 Commission is doing America a great disservice .
If there is anything that has sustained our democracy , it 's been the fact that we hang our dirty laundry out in the air for everybody to see and then we decide that it 's dirty and we go clean it .
And we 're not doing that in this process . "
Then Ian Masters says : " Well it 's a no - brainer to say that the 9 - 11 Commission failed .
I think everybody knows that And including the two heads of the 9 - 11 Commission - they came out subsequent to its publication and said " we were lied to by the Department of Defense and by the FAA " and that the full story 's not being told .
So , I mean to take that obvious point and then to turn that into that it was , you know , all that other stuff they talk about is just surreal . "
What is really surreal that these two supposed intellectuals , who have probably not even looked at the full array of facts about the most crucial event of the 21st century , cling to their state - sponsored myth about OBL + KSM+19 while breezily admitting the true story is being covered up , potentially in a treasonous manner .
What then do you think IS being covered up Mr. Masters ?
Incompetence ?
Pakistani funding of the hijackers ?
Is that why the two Israeli operatives caught at the Mexican Parliament with Glock 9 mm's , grenades and other explosives , had Pakistani passports .
Silly Pakistanis , imitating Israelis again while attempting to frame themselves .
Again , see :
Speaking with Michael Medved about 10 /10 , 9/11 and the Involvement of the Deep Israeli State
and
Medved hypocritically blind to Israeli false - flag terrorism : Says 10 - 10 - 01 terror attempt is " bogus story , " " never happened "
I 'm starting to get tired of pussyfooting around the question of cover - up and new investigations .
I 'm going to start laying it out as I see it with facts that back it up .
To me , it looks like 9 - 11 was a false - flag psyop sponsored by treasonous criminals in the US government , operationally conducted by Israeli covert operatives .
And I 'm going to just start saying it and seeing how people react on the radio and in some truthsquads .
Obviously , Mr. Masters , and most of his guests , still need schooling on the facts of 9 - 11 - you know , those stubborn things .
It is usually a pretty good show that Masters hosts on Sunday morning on KPFK ( www.kpfk.org ) from 11 am - 1 pm PST ( 818-985-5735 ) .
He ordinarily takes calls towards the last half of the second hour " Live from the Left Coast . "
Remind him that , as Aldous Huxley remarked , " facts do n't cease to exist because they are ignored . "
You can also go hear the rest of the taped dialogue with Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson , played on last week 's show , where I was able finally , after Masters interrupted me , to ask him this question about supporting a new 9 - 11 Commission :
Interestingly , and I 'm no conspiracy theorist you know , my question was one of two that were unluckily cut out because of sound problems .
Honestly though , I heard the recording beginning to skip .
Listen to the end where Wilkerson identifies 6 people who he thinks can be prosecuted , including John Yoo , David Addington and Douglas Feith .
Interesting that he completely leaves out the P and VP .
Treason , as I have said before , is so like whatever these days in DC huh ?!

2 ) Until such time as independent and unbiased study into the " real world " safety implications of Tasers has been properly completed , a moratorium must be imposed upon these weapons .
3 ) If , after independent and unbiased study has been completed , the Taser is going to remain in the police arsenal , it must be placed at a level equal to lethal force on the continuum of force and used only as a second - to - last resort .
4 ) Safety standards must be developed for Tasers .
There are currently no Canadian safety standards in place for this weapon .

Santa Monica has delivered a bright and shiny upgrade to its Pacific Ferris
Wheel , dismantling the old one to make way for a new behemoth that boasts 160,000 LED lights .
The 90 - foot ride , manufactured by Chance Morgan Rides , delivers visual performances every night and cost the city $ 1.5 million .
Thanks to solar panels that soak up energy during the day to power the wheel , those extravagant light shows have a minuscule carbon footprint .

When it was built in 1996 , the Pacific Wheel was the only solar powered ferris wheel in the world .
The old wheel was auctioned off on eBay for over $ 130,000 to an Oklahoma City real - estate developer .
Grant Humphreys , the developer , plans on incorporating the wheel into a mixed use residential community .
It has appeared in several Hollywood films , including A Night at the Roxbury and Thank You for Smoking .
There 's no doubt that its younger and more attractive replacement will probably get some screen time as well .

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice backed Iraq ’s crackdown on militias in a visit on Sunday to Baghdad , where the worst fighting in weeks killed 23 after Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr threatened all - out war .
Rockets blasted the fortified Green Zone compound where Rice met Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki and other officials and praised their month - old campaign against Sadr ’s followers .
She had harsh words for the reclusive cleric , who on the eve of Rice ’s visit vowed “ open war ” if the crackdown continues .
Sadr has not appeared in public in Iraq in nearly a year .
“ He is still living in Iran .
I guess it ’s all out war for anybody but him , ” Rice told reporters .
“ His followers can go to their death and he will still be in Iran . ”
Sadr ’s reply came in a statement sent to reporters , condemning Rice ’s visit and saying the government should not admit such “ occupier terrorists into our pure land ” .
The U.S. military described a night of gunbattles and helicopter missile strikes that killed 23 fighters in east Baghdad ’s Sadr City slum and other militia strongholds .
“ I would say it ’s been the hottest night in a couple of weeks , ” spokesman Lieutenant - Colonel Steven Stover said .
Rice said she supported what she called a new political “ centre ” that has backed Maliki ’s anti-militia campaign .
“ It is indeed a moment of opportunity in Iraq thanks to the courageous decisions taken by the prime minister and a unified Iraqi leadership , ” Rice said in brief televised remarks with President Jalal Talabani after they held talks .
A rebellion by Sadr ’s Mehdi Army militia -- whose tens of thousands of black - masked fighters control the streets in many Shi’ite areas -- could abruptly end a period of lower violence at a time when some U.S. forces are starting to leave Iraq .
Mehdi Army fighters , who have bristled at past truces , could barely hide their glee at the prospect of open conflict .
“ We are very happy and eager .
We are waiting for the end of the ceasefire , ” a street commander in Sadr City who goes by the name Abu Hassan told Reuters .
Ordinary residents of the slum say they have been living in constant terror for weeks as nightly battles between Sadr fighters and U.S. and Iraqi forces killed and wounded hundreds .

“ The bombing and shooting , it reminds me of the 1991 Gulf War , ” said student Bashar Mehdi .
“ I saw a man with his daughter get shot by a sniper .
The man was killed and we had to carry the daughter to the hospital . ”
Rice told reporters she did not know how seriously to take Sadr ’s threat of war , released in a statement on his website .
Sadr ’s threat dramatically raises the stakes in his confrontation with Maliki , who has threatened to ban Sadr ’s movement from political life unless he disbands his militia .

ROCKETS HIT GREEN ZONE
Maliki ’s crackdown has led over the past month to Iraq ’s worst fighting in nearly a year , spreading through the south and Shi’ite parts of Baghdad .
Although fighting in the south has mainly died down , the Baghdad clashes have continued unabated .
Maliki ’s crackdown has been backed by parties across Iraq ’s sectarian and ethnic divide apart from the Sadrists themselves .
Rice said this support signaled a “ coalescing of a centre in Iraqi politics ” that was working together better than ever .
As Rice met Maliki and other ministers , rockets could be heard hitting the Green Zone government and diplomatic compound where the prime minister has his office .
Rice left the meeting about five minutes after an all - clear signal was given .
Washington says the rockets are fired from Sadr City by rogue elements of the Mehdi Army that it says are armed , trained and funded by Iran .
Tehran denies responsibility .
Maliki ’s initial operation last month in the southern city of Basra went poorly , and U.S. commanders have acknowledged it was carried out hastily and badly planned .
Since then , however , the government forces have moved more carefully into Basra , and on Saturday they took control of the neighborhood that had been the Mehdi Army ’s main stronghold .
Sadr has pivoted back and forth between armed confrontation and peaceful politics throughout the five years since the U.S. - led invasion , while remaining hugely popular and staunchly hostile to the American presence .
He led two anti-American uprisings in 2004 , but joined the political bloc that won parliamentary elections in 2005 and installed Maliki .
Last year his followers quit the government for failing to demand an American withdrawal , but then Sadr abruptly declared a ceasefire , winning Washington ’s praise .
As his stance has changed , so has the response of American leaders .
In 2004 they issued a warrant for his arrest , but more recently they praised his ceasefire and started referring to him with the respectful Arabic honorific “ Sayyed ” .

A woman of 57 with suspected ovarian cancer was in fact expecting her first baby .
Susan Tollefsen feared the worst when she was sent to hospital for a scan on her growing bump .
But the sonographer told her : " Congratulations , you 're almost 30 weeks pregnant . "
She will become one of Britain 's oldest mothers when she has a caesarean section next week .
The remarkable story , which she describes as an Easter miracle , follows - several years of attempts to have a baby by IVF treatment at foreign clinics .

Susan Tollefsen and partner Nick Mayer are both excited and nervous about ' their miracle pregnancy '
The special needs teacher and her partner Nick Mayer , who is 11 years her junior , thought their final hope had been dashed last August when she suffered what appeared to be a miscarriage .
Yesterday they told the Mail their remarkable story as MS Tollefsen describes the baby girl she is due to have this Easter as a " miracle " .
Not only is she about to become a first - time mother at the age of 57 , but she found out she was pregnant just eight weeks ago .
Referred to hospital as an emergency after a physical examination by a private GP had revealed a " hard abdominal mass " , she had been bracing herself for the worst .
Clutching a paper with the suspected diagnosis " Ovarian Cancer ? ??? ? " on it , she burst into tears as she waited for a scan .
" I was lying on the examination table thinking , ' I 'm going to die ' when the sonographer turned round to me and said ' Congratulations ' , " says Susan .
" My initial reaction was to think , ' What a terrible way to tell me I 've got ovarian cancer ' .
When he then said , ' You 're pregnant ' I was literally speechless .
" I still could n't believe it when he showed me the screen and said , ' Here 's the head , here are the arms and here are the legs ' .
I was even more shocked when they told me I was almost 30 weeks gone . "
The astonishing news was given to her at the private Nuffield Hospital in Brentwood , Essex .
Susan adds : " While I 'd been waiting for the scan I 'd phoned Nick at work in tears and said , ' You 'd better get over here , they think I 've got ovarian cancer ' .
" When he arrived after the scan I had to say to him , ' Sit down while I make you a coffee .
You are going to need it .
I 'm pregnant . '
" First he was stunned and then he burst into tears .
He was thrilled .
It was the very last thing we'd both been expecting . "
The pregnancy , confirmed on January 24 , is the result of Susan and Nick 's third and last attempt to become parents through IVF treatment using donor eggs .
When Susan started haemorrhaging within four weeks of two fertilised embryos being implanted at a Russian fertility clinic , she went to her GP who , she says , told her she had miscarried .
A blood test and a home pregnancy test appeared to confirm this by showing negative .
Although she carried on bleeding heavily - which eventually led her to believe she was seriously ill rather than pregnant - she now believes she miscarried one of twins while the other managed to survive .
Today , the couple 's home in Romford is filled with baby paraphernalia and an air of nervous excitement as they count off the last few days to next week 's elective caesarean which will bring their daughter - already named Freya - into the world .
There are , of course , the obvious concerns about Susan becoming a mother at such an advanced age but the couple 's greater worry is for Freya 's health , given the problematic pregnancy .
" We are terribly excited about having our first baby but also very nervous about whether she will be all right , " says Susan , who has worked in education since 1975 , first as a special - needs teacher and then as an adviser on behavioural issues .
" All the scans have shown that she is developing normally but we wo n't know for sure until she is born .
" In the first few months of the pregnancy we went through some very stressful times .
Our house flooded and the ceilings fell down , so there was a lot of heavy physical work .
" I was eating whatever I wanted and taking strong painkillers for my bad back .
" I was prescribed antibiotics when I went down with a chest infection and also progesterone , because I was bleeding heavily and the doctor thought it would correct over - production of oestrogen caused by the IVF treatment .
" So of course when I found out I was pregnant my first thought was , ' Is the baby going to be OK ? '
" When I asked the doctors what would happen if there was something seriously wrong with her , I was told , ' Well it 's too late now .
You are 30 weeks pregnant .
You 'll have to go through the birth and then decide if you want her adopted if she is disabled . '
" That is a very frightening thing to be told and I was particularly worried by the prescription drugs I 'd taken during the early months .
" But the doctors did n't seem too worried and we are just hoping the scans , which indicate she is normal , are right .
" Nature never ceases to amaze me .
I 'm astounded that Freya survived all the things that were happening in my life .
It must have been meant to be . "
London - born Susan , daughter of an English mother and Norwegian father , says she always dreamed of having children but circumstances conspired against it .
Her four - year marriage to Bruno , an Italian restaurateur , ended in divorce in 1984 before they had even had a chance to think about children .
She claims he left her for a 17 - year - old girl who worked in their restaurant as a kitchen assistant .
She retreated devastated to her parents ' home , thinking she would never meet anyone else .
Her father Sigurdavind and mother Gladys both suffered failing health and she became their carers .
Her father died in 1986 after a two - year battle with liver cancer and her mother in 2002 , having suffered for years with emphysema and osteoporosis .
By this time Susan and Nick were together , having met on a blind date in 1998 .
It was only after her mother died that Susan 's thoughts turned to children .
This was something she had discussed with Nick soon after they met but then it had been nothing more than a wistful longing .
Now , it became a yearning .
" When Nick and I first met we both thought , ' How sad that we met at the wrong time . '
I was 47 , 11 years older than him , and I thought it would be impossible for me to have children at my age , but the reality was my mother needed a lot of care and I could n't have coped with looking after her and a baby .
" I remember once when we went on holiday together to the Maldives , there was a couple staying at our hotel who had a little girl running around with them .
" They looked such a happy family and I said to Nick , ' Would n't it be nice if we could have had a child together ? ' . "
After her mother died , Susan started to wonder if motherhood might still be a possibility through IVF , using donor eggs .
Nick was as keen as she was to investigate further .
There is no absolute age limit for IVF in Britain , but the NHS will not fund it for women over 40 .
In practice most private fertility clinics in the UK will not treat women over 50 - the average age of the menopause when they stop producing eggs .
In 2006 , Patricia Rashbrook became Britain 's oldest mother at the age of 62 through fertility treatment in Russia - after being rejected for IVF in Britain .
And in January last year following fertility treatment , 67 - year - old Romanian Adriana Iliescu became the world 's oldest mother after giving birth to twin girls , one of whom survived .
Susan continues : " I contacted fertility clinics in Britain but all of them refused to treat me because of my age .
But there are no such age limits in some foreign clinics .
" We did spend a lot of time talking it through .
I felt incredibly healthy and people say I look and act younger than my age , so I felt sure I could cope .
" I have spent my whole life working with children , so I felt very comfortable about my ability to be a good mother .
" Two relatives of mine in Norway had children in their late 40s and I could see that other women of my age had successfully given birth .
" Also I knew that , even if something happened to me , Nick being 11 years younger would be around for any child of ours and I had a lot of support from my family , offering to help in the worst - case scenario .
" People ask , ' How will you cope with the broken nights at your age ? '.
But for 20 years I cared for my parents , which often involved getting up in the night to help them .
Broken nights do n't worry me at all .
" All my friends and colleagues have been so supportive , although when I first told one of them I was met with complete silence because she had dropped the phone . "
Susan and Nick travelled to Russia , then Poland , then back to Russia , spending a total of £ 15,000 on fertility treatment .
They had decided that their third attempt would be their last , and should it fail they would simply get on with their lives .
" Four weeks after the embryos were implanted last July I was convinced I had miscarried , " says Susan .
" I was bleeding heavily and all the tests came back negative .
When I carried on bleeding my GP referred me to a gynaecologist , who said all the signs were I 'd miscarried and that the bleeding might be corrected by taking progesterone .
" But as the weeks went on I started to feel more and more ill .
I was still bleeding and felt incredibly tired all the time .
" When I walked up the stairs I felt breathless and one day I stayed in bed sleeping from 9 am to 4 pm which just was n't like me at all .
" I never suffered from any morning sickness , but I went off my food and I lost a stone and a half in a matter of weeks even though my stomach was swollen .
" Looking back it 's easy to see why , but I 'd never been pregnant before so I did n't know what it was supposed to feel like .
And do n't forget I 'd been told I 'd miscarried . "
One day in January Susan felt so ill she rang her GP .
Unable to get an NHS appointment for five weeks , because they were so busy , she booked an appointment with a private GP .
Convinced she was seriously ill , she did not even tell him she had undergone IVF because she was convinced she had miscarried .
" When he examined me he said , ' You definitely have a hard abdominal mass ' but because of my age and because I had n't told him I 'd had IVF , he was worried it could be ovarian cancer and immediately referred me to the Nuffield .
I was absolutely terrified .
" They call ovarian cancer the silent killer because often there are no symptoms , but I had a large swelling and was bleeding so I was convinced that not only did I have it , but that it was so advanced that there would be nothing they could do for me . "
Nick , a warehouse manager at the Lakeside shopping centre , was at work when Susan called him with the devastating news .
" I simply said to my staff ' I 've got to go ' and leapt in the car , " he recalls .
" It was the longest journey of my life and I was terrified for Susan .
The last thing I was expecting her to say when I arrived was that she was pregnant . "
Susan adds : " When my private GP found out the real reason for the abdominal mass , he wrote a letter to my gynaecologist , who said the next time I saw him , ' I do n't know how I missed that ! '
I still feel a bit angry that I was n't physically examined or given a scan sooner , even though the pregnancy test was negative . "
Since then Susan has been closely monitored , undergoing scans every couple of weeks to make sure Freya has been meeting her growth targets .
It still all feels rather surreal , she says .
" Most women have nine months of pregnancy to adjust to the prospect of motherhood , but I 've had six weeks .
When I turned up for my first ante-natal class the receptionist joked , " You are a bit late - you should have been here months ago " .
" I am very much aware that I am the oldest person in the antenatal classes , but I am very upfront and honest about it .
" When other women ask me how many children I have , I say , ' This is the first and , before you ask , I 'm 57 . '
" I just feel incredibly excited .
I know that when Freya is ten I 'll be 67 and I do wonder how she will feel about that , but we 'll have to cross that bridge when we come to it .
" Besides , I think there are advantages to being an older mother .
You are more patient , wiser and having worked with them all my life , I have experience of children which means motherhood wo n't come as such a shock .
" All I want as a mother is for Freya to grow up with lots of love , just like I grew up loved by my own parents .
" I want to encourage her to do as well as she can do , to be happy and healthy and to grow up with the right moral values .
" I remember my mother once saying to me when I was about 45 , ' You know , Susan , you have some lovely things to leave your children ' .
" I said , ' Hang on , I have n't even met anyone yet and I 'm probably already too old ' .
" Until I met Nick I really thought I would end up on my own .
" I still can't quite believe it is all happening .
To become a mother at my age and have the family I always wanted is , for me , a complete miracle . "

WHAT could the sex lives of algae have to do with finding a vaccine for malaria and other parasitic diseases ?
Quite a lot , it seems , because pond algae and the mosquito - borne Plasmodium parasite that causes malaria turn out to use the same protein to fuse their male and female gametes during sexual reproduction .
William Snell at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas and colleagues discovered that gamete fusion in an alga called Chlamydomonas requires a protein called HAP2 .
Plasmodium also carries the HAP2 gene so Snell teamed up with malaria specialists at Imperial College London to …
The story of how Felix Dadaev came to be Stalin 's body double is somewhat similar to the plotline of the movie " Dave , " except set in Soviet Russia and with a larger dose of paranoia .
According to the Daily Mail Felix Dadaev , a dancer and juggler who , amid the desperate defence against Hitler 's invading armies , was ordered to the Kremlin to work as Stalin 's body double .
For more than half a century , Dadaev remained silent , fearing a death sentence should he dare to open his mouth .
But at the age of 88 , and with the apparent approval of the Putin regime , he has finally come forward to tell a quite remarkable story .
It takes him from the ruined streets of Grozny all the way to Yalta on the Black Sea coast for the historic three - powers showdown , where Stalin , Churchill and Roosevelt fought to determine the shape of post - war Europe .
Dadaev 's new autobiography explains that he was one of four men employed to impersonate the supreme leader , taking his place in motorcades , at rallies , on newsreel footage and wherever – as at Yalta – Stalin feared he was in particular danger .

The chief executive of the Toyota Motor Corporation said Monday that he is pushing his company ’s engineers to develop a plug - in hybrid- electric vehicle with a lithium - ion battery before 2010 , raising the stakes in a race with General Motors .
The comments by Katsuaki Watanabe came at a briefing here on the sidelines of the Detroit auto show , which opened to the press on Sunday .
Mr. Watanabe said he welcomed a competition with G.M. , which plans to introduce its own lithium - ion hybrid , the Chevrolet Volt , around 2010 .
He said the contest would help reduce the “ negative aspects ” of automobiles , and ultimately help the environment .
The wheelbarrow - bike that could be the solution to school - run traffic jams
It looks like a wheelbarrow attached to a bike - but transport experts believe it could be the solution to school - run traffic .
Families in Richmond are being asked to swap their 4x4s for a more environmentally friendly mode of transport : Dutch cargo bikes .
Each costs from £ 1,150 and can carry a rider and up to three young children , or the weekly family shop .
The " wheelbarrow " section is fitted with seatbelts for children .
Jessica Anderson and Amy Robert - Nicoud pedal their Dutch cargo bikes
The Richmond project has been given £ 5,000 funding by Transport for London .
The fleet of four are kept at Stepping Stones nursery and are borrowed by parents for short trips .
Since May 2007 , when the project was launched , the bikes have been in non -stop use , organisers say .
Jessica Anderson , a founder of the Parents for Pedal Power Project , uses one to carry her children Jemima four , and Hugo , three .
Families are being asked to swap their 4x4s for cargo bikes when they take the children to school
Ms Anderson , who is seven months pregnant , said : ' The bikes have changed our lives and the children love it .
We have a cover for when it rains , and while I might get wet , the children are cosy .
Each cargo bike costs from £ 1,150
I 've used it for grocery shopping , getting to after - school activities , trips to the park and even to the recycling bank with a load of cardboard and bottles .
It can be quite tough but you do save on gym membership .
' It 's the ultimate eco-friendly people carrier . '
The popularity of the machines is likely to have been boosted by Richmond raising the cost of a parking permit for a large - engined " gas guzzler " to £ 150 .
It is also considering charging £ 75 for an annual permit to drop children off at school by car .
Tony Juniper , director of Friends of the Earth , said he had bought his wife a cargo bike for Christmas : ' We 've been trying to cut down on car use and this is perfect for shopping and carrying heavier goods .
We even take our youngest to chess matches . '
A spokesman for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents said cargo bikes looked no more dangerous than other bicycles , but added : ' It will handle differently from a normal one so people should get training or practice first in a safe environment . '

After falling victim to a domain and brand hijacking , Shareaza is fighting back at the scammers , assisted by the Software Freedom Law Centre , the EFF and Richard Stallman .
In further great news for BitTorrent fans , Shareaza will introduce improved BitTorrent support into version 3 of the application .
A lot of things have happened since the Shareaza domain was hijacked .
Through TorrentFreak , the Shareaza development team gives an exclusive update on the current situation :
Dear friends and supporters ,
The Shareaza Development
Team would like to extend our thanks to all of you for your contributions towards our Legal Defense Fund .
As you will remember , our project ’s identity was appropriated late last year by the recording industry funded Discordia Ltd. shell company and handed over to the recording industry “ approved ” iMesh for commercial exploitation .
To that end , we are today announcing that we have legal representation and will be contesting the trademark application on our name and identity taken out by Discordia Ltd .
After that , we ’ll be looking to get our old domain back from the people who threatened , bullied and intimidated the team member holding it on the project ’s behalf and who are now using as the gateway to their deceptive business model .
We would like to take this opportunity to thank the Software Freedom Law Centre , the EFF and Richard Stallman for their help and assistance in this unfortunate matter and also for their recognition of this new threat being faced by free software projects the world over .
If you ’d like to help us in our fight to regain control of our identity , we welcome all donations to our Legal Defense Fund .
You can use our ChipIn account here to donate safely .
So will this all be long , drawn out and very boring ?
Quite possibly .
Are we going to sit back , lick our wounds and wait for the lawyers to sort it all out ?
Heck no !
In fact , The Shareaza Development team is also announcing today that we ’ve started work on Shareaza 3.0 .
Put simply , we ’re not going to let the identity thieves slow us down at all .
Shareaza 3.0 will be a significant milestone in Shareaza ’s long history .
For a start we ’re switching to the brand new QT 4.4 application development framework .
This will allow us a lot more flexibility for a redesign of Shareaza ’s network core , making the current Gnutella , Gnutella2 and ED2 K networks more modular .
We ’re also getting rid of the deprecated MFC code to make 3.0 more plug - in friendly and many of the existing features our users know and love will also be re-built with portability in mind .
The even bigger news is that we ’re scrapping our current implementation of BitTorrent and will be using the libtorrent libraries as our base for torrent support in the 3.0 release .
Shareaza ’s BitTorrent implementation is long overdue for a revamp and while many of it ’s features were revolutionary at the time ( Shareaza was the first client to experiment with decentralized torrents for example ) the development team realizes that its time to bring BT support into line with the modern torrent scene .
Developers with some spare time and a desire to get their hands dirty playing with the new QT 4.4 on an existing code base are welcome to stop by our developers IRC channel for a chat .
Once again , we send our thanks all the Shareaza users and supporters out there and invite Discordia , iMesh and the recording industry monopoly to drop the trademark application and return our domain name before you embarrass yourselves any further .
We ’re fighting back !
Inquiries can be made via our forums here
Kind regards ,

Is ‘ Stop Liking Men Who Drive Hot Cars ’ Sound Climate Advice ?
Richard Gray at the U.K.
Telegraph reports that Sir David King , a University of Cambridge chemist , staunch global warming activist , and one of Britain ’s top government scientists , gave the following advice to a woman who asked him what she could do to curb global warming :
“ [ S ] top admiring young men in Ferraris . ”
King ’s larger point — that we should act individually to start a cultural shift that re-prioritizes gas guzzlers at the bottom of the desirability list — is probably valid .
But broad assumptions about women liking hot cars ( and the men who drive them ) aside , the idea that one person ’s decisions should be unrelated to his or her personal interests runs contrary to free - market models for achieving both personal and societally optimal results .
In other words , trying to influence someone else ’s consumer choices is far less effective than simply making those choices yourself .
The woman ’s goal — to reduce greenhouse gas emissions — would most efficiently be reached by taking direct action , like trading in her own gas guzzler for a hybrid , rather than indirectly signaling others to do so .
Not surprisingly , Ferrari owners are reportedly furious about King ’s comment , with the Ferrari Owners Club responding that most owners of the cars are married ( and thus are n’t driven to purchase them based on a desire to land women , the economics of which we ’ve discussed before ) .
In other words , they ’re turning the discussion 180 degrees from King ’s point , which is that individual consumer decisions can and do matter to global climate change .
While King ’s intentions were in the right place , he might want to rethink his methods of communication ( not to mention his culturally limited decision to tell women that their biggest contribution to fighting climate change lies in encouraging men to fight climate change ) .

A sex game went wrong when a student tried to carve a heart into her boyfriend 's chest - and almost killed him .
But Catherine McCoubrey has escaped a jail sentence for the bizarre attack during a bout of " rough sex " .
Despite doctors ' doubts , the victim not only recovered - but agreed to take her back .
Catherine McCoubrey , 25 , and her 24 - year - old partner had been drinking heavily .
He apparently asked her to carve the shape of a heart in him during what prosecutors called " rough sex " in February 2007 - but unfortunately , she pressed too deeply .
Defence lawyer John McAmmond the unnamed victim introduced his client to " body modification " , and had carved himself with knives before .
McCoubrey , from Winnipeg in Canada , has now been given three years ' probation after pleading guilty to assault .
They can legally resume their relationship after a contact order was waived .
Six years ago a man in Winnipeg who was asked by his lover to spank her with a leather belt and a wooden chair leg was convicted of assault causing bodily harm .
A newly updated analysis released June 16 , coauthored by Dr. Mitch Earleywine , associate professor of psychology at the Albany campus of the State University of New York , shows that state medical marijuana laws have not increased teen marijuana use , despite fears that have been raised when such measures are considered .
Teen marijuana use has consistently declined in states with medical marijuana laws , and generally more markedly than national averages .
The report , based entirely on data from federal and state government - funded drug use surveys , is available at http://www.mpp.org/teens/.
In New York , medical marijuana legislation passed the state Assembly last year , and the issue awaits Senate action .
" Opponents of medical use of marijuana regularly argue that such laws ' send the wrong message to children , ' but there is just no sign of that effect in the data , " said Dr. Earleywine , a substance abuse researcher and author of the acclaimed book , " Understanding Marijuana " ( Oxford University Press , 2002 ) .
" In every state for which there 's data , teen marijuana use has gone down since the medical marijuana law was passed , often a much larger decline than nationally . "
In California , which passed the first effective medical marijuana law in 1996 , marijuana use has declined sharply among all age groups .
Among ninth - graders , marijuana use in the past 30 days ( " current use " as defined in the surveys ) declined by 47 percent from 1995 - 96 to 2005 - 06 , the latest survey results available .
A similar pattern is emerging in the states with newer medical marijuana laws .
Vermont and Montana , whose medical marijuana laws were enacted in 2004 , have seen declines in current marijuana use of 15 percent and 9 percent , respectively .
In Rhode Island , whose medical marijuana law took effect in January 2006 , current use declined 7 percent from 2005 to 2007 .
There are no before - and - after data available yet from New Mexico , whose medical marijuana law was passed last year .
Overall , declines in teen marijuana use in the 11 medical marijuana states for which data are available have slightly exceeded the national trends .
With more than 23,000 members and 180,000 e-mail subscribers nationwide , the Marijuana Policy Project is the largest marijuana policy reform organization in the United States .
MPP believes that the best way to minimize the harm associated with marijuana is to regulate marijuana in a manner similar to alcohol .

Let me say right at outset that I am not seeking to “ Bash the President ” . . . the problem is far , far , far more serious than that !
I am talking about someone – anyone - who declares a belief in a Faith that teaches “ a love of thy fellow man ( and woman ) ” and seems at best to ignore , and at worst to actively work against this fundamental belief .
It begs the question as to how strong is the belief and how credible the Faith ?
When coming to power , almost his next speech after the inaugural denied the scientific thinking held by most nations , that there was such a thing as global warming .
Even if the science was not fully concluded , surely someone with faith would seek , “ for the good of all ” , to utilise the huge resources at his or her disposal to investigate if a problem actually exists ?
When hurricane Katrina hit and devastated New Orleans the body language given off , in my perception of things , was of someone who seemed indifferent to the plight of his “ fellow men and women ” .
Surely the “ Faith inside ” would drive us to go and see the extent of the problem , and with the vast resources available and on call , begin immediately to bring relief to the misery and suffering of our fellow men and women , no matter what the race , creed or colour ?
It is evident now that the Iraq war is not wanted by the peoples on both sides of this devastating divide .
With the “ Faith inside ” highlighting a “ care of our fellow man ( and woman ) ” surely a leader would be driven to utilise the vast resources available to find a way of reducing the suffering , by correctly identifying the real problems and confronting them – not just banging in more troops to exacerbate the situation .
Only today I read that the Tongass rainforest in Alaska is being opened up to logging companies , at a time when it is clear that we are having a devastating effect upon our planet ’s ecological systems , seriously undermining the natural balance so essential to our survival as a species .
Surely the “ Faith inside ” would be driving a leader to care for their fellow men and women by utilising the vast resources available to find ways and means to better manage this planet .
I would go further and suggest that as the current world super power , all of that leaders resources could be utilised in a not inconsequential effort to persuade other leaders around the world to seek ways and means to better manage this planet
The responsibility does not fall upon one pair of shoulders , or one single Faith , but is the responsibility of all , no matter what belief - but the impetus can more readily begin with a credible faith and suitable resources .
If you are happy to follow these observations so far , then the next logical step must be to question not the man , but the Faith that should be directing his judgement .
Religious belief deals with the whole of the human condition – be it attitude to money , race , creed , or environment , together with an understanding of who and what we are as a species , albeit different faiths come from different directions to the same objective .
With the advent of the Global Village it is even more essential for the widest parameters of measurement to be used to set out the disciplines for our activity as a species , to take account of our many and diverse interactions – commerce , environment , religion , economic growth , multiculturalism etc .
If we allow the fundamental basis of measurement to be reduced and overruled by narrower disciplines , such as profit or financial growth , then this very narrowing of how we judge our actions creates chaos and confusion by not meeting our full and real needs .
I believe this can now be demonstrated by the effects being felt around the globe from the actions of the Bush administration , because of its decision making allegiance to the narrower measurement of corporate activity and goals .
The Christian faith , like other beliefs , has been used in the past to identify moral integrity and the attitude needed to achieve this integrity .
Naïve ? . . .
I do n’t think so !
This broader spectrum of how we approach life forces us into greater considerations about our actions and can only benefit our development as a species .
Whatever the reason , the real problem facing us today is a lack of credibility of our traditional religious beliefs to act as a moderator , as demonstrated by the narrow confine of decision making operated by President Bush , whilst also alluding to a Christian belief .
Any leader worth his or her salt has to be able to effectively police the activities of society , whilst also creating an environment that will allow us to achieve our highest potential .
Narrowing these criteria narrows our potential to survive as a species .

Anchorage mayor announces run against Ted Stevens
Anchorage Mayor Mark Begich announced that he is forming a Senate exploratory committee in preparation for a campaign against Sen .
Ted Stevens ( R - Alaska ) , a race that would set up a political battle between an iconic figure in Alaska politics against one of the rising Democratic stars statewide .
" After months of hearing from Alaskans across our state urging me to run for the United States Senate , I have taken a significant step in that direction .
I have formed the Mark Begich for Senate Exploratory Committee , " Begich said in a statement .
“ So many have urged me to run for the Senate that I believe I owe it to them and to all Alaskans to explore whether I can help move our entire state forward .
Alaskans want bipartisan , practical problem - solving from their federal government and they ’re not getting it now . ”
The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has been recruiting Begich for the last several months , believing he has the best chance of unseating Stevens .
Begich ’s father , who was a congressman , died in a 1972 plane crash while campaigning in Alaska .
The National Republican Senatorial Committee , anticipating Begich ’s campaign , has recently set up a website titled begichbaggage.com , designed to alert voters about Begich ’s political record .
It is still under construction .
A December Research 2000 poll , commissioned by the liberal website Daily Kos , showed Begich defeating Stevens , 47 percent to 41 percent , in a head - to - head contest .
Stevens , who has served in the Senate since 1968 , filed for re-election last Thursday , but is fending off allegations of ethical misconduct that are threatening to derail his decades - long political career .
Last July , the FBI raided one of his homes as part of a wide - ranging corruption investigation into ties between Alaska politicians and the oil services giant VECO .
The company allegedly provided labor for renovations to the senator ’s home in Girdwood , Alaska — a charge that Stevens has refuted .
Stevens faces self - funding businessman David Cuddy in the Republican primary , which will be held August 26 .
And Begich still has to win his party ’s nomination , where he is set to face former state Rep. Ray Metcalfe .
The MMO genre is stagnant .
Even those games that during the pre-release hype promise " revolutionary gameplay " and vast new worlds to explore all end up being rehashes of ideas already in play .
It 's obvious that incremental changes simply are n't happening fast enough to divert the genre in a new and interesting direction so I have to have to wonder :
When will we see an MMO that completely changes the industry ?
In short , where is the Wii of MMOs ?
If there is one thing my recent Age of Conan review demonstrated it's that hardcore MMO gamers can immediately discern and recall at a moment 's notice the minute differences that separate Age of Conan from other MMO
titles , specifically Blizzard 's World of Warcraft .
Just take a look at the comments .
You'd think I 'd murdered the parents of a large swath of our readers for all the flak I drew after I dared mention the lack of innovation in Funcom 's title .
What these erudite MMO fans do n't quite grasp however , is that they are the vast minority .
To the hoi polloi these differences are functionally invisible .
That echoes the way gaming in general was perceived by the public at large only a few years ago .
Sure , the internet was filled with those who'd devoted their lives to the Church of Mario and could rattle off every character present in each incarnation of Mortal Kombat ( and the differences between the various flavors of Sub - Zero ) , but to your average mother of two the board at GameFAQs may as well have been written in Latin for all the sense they made .
That all changed when Nintendo launched the Wii .
Not only did the company capture the technological cachet usually reserved for Apple 's latest iDevice , they also earned the affection of the masses .
Now grandparents are playing Mario Kart Wii along with their six - year - old grandspawn and Nintendo is making cash hand over diamond - studded fist .
With the release of Age of Conan , Funcom delivered an enjoyable , solid MMO experience .
It offered players a new world to explore , an innovative combat system and reams of backstory courtesy of Robert E. Howard 's Conan novels and the empire based on them .
To the average person however , a large number of whom had been draw to the MMO genre by World of Warcraft 's ease - of - use and accessible art style , Age of Conan is just World of Warcraft with larger breasts and copious amounts of blood .
It 's a clever move on Funcom 's part – after all , the hardcore MMO fan is stereotypically a young adult male with adolescent fantasies and tastes .
The game 's promotion of its PvP system plays into this demographic as well : Traditionally speaking , those young males are bursting with levels of testosterone that make them apt to slay each other .
Sadly , this sort of thing totally ignores the average person .
You wo n't see grandparents who 've never played an MMO before lining up to snag a copy for themselves .
If this trend continues – and all indications are that Warhammer Online , the next big MMO release , will do nothing to end the ongoing stealth facsimile – there 's got to a breaking point .
Even the target demographic will eventually tire of minute changes and when that happens , who 's going to prop up the MMO industry ?
What MMO developers need to focus on , before gamers abandon the MMO genre en masse , is finding a way to radically change the game .
Elves and swords are not the only way to craft an MMO ( they just ca n't be ) and while I realize that the huge budgets necessary to create these things force publishers to stick to " safe " development plans , someone out there severely needs to create an MMO the likes of which we 've never seen .
Now I have no idea what this MMO will look like , and I do n't think simply adding motion sensitive controllers will work in this instance , but developers are intelligent people .
If they have the skills to craft the kind of network code that allows worlds with thousands of people in them to not completely collapse , they can come up with some novel ideas on how the genre is supposed to work .
Or maybe they do n't .
In which case , Blizzard will continue making more money than anyone , every other MMO will be considered a relative failure , and I 'll continue receiving hate mail for stating the obvious .

Rather than tossing loose change into a panhandler 's empty cup , San Francisco officials want you instead to slide your spare quarters and nickels into a homeless meter .
The city 's latest attempt to deal with one of its most vexing problems will be announced in coming weeks in the form of 10 old parking meters installed in some of the most heavily panhandled areas , The Chronicle has learned .
Money deposited in the meters would go directly to charities that help the homeless .
The goal , officials say , is to reduce panhandling and to educate tourists and residents about the problem of giving money directly to people on the streets .
" The reason people are panhandling is because there 's a market for panhandling , " Mayor Gavin Newsom said Monday .
" We 're not helping these individuals by handing out cash .
If there was strong evidence to suggest this helped people turn their lives around , we would not be using this approach . "
The bright orange meters , donated by the city 's Department of Parking and Traffic , will be scattered along places like Market Street and Van Ness Avenue that typically attract a steady stream of panhandlers every day .
The meters will be accompanied by signs telling people how they can give money to help the homeless .
The slogan for the program and accompanying advertising campaign will be plastered on the meters : " Be a part of change .
Do n't give change . "
The plan is to have the Department of Parking and Traffic employees who collect money from parking meters also collect money from the homeless meters .
The money would be divided among local nonprofit organizations , Newsom said .
A handful of cities around the country , including Denver and Baltimore , have installed homeless meters in recent years .
And while the programs have n't necessarily been lucrative , some cities have seen less panhandling as a result .
Newsom and his homelessness czar , Dariush Kayhan , say it 's worth a try .
" This is not going to solve poverty , " Kayhan said .
" But it is another strategy to see if we can save lives out there . "
Local advocates for the homeless , however , laughed - and gasped - when told about the idea Monday .
Sister Bernie Galvin , executive director of Religious Witness with Homeless People , called the meter idea " utterly ridiculous . "
She said it was based on a stereotype that all panhandlers use every nickel and dime to buy drugs and alcohol .
" Forget the children , forget the mothers who are struggling to raise their family homeless or in inadequate housing , " she said .
" Will the city never give up on trying to find ways to make the lives of homeless people harder ? "
Homeless advocate and community organizer James Chionsini liked the idea at first - until he realized you do n't actually get parking for your change .
Then he said it sounded like a political stunt that would have very little impact on funding homelessness programs or stopping panhandlers .
" I 'd rather give it to a panhandler than put it in a meter personally , " he said .
" At least if you give it to them personally , you 're going to get a smile . "
Newsom contends that most of the panhandlers in San Francisco are n't actually homeless but are supplementing government assistance with the money people give them .
Over the years , city leaders have struggled to curb the panhandling problem , which is largely centered around tourist areas and downtown .
City officials estimate that about 150 panhandlers are on city streets on any given day .
In 2003 , the San Francisco Hotel Council funded a $ 65,000 billboard campaign that linked panhandling to drug abuse and sexually transmitted diseases .
One ad read , " Today we rode a cable car , visited Alcatraz and supported a drug habit . "
Homeless advocates said the campaign was mean - spirited , and then - state Sen .
John Burton took out ads of his own reading , " Jesus gave money to poor people on the streets of Galilee . "
Also in 2003 , then - Supervisor Newsom authored Proposition M , a voter - approved measure that banned aggressive panhandling in public places .
Paul Boden , director of the Western Regional Advocacy Project that deals with homelessness issues , recalled attempts under previous mayors to place jars by cash registers in businesses and sell coupons for services that could then be handed over to panhandlers .
He said the meters idea was especially " asinine " and San Francisco 's all - time second - worst idea to curb panhandling .
The worst , he said , was a failed proposal during Willie Brown 's administration to equip homeless people with credit - card machines like those used for retail purchases .
People could swipe their cards and choose how much to donate , with 80 percent going to homeless programs and 20 percent to the individual panhandlers .
" It 's not fair for the government to create this incredible level of poverty and then turn around to the rest of the community and say , ' Harden your hearts and give the money to us , ' " Boden said .
" Human beings when they see other human beings are going to give a little change , and that 's good . "
But Newsom asked doubters to keep an open mind .
He said aggressive panhandling is by far the top complaint he hears from people .
" I ask them to give us a chance , " he said .
" If it does n't work , show me the evidence , and then we 'll abandon it . "
" The string is a stark data structure and everywhere it is passed there is much duplication of process .
It is a perfect vehicle for hiding information . "

When you switch between " Compose " and " Edit HTML " views , some amount of whitespace ( although not all of it ) is destroyed .
Even when posting using the ATOM API , the posted HTML is mangled in semi-arbitrary ways .
Properly - quoted " < " and " > " ( i.e. " < " and " > " ) are quoted again .
Additional line - breaks are added .

I switched to blogger recently expecting a more " professional " blogging experience .
I thought I 'd be able to use a GUI editor and not concern myself with the details of the blog engine .
Apparently I was wrong .
Writing that last post , I had some pretty serious problems with getting the formatting to come out right .
Blogger does a couple of really terrible things :
This is one of the reasons that I 'm such a stickler for treating data as structured data , and not making arbitrary heuristic guesses about it .
It 's not just a matter of handling obscure , nerdy edge cases that average users wo n't run into .
In fact , it 's the opposite .
Nerds ( like myself ) can figure out whether you 're double - quoting your HTML entities or doing improper whitespace conversions .
But what does a regular Joe do when a " frustrated " smiley ( " >. a page on the Habari wiki Strangely enough , this page concludes that the important thing is not to build their next - generation blogging tool on top of a technology that lets them produce valid output ( serializing DOM trees ) but that the important thing is not producing valid output , but string concatenation .
They very clearly put an implementation technique above a good experience for users .
( This is your brain .
This is your brain on PHP .
Any questions ? ) I do n't want to pick on the Habari developers overmuch .
After all , the problem that inspired this post was with Blogger , and Wordpress has the same issue .
In fact , the Habari guys are mostly notable for having considered the implications of their decision so carefully ; it 's just a surprise to me that they walked all the way up to the right answer , looked at it , made sure it was right , and then decided to ignore it and keep on going .
Here 's the surprise for the Habari developers , and basically everyone else who writes web applications that process HTML : .
It is a general principle of software development .
The only reason youwhen you 're doing XHTML is that the browser is n't correcting for hundreds of minor mistakes , and rather than screwing up immediately it screws up one time in a thousand when a user managed to type a " ultra large , the different pieces need to be able to talk to each other using clear and unambiguous formats .
These points of integration , the places where system A talks to system B ( a blogging system talks to a web browser or a blogging client , for example ) are absolutely the most critical pieces to test , test , and test again .
If you have a bug in your system , you can find it and fix it ; but if you have a bug which only arises from anbetween your system and two others , your test environment needs to be 3 times bigger , and the error is at least 3 times harder to catch .
But it gets worse .
If you 're dealing with 4 systems , then your test environment is 4 times bigger - but the bug is 6 times harder to catch .
And so on .
Fred Brooks observed that adding more programmers to a project running behind schedule makes it later .
This is because of the additional channels of communication .
Now imagine that one of your developers has a curious speech defect : when he says " lasagna " he actually means " critical bug " , and vice versa .
When he hears one , he understands it as the other .
Working alone , this is a harmless eccentricity , but as soon as you put other developers into the mix , strange effects start taking place .
He desperately tries to tell them about the delicious lasagna he had last night , and they can't understand why he 's losing sleep over it .
Or , he is sanguine as his fellow engineers tell him about all the italian food they 're eating , while the business is losing millions of dollars
It 's sort of like if every time he said " my own blogging platform and I 'll know that it can handle HTML correctly .
Until then though , I 've worked out a strategy for posting to blogger which seems to mostly preserve the formatting that I want to see .
I figure that other Python developers might be interested in this , since I frequently see posts to blogger which eat indentation .
The presence of numerous properly - escaped HTML characters in this post should be an indication that it works .
Each Monday , this column turns a page in history to explore the discoveries , events and people that continue to affect the history being made today .
Did you hear the one about the goat , the monk and the Indian pilgrim ?
There 's no crass punchline to this story , just a punchy drink that is the world 's second most important commodity , after oil .
Discovered more than 1,000 years ago by goats roaming the hills of Ethiopia , coffee today employs 500 million people , from the workers toiling in the fields of Kenya to the teenage baristas at your neighborhood Starbucks .
In a world of more than 6 billion people , enjoying a good cup of joe is one of the few fixtures of everyday life common to cultures on every continent .
Buzzed goats make important discovery
It is only fitting that the history of a beverage so associated with good conversation starts with a storybook - like tale .
Native only to parts of subtropical Africa , the stimulating effects of wild coffee beans are said to have been first discovered in about A.D. 800 by an Ethiopian shepherd named Kaldi , whose goats kept him up at nights after feasting on red coffee berries .
The shepherd shared his find with the abbott at a local monastery , where monks first brewed the beans into a hot drink , reveling in the way it kept them awake during long hours of prayer .
Romantic exaggeration or not , by A.D. 1000 the bean with a buzz was a favorite among those needing a boost in East Africa as well as across the Red Sea in Yemen , where the crop had migrated over with slaves .
If Ethiopia was the birthplace of coffee , Yemen was where it grew up .
The brew first took hold among clerics there too , but spillover into the secular crowd did n't take long and skyrocketing demand soon led to the world 's first cultivated coffee fields there in the 1300s .
The entire Arabian peninsula became a hotbed of coffeehouse culture , with cafés – called kaveh kanes – on every corner .
By the 15th - century , Mecca resembled a medieval incarnation of Seattle , men sipping steaming mugs over games of chess and political conversations .
Coffee houses were such an important place to gather and discuss that they were often called Schools of the Wise .
Coffee had much the same effect in Europe when it was introduced there in the 1600s .
Cafés were the center of social life , where people with similar interests could gather and talk .
The British insurance company , Lloyd's of London , began as a café popular with sailors who often discussed insurance matters .
Caffeine becomes a cash crop
Arabia controlled the lucrative coffee industry for several centuries , exporting only roasted , infertile beans to their new trading partners in Europe and Asia .
Caffeine junkies the world over were hooked , but could n't grow their own crops or buy beans at reasonable prices .
It took one intrepid Mecca pilgrim to break the Arab monopoly , according to legend , by smuggling some intact beans back to his native India , initiating an agricultural explosion .
The Dutch also managed to get one plant back to Amsterdam and began cultivating in their Southeast Asian colonies in the 17th century .
Europe now had a new , direct source for its daily coffee fix .
Coffee plants went everywhere that European empires did , taking root in such famous bean - growing regions as Jamaica 's Blue Mountains , the Kona district of Hawaii , Indonesia 's Java Island and the rainforests of Brazil , which remains the world 's biggest producer .
The coffee industry is the main source of income for 25 million small farmers , it is estimated .
The state of the art in the RNA world
As an employee of the National Center for Science Education , Nick Matzke was involved with everything from situations that never made the press to coaching the lawyers in the Dover trial , which gained international attention .
One thing that apparently became clear is that , due to the highly technical material and a flood of misinformation on the topic , the public ( and even many scientists ) simply do n't know what the current state of knowledge is when it comes from evolution .
As part of an effort to rectify that , the NCSE and the AAAS 's Dialog on Science , Ethics , and Religion organized a session on the state of the art in our understanding of evolution , which Matzke moderated .
Four speakers took on topics that appear to be the frequently misunderstood by the public .
One of these — the origin of life — is n't directly part of evolutionary theory , but is frequently associated with it by the public .
The remaining topics covered major events in the evolutionary history that produced humans , including the origin of bilateral animals during the Cambrian explosion , the origin of tetrapods , and the evolution of human ancestors .
Throughout the talks , there were two recurrent themes : we can identify major environmental changes that might have sparked new selective pressures , and many of the major adaptations we view as designed for a specific lifestyle actually originated as an adaptation for something else entirely .
The origin of life
Evolutionary theory , both as proposed by Darwin and elaborated since , deals with the diversification of modern living organisms from a limited number of ancestral living organisms .
But the lack of a strong theory for the origin of life is actually treated as an argument against evolution by many of the opponents of teaching the theory .
Many of the principles of evolution , including heritable variations and selective pressures , are also applied by origin of life researchers .
As such , the two topics appear inextricably linked .
The discussion of life 's origins was handled by Andy Ellington of the University of Texas - Austin .
He started by noting that simply defining life is as much of a philosophical question as a biological one .
He settled on the following : " a self replicating system capable of Darwinian evolution , " and focused on getting from naturally forming chemicals to that point .
To do so , Ellington developed three different themes .
Chemicals in living organisms can form without life
An RNA ligase ribozyme
The basic idea has been recognized for over a century , but the work of Stanley Miller was cited for triggering the modern era of scientific work on the topic .
Since the classic Miller - Urey experiments , science has steadily expanded the range of essential molecules that can be produced under conditions that might reasonably expected to have been present on the early earth .
Ellington emphasized that progress has been slow — we knew how cyanide could react to form the DNA component adenine in the 1960s , but it took over three decades to recognize that a few more reactions converted it to its relative , guanine .
And the roadblocks continue to fall .
After all attempts to produce sugars created a tar - like sludge , someone eventually found that a small amount of borate could help ethanol form large amounts of ribose , another component of RNA .
The first molecules that could replicate led directly to modern life
With the components of nucleic acids in place , Ellington traced a path through the RNA world to a molecule that could self - replicate .
Past attempts to jump to a complex , self - replicating RNA molecule seem to have been on the wrong track .
Short palindromic RNA sequences can apparently help catalyze the formation of complementary sequences , meaning what 's needed is actually an RNA that can link these short sequences into longer , more complex ones .
A number of such sequences , termed RNA ligases , have been identified .
Several labs have shown that these ligases can then be improved by an essentially Darwinian process of random mutation followed by selection for increased efficiency .
Modern RNA activities tell us about the RNA world
Ellington 's final point was that we can still see remnants of the RNA world in aspects of biology that are common to all life .
He noted that many of the cofactors used by modern proteins , including ATP itself , are derivatives of the chemical components of RNA .
Researchers have also been able to evolve RNAs that successfully bind these cofactors , which suggests that proteins would only need to have gradually replaced these RNAs .
That replacement , Ellington suggested , has never actually been completed : the central core of the ribosome , a complex essential for protein production in all organisms , turns out to be formed from RNA .
During questions , he also emphasized that basic cellular metabolism uses some amino acids as intermediates , and suggested that proteins resulted from early RNA " life " simply using what it had lying around , tying in nicely with the theme of preadaptation .
Ars spoke to Dr. Ellington after the talk and asked him about the separate thread of origin of life research that focuses on identifying the energy - harvesting reactions required for the first life .
He was very excited about the potential for user - generated genomes to help unify the two fields .
The ability to customize a genome would not only help scientists identify the very minimal metabolism necessary for life , but would eventually allow researchers to start replacing proteins with their catalytic RNA equivalents .
Ellington suggested that the result — a cell with a hybrid RNA / protein world — would eventually allow us to explore the transition to the first cells .
Ellington 's summary of the state of the art is that " we 'll never know exactly what happened , but we 're getting a really good idea of what is possible . "
The undercover officers started to appear at San Diego State fraternity parties about six months ago .
They dressed like students , complained about their parents and professors , and talked freely and knowingly of things of great interest on campus : music , sex and drugs .
Soon they were accepted , with no questions asked .
They were spotted at student hangouts on and off campus .
They swapped cellphone numbers with other partygoers .
They text - messaged their newfound friends .
The real students appeared to accept the pretend ones -- most but not all of whom were men .
On a campus of 34,000 students , blending into the crowd was not difficult .
Neither was collecting evidence of drug dealing and drug use .

On Tuesday , authorities announced that 96 young men -- including 75 students -- had been arrested on a variety of drug charges as a result of Operation Sudden Fall , which infiltrated seven fraternities on Fraternity Row and Fraternity Circle .
Officials said the name of the operation referred to the prospect of sudden death from drug usage .
The investigation involved marijuana , cocaine , methamphetamine and Ecstasy .
One of the alleged drug dealers is 19 and recently had been praised as a model student in a university publication .
Another was just a month away from earning a master ’s degree in homeland security and had worked with the campus police as a security officer .
One allegedly was selling cocaine to high school students .
A criminal justice major was arrested on suspicion of possession of cocaine .
As he was being arrested , he asked officers if this would hurt his chances for a law enforcement career , officials said .

Among the suspected drug dealers is Omar Castaneda , 36 , who is not a student and is allegedly connected to a gang in Pacoima that has possible ties to the Mexican Mafia , said Ralph W. Partridge , a special - agent - in - charge for the Drug Enforcement Administration in San Diego .
“ This operation shows how accessible and pervasive illegal drugs continue to be on our college campuses and how common it is for students to be selling to other students , ” said San Diego County Dist .
Atty . Bonnie Dumanis .
University police began the investigation a year ago after a 19 - year - old female student died of cocaine and ethanol intoxication , San Diego State President Stephen Weber said at a news conference Tuesday morning at the district attorney ’s office .
About six months ago , the probe was broadened to include agents from the federal Drug Enforcement Administration and youthful - looking undercover officers from several local police departments , who quickly became regulars at the weekend party scene .

During the investigation , a 24 - year - old student at San Diego Mesa College died of a cocaine overdose after a party at a San Diego State fraternity house .
None of the arrests Tuesday was linked to the two students ’ deaths , officials said .
About 20 of the arrested students were involved in selling drugs , authorities said .
The remainder were arrested on suspicion of possession .
About 130 drug purchases were made during the investigation , both on and off campus .
Deputy Dist .
Atty .
Damon Mosler , head of the district attorney ’s narcotics unit , said the operation was so successful that the alleged drug dealers sold narcotics to people they did n’t know on the basis of undercover officers ’ referrals .
More experienced drug dealers would never exhibit such carelessness , Mosler said .
Weber , the university ’s president , said he did not hesitate to allow undercover officers on campus , even if that decision sparked ire .

“ We did the right thing , ” he said .
“ I think , frankly , more universities should step up and take these kinds of actions . ”
As for those responsible for drug dealing , he said , “ if we find that the fraternities as organizations were involved , they will be kicked off campus . ”
Several members of the Theta Chi , Phi Kappa Psi and Delta Sigma Pi fraternities were arrested .
Late Tuesday , the university announced the suspension of six fraternities -- Lambda Chi Alpha , Phi Kappa Psi , Phi Kappa Theta , Theta Chi , Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Sigma Alpha Mu -- pending a hearing into their involvement in the drug dealing .

All of the arrested students have been suspended , Weber said .
Those who live in university - owned or maintained housing are being evicted , he added .
On the sprawling campus in eastern San Diego , word of the drug busts spread rapidly .
Angela Beckwith , 22 , a child development major , said the arrests “ are a shocker but not really a surprise .
Lots of people are using . ”
“ I ’m surprised more people are n’t caught or get hurt , ” said Adam Klein , 23 , a business major and a member of the Phi Kappa Theta fraternity .
“ This looks bad for the whole Greek system . ”

One suspect , Kenneth Ciaccio , 19 , a member of the Theta Chi fraternity , sent out a mass text message early last month to “ faithful customers , ” saying that he was traveling to Las Vegas and would not be able to make his normal cocaine sales , the DEA said .
A publication produced by the university ’s public relations department that recently lauded Ciaccio as a model student was taken off its website Tuesday .
Although the investigation was widely praised in San Diego , the nationwide group Drug Policy Alliance blasted it as “ sensationalistic ” and futile .
The group believes in the decriminalization of marijuana and favors increased drug education and treatment over mass arrests .
“ College students on any campus in this country are easy pickings , ” said Margaret Dooley - Sammuli , the group ’s deputy state director for Southern California .
“ But these types of arrests are not the best use of the DEA ’s resources .
They should be targeting large - scale traffickers and distributors . ”

According to the DEA , the seized evidence included 4 pounds of cocaine , 50 pounds of marijuana , 48 hydroponic marijuana plants , 350 Ecstasy pills , 30 vials of hash oil , methamphetamine , psilocybin ( mushrooms ) , various illicit prescription drugs , a shotgun , three semiautomatic pistols , three brass knuckles and $ 60,000 in cash .
Officials put the value of the seized drugs at more than $ 100,000 .
They said the marijuana was high - grade and probably grown locally because marijuana smuggled from Mexico is usually of a lower quality .

Internet Censorship
A review of Access Denied , edited by Ronald Deibert , John Palfrey , Rafal Rohozinski and Jonathan Zittrain , MIT Press : 2008 .
In 1993 , Internet pioneer John Gilmore said “ the net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it ” , and we believed him .
In 1996 , cyberlibertarian John Perry Barlow issued his ‘ Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace ’ at the World Economic Forum at Davos , Switzerland , and online .
He told governments : “ You have no moral right to rule us , nor do you possess any methods of enforcement that we have true reason to fear . ”
At the time , many shared Barlow ’s sentiments .
The Internet empowered people .
It gave them access to information and could n’t be stopped , blocked or filtered .
Give someone access to the Internet , and they have access to everything .
Governments that relied on censorship to control their citizens were doomed .
Today , things are very different .
Internet censorship is flourishing .
Organizations selectively block employees ’ access to the Internet .
At least 26 countries — mainly in the Middle East , North Africa , Asia , the Pacific and the former Soviet Union — selectively block their citizens ’
Internet access .
Even more countries legislate to control what can and cannot be said , downloaded or linked to .
“ You have no sovereignty where we gather , ” said Barlow .
Oh yes we do , the governments of the world have replied .
Access Denied is a survey of the practice of Internet filtering , and a sourcebook of details about the countries that engage in the practice .
It is written by researchers of the OpenNet Initiative ( ONI ) , an organization that is dedicated to documenting global Internet filtering around the world .
The first half of the book comprises essays written by ONI researchers on the politics , practice , technology , legality and social effects of Internet filtering .
There are three basic rationales for Internet censorship : politics and power ; social norms , morals and religion ; and security concerns .
Some countries , such as India , filter only a few sites ; others , such as Iran , extensively filter the Internet .
Saudi Arabia tries to block all pornography ( social norms and morals ) .
Syria blocks everything from the Israeli domain “ .il ” ( politics and power ) .
Some countries filter only at certain times .
During the 2006 elections in Belarus , for example , the website of the main opposition candidate disappeared from the Internet .
The effectiveness of Internet filtering is mixed ; it depends on the tools used and the granularity of filtering .
It is much easier to block particular URLs or entire domains than it is to block information on a particular topic .
Some countries block specific sites or URLs based on some predefined list but new URLs with similar content appear all the time .
Other countries — notably China — try to filter on the basis of keywords in the actual web pages .
A halfway measure is to filter on the basis of URL keywords : names of dissidents or political parties , or sexual words .
Much of the technology has other applications .
Software for filtering is a legitimate product category , purchased by schools to limit access by children to objectionable material and by corporations trying to prevent their employees from being distracted at work .
One chapter discusses the ethical implications of companies selling products , services and technologies that enable Internet censorship .
Some censorship is legal , not technical .
Countries have laws against publishing certain content , registration requirements that prevent anonymous Internet use , liability laws that force Internet service providers to filter themselves , or surveillance .
Egypt does not engage in technical Internet filtering ; instead , its laws discourage the publishing and reading of certain content — it has even jailed people for their online activities .
The second half of Access Denied consists of detailed descriptions of Internet use , regulations and censorship in eight regions of the world , and in each of 40 different countries .
The ONI found evidence of censorship in 26 of those 40 .
For the other 14 countries , it summarizes the legal and regulatory framework surrounding Internet use , and tests the results that indicated no censorship .
This leads to 200 pages of rather dry reading , but it is vitally important to have this information well - documented and easily accessible .
The book ’s data are from 2006 , but the authors promise frequent updates on the ONI website .
No set of Internet censorship measures is perfect .
It is often easy to find the same information on uncensored URLs , and relatively easy to get around the filtering mechanisms and to view prohibited web pages if you know what you ’re doing .
But most people do n’t have the computer skills to bypass controls , and in a country where doing so is punishable by jail — or worse — few take the risk .
So even porous and ineffective attempts at censorship can become very effective socially and politically .
In 1996 , Barlow said : “ You are trying to ward off the virus of liberty by erecting guard posts at the frontiers of cyberspace .
These may keep out the contagion for some time , but they will not work in a world that will soon be blanketed in bit - bearing media . ”
Brave words , but premature .
Certainly , there is much more information available to many more people today than there was in 1996 .
But the Internet is made up of physical computers and connections that exist within national boundaries .
Today ’s Internet still has borders and , increasingly , countries want to control what passes through them .
In documenting this control , the ONI has performed an invaluable service .

Transfer of pastor may cost Co-Cathedral $ 500,000 Parish donors angry over pastor 's transfer
$ 500,000 for center at cathedral in jeopardy

A decision to transfer a popular pastor from Houston 's Co-Cathedral of the Sacred Heart to another local parish has led angry donors to consider withholding at least half a million dollars in pledges from the church 's $ 4 million capital campaign .
The funds are intended for a Cathedral Center , due to open later this year with much - needed space for classrooms , meetings , offices and a reception hall to serve the growing downtown parish of about 2,400 families .
The pastor , the Rev. R. Troy Gately , spearheaded fundraising efforts for the new center , which will be in the old Federal Reserve bank building , catty - corner to the $ 49 million downtown Roman Catholic Cathedral that opened last month .
The Co-Cathedral is the official church of Cardinal Daniel N. DiNardo of the Archdiocese of Galveston - Houston .
Parishioner Doyle Drury , who made a five - figure campaign pledge , said he was stunned to read a farewell letter from Gately in the Sunday bulletin this week .
" The Cardinal is transferring me to become the pastor of St. John Vianney parish in West Houston , " Gately wrote .
" I did not seek this move .
In fact when asked to consider it , I said ' No . '
But when it was no longer stated in the form of a question my response was ' Yes , I will obey and do what is asked of me out of love for Christ and his church . ' "
The next day , Drury sent a letter to Cardinal DiNardo , announcing he was stopping his pledge and requesting a full reimbursement of all money he 'd already paid out .
" I want to make my point , " said Drury , a parts and service director for Texan Pontiac .
" I do n't think it 'll change anything with the cardinal 's position , actually , but at least I want him to know we 're standing up for what we believe in . "
The Chronicle could not reach Cardinal DiNardo Friday .
Gately led efforts to construct the center and deserves to see his vision through , Drury said .
" Church decisions from the cardinal I feel must be based on prayerful or ethical reasons and not political or personal one , " he said .
" Why not let him ( Gately ) enjoy the fruits of his labor ?
What does it hurt ?
I just do n't understand . "
He 's not the only one who 's angry .
Pursuing the reasons
Capital campaign chairman Patrick Pacheco said a dozen individuals representing about half a million dollars in campaign pledges have have asked him to arrange a meeting with the cardinal " to get clarification of why Father Troy was reassigned and why now . "
These donors have either indicated that they plan to withdraw their pledges or are considering it .
If the decision to reassign is final , the donors want to know if the transfer can be delayed until after the dedication of the Cathedral Centre , Pacheco said .
They also asked him to secure a written commitment from the diocese that the Cathedral Center will be utilized for parish activities and not chancery office space , apart from a half floor that has already been committed to the chancery .
Now , with Gately apparently leaving before construction is completed , the donors are afraid the diocese is going to take over a large part of the more than 100,000 - square - foot center for its own use , Pacheco said .
" It 's a groundswell of anger , " he said .
" We see Sacred Heart as part of our family , and Father Troy is part of that family .
We were shocked and saddened to hear the news .
It 's almost like losing a member of your family .
And , in fact , the environment of Mass on Sunday was like a funeral .
I 'm looking around and seeing people crying . "
' Standard procedure '
Pacheco said he called the cardinal 's office seeking a dialogue on Monday , but he has yet to hear back .
The archdiocese does not comment on pastoral assignments , spokesman Erik Noriega said earlier this week .
Noriega said Gately 's transfer to replace a retiring priest at St. John Vianney is consistent with " standard procedure . "
Most priests get moved to a different parish every six years or so , he said .
Gately , who also could not be reached for comment Friday , has been rector at the Co-Cathedral since 1999 .
Pacheco's wife , Sarah Patel Pacheco , said she has decided to withhold a " significant amount of money " she 'd pledged for the cathedral center .
" I feel having just come off the cusp of opening ( the co-cathedral ) and the publicity it got for our city , our area and Catholicism , it was a real slap in the face , " she said .

There 's something about December that makes me crave turn - based strategy .
I do n't know what it is - some kind of deep grained memory that when you can't go outside it 's time to play boardgames or something .
While I 've been dabbling with everything from Fantasy Wars to ( just starting ) the New Galacitic Civilization beta , this is what 's been dominating .
Dominating everything .
At the time of writing , a copy of Mass Effect sits unopened in the next room .
Interviews with everyone from Warren Spector to Blood Red Shoes remain determinedly untranscribed .
Rooms remain untidied ( though that 's a same - as - it - ever - was ) .
It 's compulsive , challenging , thought provoking , atmospheric and as generally neat an indie- strategy game I 've played since - oooh - Weird Worlds : Return to Infinite Space .
( And while Weird Worlds is more polished , Armageddon Empire has many times more depth . )
It 's a 4X game , which stands for " I 'm incapable of realising what letter starts a word " ( or rather , " eXplore , eXpand , eXploit and eXterminate " , which are the primary goals ) .
You start in the corner of the map , and go forth exploring it corners , making new bases , collecting neat stuff and finally kicking the heads of anyone who has the audacity to start on the same map thoroughly in .
File next to GalCiv , Civilization , and many other things with " iv " in them .
If I had to narrow it down , it 's got three things which are its stand - out features , and core to its appeal .
Its setting .
Its recruitment mechanism .
Its length .
It 's a post - apocalyptic game with a card - playing / deck building mechanism in lieu of ( most ) of its traditional building and you can play it in a relatively short time .
Most games last one to three hours , though you can expand it up or down depending on changing the size of the map .
The card mechanism is the first thing you 'll notice .
Taking inspiration from games like Magic : The Gathering ( in mechanisms , not in terms of paying money for a piece of card with a fancy orc with some numbers printed on ) , you can only put units into play which are in your " hand " .
Before the game , you design a deck of cards - each of the game 's four sides have their own unique selections - up to a set point value ( i.e. harder cards cost more ) .
Or , if you 're lazy or do n't know what the hell 's going on , you can pick a predefined one .
Then , when you start , you get dealt a hand of cards , and you can bring them into play as and when you get enough resources ( i.e. hard cards require you have secured more bits of space - floss and jam than others ) .
This is exciting .
No , really .
It takes a while to realise , but the card mechanism integrates tightly into the setting .
It 's a post - apocalypse game - in other words , about not having much stuff .
Once you 've gone through your deck of cards ... that 's it .
If a hero 's killed in play , they 're gone forever .
If you only put one enormous death robot in your deck , and he gets turned to bolts , you 're not getting another one .
This leads you to thinking carefully , both about what units you want to have available , and their fates when you get them .
The third facet - that it 's short - means that so you can experiment with more tactics , decks , approaches and just play more games .
I 'd argue this brings the strategy more sharply into focus than it does with a longer game - the link between your decisions and the resultant actions is clearer , meaning you really do know when you 've made a hideous error .
Esentially , it 's a glorified boardgame .
Like most of its peers , really .
But while most turn - based strategy games are glorified boardgames , Armageddon Empires makes it explicit .
It actually shows you the dice as they roll , for example .
However , it 's a boardgame which would require such complex book - keeping to play on a tabletop that the only sane thing to do is turn to a computer .
And it 's a glorified boardgame which makes me want to glorify it .
Why do I love it so much ?
I think it comes down to meaningful decisions .
Tying into your limited deck , it 's a game were all your decisions are about scarcity .
For example , rather than being able to order all your units every turn , you 're provided a number of action points to spend .
In most cases , you 'll have about twenty action - points ' worth of stuff you 'd like to do , and only ten or so to play with .
What do you prioritise ?
Is it more important to move your scouts or reinforce your bases ?
Play another card or draw another one from the deck ?
To save them for researching new weapons or keep them so you can play tactic cards during battles ?
( And away from the action points , you also have to worry about resources , number of cards , where to explore , etc - the choices pile up . )
What adds a second edge to the action - points decisions is that it 's not a stable reservoir .
At the start of every turn , dice are rolled to determine which side goes first .
As well as having the initiative , whoever rolls highest also gets more points , so can do more stuff .
To help secure it , you can spend your resources on buying more dice .
Of course , if you do that you wo n't have them to spend on constructing new material .
The pay - off is tense , rewarding and totally game - shaping .
Identifying when you need to win is critical - hell , one of the joys is when you have the AI on the ropes , having sprung a trap to capture his ( Armageddon Empire 's AI are men - I do n't know why , I just know they are ) capital and he spends as many resources as he can to make sure he gets to go first , in a desperate attempt to foil the plan .
You lean back and laugh at the desperation .
Nuclear Desert Oasis : Roll
With it .
( It 's always a good sign when you start to actually picture the thought pattern behind computer players ' actions .
This makes them more human .
This makes it more of a pleasure to kick them in their vulnerable hexes . )
As all the mentions of dice rolling suggests , it means the game involves a lot of luck .
This is actually one of the reasons why it 's so tense - like some kind of HyperRisk , you may know the odds are enormously in your favour , but you can't be completely sure .
But in all the games I 've played , it has n't felt random , and that 's due to all those decisions yo get to make .
You 've massaged the odds in whatever what you think best .
Now let 's see them roll .
All of which is so brilliant , that it saddened me that I realised I probably , in good faith , should give it a seven .
Technically it 's hardly exemplary - programmed in Macromedia Director , it 's limited to a single resolution .
Its buttons , especially when battles clash , can be a little sluggish .
It occasionally throws up a scripting error for some reason - restarts are very occasionally needed , though the auto - save feature normally covers you .
Away from that , it 's also deeply inaccessible - while the manual is in - depth , there 's no in - game training bar button pop-ups , the game does n't have enough decks to show you what to do ( in fact , you have to download a few of the factions basic deck from the Cryptic Comet site ) .
The interface hides information from you in the most bizarre ways - for example , some actions requiring you to select an army 's icon and right - click , and others requiring you to go into the army and select the individual unit .
I learned to play by starting several games , going along until I realised something fundamental I was missing completely ( like , say , how to build a resource - gatherer on a square ) , then restarted .
Oh - and the mini-map actually obscures the top left corner , requiring you to turn it on and off to see what 's going on up there .
The deck builder especially does its best to be unfriendly .
Also , while a flexible and deep game - the levels are randomly generated , with maps and encounters always being a surprise - it 's missing several elements you may expect .
For example , no hot - seat multiplayer or anything resembling a predefined series of missions .
But it 's getting an eight anyway , because what it has on its side kind of overrules other considerations : it 's up there with any strategy game released this year , and if you have any affection for the genre whatsoever , you 'll adore it .
In fact , I suspect it may end up as a minor classic of the genre .
Sexy dice .
It 's obviously a work of love .
For example , despite the fact the only sense of the factions are the pictures at the top of each card , you genuinely know who each are .
Take the Free Mutants ' Zentrads .
All I know about them is the picture : a bare - chested giant with some manner of Merlin - from - Excalibur - esque skull - cap , with their hands clasped around the head of an unfortunate soldier 's helmet , squeezing .
From the coldly malicious look and the almost laziness of the action , it 's clear that the skull 's about to pop and there 's nothing the soldier 's going to do with it .
The " s " at the end of Zentrad implies the unit includes loads of these guys , and their enormous attack value plus the commando special ability ( so allowing them to act without supply - supply being another one of the tactical considerations that weigh on your every decision which I have n't room to talk about ) .
And from that , I 've got the image of some kind of brutal mutant elite and ... well , when they go into action I know them .
Same 's true for - say - the Zombie Launcher ( picture : a square WW2 - styled launcher , in silhouette , with a figure propelled from it instead of missile ) .
Or any of them , really .
I was unsurprised to discover the developer 's got enough background on the world which is n't in the game to make him talk about writing a novel set there .
For a hex - based game to have this sense of place implies he 's thought it all through .
This sense of real armies viewed through the abstract dice - rolling shows best in the combat , one of the mini-sections requiring its own set of tactics .
Armies are divided into two rows , with only artillery able to engage from the back .
You take turns to attack .
Since each card has its own abilities , the order you use them is where you win or lose .
The card with Shock Attack , if it hits , will prevent a unit from attacking , if they have n't yet , for example .
Do you use this card first ?
If so , who do you aim at ?
What if it misses - perhaps it 'll be better if your hardest hitter engages before the other side 's Shock Attack can come into play .
And that 's one special ability .
There 's dozens .
And there 's influence of generals , tactic cards , equipments , supply , assassination and ...
DECISIONS .
IT IS A GAME ABOUT DECISIONS .
IT IS ABOUT MORE DECISIONS THAN YOU CAN FIT IN A REVIEW BUT - CRUCIALLY - NOT MORE DECISIONS YOU CAN FIT IN YOUR HEAD .
This is exactly what we play strategy games for .

He has made millions as a title insurance executive , landlord and real estate developer in this college town , where the economy , despite trouble nationwide , is still growing nicely .
Now , as a United States senator , with the mortgage mess fueling a national economic slowdown , Richard C. Shelby has more say over the revamping of housing finance laws than almost anyone else in Congress .
Mr. Shelby , 74 , does not run a key Congressional committee .
Instead , as the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee , he is using his clout and the Democrats ’ slim majority in the Senate to help determine what gets in , or almost as important , what is left out , of legislation .
He will soon play a major role in deciding the fate of one such bill , to help struggling homeowners , that the House passed , 266 to 154 , on Thursday .
But over the years , his critics say , Mr. Shelby ’s ties to the mortgage industry and the Alabama real estate market , and the generous campaign donations he receives from financial services companies , have distorted his perspective and led him to delay critical legislative remedies .

The back story of how a Torah got from the fetid barracks of Auschwitz to the ark of the Central Synagogue at Lexington Avenue and 55th Street is one the pastor of the Lutheran church down the street sums up as simply “ miraculous . ”
It is the story of a sexton in the synagogue in the Polish city of Oswiecim who buried most of the sacred scroll before the Germans stormed in and later renamed the city Auschwitz .
It is the story of Jewish prisoners who sneaked the rest of it  four carefully chosen panels  into the concentration camp .
It is the story of a Polish Catholic priest to whom they entrusted the four panels before their deaths .
It is the story of a Maryland rabbi who went looking for it with a metal detector .
And it is the story of how a hunch by the rabbi’s 13 - year - old son helped lead him to it .
This Torah , more than most , “ is such an extraordinary symbol of rebirth , ” said Peter J. Rubinstein , the rabbi of Central Synagogue .
“ As one who has gone to the camps and assimilates into my being the horror of the Holocaust , this gives meaning to Jewish survival . ”

Lots of you are probably familiar with MediaDefender .
They 've been around for many years ( we first mentioned them back in 2000 ) with the business proposition of basically helping big entertainment companies disrupt any sort of unauthorized file sharing .
In the early days , that just meant putting up spoof files to annoy people .
But it 's become a lot more sophisticated since then -- including tricking people into downloading spoof files with malware that actually scans your computer for infringing files .
Then , of course , there was the infamous attempt to create an entire fake honeypot file sharing system to try to catch people for unauthorized file sharing .
The company has also been accused of a variety of different denial of service attacks against sites it believes are promoting file sharing .
On the whole , pretty much everything the company seems to be associated with would be considered dirty tactics .
What 's amazing is that in pulling all these dirty tricks , MediaDefender never seems to get in much trouble for it .
However , it may have picked the wrong target this time .
Over the weekend , there was a lot of buzz about the fact that online video company Revision3 was taken totally offline thanks to a denial of service attack .
As a whole bunch of you are sending in , Revision3's CEO has now put up a post explaining how it was actually MediaDefender that very obviously launched the denial of service attack on Revision3 .
There are some details missing , but effectively what has been pieced together is that Revision3 uses BitTorrent ( properly and legally ) to help offload the bandwidth costs of distributing its videos ( this is exactly what BitTorrent was originally built to do ) .
MediaDefender , however , used a backdoor into Revision3's BitTorrent tracker to inject its own nefarious torrents -- basically piggybacking off of Revision3 's tracker .
Revision3 noticed the backdoor and closed it -- at which point , MediaDefender 's system started flooding Revision3 's servers with over 8,000 pings per second ( MediaDefender claims it should have been once every 3 minutes ) .
So , it does n't appear to have been a malicious attack by MediaDefender on Revision3 -- just a sneaky , poorly implemented one ( which , at this point , seems par for the course on just about everything MediaDefender does ) .
And , in doing so , it took a totally legitimate business nearly completely offline for a few days , and does n't seem particularly apologetic about it .
And these are the guys that the entertainment industry trusts to save it from the " evils " of unauthorized file sharing .

The Man Who Pushed America to War : The Extraordinary Life , Adventures and Obsessions of Ahmad Chalabi , By Aram Roston .
Nation Books , $ 27.50 .
Who is Ahmad Chalabi , really ?
A scheming manipulator , a corrupt businessman , a political visionary , or all of the above ?
In The Man Who Pushed America to War , Roston , an Emmy - winning investigative reporter , tries to solve the riddle of the man who would have been president of Iraq and how he captivated neoconservatives with his vision of overthrowing Saddam Hussein and bringing freedom and democracy to the Middle East .
Much of Chalabi ’s story is well known ( see “ Heroes in Error ” in the March / April 2006 issue of Mother Jones ) , but Roston weaves its disparate parts into a coherent narrative .
He follows Chalabi through his various incarnations , starting as the brainy , exiled son of Baghdad ’s ruling elite who headed his family ’s international business empire .
Roston provides an overdue explanation of how Chalabi treated his Petra Bank as a private slush fund , fleeing into the night when his embezzlement was discovered by Jordanian authorities .
Next came Chalabi the dissident , the Iraqi National Congress head who devoted his every waking moment to guiding America into war with Saddam .
Finally , we meet today ’s Chalabi : Rejected by his American patrons and allied with Shiite warlord Moqtada al - Sadr , he ’s a floundering has - been .
( Or is he ? )
More than just a biography of a chameleon , Roston ’s book is a fascinating , if dispiriting , look at the mechanics of power in Washington .
Time and again , Chalabi , “ an extraordinary dining companion , ” wins the loyalties of key political players by sheer force of personality .
( Chalabi ’s gustatory skills are presumably the reason for the book ’s bizarre focus on his undulating waistline and his enthusiasm for the Atkins diet . )
Despite parsing the minutiae of his bloated ambition , Roston never nails down a satisfactory answer for what really drives Chalabi .
But this portrait will surely be recognizable to those who fell into Chalabi ’s orbit , not realizing their mistake until it was too late .
Commuter rail ridership broke an all - time record this week , and Caltrans reported a dip in freeway traffic as commuters across California struggled with record gasoline prices .
Metrolink recorded its highest number of riders in a single day Tuesday -- 50,232 -- a 15.6 % increase over the volume on the Tuesday of the same week last year .
Metro Rail ridership has also risen , shooting up 6 % last month over May 2007 , with the downtown L.A. - to - Pasadena Gold Line setting an all - time ridership record , said Dave Sotero , a Metro spokesman .
Meanwhile , Caltrans officials said Thursday that traffic on California freeways dropped 1.5 % over last year -- the equivalent of a billion fewer miles traveled , said spokesman Derrick Alatorre .
In Los Angeles and Ventura counties combined , Caltrans ’ traffic sensors found a slight decline in freeway traffic : from 91.7 million miles traveled in March to 91.4 million in May , the most recent data available .

Alatorre said Caltrans engineers expect the downward trend to continue during the summer months , as gas prices remain high .
“ Statistically speaking , that is not a lot of difference in miles , but it is a lot of gas , ” he said .
Spikes in gas prices have often brought increases in public transit ridership and even small reductions in traffic -- only to see motorists get back on the road when prices drop .
But the increasingly crowded rail lines are a marked contrast in a region where the car has long been king -- and remains so even with the record gas prices .
Some commuters said Thursday that prices are now so high that they would consider using rail more frequently .

Thair Peterson , an employee at the Metropolitan Water District , switched to using Metro just over a year ago when gas prices hit a “ tipping point ” of $ 3.30 a gallon .
“ It was a no - brainer , ” Peterson said , after arriving at Union Station from his Los Feliz residence .
Now , he says , gas prices would have to drop below $ 2 a gallon for him to consider commuting by car again .
California ’s average gas price jumped 15.5 cents last week to $ 4.588 a gallon , the U.S. Energy Department said this week .
In the last month , California ’s average has increased nearly 64 cents a gallon , while the U.S. average has risen 29 cents .
The shift in behavior extends beyond Southern California .

Americans drove 1.4 billion fewer highway miles in April compared with the same month last year , and 400 million fewer miles than they did in March , U.S. Transportation Secretary Mary E. Peters announced this week .
Peters also said that gas - guzzling sport utility vehicles are decreasing in popularity , as sales of midsize sport utility vehicles were down 38 % year - over - year in May .
“ It ’s absolutely the sticker shock and awe at the gas prices , ” said Denise Tyrrell , a spokeswoman for Metrolink , the commuter rail service that links downtown L.A. with outlying suburbs .
“ This is the time of year that we normally have lower ridership , but it ’s only going up . ”
Metrolink tends to serve commuters with especially long drives from places such as San Bernardino , Riverside and Orange County .
Joel Zlotnik , a spokesman for the Orange County Transportation Authority , said Metrolink ridership in April hit a record high in the county , when the 1 - million mark was broken for the first time -- a 6.4 % increase over the same month last year .
The MTA ’s network of rail lines has also seen significant gains .
In May , 7,625,541 passengers boarded Metro ’s two subway lines and three light - rail lines , compared with 7,192,173 boardings last May .

“ It ’s one of the highest one - month spikes on record , ” Sotero said .
The Gold Line , for example , saw average weekday boarding rise to 23,141 last month from 19,093 in May 2007 .
Antral Thomas , 35 , started taking the Gold Line from Pasadena to the Red Line in Koreatown a few weeks ago because of rising gas prices .
Although his commute from his residence to the Koreatown restaurant where he works has increased from 30 minutes by car to an hour and a half by train , the money he ’s saved has paid off .

“ I save a lot .
It takes $ 60 to fill my car , and I use that in a week , ” he said .
Thomas now buys a weekly Metro pass for $ 17 .
Transportation experts are quick to point out that mass - transit riders like Thomas remain part of a tiny minority who use rail instead of their own cars .
And it remains an open question whether that will ever change .
James E. Moore , director of USC ’s transportation engineering program , compared the current uptick to the aftermath of the Northridge earthquake in 1994 , when several major roads were closed .

“ There was some speculation that once people got used to it , they ’d stick with ( public ) transit , ” Moore said .
“ But people do n’t fail to use transit out of ignorance , they choose the option that is the cheapest for them . ”
But with gasoline approaching $ 5 a gallon , the effect may be more permanent .
Michael Miller , 45 , used to spend $ 460 a month at the pump , but now he buys a $ 230 monthly pass for his daily 2 1/2 - hour commute from Rancho Cucamonga to L.A .
An electrical engineer , Miller started using public transit when gas prices hit $ 4.45 a gallon just under a month ago .
Even if fuel costs go down , he says , he ’s staying on the train .

“ I ’m a Metro convert now , ” he said .
“ You avoid a lot of hassles .
You do n’t have to deal with traffic ; driving is a big headache . ”
Although the region ’s rail lines have seen more commuters lately , bus ridership in Los Angeles is slightly down compared to last year , Sotero said .
More than 1.2 million passengers boarded Metro buses on an average weekday in May , but compared with all of May 2007 , ridership is down 5.37 % .
Facing a deep operating deficit , the Metropolitan Transportation Authority last year approved the first across - the - board fare increase in more than a decade , with officials at the time predicting that bus ridership might go down .
Bus riders make up more than 80 % of all MTA boardings , officials said .

But for Metro rail rider Thair Peterson , the trains offer more efficiency than cars or buses .
“ The Sunset Boulevard [ bus line ] is pathetic , ” Peterson said , walking through Union Station on Thursday .
“ It can be discouraging . ”
Because the Gold Line stops running before he gets off work , Antral Thomas takes the bus home .
He says it ’s not as convenient and prefers taking trains .
“ The train comes on time ; you know when it ’s going to be there , ” he said .

Times staff writer David Reyes contributed to this report .
The use of a stun gun on a Polish immigrant was caught on camera The Royal Canadian Mounted Police says it will curb the use of stun guns after a critical report concluded they were using them too often .
The review was prompted by the case of a Polish immigrant who died shortly after officers shot him with stun guns at Vancouver airport last year .
The report said stun guns should only be used against " combative " people .
The RCMP said it would act " as quickly as possible " to give clearer advice to officers and enhance accountability .
There are an estimated 2,000 to 3,000 stun guns available to Canadian police .
Public outrage Paul Kennedy , who led the review by the police force 's watchdog , the Commission for Public Complaints ( CPC ) , called for " a more conservative use " of stun guns , also known as Tasers or conducted energy weapons ( CEWs ) .
See how a Taser works Mr Kennedy said that if the police could not account for the use of the weapon , or properly instruct officers on appropriate use , " then such use should be prohibited until prompt and strict accountability and training measures can be fully implemented " .
He also recommended that officers seek immediate medical attention for people they shock with the devices .
Mr Kennedy 's review followed the case of Robert Dziekanski , a Polish immigrant .
Amateur video showed the RCMP firing a stun gun at least twice at Mr Dziekanski , who died shortly afterwards .
Mr Dziekanski spoke no English and had become agitated after waiting in a secure area of the airport for 10 hours .
Police say that the guns allow an officer to subdue a violent individual without resorting to a lethal firearm .
In response to Mr Kennedy 's report , the RCMP said : " We will act on the recommendations as quickly as possible to provide clearer direction to our members , to further restrict situations in which the CEW can be deployed and implement measures to enhance accountability . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Federal Reserve on Friday joined other U.S. banking regulators in backing new limits on certain billing practices by credit card companies .
Federal Reserve Bank Board Chairman Ben Bernanke collects his notes as he arrives to speak to a joint congressional hearing on the country 's economic outlook on Capitol Hill , April 2 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Jonathan Ernst
The Fed approved a proposal that would generally prohibit credit card companies from increasing the annual percentage rate on a customer ’s outstanding balance .
It would also ban companies from reaching back to prior billing cycles when calculating the amount of interest charges in the current cycle , a practice known as double - cycle billing .
The U.S. Office of Thrift Supervision and National Credit Union Administration already approved the same proposal .
All three regulators said they hope to finalize the rule by the end of 2008 .
Among the biggest issuers of Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc credit cards are Bank of America Corp , JPMorgan Chase & Co , Citigroup Inc , Capital One Financial Corp and Discover Financial Services .
“ The proposed rules are intended to establish a new baseline for fairness in how credit card plans operate , ” Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said at a meeting to approve the proposal .
“ Consumers relying on credit cards should be better able to predict how their decisions and actions will affect their costs . ”
The banking industry has fought bills in the Senate and the House of Representatives that aim to limit similar practices .
“ Regulatory responses such as these are effectively price controls , which have never worked in the past , and we do not believe they will work here , ” Edward Yingling , president of the American Bankers Association , said in a statement .
The new plan would also bar banks , thrifts and credit unions from assessing a fee for paying an overdraft on a checking account , debit card purchase or ATM withdrawal unless they give consumers the right to opt out of overdraft payments .
The proposals also attempt the halt the practice of raising interest rates on a balance when a cardholder fails to make payments on an unrelated bill .
The proposal bars banks from changing rates on existing balances , but can tell customers 45 days in advance it might raise rates .
The public comment period for proposals aimed at addressing unfair and deceptive practices is 75 days and disclosure proposals for overdraft fees for consumers is 60 days .
Democrats in Congress said the proposals appear to tackle some practices , but more can be done but they are still an improvement from the current practices .
“ It remains to be seen if these proposals will go far enough , ” said Senator Robert Menendez , a New Jersey Democrat .
In recent months , a number of U.S. lawmakers have criticized credit card billing and marketing policies that they say blindside unsuspecting cardholders who then become trapped by a mountain of exorbitant fees .

Advertisement " This might make you jump a bit , " warns Ian Cotton .
It is near pitch - black in the viewing room where we are standing ; a soft red glow exuding from a warning light above the door barely cuts through the darkness .
A klaxon sounds , and , suddenly , a giant flash of lightning bolts through the air , accompanied by a deafening crackle , lighting up the room for a fraction of a second .
Every day , the National Grid High Voltage Laboratory at the University of Manchester generates electricity that can reach millions of volts .
The hangar - like facility is packed with enormous pieces of equipment : transformers , generators and the odd huge aluminium sphere stand tall .
A glass - fronted viewing room , where experiments can be safely watched , is adjacent .
It is one of the few places in the UK where scientists can work with huge voltages at first - hand .
Lightning tests Ian Cotton , a senior lecturer at the University of Manchester 's School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering , says : " We do a lot of lightning protection work here . "
Electricity is taken straight from the mains , at the UK 's standard 240 volts , but a towering impulse generator then ramps it up to a massive two million volts - creating a voltage that can be used to see how lightning attaches to objects .
The impulse generator can boost electricity to two million volts
On a regular basis , equipment prone to lightning strikes is brought into the facility .
" We do routine testing of aircraft nose cones - or radomes , " explains Dr Cotton .
Aircraft are mostly made out of metal - meaning that any lightning strikes are conducted towards the tail .
But as the nose cone contains a radar , which would be blocked with a metal casing , this component of the aircraft is made out of glass fibre .
But , according to Dr Cotton , this has a drawback : " If lightning hits [ glass fibre ] , it would blow apart and incinerate - and you cannot have that on a plane .
" This means that they have to have special lightning protection - diverter strips that are often made from segmented pieces of metal .
" And we are able to test how well they can guide the lightning to a safe place in a lab like this . "
Wind turbines also make a regular appearance in the lab .
Dr Cotton says : " If you went back 15 years , early types of wind turbines had no lightning protection in the blades .
When the blades were hit , they would blow apart into smithereens .
" This is obviously bad for the economics of operating a windfarm - and of course for public safety . "
Now the blades have a protection system built in , which is especially important as wind turbines can be placed offshore where repair is difficult .
Dr Cotton says : " We are constantly checking that these lightning protection systems work well and we are working on improving their resistance to lightning . "
Buzzing power lines
Another giant transformer towers inside the test area .
This one boosts electricity to 800,000 volts - about double the voltage that power lines or substations carry .
" We use this generator to carry out experiments on all of the types of equipment that are used on the power system , " Dr Cotton says .
" If you own lots of overhead lines and cables , you want to understand how they are working and when they will fail . "
All kinds of electrical apparatus are tested at the lab
Of particular interest are insulators - the devices that resist the flow of electrical current to make electrical apparatus safe .
You normally see these carrying the conductors on an overhead line .
The team feeds them with electricity to investigate where and when any strains and weaknesses appear .
In the lab , when the voltage is turned up , the insulators turn a gentle shade of blue as corona discharge - the buzzing noise you sometimes hear around power lines - begins to emit .
They then begin to spark violently as they reach the point at which an electrical breakdown occurs .
Ageing equipment Equipment is tested under lots of different conditions .
Dr Cotton says : " We have a salt fog chamber , where insulators go into a very , very salty environment - it is akin to a heavily polluted one - and they degrade very quickly .
" We can also simulate extremes of light - we have a bank of UV lights that show us how plastics change in sunlight . "
You cannot make anything 100 % perfect , but the better you can make it , the more chances you have of keeping the lights on
Dr Ian Cotton , University of Manchester Testing how equipment fares as it ages is key for power companies .
Most of the electrical infrastructure in the UK was installed in the 1950s - and at the time , was given a shelf life of about 40 years .
A decade after this life limit , some have expressed concerns of an impending electricity crisis should any equipment begin to fail .
However , regular tests carried out at this facility , and at other similar labs around the country , show that the equipment is continuing to function well and shows little decay .
Dr Cotton says : " The problem is , when a lot of this new kit was designed , no - one really knew how to predict its lifespan - 40 years was a pretty arbitrary number . "
He adds that it is important to keep on testing the apparatus , a process known as condition monitoring - and this is really where high voltage labs come into their own .
He explains : " Electricity is important in our everyday lives ; now people take it for granted - you switch on a light and you do n't really think about how it gets from a power station to your house .
" But that process is a complex path of overhead lines , cables and substations , and all of them have to be working well virtually all of the time .
" You can not make anything 100 % perfect , but the better you can make it , the more chances you have of keeping the lights on . "

The so - called " D Block " of the FCC 's gigantic 700 MHz broadband auction was supposed to attract bidders willing to share this spectrum with a public safety communications system made available to the nation 's emergency service providers .
The D Block network would provide both commercial broadband service and public safety communication services .
The auction concluded on March 18th , raising a record $ 19.6 billion .
But no one bid the minimum reserve price for the public safety region : $ 1.3 billion dollars .
When the dust cleared , there was no shortage of finger pointing .
Now , the FCC's Office of the Inspector General ( OIG ) has completed an audit of the auction process released on Friday .
The report reveals the challenges the agency faces in realizing its vision of a nationwide public safety network built without cost to the taxpayers .
It also clears Cyren Call of any wrongdoing , calling its actions " a drop in one of many buckets " that undid the effort .
Did somebody break Frontline 's back ?
One of the biggest boosters of the D - block concept , Frontline Wireless , withdrew from the auction after concluding that it could not raise sufficient funds to bid for and maintain the license .
Frontlines ' principals have included former FCC Commissioners Reed Hundt and Mark Fowler .
In late January , Harold Feld of the Media Access Project posted an entry on his Wetmachine blog suggesting that Cyren Call founder Morgan O'Brien represented " by accident or design " the " straw that broke Frontline 's backers backs . "
The non-profit Public Safety Spectrum Trust ( PSST ) had hired Cyren Call 's O'Brien as an advisor to help administrate the D Block 's Public Safety Broadband License ( PBSL ) , which PSST expected to get .
PSST 's officers include the President of the International Association of the Chief of Police and the head of the International Association of Fire Chiefs .
According to Feld , O'Brien , as a representative of PSST , met with Frontline and estimated that the company would need to pay about $ 500 million over a decade to lease the public safety section of the license for commercial purposes .
And that figure did not include the license price , build out , and maintenance .
" O' Brien 's conduct apparently made the Frontline backers extremely worried that even if they won the license , they could never expect to negotiate a [ leasing ] deal , " Feld wrote .
After the auction concluded , Feld , as a representative of the Public Interest Spectrum Coalition ( PISC ) , asked the FCC to investigate the D block failure and Cyren Call 's involvement .
PISC consists of Public Knowledge , Free Press , the Consumers ' Union , and six other similar groups .
After discussing the matter with all parties , the OIG confirmed that O'Brien did indeed meet with Frontline , as well as Verizon .
Different interviewees told the OIG that O'Brien threw out an estimated annual spectrum lease payment of $ 50 to $ 55 million over ten years .
But no auction rules had been broken , the FCC concluded .
Frontline told the agency that " the lease payment amount was only one of many factors it considered in deciding whether to participate in the D block . "
These other factors included :
The Bid Default Rule
Frontline feared that if it could not come to a co-management agreement with Cyren Call after it won the D block , and it withdrew from the whole project , the FCC would hold the company liable for the difference between its bid and the next lowest bid .
" This could translate into a penalty of many millions of dollars , " the agency conceded .
In addition , Frontline apprehended that the threat of this penalty would give Cyren Call tremendous leverage , especially if the FCC consistently sided with O'Brien 's PSST .
" This left [ Frontline 's ] investors facing a significant and uncertain financial exposure , " the Commission observed .
Build - out questions
In the end , Frontline could not anticipate with certainty what it would actually cost to construct the FCC 's nationwide public safety network .
The company " became more and more concerned with the system requirements that it thought PSST and Cyren Call would demand , with the costs that these would entail , and with the business viability of the venture . "
Service quality
PSST officials frankly told Frontline principals that their clients - police , health , and fire emergency responders - did not expect to experience the kind of service delays and blackouts that typical cell phone users put up with from time to time .
" It became apparent to Frontline that PSST regarded the quality of service necessary for public safety to be much higher than that considered acceptable for commercial use , " the OIG 's report discloses .
Too many people and clients
Frontline also did not expect the number of groups that PSST eventually told them would be served by the D Block public safety license , again raising the fear of unacceptable service interruptions .
And Frontline 's Hundt told the OIG that " the costs necessary to reach only a few additional users would entail a vastly disproportionate additional cost . "
But at the same time that users could overwhelm the system , they could possibly underwhelm it as well , declining to buy into the D Block spectrum resource , depriving Frontline of millions of dollars in revenue .
Thus , Cyren Call 's lease payment negotiations did not cause the D Block 's failure to sell at the agency 's reserve price .
" Rather , the many layers of uncertainty and risk and the growing prospect of high network costs , " the OIG concludes , " were responsible for potential bidders ' decisions not to bid . "
Shortly after the FCC issued its findings , MAP's Harold Feld send
Ars a statement congratulating the OIG on its finding that no rules were broken .
But the agency 's investigation shows that the auction was " fatally flawed , " even " doomed to failure " by " terms and conditions set both by the Commission and by the public safety community , " Feld wrote .
The OIG 's findings also raise the question of
whether a nationwide broadband public safety system can be built and run
entirely by the private sector on a for profit basis .
Cyren Call has held four Ex
Parte meetings with the FCC on the 700 MHz auction this month .
The agency
will launch a new proceeding on the D Block challenge at its next Open
Commission meeting , scheduled for May 14th .

HaskellDB is a domain specific embedded language for specifying database queries and operations .
The upside of this is the full Haskell language for writing queries and the Haskell compiler and type checker for validating database code .
The ( big ) downside is the error messages are horribly cryptic ; although once is compiles it is likely to be correct .
The original version of HaskellDB was re-written to be more portable and usable in more situations .
Unfortunately , the documentation is out of step with the current code .
Installation is particularly tricky .
The following is an example query :
stockInfo :: Database -> String -> IO [( CompanyName , TickerSymbol ) ] stockInfo db val = do let q = do s < - table stock restrict ( fromNull ( constant " " ) ( s ! company_name ) ` like ` constant ( " % " ++ val ++ " % " ) ) r <- project ( company_name << s !
company_name # ticker << s ! ticker ) return r rs <- query db q return $ map ( \\ r -> ( maybe " " id ( r ! company_name ) , r ! ticker ) ) rs
To run the query , a database connection detail is passed , along with the search string .
In this case , find all company names and stock tickers where the company name contains ‘ news ’ .
vals :: IO [( CompanyName , TickerSymbol ) ] vals = withDB $ \\ db -> stockInfo db " news "
The result is :
[( " APN NEWS & MEDIA LIMITED " , " APN " ) , ( " WEST AUSTRALIAN NEWSPAPERS HOLDINGS LIMITED " , " WAN " ) , ( " NEWS CORPORATION " , " NWS " ) , ( " NEWSAT LIMITED " , " NWT " ) ]
The database connection can be abstracted into a separate module :
module StockConnection where import Database .
HaskellDB import Database.HaskellDB.HSQL.MySQL opts = MySQLOptions { server = " localhost " , db = " stocks " , uid = " stock_user " , pwd = " stock_pass " } withDB :: ( Database -> IO a ) ->
IO a withDB = mysqlConnect opts

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Confidence in Merck & Co's MRK.N earnings prospects withered on Tuesday , along with its stock price , after U.S. regulators surprisingly rejected the drugmaker 's treatment to raise levels of " good " HDL cholesterol .

Shares of Merck , already battered by this year ’s failed trial of its blockbuster Vytorin cholesterol drug , were swept as much as 10.8 percent lower in Tuesday trading .
They are down 36 percent for the year .
Merck for years has touted the drug , which it had planned to call Cordaptive , as one of its most important experimental medicines and a major new weapon to prevent heart attacks and stroke .
But the Food and Drug Administration late on Monday slapped the product down with a so - called not - approvable letter .
“ The issuance of a not - approvable letter suggests a serious deficiency in the new drug application ” by Merck for the medicine , Leerink Swann analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a research note , calling the rejection surprising and disappointing .
Merck did not explain why the FDA spurned Cordaptive , other than to say the agency wants additional information on the drug .
It is an extended release form of niacin that is combined with a chemical meant to reduce flushing -- uncomfortable redness and burning of the face and neck that is a side effect of niacin .
Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson speculated the FDA rejection was due to the same type of blood - clot risk that had sparked the withdrawal of Merck ’s arthritis drug Vioxx , although no such risk has been reported from the medicine ’s clinical trial data .
“ A rejection by the FDA would either seem to mean that in the full dataset there was a signal that just was not presented , or that the FDA was worried instead about a theoretical safety issue that would only be seen with more widespread use of the product , ” Anderson said in a research note .
Anderson lowered by 7 percent his 2012 profit forecast , to $ 3.64 per share .
Other analysts speculated that the FDA , seen as increasingly cautious after the 2004 withdrawal of Vioxx and controversy over the failed Vytorin study , wo n’t clear Cordaptive until long - term trials establish it can prevent heart attacks and improve other health - related outcomes .
Nomura Code analyst Mike Ward noted that the FDA , in a recent draft of recommendations for the drug industry , calls for such outcomes studies where side effects are an issue .
“ We should clarify our position ” for makers of cholesterol drugs , Janet Woodcock , head of the FDA ’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research , told Reuters , adding that formal agency guidelines were a possibility .
But Woodcock declined to discuss specific cholesterol products , including Cordaptive .
Other analysts said the rejection raises doubts whether the FDA would be willing to approve another potentially lucrative Merck drug , now in development , that combines Cordaptive with Merck ’s older Zocor cholesterol fighter .
Citibank analyst George Grofik had predicted $ 1.4 billion in U.S. sales for Merck ’s experimental niacin - based cholesterol treatments , but on Tuesday stripped all the potential sales from his Merck forecast .
Consequently , Grofik cut his Merck per-share profit forecast to $ 3.59 in 2009 and $ 4.01 in 2010 , from his earlier projections of $ 3.62 and $ 4.12 , respectively .
Although Grofik noted it was “ still theoretically possible ” Cordaptive could be approved before data from long - term trials , now expected in 2011 , he said Merck ’s attractiveness is now “ less compelling . ”
Even so , he maintained his “ buy ” rating on the company , citing its lowered share valuation , 4 percent dividend yield and favorable sales - growth prospects for existing products -- including its Gardasil vaccine against the virus that causes cervical cancer .
The setback for Merck spelled good news for rival Abbott Laboratories Inc ABT.N , whose Niaspan drug is the leading niacin HDL - booster on the market .
Abbott shares closed up $ 1.87 , or 3.6 percent , at $ 53.48 on the New York Stock Exchange .
Merck fell $ 4.30 , or 10.4 percent , to $ 37.14 , also on the NYSE , after trading as low as $ 36.97 earlier .
Former fascist elected mayor of Rome
By Marianne Arens
3 May 2008
Two weeks after the victory of Silvio Berlusconi in the Italian parliamentary elections , the city of Rome , which for decades has been governed by centre - left parties , has fallen into the hands of the right wing .
On April 28 , Gianni Alemanno , a long - time member of the fascist movement with close links to prominent right - wing extremists , was elected mayor of the Italian capital .
In the mid-1990s , Alemanno had participated in the so - called “ Fiuggi turn , ” whereby a majority of Italian neo - fascists distanced themselves from the cult surrounding the figure of former fascist dictator Benito Mussolini and founded the National Alliance ( NA ) based on “ national conservative ” values .
Nevertheless , when Alemanno ’s victory was announced at the start of the week , his supporters responded in a manner powerfully evoking Italy under the dictator Mussolini .
Chanting “ Duce , Duce ” they celebrated their so - called “ liberation of Rome ” by giving fascist salutes in front of the city ’s town hall .
Mussolini ’s granddaughter , Alessandra Mussolini , was jubilant because the election of Alemanno took place exactly 63 years after the shooting of her grandfather by anti-fascist partisans .
As a youth , the now 50 - year - old Gianni Alemanno had joined the “ youth front ” of the fascist Movimento Sociale Italiano ( MSI ) and had a reputation for hooliganism in his activities as a fascist ringleader .
In 1988 , he took over the leadership of the youth front from Gianfranco Fini , who today heads the NA .
Alemanno is married to the daughter of Pino Rautis , who founded the MSI in 1946 and went on to set up the extreme - right terrorist organization Ordine Nuovo ( New Order ) in 1956 .
Today he leads his own ultra - right grouping .
Unlike his father - in - law , Alemanno joined the NA in 1994 , but he always belonged to the organisation ’s right wing — the so - called Destra Social ( Social Right ) .
The most important representative of Destra Sociale , Francesco Storace , has since split with the NA to form another ultra- right party , La Destra ( The Right ) .
La Destra supported Alemanno ’s election campaign in Rome .
Between 2001 and 2006 , Alemanno was also secretary of agriculture in Silvio Berlusconi ’s second government .
Although Alemanno trailed behind the candidate of the newly formed Democratic Party , Francesco Rutelli , in the first round of voting , he was able to emerge victorious in the second ballot held last weekend with a surprisingly comfortable lead of 53.7 to 46.3 percent of the vote .
The election turnout of 63 percent was over 10 percent lower than in the first ballot , which had taken place at the same time as the parliamentary elections .
As is the case with the reelection of Silvio Berlusconi as head of government 14 days ago , this latest result raises a serious question :
How is it possible for a fascist politician such as Gianni Alemanno to be elected as mayor of Rome , which is both the Italian capital and a leading European cultural metropolis ?
Immediately after the election the defeated opposition candidate , Francesco Rutelli , blamed a general “ turn to the right ” by the population for his defeat .
In reality , the answer lies with his own policies .
For years the politicians now leading the Democratic Party have unquestioningly implemented pro-business policies and therefore bear responsibility for the city ’s increasing social polarization .
In the course of their decades in power they were able to rely on political support from such organisations as Rifondazione Comunista ( Communist Refoundation ) , while the right wing was able to demagogically exploit the fears and worries of the population .
This same process resulted in the government led by Romano Prodi being voted out after just two years in office .
Now the consequences for Rome have been even more dramatic .
Rome , with its population of 2.7 million , has been governed for the past 15 years by administrations led by the two most important figures in the new Democratic Party , Francesco Rutelli and Walter Veltroni .
Rutelli , leader of the Christian - democratic alliance Margherita , was mayor from 1993 to 2001 .
Veltroni , a long - time functionary of the now defunct Italian Communist Party , then a leading member of the Left Democrats , was mayor from 2001 to 2008 .
Then following an initiative by Veltroni , the Left Democrats united with Margherita to form the Democratic Party last year .
Both Rutelli and Veltroni had won international praise for their work in improving the ambience of the “ eternal city ” by modernizing the city ’s traffic system and restoring the city ’s outstanding cultural heritage .
Veltroni was at home amongst cinema and artistic circles and even founded Rome ’s own film festival in 2006 .
But above all , it was tourists and the city ’s own upper - middle classes who were able to profit from such policies .
On the fringes of society and in the suburbs outside of the immediate city centre , hundreds of thousands were condemned to a struggle to survive — employed in low - paid , so - called precarious jobs , while food and energy prices have risen dramatically .
Less well - off families confront declining education and training opportunities for their children and are forced to pay high rents for unhealthy and small dwellings .
The elderly are forced to eke out their retirement with miserly pensions made even worse by inflation .
In the meantime , the crisis of the “ quarta settimana ” — the fourth week of the month when the family purse is empty — has become widespread .
Rome has undergone an unprecedented social decline during the past 15 years .
Soup kitchens have registered a sharp growth in poverty , with many single pensioners dependent on handouts and unable to survive on the minimum pension of € 500 per month .
An estimated 10,000 lack any proper accommodations , with around 4,000 living directly on the streets .
The newspaper Repubblica writes : “ The new poor are spreading both geographically and numerically and can be found on river banks , railway embankments and in barracks , tents and corrugated sheet dwellings under motorway bridges . ”
Above all , there is a lack of reasonably paid jobs for young people .
According to a report by the Caritas welfare organisation , around one third of those who receive food packages in the centre of Rome are between 18 and 35 years of age and have no income , although many of them have a good education or university degree .
There is also a marked increase in the number of entire families coming to the welfare centres .
Under these conditions , Gianni Alemanno has been able to profit from social discontent and frustration .
In his populist campaign he promised all manner of things : “ We will free Rome of fear , decline and poverty , ” he proclaimed , and among his list of promises was an increase in pensions .
He also sought to demagogically exploit the appalling living conditions in many of the city ’s suburbs , where large numbers of immigrants lacking proper residency permits live in slums .
In playing the nationalist and racist card , Alemanno singled out immigrants from Romania , particularly Sinti and Roma , calling for the deportation of “ 20,000 criminal foreigners . ”
On this issue he was able to rely on the backing of the Democrats .
Instead of addressing the urgent social questions that underlie the tensions between different nationalities , the Democrats joined in the anti-immigrant chorus .
It was no less a figure than Walter Veltroni who had pressurised the Prodi government to pass a decree for the classification of all European Union citizens who constituted “ a threat to public security . ”
And for his part , Francesco Rutelli reacted to his defeat by declaring that the problem was that the “ left ” had not been able to dominate in the debate over security issues .
There had been a similar reaction in the case of the former trade union secretary and role model of Italian petty - bourgeois radical circles , Sergio Cofferati , who after being elected mayor of Bologna launched a draconian law - and - order campaign aimed at ridding the city of immigrants .
There can be no doubt that the policies of the government led by Romano Prodi also played a role in the election results in Rome .
Both Veltroni and Rutelli are directly identified with the Prodi administration .
Rutelli was culture minister and vice - prime minister in the Prodi government , and Veltroni was expected to take over Prodi ’s political role as leader of the Democrats .
Just two years ago , Veltroni won over 60 percent of the vote in the first round of the Rome elections , soundly defeating Alemanno .
Now positions have been reversed in the election held last weekend .
Girl has just sat accross the sea to relax and taken off his shirt for sunbathe when shesaw a guy coming .
What do you think about the next may happen .
If I say " If you areshowing it , it is got to be perfect ! " maybe you may guess .
An add with sense of humor and enjoyment .
It 's funny and hilarious .

The country will see growth of about 2.7 % despite the housing slump and credit crunch , the annual Economic Report Of The President said .
However the report did warn that the troubles could dent growth .
Last week a $ 167bn economic stimulus package was approved by the Senate and House of Representatives .
The plan , which includes a series of tax rebates , is aimed at boosting the economy and avoiding a recession .
The Federal Reserve has slashed its key interest rate to 3 % as it tries to ensure economic momentum .
Like other central banks , it has also pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into money markets to boost liquidity .
Credit crunch
" Economic growth is expected to continue in 2008 , " the report said
" Most market forecasts suggest a slower pace in the first half of 2008 , followed by strengthened growth in the second half of the year . "
President George W Bush said that the annual report indicated " that our economy is structurally sound for the long term and that we 're dealing with uncertainties in the short term " .
The report , which some are seeing as too upbeat , predicts that annual growth in 2009 will accelerate to 3 % .
Figures released last month showed that US economic growth fell sharply in the last three months of 2007 as the credit crunch took effect .
The economy grew at an annual rate of just 0.6 % from October to December , the Department of Commerce said .
In the previous three months , between July and September , the economy was growing at an annual rate of 4.9 % .
The slowdown was triggered by a slump in building activity , which fell by 16.9 % , the biggest fall in 25 years , as housing prices collapsed .

He defeats his greatest childhood fear by becoming it and " Batman " is the result .

He seems to not only want vengeance but Punishment when it comes the criminals he goes after and will go through any means get both .
This of course spawned from the tragic death of his father when he was a kid .

The alcoholism , the take over of his company , him becoming homeless for a while , creating weapons of war for profit and of course the tragic death of his parents .

To me the Geek Pete was the ultimate mask .
No one ever suspects a friendless braniac loser with a hunch to be the super strong , wall crawling , web swinging hero .
I wanted to elongate his porportion and give him very lanky figure .
This look to me sort of makes him look more " SPIDER " like when he pops on the suit .

My daughter was born on April 7th of this year .
We went to Alta Bates hospital , in Berkeley , which was pre-approved by our insurance provider , Blue Shield .
At the hospital , as is often the case in baby deliveries , my wife asked for and received an epidural .
There was one Anesthesiologist in the entire hospital .
That anesthesiologist charged $ 1,032 for his services , which was passed on to Blue Shield .
After an initial refusal to pay , followed by several weeks of back and forth , they sent a letter dated May 14th that says :
This is in response to your inquiry concerning services provided by East Bay Anesthesiologist on April 07 , 2007 in the amount of $ 1,032.00 .
You contacted us to request that claim process at the preferred rate .
After careful consideration of this matter , we will , in this instance only , administratively approve payment for the above mentioned services .
The claim (s ) in question will be processed and an Explanation of Benefits will be sent shortly for you .
Please be advised that our determination in no way alters the terms and conditions of the subscriber 's plan .
In making this decision , we do not waive any of our rights to enforce the provisions of the subscriber 's plan on this or any other service plan or claim .
Well , that ended well , did n't it ?
Of course not .
This is the modern medical system we 're talking about .
Since that time , Blue Shield paid about $ 400 of that total , and refuses to pay the rest .
Meanwhile , the anesthesiologist 's office keeps threatening to send us to collections .
We 've literally called Blue Shield several times every single month since May , asking why they would n't pay the balance .
Each time , they assured us they would .
Then today , a service rep said they would pay no more .
They said that this sentence applied :
You contacted us to request that claim process at the preferred rate .
Their out is the line " preferred rate " .
And the preferred rate for that procedure was apparently around $ 400 .
Of course , we never asked them to process this at the " preferred rate " .
We ask them to pay for the service .
That 's why we 're paying over $ 800 / month in insurance premiums .
To be insured .
It gets worse , the office of the anesthesiologist has letters from Blue Shield claiming that the insurance company had sent us the money directly , so to bill us for the services .
Of course , we never received such money .
No such checks were ever cashed ( which would be easy enough to verify if they were really interested in the truth , and not shirking their duties ) .
So they lie to us , claiming for seven months that they 'll cover the procedure .
They lie to the anesthesiologist 's office , claiming they 've already paid us the amount owed , and to bill us directly .
And now , finally , they truth comes out -- they have a problem paying what 's owed and will refuse to do so , even though they sent us a letter saying they would .
As my wife tried to deal with Blue Shield , she asked the costumer service rep what her name was .
She said , " Diane . "
My wife asked for her last name .
The woman said , " I do n't have to give you that ! "
Then she hung up .
Nice .
How could a government - run service be any worse than these unaccountable , unethical , disgusting creeps ?
I can't wait to see all the stuff they 'll refuse to pay over my abdominal pain .

AMD ’s ATI division on Wednesday announced a new external graphics solution , known as XGP , that will allow discrete graphics modules mounted in an external chassis to be connected to laptop computers .
ATI ’s XGP is fully optimized for the new AMD Turion X2 Ultra notebook platforms , also announced on Wednesday .
ATI also announced the ATI Mobility Radeon HD 3800 graphics chip .
Finally , the company disclosed its new ATI PowerXpress feature , which basically is a version of its Hybrid Graphics technology for notebook PCs .
The XGP feature is being launched in conjunction with the ATI Mobility Radeon HD 3800 , AMD said .
Fujitsu announced support for the technology .
All told , the ATI Mobility Radeon HD 3800 series coupled with the AMD Turion X2 Ultra processors , the AMD 7 - Series chipset , and 802.11n technology make up the “ Puma ” platform , also announced on Wednesday .
The external graphics concept was first demonstrated as part of the Asus XG Station at the 2007 CES show .
A month later , the PCI Express SIG released an external cabling specification that was designed to allow for external graphics solutions , both for desktops as well as notebooks .
“ If you wanted to build a gaming machine with two or three or some ridiculous number of graphics cards , there would be a restriction by the chassis [ in terms of the number of slots ] , ” Ramin Neshati , chair of the PCI Express Technical Communication Working Group and a technology manager at Intel , said then .
“ In the future , you could remove those graphics cards and place them in a separate block . ”
AMD demonstrated XGP using four displays , with HDMI and integrated audio available to all four .
The cable was co-designed by AMD and Japan Aviation Electronics Industry , a PCI Express connector manufacturer .
It provides 4 Gbits /s bandwidth ; in a novel twist , the cable also serves as a USB connection to allow the external solution to serve as an external hub .
Executives described the technology as an ideal way to take a notebook to a business meeting , then return home and use the external graphics solution to play games .
Fujitsu announced plans to manufacture or at least offer one of the XGP solutions .
“ Powered by ATI Mobility Radeon HD 3870 in an external AMILO GraphicsBooster , the ultra mobile AMILO Sa 3650 , with ATI XPG technology , takes on two very different but equally compelling personalities , ” said Björn Fehrm , head of strategy and innovation for the consumer business at Fujitsu - Siemens Corp . ’s EMEA division .
” Use it for your daily computing with the internal graphics for outstanding mobility and battery life .
Dock it to your AMILO GraphicsBooster when coming home , in a hotel room or at a LAN event and now your gaming and multimedia performance is in another world . ”
The Mobility Radeon HD 3800 , meanwhile , offers three times the performance of the previous generation , AMD claimed .
The chip is manufactured in a 55 - nm process and uses a 256 - bit GDDR - 3 memory interface .
PowerXpress , meanwhile , is a means to let owners of the slightly older Radeon HD 3400 series graphics chips gain a boost in performance .
By combining the HD 3400 and an integrated AMD M780G with ATI Radeon HD 3200 graphics and plugging in the system into the way , the PowerXpress technology is triggered , allowing the two to work together to divvy up the rendering tasks .
オーム社開発部での開発体制
オーム社開発部さんでの本の作り方を取材させて頂きました。
社内で自作ツールをバリバリ作って、出版作業の効率化を行っているのが凄いと思いました。
ただし、今回取材をした内容が行われているのは、オーム社開発部のうちの1グループ(グループは約3名)です。
全体的にこの体制で行われているわけではないそうなので、ご注意下さい。
取材実現の経緯は「オーム社開発部の方とのやり取り」をご覧下さい。
Subversionでバージョン管理
著書の原稿は、XML管理されており、そのXMLはSubversionで全ての著者(監訳者)と共有されているそうです。
Subversionのサーバはインターネット上にあり、各自がリモートで作業を行える環境が整い始めているため、最近では著者と一度も会わずに本が完成するという案件もあるそうです。
フォントなどの問題から、本番環境でのPDF作成はオーム社開発部で毎日行っており、毎日のPDFはSubversionサーバに蓄積されていくような運用をしているそうです。
通常の方式である場合、出版社は原稿確認を著者に依頼し、その結果を反映させるためにDTP業者に外注をするそうです。
そのため、確認⇒反映⇒確認の作業に非常に時間がかかり、製本までに確認できる回数は最大でも3回ぐらいだったそうです。
現状では 、PDF作成までをツールで行えるようになったため、DTP作業が軽減され、開発期間とコストが大幅に短縮できるようになったそうです。
使っているツー ル
使っているツールは自作だそうです。 Schemeで書かれており、処理系はGaucheを使っているそうです。
一昨年の年末年始の休みの間に一気に作り上げたそうです。 その後は、徐々にソフトを成熟させながら利用していて、現在に至っているそうです。
先月発売された 「アジャイルプラクティクス」は、この手法でアジャイルに作られたそうです。
ツール詳 細
書籍用の原稿は全てXMLで書かれているそうです。 このXMLの仕様 はPragmatic Bookshelf社で利用しているものを利用しているとの事でした。
本当は、処理ツールも使わせてもらいたかったそうですが、非常に高い金額だったので断念して自作してしまったそうです。
このツールは、 「 make」コマンドを実行するとXMLで書かれた原稿をLatexへ変換します。 そして、そのLatexをコンパイルし、dvipdfmxでPDFを出力するそうです。
このツールの欠点としては、現状ではUNIX系環境でしか動作しないかもしれない点があるそうです。 これは、KAKASHIやGaucheなどでシステム依存する機能を使っているかも知れないからだそうです。
XMLで記述してからTEXへ自動変換しているのには理由があるそうです。
例えば、ソースコード例の最初に行番号を入れるような場合であっても、TeXでは全行の先頭に数字を入れなければならないそうです。
しかし、このシステムを使うと、XMLでattributeを使って指定するだけで行番号アリ/ナシを切り替えられるそうです。
さらに、プログラミング言語指定をattributeで指定して予約語だけを強調するようにしたり、メソッド名(関数名)を自動的に索引に入れたりすることもできるそうです。 例えば、language= " cs " はC#を表し、language =" ruby " はRubyを表しているそうです。
アジャイルプラクティ ス 106ページより、サンプルです。
XMLコード
< code number = " yes " language= " cs " > public int compute ( int val ) { int result = val << 1 ; //... その他コード ... return result ; } </code >
中間TeXコー ド
\ begin{cs}1 \ codebf{public} \ codebf{int} compute( \codebf{int} val ) {\protect\lsquash} \codebf{int} result = val << 1 ; //... その他コード ... \codebf{return} result ; {\protect\rsquash} \end{cs}
最終出力
1 public int compute ( int val ) 2 { 3 int result = val << 1 ; 4 //... その他コード ... 5 return result ; 6 }
単語を索引に入れるための専用XMLタグというのもあり、範囲を指定するとKAKASHIで漢字からかなに変換して、アイウエオ順の索引が平仮名を指定しなくても自動的に出来上がるそうです。
このような事をするにもXMLからTexの中間コード生成は便利だそうです。 なお、XMLタグを使用して読み仮名を手動で指定することも可能だそうです。
この体制が行い難かった書籍
マンガでわかる系の本では、この手法は使えなかったそうです。
例えば、漫画家が紙派であった場合、作業の多くが紙ベースで行われます。
このマンガでわかるシリーズは、専門家である原著者に文章を依頼することから始まるそうです。
出来上がった文章をシナリオ家に渡し、出来上がったシナリオを元に漫画家に発注するそうです。
これらの、漫画系の書籍はプロダクションに依頼して作る事が多く、
オーム社開発部が関わるのは、専門家である原著者との文書作成、シナリオ確認、漫画家選定、キャラデザイン選定、マイルストン毎のチェックなどであり、subversionで細かくチェックするような作業が行われる事はあまりないそうです。
仮に、マンガでわかる系の本には以下のようなものがあるそうです。
オープンソー ス
オーム社開発部には、個人のオープンソースプロジェクトとして汎用ツールを作っている人もいらっしゃるそうです。
IdeoTypeというXHTMLをPDF化する出版用ツールを公開しているそうです。 IdeoTypeは、最初に紹介した原稿管理システムとは別のもので、開発者も別です。
このオープンソースプロジェクトは2003年ぐらいにプロトタイプを作っており、去年と今年を未踏プロジェクトの支援を受けているとのことでした。
PMは公立はこだて未来大学の美馬先生だそうです。
IdeoTypeは、現在使われている社内ツールとは完全に別の実装で、すべて
個人がプライベートな余暇で進めているオープンソースプロジェクトである とのことでした。
現在使われている社内ツールは、現状の出版業務を効率化するために社外から入手した野良XMLをリバースエンジニアリングしたものである一方、IdeoTypeは広く使われる事を想定した設計にしてあるとのことでした。
IdeoTypeは、野良XMLを使うのではなくXSLTなどの汎用性のあるものを使ったものにしてあるそうです。
「 LISP を使えれば楽なんだけどなぁ」と思うこともあるそうですが、そこで手を抜かないようにしているそうです。
ただ、社内ツールでのノウハウなどをIdeoTypeに生かしていき、完成度を向上させていく予定であるそうです。
最近では、やっと社内の業務にも利用できそうな完成度になってきたとのことでした。
今後が楽しみなソフトウェアだと思いました。
IdeoTypeを作り始めたきっかけですが、XHTMLで書かれたものを印刷したかったというところから来ているそうです。
XHTMLをブラウザで印刷してもイマイチであり、最初はTEXに変換してから印刷というのをしていたそうです。
それを発展させていったら、XHTMLをコンパイルしてPDF化するようなBook Compilerを作り始めていたそうです。
「 ツールを使って一発で最終的なのものが出てくるというのを目指している。マウスのオペレーションが入っている限りはうまくいかないと思う。」という意見が印象的でした。
海外では 、Book Compilerという分野はある程度認知されている分野であるそうです。
国内ではまだあまり知られていないそうです。 例えば、USのオライリーでは、原稿データをXMLでデータベースに入れてしまって、必要に応じて取り出して、パイプラインに入れるという事を行っているそうです。
( 参考: O'Reilly TOC Conference : Evaluating and Implementing Tools and Processes for a Digital Workflow )
最後に
色々と話を伺いましたが、当初予想していたよりも、ずっとずっと深い話が聞けて驚きました。
「 深いですね」と聞くと「関わる著者の方々の影響が強いですね」というのが非常に印象的でした。
なお、この記事はオーム社内部で机をお借りして書いています。
取材をして、その場で原稿確認、そしてリリースを数時間で終了！！！。。。
の予定が最後の記事UPがProxyに阻まれてしまったので帰ってから投稿しています。
追記
このシステムを利用して本を書きました。

Further price rises this year have been widely predicted Data on people with low incomes could be shared with energy companies to help people pay their fuel bills .
The government wants to share details so extra cash from suppliers , as well as existing grants , can be better targeted at the elderly and vulnerable .
The initiative is part of a package of measures that energy regulator Ofgem hopes will alleviate fuel poverty .
But campaigners say the plans do not go far enough , and that poorer families will continue to face a fuel crisis .
Steep rises
The government estimates 2.5 million households are in fuel poverty - defined as when more than 10 % of household income is spent on fuel bills - but watchdog Energywatch says the figure is more than four million .
Concern for those on low incomes is growing since energy suppliers announced steep rises in the price of gas and electricity .
All the major suppliers announced double - digit increases in early 2008 , and more rises are expected by the end of the year .
The new fuel poverty measures announced today wo n't fix the problem - people will still be left out in the cold
Ed Matthew , Friends of the Earth
The plans at a glance Most of the energy companies have so - called " social tariffs " , and ministers are proposing that data identifying poorer families could be shared with the companies to ensure they pay the cheaper rates .
This could see information about who is on certain benefits shared with the suppliers , although new legislation would be needed to do this .
The government is planning for this with an amendment to the Pensions Bill which , subject to parliamentary approval , could come into force in the autumn .
Age Concern director general Gordon Lishman said that the sharing of data was " controversial , but justified " .
He added : " We feel strongly that the severe pressure of rapidly rising energy prices justifies this kind of action , providing the data is handled by a trusted third party and people are fully informed about the scheme and given the option to opt out . "
But Teresa Perchard , of Citizens Advice , said that there was public concern about handing out personal information to companies .
" We will be watching very carefully to see it is used wisely and people 's personal privacy is not abused , " she said .
Radical measures Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The charity estimates that 250,000 pensioners were pushed into fuel poverty by price rises earlier this year and has called for " radical new measures " .
In addition , £ 3 m in existing funding for general energy efficiency schemes will be set aside to help low income families wanting to generate their own power through heat pumps .
Ministers also want existing government programmes which help with energy efficiency to make sure people are aware of the help that is on offer .
The announcements follow an agreement last month which should see the energy companies putting an extra £ 225 m towards tackling fuel poverty over the next three years .
The government has taken away more from us than it has given .
Any additional help it can give us to help with the energy prices would be appreciated
Norman Russell , Essex
Readers ' reaction to the plans
In an annual household bill , the amount paid by energy suppliers which is then earmarked for energy efficiency schemes increased from £ 18 to £ 38 in April .
Energy minister Malcolm Wicks said it was important to provide " sustainable solutions " for the elderly , disabled people , and young families at risk from fuel poverty .
He also admitted that the prime minister 's announcement on developing new oil fields in the North Sea would have no impact on current fuel prices .
Fuel crisis
But the measures have not satisfied some charities and campaigners for fuel efficiency .
The National Housing Federation called for pre-payment meter charges - typically more than £ 100 higher than the average annual bill paid by direct debit - to be brought into line with standard rates .
Kate Jopling , of Help the Aged , said : " While it is welcome news that the government is moving in the right direction on fuel poverty , this initiative does not go nearly far enough to deal with the looming fuel poverty crisis . "
Ed Matthew of Friends of the Earth said : " The new fuel poverty measures announced today wo n't fix the problem - people will still be left out in the cold .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Those who are on higher incomes should not be subsidising those on lower incomes on everything .
S , The City " The only way to warm up our four million fuel - poor homes is to super - insulate them and help them produce their own energy .
" Chancellor Alistair Darling told the BBC that he disagreed with campaigners ' criticism that the plan was simply reshuffling old ideas .
" What we have done is that we 've reached an agreement with the power companies to increase the amount of money they spend in helping people get on to lower tariffs , helping people insulate their homes , " he said .
" There is an obligation now on all energy companies to help their customers cut their fuel bills by insulation and other measures as well . "
Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said energy companies had a £ 9bn windfall profit from the Emissions Trading Scheme .
" The government should simply insist that this massive subsidy enjoyed by the energy companies should be used to help the most vulnerable families with their fuel bills , " he said .

Why not to have a sexual predator on your TV show
Posted by Pete Berg on Friday , March 21st , 2008 at 7:53 am
There ’s nothing more beautiful than watching a man share his love with others .

WINSTON - SALEM , North Carolina ( Reuters ) - Republican presidential candidate John McCain said on Tuesday he would appoint judges in the mold of conservatives John Roberts , Samuel Alito and former Chief Justice William Rehnquist if he were elected in November .
In an excerpt from a speech McCain was to give in Winston - Salem on Tuesday , the Arizona senator said he would “ look for accomplished men and women with a proven record of excellence in the law , and a proven commitment to judicial restraint . ”
“ I will look for people in the cast of John Roberts , Samuel Alito , and my friend the late William Rehnquist -- jurists of the highest caliber who know their own minds , and know the law , and know the difference , ” McCain said .
Roberts , the current chief justice , and Alito were both named to the U.S. Supreme Court by Republican President George W. Bush .
Legal experts say they have helped move it to the right .
The court has the final word on questions of U.S. law and its rulings affect the rights of all Americans .
The court has been closely divided between liberal and conservative factions on such contentious issues as abortion , the death penalty and church - state separation .
Republicans and Democrats have battled frequently over judicial nominations , which must be voted on by the U.S. Senate .
McCain angered some conservatives in 2005 when he joined with a group of Democratic and Republicans senators on a compromise that averted a threat by leaders in the then - Republican - led Senate to prevent Democrats from blocking consideration of Bush ’s conservative judicial nominees .
In his speech on Tuesday , McCain criticized his Democratic rivals , Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama , for voting against the nominations of Roberts and Alito .
Referring to Obama , McCain said , “ Apparently , nobody quite fits the bill ( for the court ) except for an elite group of activist judges , lawyers , and law professors who think they know wisdom when they see it -- and they see it only in each other .

OK , I admit : I am experiencing " writer 's block . "
The material is here , it 's cool , I 've had my favorite breakfast ( homemade muesli , my personal recipe : 50 % oats , 50 % nuts , 50 % raisins - try to beat that ! ) , my trusty open source editor 's caret is blinking invitingly ( I know what you 're thinking : " Invitingly ?
Incurable geek ! " ) , yet I can't find a good introductory paragraph .
Reason for which I 'm resolving my angst , dear reader , by annoying you with these meta - writing quibbles in lieu of that good first paragraph .
But then this is a meta - programming column , right ?
Plus , you 're a C++ programmer , so you would hardly mind some extra syntax .
Now that we took the first paragraph problem out of the way , please allow me to introduce my long - time e-mail friend John Torjo , C++ expert , consultant , and " Practical C++ " columnist for http://builder.com.
John and I are co-authoring this article that describes John 's improved assertion framework .
After reading my article on assertions [ 1 ] , which is mainly the result of the discussion that Jason Shirk and I have had , John found it wanting .
More precisely , he found himself wanting more features from an assertion facility .
This happened because that article on assertions , and the code accompanying it , was using the Simple World Assumption .
This is a highly specialized scientific term that you may or may not know about , so please allow me to detail it a bit .
Under the Simple World Assumption , programmers work normal hours and have reasonable schedules .
They have the time and are given incentive to conduct code reviews and write tests .
Therefore , whatever failing assertions are planted in the code will be fired by the unit and integration tests .
Programmers test the code , debug it , make sure no assertion fails in comprehensive testing scenarios , and finally compile with NDEBUG defined and deliver a small and fast executable to their managers , who , in turn , take care of delivering it to a happy customer base .
By the way , under the Simple World Assumption , managers are considered competent people who help the programmers do their job and add no undue stress or overhead .
( As it turns out , the Simple World Assumption does not hold in practice .
Ahem . )
In a more realistic world , programmers endure significant schedule pressure as the norm , and therefore instead of writing unit tests , they throw the not - so - tested program over the fence to the black - box testing team , which creates bug reports together with the scenarios in which those bugs arise .
Figuring out exactly the sequence of events that leads to the manifestation of a bug is not always easy .
A rich state space , threads , or event - driven programming are going to make bug reproducibility quite difficult .
Random behavior created by uninitialized variables , ill casts , or buffer overruns only add to the fun .
Hey , I almost forgot the various system settings such as installed DLLs and registry settings ...
( Ever write an application that runs perfectly on your system and fails mysteriously on another ? )
A way to help the situation , John says , is to devise a better assertion framework that extends assertion 's charter .
Specifically :
There are multiple levels of assertions ; design errors come in more shades than just black and white .
At one extreme , there are the most obvious checks , the least likely to fail as the application becomes mature .
At the other extreme , there are " low - cost , high - utility " checks that you can leave in for the professional testers , beta testers , and sometimes even for the final users of your application .
I personally do n't enjoy the idea of the final users seeing the assertion messages , but John sure convinced me that that 's quite a possible scenario .
Besides , read below because there are various ways in which failing checks are reported .
Displaying messages is not enough , especially when the development and the testing teams are separated .
A logging facility would be extremely useful ; after a failing run , the developers can take a look at what assertion ( or sequence of assertions ) failed .
The quality of the messages is greatly improved , containing detailed information not only about the failed expression , file , and line , but also ( under programmer 's control ) the values of related variables .
All of these extra features come in an industry - strength package , building on the original assertion code , to which John added some tricks also used in the Enforcements article [ 2 ] and many of his own .
We will detail below how the improved assertion package works .
Providing Extra State Information
When an assertion fails , it means the expression that ASSERT evaluates is false .
Often , however , you might be interested in knowing the actual values of key variables that caused the assertion to fail .
For example , consider that at a point you are confident that two strings are empty .
So you write :
string s1 , s2 ; ... ASSERT ( s1.empty ( ) && s 2.empty ( ) ) ;
Should this assertion fail , it is very likely you 'd want to know what the actual content of myString was ; that would provide insight into where it was last updated .
John 's framework allows you to do that by using the syntax :
SMART_ASSERT ( s1.empty ( ) && s2.empty ( ) ) ( s1 ) ( s2 ) ;
Notice the use of the parentheses that offer a nice extensible way to provide extra arguments to ASSERT , similar to ENFORCE [ 2 ] ( yet , of course , ENFORCE would not be the first component that uses operator ( ) in that particular style ) .
When doing so , if the assertion fails , the message displayed and logged will look like this :
Assertion failed in matrix.cpp : 879412 : Expression : ' s1.empty ( ) && s 2.empty ( ) '
Values : s1 = " Wake up , Neo " s2 = " It 's time to reload . "
Here 's how the magic works .
Get ready for something quite tricky , but definitely worth knowing .
( To understand and enjoy it , you need to wake up your inner C macro lover . )
First , the basic idea is that to grab the name and the value of a variable , you need to use the " stringizing " operator # .
In the example above , you need to use the stringizing operator on myString , But the stringizing operator works only when inside a macro , and here 's what makes everything so tricky : you need an " infinitely expansible " macro mechanism - a macro that expands into something that can be continued as a macro ( so you can collect more variables s3 , s 4 ... ) .
But we all know that recursive macros do n't work .
However , the trick is doable if you press the gas pedal , open the sunroof , and hold the antenna with your left hand at the same time .
Credits are due to Paul Mensonides , the one who ( as far as we know ) invented this trick .
Here 's what you need to do :
First , inside your Assert class ( defined and used much as the homonym class in my previous article ) , add two member variables SMART_ASSERT_A and SMART_ASSERT_B .
Their type is Assert& .
class Assert { ... public : Assert& SMART_ASSERT_A ; Assert& SMART_ASSERT_B ; // whatever member functions Assert& print_current_val ( bool , const char* ) ; ... } ;
Make sure you initialize these members with * this .
The whole purpose of all this is that , if you have an object of type Assert called obj , you can write obj .
SMART_ASSERT_A or obj.
SMART_ASSERT_B
- and the whole entity will behave just like obj itself , given that the references refer to * this .
Second - and here 's the cool trick - define two macros SMART_ASSERT_A and SMART_ASSERT_B that kind of " recurse to each other " .
Here 's how :
#define SMART_ASSERT_A(x ) SMART_ASSERT_OP( x , B ) #define SMART_ASSERT_B(x ) SMART_ASSERT_OP( x , A ) # define SMART_ASSERT_OP( x , next ) \ SMART_ASSERT_A.print_current_val (( x ) , #x ) .
SMART_ASSERT_
## next
As you can see , when you invoke SMART_ASSERT_A ( xyz ) , it will expand into something that ends with SMART_ASSERT_B .
When you invoke SMART_ASSERT_B ( xyz ) it will expand into something that ends with SMART_ASSERT_A .
During the expansion the two macros grab the value xyz you passed and its representation as string .
Yes , it is tricky .
One observation that helps with understanding this trick is that , when the preprocessor sees an open parenthesis after SMART_ASSERT_A ( or _B ) , it treats that as a macro invocation .
If there 's no parenthesis , the preprocessor just leaves the symbol alone .
When left alone , the symbol is just a member variable .
Here 's the SMART_ASSERT definition that starts the tandem action of the two macros :
# define SMART_ASSERT ( expr ) \ if ( ( expr ) ) ; \ else make_assert ( # expr ) .print_context ( __FILE__ , __LINE__ ) .
SMART_ASSERT_A
If at this point you say " Aha ! " you 're saying exactly what I said after looking over the code for the twentieth time .
Ok , now let 's follow how the macros expand starting from the initial expression :
SMART_ASSERT ( s1.empty ( ) && s2.empty ( ) ) ( s1 ) ( s2 ) ;
Let 's first expand SMART_ASSERT .
( We wo n't necessarily obey the order in which the preprocessor does things , but for clarity 's sake , we 'll break down the process in bite - sized chunks .
Also , we 'll take the liberty to reformat the code as we expand . )
if ( ( s1.empty ( ) && s2.empty ( ) ) ) ; else make_assert( " s1.empty ( ) && s 2.empty ( ) " ) .
print_context ( " matrix.cpp " , 879412 ) .
SMART_ASSERT_A(s1 ) ( s2 ) ;
Now let 's expand SMART_ASSERT_A and the resulting SMART_ASSERT_OP :
if ( ( s1.empty ( ) && s2.empty ( ) ) ) ; else make_assert( " s1.empty ( ) && s 2.empty ( ) " ) .
print_context ( " matrix.cpp " , 879412 ) .
SMART_ASSERT_A.print_current_val (( s1 ) , " s1 " ) .
SMART_ASSERT_B(s2 ) ;
Notice how SMART_ASSERT_A is not treated as a macro anymore because it is not followed by a ( .
Expanding SMART_ASSERT_B
and the resulting SMART_ASSERT_OP gives us the final answer :
if ( ( s1.empty ( ) && s2.empty ( ) ) ) ; else make_assert( " s1.empty ( ) && s 2.empty ( ) " ) .
print_context ( " matrix.cpp " , 879412 ) .
SMART_ASSERT_A.print_current_val (( s1 ) , " s1 " ) .
SMART_ASSERT_A.print_current_val (( s2 ) , " s2 " ) .
SMART_ASSERT_A ;
This , considering that SMART_ASSERT_A is a member variable and that all member functions return a reference to Assert , is a perfectly well formed statement .
Handling and Logging
When an assertion fails , two things happen in sequence :
The failure information is being logged
The failure is being handled depending on its level
The two activities are completely orthogonal and can be customized in separation .
You can , for example , have a mode in which you never ask for input on error but you still log all errors , which is very useful in automated runs , push installation , or your " innocent user protection program . "
You can customize logging by passing your own logger function to the static member function Assert:: set_log ( void ( * assert_handler ) ( const assert_context & ) ) .
You can define your own assertion handler and plug it in ( in the time - honored set_unexpected manner ) by calling Assert : : set_handler ( level , void ( * assert_handler ) ( const assert_context & ) ) .
assert_context contains the acquired context of the failed assertion , explained below .
Not Just One Type of Assert
As many senior programmers have noticed , an application can have different levels of assert , some more critical than others .
Let 's look at how asserts are used .
Typically , you use assertions when you assume some situations will never occur ( i.e. , you expect a size or an index variable to never be negative ) .
Sometimes you couple assertions with defensive programming ( writing your code in such a way that it will " survive " invalid input ) , but not always .
In the latter case , it could be better to throw an exception .
Look at the following code :
void install_program ( User & user , const char * program_name ) { // only admins can install programs ASSERT ( user.get_role( ) == " admin " ) ; ... }
In case the user is not an administrator , you 'll prefer to throw an exception ( otherwise the user could get away with doing forbidden things ) .
Just change it to :
void install_program ( User & user , const char * program_name ) { // only admins can install programs SMART_ASSERT ( user.get_role( ) == " admin " ) .error ( ) ; ... }
We have 4 levels of assertions :
lvl_warn ( it 's just a warning , the program can continue without user intervention )
( it 's just a warning , the program can continue without user intervention ) lvl_debug ( it 's the default , the usual assert )
( it 's the default , the usual assert ) lvl_error ( an error )
( an error ) lvl_fatal ( it 's fatal , it 's most likely the program / system got unstable ) .
Each level can be handled differently .
Thus , we have a handle per level .
The defaults are :
Warning : dump a message and continue program
Debug : ask the user what to do ( Ignore / Debug /etc . )
Error : throw an exception ( std::runtime_error )
Fatal : abort the program .
You can rely on the defaults , or , as said above , changing the handler is as easy as :
Assert::set_handler( lvl_error , my_handler ) ;
Here 's how you set the level of the assertion :
SMART_ASSERT ( user.get_role( ) == " admin " ) .
level ( lvl_error ) ; SMART_ASSERT ( user.get_role( ) == " admin " ) .
level ( lvl_debug ) ; // this is the default SMART_ASSERT ( user.get_role( ) == " admin " ) . level ( lvl_fatal ) ; SMART_ASSERT ( user.get_role( ) == " admin " ) .
level ( lvl_warn ) ; // shortcuts SMART_ASSERT ( user.get_role( ) == " admin " ) .error ( ) ; SMART_ASSERT ( user.get_role( ) == " admin " ) .debug ( ) ; SMART_ASSERT ( user.get_role( ) == " admin " ) .
fatal ( ) ; SMART_ASSERT ( user.get_role( ) == " admin " ) .warn ( ) ;
Acquiring Context
When an assertion fails , it is up to you how you 'd like it handled .
For instance , you can decide to ignore it ( if it 's a warning ) , throw an exception , or the like .
But most important , in case you decide to display it , you can choose how the data is laid out and what data is shown .
You might choose to just show a simple message and have an " Advanced " option similar to Figure A .
You can customize logging in a similar manner .
In order to allow this , when an assertion fails , it acquires context : the file , line it occurred on , its level , the expression that evaluated to false , and the values involved in the expression .
Grabbing the __FILE__ and __LINE__ context is done in a similar manner to that described in [ 1 ] .
class assert_context { public : // where the assertion failed : file & line std::string get_context_file ( ) const ; int get_context_line ( ) const ; // get / set expression void set_expr ( const std:: string & str ) ; const std :: string & get_expr ( ) const ; typedef std :: pair < std::string , std::string > val_and_str ; typedef std::vector < val_and_str > vals_array ; // return values array as a vector of pairs : // [ Value , corresponding string ] const vals_array & get_vals_array ( ) const ; // adds one value and its corresponding string int add_val ( const std :: string & val , const std:: string & str ) ; // get / set level of assertion void set_level ( int nLevel ) ; int get_level ( ) const ; // get /set ( user - friendly ) message void set_level_msg ( const char * strMsg ) ; const std:: string & get_level_msg ( ) const ; } ;
Usually , when logging , you 'll want to record as much information as possible .
Thus , most of the time you 'll be happy with the default logger , which writes out everything in the context .
Handling is at the other extreme .
There are countless ways of handling an assert :
Just ignore it
Show only a summary to the user ( the file : line it appeared on , and the expression )
Show all details to the user on the console
Throw an exception
Show summary / details on a UI - dialog .
Abort with core dump , etc .
As your application reaches the beta state , you 'll be happy with the defaults .
However , as it matures and reaches a larger number of customers , you 'll want finer control .
You 'll almost certainly want to override the default handlers and provide your own .
A customer - friendly handler could simply look like this :
// show a message box with two buttons : " Ignore " and " Ignore All " void customerfriendly_handler ( const assert_context & ctx ) { static bool ignore_all = false ; if ( ignore_all ) return ; std::ostringstream out ; if ( ctx.msg ( ) .size ( ) > 0 ) out << msg ( ) ; else out << " Expression : '" << ctx.get_expr ( ) << " ' failed ! " ; int result = message_box ( out.str ( ) ) ; if ( result == do_ignore_all ) ignore_all = true ; } // putting it in place Assert:: set_handler ( lvl_debug , customerfriendly_handler ) ;
User -Friendly Messages
As said in the introduction , it 's not always you who 's debugging your program .
Senior programmers keep telling you to document your code .
The same goes for asserts .
When an assertion fails , you 'll want to know what that means .
Let 's look at a well - behaved ASSERT :
// too many users !
ASSERT ( nUsers < 1000 ) ;
Should this assertion fail , the more or less informative message " nUsers < 1000 " will be displayed and logged .
A step forward would be to allow showing an explanatory string , which would give higher - level semantics to the expression :
SMART_ASSERT ( nUsers < 1000 ) ( nUsers ) .msg (
" Too many users ! " ) ;
This is quite a neat solution , because it makes the code more self - documenting and also makes the error message more meaningful .
The msg ( ) member function does not change the level of the assertion .
The level ( ) member function sets the level while you can also provide an optional message .
Helper functions are provided in order to change the level to warn , debug , error , fatal and eventually set a message at the same time .
Take a look :
// using level ( ) SMART_ASSERT ( nUsers < 1000 ) ( nUsers ) . level ( lvl_debug , " Too many users ! " ) ; SMART_ASSERT ( nUsers < 1000 ) ( nUsers ) . level ( lvl_error , " Too many users ! " ) ; // using helpers SMART_ASSERT ( n Users <= 900 ) ( nUsers ) . warn ( " Users aproaching max ! " ) ; SMART_ASSERT ( nUsers < 1000 ) ( nUsers ) . debug (
" Too many users ! " ) ; SMART_ASSERT ( nUsers < 1000 ) ( nUsers ) .error ( " Too many users ! " ) ; SMART_ASSERT ( nUsers < 1000 ) ( nUsers ) . fatal ( " Too many users ! " ) ;
Ignorance Is Bliss
In case you 're dealing with someone else 's code ( which sometimes cannot be altered ) , and an assertion fails repeatedly , you 'll be happy to know there 's an " Ignore Always " option .
" Ignore Always " works as advertised in [ 1 ] , but under the hood it uses a different implementation : it remembers the file and line of all failed assertions that were answered with " Ignore Always . "
This mechanism makes the assumption that you wo n't have two SMART_ASSERT s on the same line .
The advantage is that interesting levels of granularity - such as " ignore all assertions in file xyz.cpp " - are now possible .
" Ignore All " is useful for non-programmers using your app .
In case many assertions fail in a row , the user will prefer using the " Ignore All " option .
Also , testers can use " Ignore All " to speed up testing because they know assertions will be logged .
You can define your own handling strategies .
For example , John 's own complete implementation [ 3 ] defines a two - way persistence mechanism that makes " Ignore Always " and " Ignore All " work throughout consecutive runs of your program , which is quite neat .
What About the Release Mode ?
The traditional way of using ASSERT is as a debugging tool .
The strength of ASSERT s stems from their no -cost promise -- they are not present in the released build ( in release mode , it 's like they 've never been there -- no overhead whatsoever ) .
However , this is not always the best approach .
Sometimes the customer wants a release version of your program ( due to efficiency issues ) .
In release mode , all asserts are gone , so bugs are very difficult to track .
In the early stages of development , you 'll want to keep assertions in release as well .
Heck , even Windows NT had a Debug version to make it easier for programmers .
You should also note that in debug mode , it is not necessarily the ASSERT s that bring down the speed of the program , but rather the compiler flags instructing it not to optimize the code .
So , keeping ASSERT s in release ( optimized ) mode might not slow it down much in many cases .
Using SMART_ASSERT
, it is very easy to turn on / off SMART_ASSERT s by using the SMART_ASSERT_DEBUG_MODE macro .
In case you do n't define it , defaults are : SMART_ASSERT s are present in debug mode , and gone in release mode .
If you choose to define it , here is what you need to do :
#define SMART_ASSERT_DEBUG_MODE
0 // SMART_ASSERTs are off ( gone ) # define SMART_ASSERT_DEBUG_MODE
1 // SMART_ASSERTs are on ( present )
Finally , there are some asserts that you will want present in release mode , even though they might incur some ( small ) overhead .
These are usually the most critical parts of your code .
SMART_VERIFY acts like SMART_ASSERT , with two differences : - SMART_VERIFY works in both debug and release modes - SMART_VERIFY 's default level is error ( lvl_error ) , while SMART_ASSERT 's default level is debug ( lvl_debug ) .
This is expectable , since if a SMART_VERIFY fails , it 's most likely that the program could crash if it continues on its normal path ( therefore , an exception will be thrown ) .
Here 's an example :
Widget *p = get_nth_widget( n ) ; SMART_VERIFY ( p ) ( n ) .msg ( " Widget does not exist " ) ; // if p were null , and we reached this point , the program would most likely crash .
p->print_widget_info( ) ;
Conclusion
John 's work constructs a full - featured , industrial - strength assertion facility .
It remains as true as ever that using assertions is a key ingredient of successful programs ( and programmers , for that matter ) .
Now things just got better with a tool that makes it easy for you to define , use , and analyze invariants for your applications .
Happy asserting !

Q84 : Several sources ask :
With rising temperatures are we seeing cockroaches flying more ?
Ans : All ,
The increased gliding flight of pest cockroaches might be expected in a hot NYC because they have a preferred temperature range which is between 75 °F and 86 °F .
Below that temperature they will move to a warmer one if they can find it .
Above 86 °F they will try to find a cooler temperature .
So , in a hot NYC the roaches will be climbing and gliding down to find that cooler temperature .
In addition , in a drought they will be looking for water , particularly because above 86 °F their cuticle lipids allow water to evaporate from their body much faster and they will dehydrate unless they find water .
Hot temperatures and lack of water will keep the roaches jumping or they will die .
That is why they have survived since they evolved 250 million years ago .
Unfortunately they have staying power .
Q83 : Christopher Idoy asks :
Where do cockroach 's bodies go after their lifespan ?
Ans : Christopher ,
In nature , wild cockroaches that die of old age are usually on the forest floor under some leaf liter or under some loose bark .
There the omnipresent bacteria and molds will degrade them relatively quickly and thus they are recycled .
Most cockroaches do not die of old age .
Most are eaten by a predator such as a mouse or shrew or spider .
The household pest cockroach may more likely die of old age and will likely dry up and grow some mold if not vacuumed up in the routine cleaning of the living spaces .
If they die in a partition , their dried up bodies may accumulate if not eaten by a beetle larva such as a carpet beetle or silverfish or another cockroach .
Eventually they will be recycled also .
More important is the question of where do their cuticles go when they molt and also when they die .
If not eaten by the newly molted individual , the shed cuticle may crumble or be ground into the dust of a room .
That cuticle contains the antigen that causes childhood asthma .
That is one good reason to vacuum up the dust from carpets and floors so that the level of the cockroach antigen is kept low enough not to irritate the immature immune systems of children .
It seems that the immature immune system can be hyper sensitized by the cockroach antigen and other household dust borne items such as dust mites .
That is to be avoided .
Q82 : Charlie asks :
Everytime there 's a Cockroach in my house , and I 'm about to kill it ...
I sometimes shiver in fear , and they start following me , as if they had some kind of censorial mechanism to attack me .
In one of the cases , one flew towards me .
Can Cockroaches sense fear from , transmitted from , human bodies ?
Ans : Charlie ,
Your characterization of cockroaches goes beyond their capabilities as they are currently understood .
As presented in my FAQ the cockroach is presented as fairly dumb .
Their basic instincts are to seek our environmental cues in an established order : thirst > hunger > sex .
Temperature of their environment fits somewhere in there .
If their water needs are not satisfied their primary goal would be to find water which they can sense in a directional way .
They can follow humidity up a gradient to a water source .
When their water need is solved they would next seek out food , and so on ....
Sensing your fear is way beyond their capacity .
If you are sweating due to fear , perhaps they could be sensing the water coming from your sweat and approach you to get water .
The ' sensorial mechanism ' in this case would be activated based on their water thirst .
Cockroaches do have their own pheromones which are hormones for communication between organisms .
A fear hormone is talked about for mammals including humans but it would be a real stretch at this point to accept your characterization of the cockroach behavior you report as a sensing of your fear .
I would eliminate the primal cockroach sensations as possible causes before I jumped to an as yet unknown sensory mechanism for cockroaches .
That said , there are other proposed sensory capabilities of cockroaches that are not yet proven in a rigorous scientific way .
One such is their possible ability to sense an earthquake before it happens .
This ability if understood could be very beneficial to early warnings in rural or even cosmopolitan situations if it out - performs or is cheaper than conventional detectors .
Similarly , a cockroach fear - sensor could be very useful if it could be calibrated and validated to reliably detect fear .
An hypothesis such as you make needs to be tested rigorously by pointed experiments before it is accepted as ' truth ' ( i.e. not rejected ) .
Q81 : Angelo asks :
I recently went to open my refrigerator door and sure enough , there was a roach inside on the refrigerator shelf .
It got away , unfortunately , but made me wonder ... How ?
Ans : Angelo ,
Most refrigerators chill food to < 40 ° F or 2 - 4°C .
At 4 °C pest cockroaches are inactive .
They will not eat or drink at that temperature .
They will be torpid .
My guess is that the roach was hiding in the crevice of your frig door and dropped down into the frig when you opened the door .
If it had been in the frig all the time it would barely be able to move and could not escape .
Q80 : Yna Lim asks :
What are the contents of a cockroach brain that makes it a possible antibiotic against MRSA and Escherichia coli ?
Ans : Yna ,
The brain is a very important organ in an animals life and survival .
It fights all sorts of attacks from invading organisms and also anything that might disrupt its function .
All living organisms fight against microorganisms using whatever they are able to discover through the evolutionary filter of survival of the fittest .
Ergo , we find an anti-cancer drug from the Yew tree 's bark .
There is not enough
Yew tree bark to provide the amount of its anti-cancer substance needed .
We have learned how to synthesize this drug without killing Yew trees .
For some reason , the cockroach brain has developed a unique general approach to antibiotics about which you seem to have heard .
Insects do not have the highly - targeted immune response that we have , i.e. IgG , IgA , IgM , t- cells , etc .
They have general responses to fighting against microbes .
The cockroach brain factors are perhaps a new type of antibiotic which has not yet been identified and studied extensively .
I have only read about it in news reports and the discoverers are keeping the details that they know somewhat close to their vest perhaps because they are in the process of discovery that is needed to apply for a patent .
Also the criteria for publishing in a peer - reviewed journal are more stringent that those for reporting phenomena at a conference .
They are perhaps playing the wise strategy of giving a little bit of info to the public to stimulate interest and perhaps private / public investment until they have enough info to publish in a professional journal or patent the technique .
I am not sure what the British patent law is like vs the USA law .
In Europe one can not patent a life - saving protocol .
In America you can .
In America you need to patent a protocol soon after you make the details public in a journal or you lose the right to patent .
The most profitable approach would be to keep quiet about technical details until you to get a USA patent on the protocol / substance .
For that reason we may not know the details of this story until the financial issues are settled .
There are many such discoveries that never pan out .
However , if it is actually one or several new ways of fighting bacteria then understanding them could lead to new families of antibiotics that could be new treatments for the growing number of antibiotic - resistant - bacterial - strains such as MRSA ( Methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus ) which no longer are controlled by their previously effective antibiotic .
Q79 : Scarlet asks :
We bought two female cockroaches about seven months ago , and ... one ... has recently given birth ...?
They are both ... female , and she gave birth about six months after we got her , which is too long for her to have gotten pregnant in the ( pet ) shop is n't it ?!
Even stranger is that she has given birth twice now ( we think ) but only to about three cockroaches each time .
Ans : Scarlet ,
Cockroaches need to mate only once to produce up to 3 or more sequential batches ( oothecae ) of fertilized eggs .
They store the sperm in an internal storage location and use it as needed .
Sometimes the last batches of hatching embryos are small in number because the sperm was running out .
Also the paired ovaries are made up of ovarioles which are strings of maturing oocytes .
Only the terminal oocyte of an ovariole gets ovulated and fertilized to participates in a current ootheca .
Sometimes the ovarioles develop tumors which then inactivates that ovariole from participating in a current or future ootheca .
Sometimes if the female is not well fed and well supplied with water an embryo will die before hatching .
Several phenomena contribute to how many offspring you will have .
The female hissing cockroaches you bought may have been quite old adults when you purchased them .
They do not show their age externally .
With fresh larvae hatched to rear , you can control their health and growth by how well you treat them .
The males usually metamorphose to the adult stage first , sometimes an instar earlier than the females .
Feed the larval males and females well with a low nitrogen diet .
Mix ground dog biskit with corn starch to dilute the amount of protein nitrogen , moisten it with a bit of water and bake it into your own custom roach biskits .
Too much nitrogen will give the cockroaches a form of gout , excess uric acid in their waste and their fat bodies .
This gout can lead to an early death of your pet cockroaches .
They are healthier if you feed them something like 10 - 15 % dog biskit with 85 - 90 % cornstarch .
Give them a banana or carrot slice occasionally .
Keep their container relatively clean and look at their fecal pellets to see if they have too much uric acid in them .
They will be white if they have too much uric acid .
A healthy first parturition female Gromphadorhina portentosa can have 40 - 60 live offspring at each birth as you have read .
Good luck .
PS : Virgin births ( parthenogenesis ) is known among cockroaches !
Q78 : Scøut asks :
I ... wonder if you might help me with ( a ) hypothetical : Say someone had found a cockroach that had been living near water and food contaminated by runoff from a golf course .
It appears normal accept that it 's roughly the size of a shoebox .
How might you go about trying to explain such a thing ?
In your section on the Roach 's size being regulated by its respiratory system and wondered if the two things might be connected ? `
Ans : Scøut ,
The possibility that a local phenomenon , pollution runoff at a golf course , could be the basis for the appearance of a ' hopeful monster ' is an unlikely outcome .
The concept of a ' hopeful monster ' , your ' shoebox sized cockroach ' , is not new and you can read about such phenomena , which was most recently described by the late Stephen Jay Gould .
Find out about this phenomenon by googling ' hopeful monster ' .
The runoff from a traditional golf course while perhaps not healthy for the surrounding environment is more a stimulus to normal growth , not a mutagenic event , which is what might cause ' hopeful monsters ' .
The situation that the resultant overgrown cockroach was the size of a shoebox but otherwise normal would require a substantial genetic change .
The change from a Periplaneta size ( 4 cm ) to a shoebox size ( 33 cm ) would have required the normal increase form stage to stage ( 1.25X the previous size ) to be applied at least 9 times .
One additional molt is not unusual in insects but nine additional molts would be very unusual and would need invocation of a ' hopeful monster ' event .
Q77 : Kelly asks :
What other insects or arachnids are related to the cockroach ?
Are scorpions or lobsters ?
Ans : Kelly ,
Cockroaches are in the insect order Dictyoptera , which , to some , is a super order of the cockroaches , termites and preying mantids .
In my mind , this is a firmly established group based on molecular as well as morphological and physiological evidence .
I myself have published immunological evidence that the termites are like another family of cockroaches with the preying mantids being more distant from both termites and cockroaches .
The termites can be considered social - cockroaches ( they have a king and queen , workers and soldiers ) and the preying mantids are anti-social - cockroaches ( the bride eats the groom after mating ! ) .
The cockroaches are also a member of an old - school ragged group of insects called the Orthopteroids which include grasshoppers , crickets , stick insects .
This old group is based primarily on similarity in form and did not include the termites and mantids .
This old school ignored the modern DNA and protein sequence data as well as physiological and internal organ morphology and physiology ; i.e. it was ' really old - school ' .
The orthopteroids are certainly distinct from the ' modern insects ' including beetles , bees and wasps , butterflies and flies .
The orthopteroids are also more evolved than the so - called nerve wing insects including the dragonflies and lacewings and mayflies and dobsonflies .
As basically winged insects , the Orthopteroids and all higher insects are more advanced than the wingless insects which include the silverfish and proturans .
No , the cockroaches are more distantly related to other insects and yet more distantly to other arthropods such as spiders ( arachnids ) and crustaceans ( shrimp , crabs and lobsters ) .
But , recent evidence has connected insects more closely to crustaceans , which would make a cockroach more closely related to a lobster or crab or wood louse than to a spider .

Q76 : Sue asks :
... In one of ( your ) FAQs , someone asked about roaches making sounds , and you replied that to the best of your knowledge the ( pest species ) did n't communicate through sounds .
However , one thing I noted at one point when my home was suffering a rather bad infestation of American roaches is that at night I would hear a clicking sound , very similar to the sound made when a person snaps a fingernail and thumbnail together .
If I made this snapping noise with my fingernails , I 'd get a chorus of " replies . "
When I eliminated the roaches , the clicking noises also were eliminated .
So although the evidence is a bit circumstantial , I believe that the American roach actually communicates via this clicking sound , perhaps a mating call ?
Ans : Sue ,
Good observation !
That sound might fall within the realm of stridulation which I mentioned about some species of cockroach .
One might ask how stridulation developed evolutionarily and it might have started with a few clicks of the roach wings or limbs against one another .
Your experiment with inducing them to click is particularly telling .
I would think that rather than mating , which has been studied fairly thoroughly , that the clicking might be a warning that is transmitted through the roach world .
In certain species of the closely related termites the large headed soldiers do head - knocking behavior in their wooden galleries , banging their little heads against the wooden walls which sends an alarm signal to the rest of the colony .
Alarm - signal evidence in cockroaches would be an important finding .
It would be further evidence of a social structure beyond mating much as white - tailed deer flash their tails or turkeys gobble a warning to fellow turkeys when danger arises .
You may not be willing to recreate the environment in which the roaches were clicking and could respond to your nail - snaps but that would be necessary in order to design experiments to test your ' communication hypothesis ' .
Someone may read this in my FAQ and do just that .
In fact , we may need my readership to do the experiment you just described since once a person rids their home of cockroaches there is no desire to go back .
Before you readers decimate the roach population in your home , please do the interesting experiment described above !
Q75 : Kevin asks :
We are the producers of a commonly used household item .
My question is this , we distribute product to off sight clearing houses ( shipping consolidators ) .
Recently we delivered a job to such a facility and they in turn got the product to the ultimate customer the next day .
When the customer started opening the 20 some boxes he started finding cockroaches .
By the time he had emptied the boxes he had found and killed ten roaches .
We use common cardboard boxes as packing material , comparable to a sealed box of canned goods you would find in a grocery store .
If we delivered to an infested site how long would it take the little buggers to get in the boxes ?
I know this particular job did not sit on their dock for more than 12 hours .
Ans : Kevin ,
Cockroaches are active for the four hours after the normal ' lights out ' in a building .
Your shipment was presumably packed in the evening and sat in the dark , perhaps still somewhat open , at the end of business .
The cockroaches became active and then after their four hours of activity they sought a hiding place for the coming day .
Some hid in your packages and then were found upon eventual delivery the next day .
Q74 : Tara asks :
Growing up , my room was the only room in my parents house that cockroaches completely infested .
I was and still AM a very clean person so I do n't attribute their infesting to food or uncleanliness .
I 've had cockroaches drop on me in the middle of the night countless times , fly directly at me , fall on me in the shower , crawl underneath my pillow / couch cushion sit on my purse strap or inside my purse , crawl in my shoes / clothes , crawl in my drawers , etc. .... ( Are ) cockroaches ... attracted to my scent , is that possible ?
Ans : Tara ,
In 2005 scientists at Cornell and NC State , including my good colleague Coby Schal , identified the elusive hormone that attracts the male of Blattella germanica to the female .
A news release of that discovery can be viewed at URL :
http://www.ncsu.edu/news/press_releases/05_02/042.htm
... so , due to some genetic anomaly you might be secreting that elusive compound , gentisyl quinone isovalerate .
That is , if it is Blattella germanica males you are attracting .
If you are attracting another species , you may be a living clue to identifying their attractive pheromone .
Science advances in fits and starts .
Serendipity is sometimes the most rapid approach to an answer .
Q73 : Liz Jeavans asks :
I would like to know how cockroaches walk up walls .
I heard that they have statically charged feet , but is this true ?
Ans : Liz ,
Liz ,
The feet of insects including cockroaches are made up of a brush like pile which reacts with a surface like myriad weak suction cups .
The weak forces involve adding together thousands of such individual adhering pillus ends and result in a strong enough force to suspend the body of a fly , a roach or even larger non-insectal critters such as lizards .
To step the cockroach must remove the pilli individually in a wave , like ripping off some cellophane or an adhesive bandage .
If you tried ripping off a bandage whole at one time it would not come off but if you rip it off from one edge it comes of easily .
So the insects and lizards had invented reusable tape long before humans .

Q72 : Arlette Koiiman asks :
I saw one cockroach with an ootheca when I caught it to throw it out .
My question is , where are the cockroaches most likely to place the ootheca ??
Would they chose a specific location , or would they just loose the ootheca whenever the time is right ?
Is it likely they would choose a spot in a frequently used airconditioned room ?
Would they climb into the drawers or closet and chose to place it between your clothes ???
Ans : Arlette ,
Blattella germanica the German cockroach is the commonest small pest roach and carries its egg case until it hatches in about 18 days at 30C .
At hatching the ootheca is on the female or dropped at random wherever she is at the time .
Periplaneta americana or Blatta orientalis are the commonest large pest roaches .
They carry their egg case for a few days and then deposit it in a corner or crevice , cementing it there with local debris and saliva .
A favorite place is in the corrugations of corrugated cardboard .
They chew a hole into the cardboard and use the chewings to paste together over the ootheca that they have placed into the hole they have made in the cardboard .
They would not typically burrow into clothing in a drawer to do it .
They might chose the corner of the drawer and use some of the lint available to glue together over the deposited ootheca .
Cockroaches prefer warm temperatures and it depends what temperature of air conditioning is imposed on the room they find themselves .
Cockroaches prefer temperatures between 25 and 30C .
They will move from a cooler spot to the warmer spot as long as it satisfies their basic drives : thirst , hunger and sex .
Q71 : A. Ganesan asks :
Does Cockroach like to be touched on all its sides ?
What is the word for it ?
Ans : A. ,
Thigmotropic .
[ Greek thigma , touch ; as in thigmotaxis + - tropism . ]
This is a word used often in the plant world where a plant entwines itself about another object such as a vine climbing another vine or a tree or a string .
Cockroaches are thigmotropic in the sense that they like to conform to a hiding place during the day , conforming to a curve or having something touching them on top and bottom such as in a crevice .
Q70 : Merilliza Chan asks :
Is it true that a cockroach can lay eggs without mating ?... how is that possible ?
o_o
Ans : Merilliza ,
There are three issues here , egg laying , fertile egg laying and virgin birth :
1 ) Cockroaches and many other animals can lay eggs ( infertile ) without mating .
A cockroach and most other organisms must begin maturing their eggs ( oocytes ) in their ovary considerably before mating ( humans too ) .
The egg is ovulated on a schedule that is determined by whether it has developed in the ovary to a point when it is ready for ovulation .
2 ) After ovulation , there may or may not be sperm to fertilize the egg that is ovulated .
In cockroaches , if there are no sperm to fertilize the egg , the ootheca that covers the eggs is often thinner .
The cockroach 's physiology knows not to waste the protein on producing a thick oothecal covering and very often the female will eat the infertile eggs regaining the stored yolk protein lest it be wasted from the cockroach 's nutritional economy .
3 ) Parthenogenesis is the process of producing fertile eggs without male participation .
Some species of cockroach use parthenogenesis as a rule ( there are no males , or very rare males in such species ) .
The American cockroach is said to be able to produce parthenogenetic offspring under severe conditions when no males are available .
Q69 : Jacques asks :
Why is there not a single photo of cockroach eggs on the net ?
Well ok I saw 2 photos on google image but they were drawn or cr___y !
Ans : Jacques ,
Cockroach eggs do not occur in nature singly , they come in batches called oothecae .
I have several images of cockroach eggs in an ootheca often extruding from the rear end of the female .
Try the following links .
Two families of cockroaches ( Blattinae and Blattellidae ) extrude the ootheca and hold onto it for a few day until they deposit it in a safe place to hatch about a month later .
Blattinae and oothecae
Nyctibora and ootheca
One genus of Blattellinae , Blattella , including our favorite Blattella germanica , the German cockroach , holds onto the ootheca extruding from its rear end until it hatches :
German cockroaches with oothecae
The entire Blaberidae family of tropical cockroaches incubate their ootheca covered eggs internally and you never see their ootheca unless you are someone like me who rears them and you see the ootheca during the extrusion phase after which they take it back into the uterus and incubate it until hatching / birth .
Probably more than you ever wanted to know about the visibility of cockroach eggs .
Finally , you would have seen more cockroach egg pictures on the internet if you had searched Google Image for ' ootheca ' rather than ' cockroach egg '
Q68 : 9513...@vmo ... asks :
What color are cockroaches most atrackted to ?
Ans : 95 ... ,
Cockroaches ( and most other insects ) have two light receptors , one sensitive in the ultraviolet range and one in the green range .
Many insects also have a third light receptor peaking in the blue .
Most pest cockroaches are not attracted to light .
They are active at night and if anything they might avoid light .
However , if you have a patio that is lit you might be asking what type of light should you have in your patio lighting scheme .
The yellow ' bug ' lights would be least visible to any of the wild cockroaches that can see light and fly and often are attracted to porch and patio lights .
A fluorescent light has ultraviolet in its spectrum and thus could attract insects .
A normal incandescent light will have the usual blue and green light in its spectrum and thus attracts insects that see that light .
The actual question of whether they are attracted to the light is another issue .
Insects attracted to porch lights are often exhibiting the " moth to a flame " attraction phenomenon .
Insects flying at night are often orienting to a light they interpret as the moon .
If you are trying to fly in a straight line you might chose to keep the moon at a constant angle in your front line of sight .
Since the moon is so far away , that keeps you going in a straight line .
However if you mistake a porch light for the moon and keep a constant angle to it , you are likely to spiral into the light - like a moth into a flame .
Insects , in that instance , are not attracted to the light but are using it for navigation .
Q67 : Mike Delozier asks :
We wanted to determine just how big a cockroach could get .
Would the physiology and structure of the insect allow it to be as big as a dog or cat ?
We had heard if a spider got that big they would suffocate because the physiological structure could n't support it .
Is there any similar restrictions with the roach ?
Ans : Mike ,
That is a classic question in insect physiology .
Insects are usually thought to be limited by the free diffusion in air of oxygen into their innermost tissues and free diffusion of CO 2 out .
Insects supply their tissues with oxygen using their segmental spiracular openings and the tracheal tubes that divide and subdivide until they reach the size of tracheoles which are small tubes that directly tangent the cell surface and gases exchange .
This subdivision is such that the cross sectional area of the tube does not change at each subdivision .
If the cross-sectional area of each tracheole at the cellular level does not change , it necessarily follows that as the insect volume increases , the size of the outermost tracheal trunk will needs be get larger in proportion to tissue volume .
Given the properties of surface to volume , there is an upper limit to the size of an insect if the principles outlined are held constant .
Extrapolated , the cross- sectional area of the spiracular openings would need to be larger than the available insect outer surface .
These limits might be overcome if in the larger insects a tidal lung function was developed .
In some of the larger cockroaches there is a sort of tidal rhythm that occurs through the action of body wall muscles contracting and relaxing .
This might extend the size of a cockroach by compensating for the need to maintain a constant crossectional area from the smallest to the biggest tracheae .
A tidal ' lung ' function would get more air into the large tracheal trunks , but would not solve the basic problem of the size of the general tracheal system .
I doubt that a single level of tidal ' lung ' would allow the cockroach to get much larger than the current tropical cockroaches like Blaberus giganteus but it would be nice for someone to put a firmer theoretical basis on that limit .
Good luck !
Q66 : Wallace Anderson asks :
... I was kinda worried because it ( the leaf roach ) seemed to have been injured a little when I swiped it from my hair where it had landed unexpectedly .
...
Will it heal ?
Ans : Wallace ,
Good question !
Actually I did my Ph.D. dissertation on that very topic .
Cockroach regeneration of limbs .
I wrote a chapter in a book on cockroaches on the topic :
Kunkel JG. 1981 .
Cockroach Regeneration .
( PDF ) Chapter 16 in THE AMERICAN COCKROACH , eds. WJ Bell and KG Adiyodi , Chapman and Hall , London , pp427-443 .
The most common injury for them to endure is the loss of a leg .
If a predator tugs on a cockroach leg it will fall off at a preset point called an autotomy point , similar to a lizard losing its tail as a reflex to being caught by the tail .
Unlike some other insects which will gradually regenerate a leg over several molting cycles , the cockroach will delay its next molt in order to regenerate its leg .
This will provide the cockroach with the swift feet necessary to escape the next enemy quickly .
Six legs are better than 5 or 4 .
The fast escape of the cockroach requires the pattern of running which uses a tripod of legs on the ground at any one time .
My Ph.D. dissertation dealt with how the cockroach delays its molting cycle in order to regenerate one or more lost legs .
Yes , many slight to severe injuries can heal in cockroaches !
Q65 : Mariele Pellecer ask :
I ... wanted to know how do you sex them ( Blattella germanica ) before they molt to adults ?
Ans : Mariele ,
Since this is an important issue for cockroach biologists I constructed a page to explain it as I understand it from Mary Ross and Don Cochran , and have used this technique for decades .
It is almost fool - proof :
Sexing Blattella nymphs
Q64 : Karna and Izzy and Sarah ask :
... we are moving .
And we have a problem with big huge roaches in our house , mainly kitchen and bathroom .
I am VERY worried that during packing and moving the roaches will jump into my suitcases and nest in my clothes !!!!!
Ans : K , I and S ,
What can I tell you ?
Cockroach larvae will hide anywhere they can .
Moving with migrating human populations is exactly how pest roaches have gotten around the world .
I have no magic solution .
Kill the roaches any way you can before you reach your new home .
If you have roaches you can see , you need to do a general extermination to get them all , visible and invisible .
Fumigate the moving van ?
I am not an exterminator and have no special expertise in that respect .
Q63 : Andy Robb asks :
After cooking pizza in my microwave , I opened the microwave ... and discovered a small roach ... still alive .
... is it possible that it was in the microwave ... and ... survived ?
Ans : Andy ,
This experiment has been done often .
The microwave oven is amazingly non-uniform in its heating .
That is why most of them have carousels to keep the food moving through the focus of the power .
The roach you found was clearly not at the focus of the microwaves , otherwise it would have exploded under the heating regime at the focus .
Q62 : Frances asks :
I wonder if you know of any roaches that have spiny protrusions extending from a slightly elongated abdomen that they upend and essentially point at each other when fighting .
Ans : Frances ,
The cockroach species , Diploptera punctata , is found in Hawaii .
It has cerci protruding from the tip of its abdomen and it will spray an acrid fluid from its upturned abdomen at attackers , usually not at each other but some small rodent intent on eating them .
Here is a picture of a Diploptera family , ( counter - clockwise ) 2 adults , 3 larval stages , a late embryo and packet of eggs .
Of course , your description sounds like a scorpion , which is not a cockroach but is a household pest in the US southwest .
It also sounds like an earwig which has pincer like protrusions from the tip of their abdomen with teeth that are reared up in the air when they are disturbed .
You may be mistaken about the fighting .
Mating male cockroaches extend their abdomen and point it at the female offering her a taste of a secretion on his abdomen .
If the female feeds on this gland it stimulates the male to continue the mating process , eventually copulating and transferring a package of sperm to the female which then uses it for the next month or two fertilizing eggs .
Q61 : Boomom asks :
What is the little brown sac that falls out of some roaches when they are dying ?
Ans : Boomom ,
That is a sac of eggs , called an ootheca .
See the pictures at URLs :
1 ) Blattinae , the Periplaneta family , with protruding and laid oothecae
2 ) German cockroaches , some females with ootheca .
The females carry the ootheca protruding from their bursa which is at their tail end until , depending on the species , it hatches , they hide it somewhere or until they retract it into their uterus to incubate it until the eggs hatch .
The German cockroach carries it around until it hatches and might be the culprit you are specifically asking about .
The American cockroach carries it around for a day or two until it hardens and darkens and then hides it in a crevasse covered with some camouflage they glue in place with saliva .
The ootheca is only gently held in the bursa and could easily fall off when the roach is roughly handled or dying .
Q60 : Elizabeth Palmer asks :
How much weight can a cockroach carry ?
For instance , an ant can carry it 's own weight ...
Ans : Liz ,
That saying about the ant sounds just as offhand as what I might give for the cockroach , but for an important difference :
The ant is a forager which is designed to find and carry objects back to its colony nest .
Carrying things has a meaning for ants based on their innate behavior .
The cockroach does not move things more than a few millimeters when it lifts things that it is nibbling while eating or tasting .
Therefore the carrying question is meaningless in most situations .
Cockroaches were not designed to carry foreign objects around .
The ant can probably carry things twice its weight .
...
This is a perfect question for an undergraduate lab , but not particularly interesting to an insect physiologist .
It would engage the student in trying to get the cockroach and ant to carry something .
The student would hopefully learn that the ant instinctively carries things off and the cockroach does not .
This exercise would teach that the posing of a logical experimental question is an important step in doing research .
A close relative of the cockroach is the preying mantis which catches and lifts other insects to eat them .
The females will even catch and eat the male after she mates with him .
The male in mating with the female , jumps on its back and is carried around during the mating process .
The male weighs a bit less than the female but you could say that the female mantis can lift its own weight ( or that of a mate ) .
In this case the female does carry the male on her back while mating , then she grabs him and eats him on the spot , usually without carrying him any further .
Similarly the other close relative of the cockroach , the termite , is a social insect which lives in a nest but it does not go foraging and bring back large objects the way that an ant does .
The termite can forage for bits of wood and does lift bits of wet saliva soaked wood in order to extend its nest , often building huge structures in Africa , or , more close to home , tunnels from house siding across foundation to ground .
Carrying of this building material is essential to survival for these termites .
The cockroach female does not carry the male on her back during the mating process as the mantid and many other insects do , they mate tail to tail with no carrying involved .
So , you need to create a question about cockroaches that has meaning .
A carrying question about a cockroach is not meaningful , unless you could create a situation in which it needs to carry something .
When a group of cockroaches is very hungry I have observed them competing for food .
Occasionally I have seen a cockroach drag a piece of food off to nibble on it without being harassed by close neighbors .
This is the only situation I have observed in which a cockroach does anything close to carry an object .
Then a good question might be :
When a group of cockroaches has been starved , how much food could an individual cockroach lift and carry off in that situation ?
I do not know the answer .
Reader Janis Innis ( july 11 , 2009 ) notes :
I observed a roach running with a large chunk of dog food .
It was running across the kitchen , but when I entered the room , it turned and ran back towards the other side of the room .
I would estimate it covered six feet while I was watching it .
I would guess the dry dog food chunk weighed much more than the roach .

Q59 : Jennifer Manley asks :
I have an insect that I believe to be a Blaberus colloseus , just judging by the one picture I could find on the internet .
Can you tell me where to find out anything about this guy ?
I 'm not having any luck on the internet .
Ans : Jennifer ,
My experience with Blaberus species is limited to B. giganteus , B. discoidalis , and B. cranifer .
Now that other species of Blaberus are becoming attractive as pets and feeder cultures worldwide , our poor understanding and literature about the diversity of species in this and most other cockroach genera is becoming obvious .
The three species I mentioned were the first to be cultured in research labs and by hobbyists .
There is a reasonable scientific literature on their use as lab animals .
We actually know little about their natural ecology and behavior except where experimentalists and hobbyists have taken the time to describe it .
I have no information and could find no information at PubMed or Web - of - Science on Blaberus colloseus the " Ecuador roach " or Blaberus colossus , the more likely spelling .
It is also possible that this name is a synonym or a mistake that you have run across on the internet on the many hobbyist pages dealing with cockroaches .
One note of caution , many Blaberus species look alike and if you have collected your Blaberus species in the wilds of the southern USA , it is most likely B. discoidalis or B. giganteus which can be found in the wild on our southern USA coast .
Q58 : An editor asks :
I 'm a freelance editor on deadline trying to edit a story on roaches for a reading textbook .... ( T ) here is so much conflicting information on the web .
... ( C ) ould you clear up the following ... questions for me ?
(1) How many nymphs can a female German cockroach produce in a lifetime ( how many eggs per sac x how many sacs ) ?
Ans :
That number is not the usual number quoted and is ( ~40 x 5 - 6 ) = 200-240 .
In my substantial experience using B. germanica in my lab , a single female can produce at max about 5 - 6 egg cases during her lifetime , each about a month apart after her own approximate 35 day juvenile phase .
The timing depends on temperature and they develop most quickly at 30C .
Each egg case has approximately 40 eggs so that means a single female will only produce 240 primary offspring .
However most people like to scare you with the calculation of total progeny .
That means understanding that only half the 240 primary offspring are females who could each also have 240 offspring half of which are females .
Depending on the temperature one needs to calculate the larger number of offspring that a female can produce in a year , which is the usual number that is quoted .
( 2) Same question for American cockroaches ?
Ans : The American cockroach produces 1 ootheca per 2.5 - 3 days with each ootheca bearing about 12 offspring .
The number of ootheca in the adult life of an American roach is probably somewhere in the literature .
The egg cases start being less frequent as the female gets older and some of the ovarioles become inactive such that an ootheca might only contain 6 - 8 eggs in later life .
I presume an adult female might continue the output for 6 months ( although that is a guess ) so resulting in 60 ootheca x 12 = 720 offspring .
The variance about this average might be quite high so I would not be surprised by actual counts of females producing 500 - 1400 offspring in her lifetime .
Q57 : Rochelle asks :
I see that you 've mentioned that cockroaches are connected to asthma in kids .
Please could you explain this to me ?
Why do they cause atshma ?
A : Rochelle , You ask a good question .
Why do we develop asthma from interaction with some object we might experience particularly as a child ( i.e. childhood asthma ) ?
Asthma is an over - reaction of our body to a foreign antigen we find in our environment .
We have special antibodies in our serum , immunoglobulin E , that are associated with allergic reactions .
When we develop an allergy to something in our environment that allergic reaction sometimes takes directions that are dangerous to the individual .
A severe reaction is anaphylactic shock which can kill you .
A milder reaction includes various levels of asthma .
Why do children develop asthma by growing up in a cockroach infested home ?
Young children crawl around on the floors and carpets which may have the parts and proteins of cockroaches imbedded in them .
The same goes for pet dander and allergies to dogs and cat dander .
When an allergy test is given to those asthmatic individuals they find the children react perhaps to cockroach antigen and perhaps to dog or cat dander antigen .
Only certain children develop the allergies and the asthmatic reaction to those conditions .
This seems to be partly an inherited tendency , so , allergic parents may pass on the tendency to become allergic to their children .
Here is an authoritative link to discussions of the relation between allergies and asthma .
Q56 : Glesne asks :
How fast are cockroaches ?
A : Glesne , Cockroaches are fast enough .
They have giant fibers in their ventral nerve cord that transmit the sensory info from their cerci , which sense air currents , directly to their thoracic ganglia which control their leg muscles .
This is a reflex circuit which does not need any decision by the cockroach brain .
It is fast enough to detect the air wave in front of a predator and allows the cockroach to scuttle away , avoiding capture .
If you want to know how fast in cm / sec you will have to do your own experiment .
Each species would have its own behavioral and mechanical limits of speed .
You might make your measurement of speed in terms of body lengths per second which might allow you to compare species of cockroaches .
What would be your measuring conditions ?
Starting from a full stop and measure speed after 0.1 or 0.2 seconds ?
You have some thinking to do before you can decide how to measure the cockroach speed .
How long can a cockroach maintain its top speed ?
How long does it take to accelerate to its top speed ?
Q55 : Justin Winstead asks :
I had a debate with my brother and his wife over whether or not cockroaches live in organized groups .
I said that they do live in organized groups and they acted like I was crazy .
Can you set us straight please ?
A : Justin , Social structure in the cockroach pest species is next to invisible .
However there are a few indications of group organization .
Most such behavior would not be considered social :
1 ) Many cockroaches care for their eggs until they hatch , including the German cockroach which carries the eggs externally until they hatch .
A whole Family of cockroaches , the Blaberidae with subfamilies Blaberinae , Zetoborinae , Epilamprinae Diplopterinae and Pycnoscelinae among others , carry the eggs internally until they hatch .
One Blaberid species , Diploptera sp. , provides nutrition to the embryos which actually molt in utero several times such that they need only molt three times after they are born to become adults , URL : D_punctata - devel - 2864.JPG
2 ) There is a so - called group - effect among the young of German cockroaches .
If they are alone they develop very slowly .
If there are at least two larvae in a defined space they accelerate their development to become adults .
This later behavior is a mechanism that increases the probability that two adults will be present by the time adulthood is reached .
Unfortunately , this effect is sex-neutral so the two adults could be both males or both females with a probability of 50 % .
3 ) The termites are a group of insects that have approximately the same level evolutionary relationship as Families of cockroaches .
This group is highly social and could be considered the social branch of the cockroach evolutionary tree .
Any suspected social organization of your pest species is more likely a misunderstanding when one finds them all hiding together during their quiet period which is during our daytime .
Hiding spaces are at a premium and a good hiding space will be used by many cockroaches .
Is sleeping - together " living in organized groups ? "
Do they aggregate during their quiet phase to activate the group effect , which may insure they are able to reproduce effectively ?
Q54 : Laurie Betts asks :
Are there Australian cockroaches in the USA ?
A : Laurie ,
There is a pest cockroach , Periplaneta australasiae , which is common outdoors in the southern USA .
It is commonly called the Australian cockroach .
It is found worldwide as a pest and also called the greenhouse cockroach because of its predilection for establishing itself as a pest in the warmth of greenhouses at all latitudes .
It is also found in western Australia .
I am not sure of the etymology of the common name , ' Australian cockroach ' .
The actual geographic origin of pest species is not easy to determine .
North Africa seems to be the major focus of the wild species of the genus Periplaneta , thus Periplaneta americana is thought to originate in North Africa despite its common name , the American cockroach .
It is thought that the pest species of cockroaches have dispersed around the world with the , relatively recent , early human migrations , explorations and trading activity .
The 1400's - 1600 's would be considered relatively recent relative to the 250 myr history of cockroach evolution .
The scientific name is P. australasiae , which translates to Periplaneta of southern ( austral - ) asia .
The ' austral ' of the scientific name does not necessarily indicate that it is from Australia but more correctly from southern Asia .
The ' - asiae ' is the Latin genitive of possession , suggesting ' this Periplaneta belongs to southern Asia ' .
' Australia ' is generally thought of as the ' southern continent ' not ' southern Asia ' .
The scientific , Latin names of insects and their common names , if common names exist , are often applied for local or mistaken reasons .
Somehow , the common name ' Australian ' was applied at some point in time to P. australasiae .
See URL :
http://www.bio.umass.edu/biology/kunkel/cockroach_faq.html#Q26
There is another answer to your question .
The cockroach Family group , Polyzosterinae , is almost entirely found in Australia , thus it could be thought of as a group of Australian cockroaches .
It has hundreds of described species , most if not all wingless as adults .
There is one species of this Family in the USA , Eurycotis floridana .
It is thought that E. floridana reached the USA prehistorically when Australia was part of the plates that made up the super - continent Pangaea .
During the separation of Australia from South America , about 50 myr ago , it is thought that the then nuclear Family of which Eurycotis was a member split , sending one or a few representatives up into South American landmass and the remainder in the future Australian landmass .
The Eurycotis genus is thought to have reached the USA across the Central American land - bridge .
Eurycotis floridana is the only surviving species of the Polyzosterinae in the USA while the Polyzosterinae blossomed in Australia .
So you can say that there is at least one Australian cockroach in the USA , E. floridana .
... or two if you include P. australasiae .
Q53 : Kian Hwee ( Singapore ) asks :
... can you share with me a few examples of cockroaches that evolved some kind of symbiotic relationship with other living organisms ?
Thank you .
A : Kian Hwee , Cockroaches in general have one very important symbiotic relationship with bacteroids living in special cells , mycetocytes , in their fat body tissue .
The bacteroids are passed from generation to generation as a thin coating on their eggs , between the chorion and the oocyte cell membrane .
During embryology these bacteroids invest in the female future ovary and the developing fat body tissue .
The bacteroids produce all the vitamins needed by the cockroach with the exception of choline and cholesterol which remain as the only essential vitamins of the cockroach .
The close relatives , termites and preying mantids have lost or never gained this type of symbiont .
They must get their vitamins , like Vit A and D , in their food .
This is a true symbiotic relationship since the cockroaches have protected the bacteroids over the millions of years of their association and probably these bacteria - like organisms have been protected from changes forced on their strains by mating with other bacterial strains and have remained true to their type since they accepted the cloistered life they enjoy in the cockroach fat body .
As long as the cockroach survives , these bacteroids will survive .
They have hung their survival on a pretty sure bet .
How is that for a symbiotic benefit ?
The cockroach makes out pretty well also since due to the vitamins supplied by the bacteroids , the cockroach can eat almost anything organic without thinking of whether it has vitamins and essential amino acids , which we all need to get via our diet or a vitamin pill !
Q52 : Mendriks asks :
How would we know a cockroach was still alive if it does not move ?
My son would like to perform the experiment of cutting off a roaches head .
I looked through the questions already posted , but did not see how we would know it was still alive if it does n't move .
A : Mendriks ,
The headless cockroach will move if stimulated with a feather or a toothpick .
The cockroach will sense an irritation on its leg or back and move to avoid it if it is still alive .
The way to do the experiment with the greatest chance of success is to take some old - fashion dental floss , the type made up of very fine filaments and make a simple loop knot that is put over the cockroaches head and drawn tight around its neck .
You can also use a fine silk thread or hair from your head and similarly make a loop knot that can be tightened .
At that point you can cut the head off on the head - side of the knot .
This prevents the cockroach from losing any blood .
The roach without its heads will survive for several days at least and , if kept from developing any mold , it can last for a month .
Without the knot the experiment will work but if you disturb it too early , before a blood clot is formed on the wound , the cockroach will expel its innards through its neck and die thereof .
Q51 : Robert asks :
I read here that the cockroach can live for about a month without its head .
Is it possible for a female to be headless and get pregnant by a male and give birth before it dies ?
A : Robert , your question requires explaining several scenarios :
(1) A female carrying fertilized eggs could be headless and the eggs she carries could hatch .
(2) Females also store sperm and can fertilize several subsequent egg packages ( oothecae ) before they need to mate with a male again .
However , a cockroach female needs the head associated gland , corpora allata , to produce the reproductive hormone , JH , to produce a batch of eggs and produce the pheromone that attracts a male to mate .
Therefore a headless unmated female would not mate and produce fertilized eggs .
(3) Whether a mated female with ripe eggs who loses her head could ovulate the now mature eggs and hold onto them until they hatched is questionable .
I am not sure if we know the answer to that question .
I do know that I did take the ovaries out from of a female German cockroach that was half - way through her ovulation of eggs .
The eggs continued to be ovulated in the physiological saline that I was observing them in .
I do not know if the other organs that put the oothecal covering over the eggs would have functioned properly .
This would be a simple experiment to confirm using the synchronized batches of mated females that I have used previously in my experiments , URL :
http://www.bio.umass.edu/biology/kunkel/ms/k1966/
(4) In Blattella germanica , the German cockroach , the ootheca is held by the female for about 18 days before it hatches .
The female provides moisture to the ootheca which the female carries protruding from her bursa .
It is precisely the moisture that she provides the ootheca that is in short supply when her head is severed .
I doubt that a female which has lost her head and just ovulated her eggs could bring those eggs to term and hatching given the inability to provide water .
In a moist atmosphere perhaps it would be possible .
(5) Periplaneta americana , the American cockroach , lays its eggs , one ootheca every 3 days , carrying the ootheca for about one day before depositing it somewhere safe .
If such a female lost her head prior to dropping the ootheca then I am not sure whether the ootheca would be dropped but it is entirely provisioned with enough water to last until it hatches .
So , your question 's answer has several stages of possibility .
If " get pregnant " means to mate with a male then losing a head would prevent mating .
If a female has already gotten to the stage when she has released her sex pheromone to attract the male then a male would be attracted but the female must exhibit some requisite behavior , requiring the head , when a male presents himself to mate with her .
Without its head it would not accept the male 's mating overtures .
But if a female was already mated before her head was lost and " get pregnant " means the ovulation and fertilization of the eggs by the already acquired sperm , then the above discussion does not absolutely preclude her producing and hatching some eggs .
Carried eggs might well hatch , unovulated eggs might ovulate and be fertilized but whether they would acquire the requisite oothecal covering to reach hatching is experimentally unknown at the moment .
That is a good question .
Q50 : Roland asks :
My 9 year old son came home today telling me that his science teacher told him that cockroaches were being used in large farms to produce methane gas .
I had never heard of this .
Any truth to it ?
A : Roland ,
Your son may have access to some information of which I am not aware .
The practicality of methane production by cockroaches is not established as far as I know .
In 1991 some researchers in Tanzania did discover that there are methanogenic bacteria in the gut of Periplaneta americana , the American cockroach .
Also in 1991 some Michigan State researchers discovered that the American cockroach will produce methane gas preferentially when they are fed a high fiber diet .
These publications were part of a flurry of publications about methane production by cockroaches in the early 1990's .
You can find these publications by using Google / Scholar :
http://scholar.google.com/
... and searching on : methane cockroach .
I have not found that these facts have been commercialized into farms for the production of methane .
Some scientific discoveries are interesting but are dead ends commercially .
Small businesses however often go bankrupt because of poor planning and management ; and perhaps the underlying ideas are still sound .
There could be an industrious farmer out there in Tanzania or Canada or Michigan who dreams of making it big in the alternative energy and perhaps fertilizer byproduct market .
Q49 : Timothy Ampi asks :
Does cockroach have emotion ( fear , anger , happy ) ?
A : Timothy ,
Emotion is not usually associated with insect or cockroach behavior .
The cold and unmoving surfaces of the insect exoskeleton do not allow for movement of surface muscles and skin that one can interpret as a smile or other facial emotion .
Insects react to environmental cues with reflexes that we usually do not interpret as emotion .
Have you ever seen the waggle communication of the worker honeybee ?
It is used to communicate the direction and richness of a nectar source .
That is interpreted by insect behaviorists to be a reflex behavioral response released by finding the nectar source .
The public might interpret it as an indication that the worker is happy at finding the sweet nectar .
Go figure ?
Is there any evidence that the bee is happy ?
What would that evidence be ?
Is a bee worker angry when it stings an intruder to the hive ?
We subjectively use the terminology " angry worker bee " .
Now , is there any behavior that you might ascribe to something you see a cockroach do ?
Is their escape behavior based on fear ?
Or is it a ' simple ' reflex ?
Science would suggest it is a simple reflex in all the above cases of insect behavior .
Our emotions ( e.g. happiness ) are associated with the release of certain chemicals in the brain ( endorphins ) which also have been discovered in the insect brain .
Does that mean that insects feel happiness ?
Does that mean that what we call happiness , endorphin release , in humans ( or mice ) is a reflex ?
These are difficult subjective questions that science rarely deals with but are fun for us to think about .
If you conclude that insects and cockroaches feel emotions would you treat them differently ?
Read the poem St. Roach by Muriel Rukeyser .
Q48 : Martha Johnson asks :
I am interested in some type of roach control that is safe and non-toxic for myself , an invalid , and my companion dog .
We live in coastal Texas with high humidity and a leaky roof .
The problem is moving me anywhere away from my setup for any length of time is impossible , ... and my dog loves ( to eat ) cockroaches .
I used the Bengal product which worked for a while and also spread borax .
A : Martha ,
I was involved as a consultant in the development of the Bengal product which uses a bait station dispensing a mold that is lethal to cockroaches ( but non-toxic to vertebrate animals and humans ) , rather than a chemical poison .
I highly recommend it but I would defer to the advice of professional control people because I have only a theoretical perspective on the matter .
The Bengal bait stations might have to be applied periodically if the mold dies out due to a lack of critters to pass it on .
The boric acid , not borax ( a different compound ) , should not be dangerous to your dog if used in small quantities as a dusting in isolated corners where your dog would not reach to sniff it into its lungs .
Chemical safety bulletins are typically alarmist ( e.g. Baker ) and warn of respiratory damage and irritation if inhaled .
A large amount ( grams ) needs to be ingested to be lethal .
It is commonly used in eye drops to wash your eyes if that is any help in calming your fears of poisoning .
Some concern is voiced about constant exposure .
It is not a poison in small quantities and should not be spread in large quantities .
People often feel that " if a small amount is good , a lot will work better " .
In this case a small amount is good but a large amount could be dangerous .
Also boric acid is said to act in its dry form to abrade the cuticle of the cockroach so that it dies of water loss .
This might not be very effective in your situation where there is abundant moisture that could dissolve the applied boric acid and thus make it ineffective as well as your leaky roof providing plenty of water to the roaches which would also save them from desiccating .
These two solutions to roaches should not require that you or doggie companion to be moved out of your setup during their application as they are both non-toxic to vertebrates if applied in moderation .
In my experience , 75 % of your problem is the excess moisture .
Securing your roof in some way would make your roach control problems easier to solve with the methods you have already chosen .
Q47 : Alexandra Manou asks :
What is the cockroach reproduction cycle ? ...
Was told by pesticide company that it is 40 days , including winter .
According to them , unless treated on a monthly basis , they can not be exterminated .
Is this true or an excuse for frequent visits ?
A : Alexandra ,
The reproductive cycle like the life cycle depends on the temperature .
It is maximum for most pest species at 30 ºC which is about 86 ºF .
At that temperature an egg case is produced by _Blattella germanica_ adults in about 6 days but it is held by the female for 18 days before they hatch .
The other common pest species , _Periplaneta americana_ , deposits an egg case every 3 days at 30 ºC and each egg case will hatch in about 30 days .
Perhaps that is the magic number 30 that corresponds to the lunar monthly cycle that your exterminator has suggested is critical for visits .
The rates of egg production and development are temperature sensitive so at 25 ºC all the above times are approximately doubled , slowed down by the reduced temperature .
Another 5 ºC reduction again doubles the times and thus the German cockroach egg laying and hatching cycle would be quadrupled from 24 days to 96 days .
Most homes are cooler in the winter than the summer so roaches are probably growing and reproducing slower in the winter than the summer .
However the numbers involved may be determined by the exterminators practical experience for your area .
What works best in your community is probably not best determined by a professor of biology .
For instance , the outdoor cockroach refuges that provide the reservoir of pests that would enter your home may be the determinant .
In cities , the sewer system may be the major reservoir of cockroaches and it is the temperature there that possibly drives the infestation rate .
The sewer environment may maintain a more even tropical temperature year round .
Q46 : Thomas Coxey asks :
Where did the cockroach get its name ?
A : Thomas ,
Pest cockroaches have lived with people of many cultures perhaps before language developed .
Here is a link to the common names given to cockroaches in different cultures :
http://open-dictionary.com/Cockroach
Some common names have some suggestive associations .
( 1 ) Water Bug . ( 2 ) The German cockroach , Polish cockroach , Russian cockroach , Crotton bug all refer to the same species Blattella germanica because one community wanted to name it after something they despised .
( 3 ) Some dominant societies have named their local pest cockroach after their oppressed native population .
This practice is a sad reflection of how far prejudice has driven our common language .
Our common name ' cockroach ' shares sounds with Dutch ' kakkerlak ' and Spanish ' cucaracha ' and the Spanish song ' La Cucaracha ' brings to mind vigorous stamping of the flamenco dancers feet which could refer to the canons of war ... or the stamping feet of a homeowner on the pests .
I am told by a reader that the song has multiple potential meanings .
The origins of the names are entwined in early cultural history and only careful etymological and sociological study might discover the origins of our word ' cockroach ' .
I am not aware that such research has been successful in this case .
Q45 : Frank Melchior asks :
I have a question .
...
Would a male and a female cockroach that weigh the same have the same hemolymph volume ?
A : Frank ,
Larval males and females of the same size have the same hemolymph volume .
Last instar females are bigger than last instar males , anticipating the larger abdominal format of the females and tend to have more hemolymph .
Adult females are generally more robust than males particularly in the abdomen where the ovaries of the female take up substantially more volume than the adult male gonads .
In addition the fat body of the adult female is much more developed due to its involvement in vitellogenin synthesis in support of egg development .
Coincident with this greater abdominal tissue development there is more hemolymph in the reproductive adult female .
Finding an adult female the same weight as an adult male might be difficult .
The largest adult males and the smallest females might be the same weight and perhaps they might have the same blood volume but I doubt it .
The females more extensive abdominal tissues are all laminar and would require more volume of blood to suspend them .
I hypothesize that if you measure male and female blood volumes the adult females would have a larger blood volume when regressed against weight due to their greater tissue surface needs .
Q44 : Katherine McGlothlin asks :
What was the reason for this cockroach behavior ?
On Sept.29 around 9:00 pm in my front yard ... I observed a large number of cockroaches ( maybe 100 - 200 ) pouring out of a manhole .
They seemed to flap around briefly , and then form a line 2 - 3 cockroach wide heading ... towards a large tree .
Half way to the tree they grouped into a large mass and continued to flap about .
It almost seemed to be a mating frenzy .
This sight , ... was observed by the light of a full moon , was ... interesting and also creepy .
A : Katherine ,
I am not particularly a behavioral expert but I have seen such a frenzy in the lab on a smaller scale when I added a bunch of mature adult males to a bowl of virgin adult females who were all ready to mate .
What you observed in the wild does sound like a mating frenzy .
The population pressure in the utility / sewer was probably pretty high .
One or more females were probably sending out sex pheromone signaling that they were ready to mate and they were being mobbed by males who were ready to mate .
The flapping of wings is the males ' signal to the female that they are ready and the males would pursue the females and occasionally bunch together around what they sense was the source of the pheromone .
The females would respond by palpating the abdomen of the male she chose to have sex with and if she was really ready she would copulate with the most ' attractive ' male .
I do not know how common the mobbing phenomenon is but I expect it often happens down in the sewer as long as the population pressure is not high .
I also would assume that it was only adult cockroaches that participated .
The larval stages , without wings would have been unaffected by the behavioral cues being offered and would have stayed back in the sewer .
This behavior might have the purpose of getting the adults in a crowded population to disperse before they mate and produce eggs .
A close relative , the termite , exhibits this adult mating flight swarming quite frequently .
It is interesting that you may have stumbled on observing one of the traits that link the two groups ( termites and cockroaches ) from a behavioral point of view .
Q43 : Cressida Mahung asks :
How can I tell if a cockroach is breathing ?
How do I measure the breathing rate ?
I would like to do project on this for my science fair , but I am stuck !
A : Cressida ,
The cockroach 's breathing rate , like that of most insects , is controlled by accumulation of carbon dioxide , not lack of oxygen .
In order to conserve water the average insect closes its spiracles , which are the openings of the insect tracheal system that supplies oxygen to all tissues and removes the carbon dioxide .
When the carbon dioxide in the animals system rises to a critical level , the spiracles open and then CO 2 leaves the system and oxygen enters .
In most small insects this opening and closing of the spiracles ( breathing ? ) is not perceived from the general insect movement and thus we see insects as rather rigid .
We see no obvious breathing .
If you however look at breathing as the uptake of oxygen from the available volume of air you could measure this disappearance of oxygen as volume of gas .
I have done this in a student laboratory using an apparatus similar to the diagram below , a small vial with a stopper in its end through which a breathing tube is inserted :
____________
|___________|_|=========
If you put an animal in the vial above and keep the vial in a constant - temperature water - bath then the water will enter into the small tube that goes through the stopper and the water will continue to be drawn in through the small tube as oxygen is used up , somewhat like the mercury in a thermometer .
CO 2 dissolves in the water and is thus removed as it is expired by the insect and thus the volume declines as oxygen in the air is used up by the respiring insects .
By measuring the position of the water in the tube you can measure the usage of oxygen .
This is the long accepted method of measuring respiration of such small animals .
You could also restrain the insect under a microscope so that you could watch the spiracles and watch them open and close .
However , a restrained insect often struggles and its use of oxygen will go up abnormally .
Some minimal restraint might be designed such as gluing the pronotum to a wand and giving the insect a small light ball to " walk " on .
The wand can be maneuvered to allow the abdominal spiracles to be observed by a dissecting microscope , allowing the spiracular opening rate to be counted .
Q42 : Joe Rowell asks :
I am a illustrator going to Savannah College of Art and Design and I am trying to illustrate a image from a roaches point of view .
What would that look like ?
A : Joe ,
You would be looking out of a crack at the world during the early morning or during the day in a half stupor because you would be hiding there sleepy or asleep from 2 AM to 10 PM .
At 10 PM when the human household turns off the lights you would come to life and be looking at the world from weird angles since you would be scuttling on the floor or viewing the room in dim light from standing on the wall or the ceiling .
Q41 : Alejandro from the Phillipines asks :
... I have observed that cockroaches in my house get " wild " before any earthquake occurs .
They start running and getting out from their niches .
... I have the impression that cockroaches can " feel " some of the very early vibrations of an earthquake , small or big , and can be a very good help to give " early warnings " of earthquakes .
Can you confirm this ?
A : Alejandro ,
If you have done a careful experiment to demonstrate the phenomenon you should publish it .
There have been newspaper articles professing to demonstrate that point ( perhaps 20 years old ) but I have never seen confirmation of earthquake prediction by cockroaches in the scientific journal literature .
The type of proof that would be needed is a type of automated or regular observational record of the cockroaches and the demonstration of how that record changes and predicts future seismic activity .
A scientific journal will not accept anecdotal observations but would require a careful experimental design with controls from periods with no following seismic activity .
Reliability would be another issue .
Do the cockroaches predict every earthquake ?
Are there times they produce a false positive , i.e. their activity predicts a quake that does not happen ?
A better approach would be to build a small chamber that would act as an activity meter which would automatically record the cockroach activity .
There are several designs for a cockroach activity meter .
One that might be useful is a small light plastic pie plate with lid .
It would sit on a metal base that would conduct electricity .
The plate would sit on a pin at its center that keeps the pie plate off the metal base except at one point on its rim .
A large cockroach such as Periplaneta during its normal activity cycle would make the pie plate rotate on the metal plate as it walks around the plate .
A wire at one or more places on the rim would make a circuit and that circuit closure could be recorded with its time of occurrence .
This activity rhythm ( because cockroaches are normally active for 4 hours after lights go out in the evening ) recording gives one a record of the normal activity something like the following :
||| |
|
|
|
| | | ||| |
|
|
| | | || | |__________________________________________|_______________________________________|

||| || || | X |
|
|
|
| | | ||| |
|
|
| | | || | |__________________________________________|_______________________________________| 0 12 24 12 24
While that is the general design of the experimental setup it can be adapted to several other specific hardware designs .
For instance the analog design described above could be changed to a sold state and digital design by using a digital camera or camcorder to take a digital image of the cockroach in its dish which would record if it has moved since the last picture .
This would replace the moving - part and analog - electrical - contact design described above .
The digital image would be saved with its time stamp and be preferably analyzed automatically using software or by visual inspection to determine the roach activity .
I understand that these approaches might be beyond your technical capabilities but that is why we have research labs at universities and commercial labs that do this type of sometimes expensive basic and applied research .
Such designs , once proven in the lab , possibly could be commercialized and be able to be packaged with computer software as a seismic prediction device which could be located in a local prediction center or police station where a perhaps automated warning could be broadcast to the public .
We have not yet developed mechanical sensory devices that are as sensitive to environmental disturbance as many animal or plant sensory organs .
This area of research has been dubbed ' biosensors ' and grants are available to pursue such questions .
Ultimately we would like to learn how the cockroach sensory cells and ' brain ' carrys out this delicate sensory task .
Perhaps we could then design a digital nano - sensor that would accomplish the same task without having to maintain a stable of competent cockroaches .
Q40 : Marlene asks :
A former science teacher said that cockroaches glow under black light .
Are they flourescent ?
A : Marlene ,
I have never seen a cockroach glow under black light however another arthropod more common in more tropical or desert regions , the scorpion , does glow fluorescently .
Scorpions are well known for this phenomenon .
Their generally soft cuticle has fluorescent compounds .
There is a famous picture on the cover of Science of a fluorescent scorpion .
I once took a walk in the evening desert outside Albuquerque NM with a portable black light .
The cresote bushes , after dark , illuminated with black light became like Xmas treess illuminated with scorpions which were foraging for prey on all the twigs and branches of each bush .
It was a powerful demonstration of how physically active they become at night and just how many scorpions are out there .
Perhaps some cockroach species would show some flourescence but I have never seen it nor heard of it from any other experts .

Q39 : BEH301 asks :
How do Cockroaches Digest and what organs do they use to do so ?
A : BEH301 ,
You can look at the diagram at URL :
http://www.bio.umass.edu/biology/kunkel/rolleston/plate_viii.html
...
This is an illustration by GEORGE ROLLESTON published in 1870 .
Cockroaches shred food with their mouthparts and then swallow it using their salivary glands ( e ) and salivary reservoir ( f ) to moisten their food before it enters their crop ( d ) .
Their gizzard or proventriculus ( g ) grinds the moist food further and adds it to the stomach ( i ) into which digestive enzymes are poured from the gastric caeca ( h ) , after which it flows into the intestines ( l ) which is shown separated from the tubular stomach by a short segment of the peritrophic membrane ( k ) which is a chitin sac woven by the microvilli of the stomach to contain the bolus of food which passes through the GI track .
The hind intestine ( lower - l ) removes water from the digestate and then the rectum ( m ) compacts the remains into a roach scat .
The digested food is relieved of its nutritive materials by the walls of the stomach and intestines .
Q38 : Fischer Ling asks :
I read your article on the " elusive albino cockroach " .
Just hope that you can provide me with more insight on the following ( 3 ) questions :
Q38.1 : Is it scientifically possible for a albino cockroach to mutate in the wild naturally ?
Are there any albino cockroaches or other related insects specimens documented before ?
A1 : Such mutants are possible but the hardness of the cockroach cuticle depends upon the tanning process which cross - links its cuticle with a process that creates a mahogany - like color .
Thus an albino cockroach ( or other naked insect ) would have weakened cuticle which would make it very vulnerable to attack .
In insects clothed in colored hairs or scales the color of the scales can become white due to the storage of white substance in the scales .
In this sense the underwing moth , Catocal relicta , has an albino morph which is able to hide on birch bark trees based on its ability to hide on the cryptic bark surface , URL : http://www.bio.umass.edu/biology/kunkel/catocala.html
Albino examples such as the one above are relatively common in insects .
They were observed by midieval monks who manually transcribed the bible and included the albino genetic " sports " as decorations in the margins of illuminated manuscripts .
Q38.2 : I have personally seen American cockroaches ... that are not entirely brown .
I have seen one ( full grown adult ) with partially white wings and my friend claimed to have collected one with white eyes .
Are these rare finds ?
A2 : If injured while molting a cockroach may not fully tan its wings .
White eyed Periplaneta cultures are available in some labs but I am not aware of how frequent the gene is in the wild and whether any of them are based on distinct genes .
There are dozens of genes for abnormal colored eyes in Blattella germanica , not all are white .
It would be interesting to cross the available white eye Periplaneta cultures to see if they complement each other ( i.e. are from distinct mutant genes ) .
These albino mutant eyes are mutations of the eye pigments which does not involve the cuticle and thus there are not the limitations to the structural properties of the cuticle as is with the surface integument .
Q38.3 : I saw a documentary ... reputable organization who claims that a cockroach has two " brains " one in front and one behind .
That is why a cockroach ... continues to function as per normal ( except feeding ) when its head is cut off .
Is this true ?
A3 : That is true .
The reproductive behavior is somewhat driven by its terminal abdominal ganglion , the VI abdominal ganglion , which is quite large .
The preying mantid is in the same insect Order , Dictyoptera , and it is famous for the males prowess in completing sexual behavior after the female has bitten off the male 's head .
In this case the brain ( in the head ) is thought of inhibiting the reproductive behavior and when bitten off the reproductive behavior , released from inhibition and programmed into the VI ganglion , takes over .
The cockroach VI ganglion is responsible for coordinating the reknowned escape reflex of the cockroach .
Delicate hairs on the cockroach hind end detect air rushing in front of a predator .
The sensory hairs transmit their signals to the VI ganglion , it interprets the signals as an attack ( or not ) and accordingly sends a rapid message to the thoracic legs to start running .
This escape reflex does not require the coordination by the ( anterior ) brain in the cockroach head .
Q37 : Kunal Patel writes :
( Does ) the presence of an exoskeleton ( in cockroaches ) increase the efficiency of locomotion in comparison with the hydrostatic skeleton of worms ?
A : Kunal ,
I assume you are referring to annelid and polychaete worms and not the larvae of insects ( e.g. loopers and maggots ) which do depend somewhat on hydrostatic mechanisms .
Given that spiders , like worms , have a partial hydrostatic skeleton I am not sure that there is any difference in efficiency unless you say that the success of insects vs spiders shows that the insect design is more successful .
I would say that the variety of motion shown by insects is an indication of the benefits of the opposing - muscle approach to design .
Insects have established several mechanisms of flight while spiders have only been able to do it by parachuting .
Perhaps this is an indication of the limits of a hydrostatic skeleton .
I am not sure that it says anything about the efficiency of comparable motion in a biophysical sense .
When a hydraulic system is more efficient , the insect uses it .
The spider is limited to using blood pressure to extend limbs , perhaps because they have not developed an easy local sclerotization of structures by which to create the fulcrum and levers for extensor muscles to work .
Again this does not speak to whether the blood pressure extension is more or less efficient .
I would think that controlling localized pressure differences allowing dexterious extension of one limb but retraction of another would seem to be less efficient .
The tubular worms on the other hand do not in general have the problem of multiple appendages needing separate control ; however they can extend different segments of their body by resisting extension in select regions by using their retractor muscles in those regions .
Q36 : Samantha writes :
I am doing a report on cockroaches and was wondering what are cockroach 's support system (s ) ?
A : Samantha ,
This is clearly an assignment from someone who knows the type of answer they want .
I am not sure what the questioner wants .
I imagine that the majority of the approximate 3000 cockroach species are largely on their own in the environment .
Their support is based on their membership and place in the food web .
They are omnivores and thus eat almost any organic matter that does not fight back .
They are eaten by many small lizards , amphibians , mammals , and birds .
Domesticated cockroaches ( about 10 species throughout the world ) have found it easy to live with humans and get their food , water and shelter from the human shelters in which they live .
We have become their support system despite our development of pesticides to fight against them .
Q35 : Diane Wilson writes :
I am a graduate students at UAlbany ( NY ) .
Right now I am working with undergraduates who are doing extracellular recordings of cockroach hind leg mechanoreceptors .
We are having a hard time keeping our roaches alive and have resorted to trying to catch them around the building with limited success .
Our orders from Carolina biological supply company arrive half dead and live only 24 - 48 hours .
I was hoping you have some suggestions as to a good source , trapping tactics and stratigies for maintenance .
A : Diane ,
Cockroaches should be kept and reared at a temperature close to 30°C .
If you allow them to chill they will die of cold shock .
That is most likely the reason for your roach deaths after shipments made during the winter in your latitude .
25 °C - 30 °C is the recommended growing temperature for Periplaneta .
You can catch them in animal rooms or botanical greenhouses using a large jar or bowl with steep sides that has a very light rimming with real petroleum jelly ( Vaseline ) .
Bait the trap with banana or potatoes and carrots and place it in a warm moist area overnight .
There is no excuse for failure !
Q34 : M.I.A. writes :
Also , how big is a cockroach baby or nymph ?
Occasionally I have seen very tiny ( about the size of two fruit flys ) beetle creatures in our apartment .
( Are these baby cockroaches ? )
A : M.I.A. ,
I can not identify things I can not see .
The size you mention is about the size of a first instar cockroach .
You can see an example of a recently hatched first instar American cockroach on a dime at URL :
http://www.bio.umass.edu/biology/kunkel/jpegs/pam_fam1.jpg
... a German cockroach newly hatched larva is half that size and black .
Other beetle like creatures ( such as carpet beetles and flower beetles ) can invade a house also .
Q33 : M.I.A. writes :
Also ,
My roommate says that , if you have previously never seen any cockroaches in your room , but one day you see a huge one , then it is a scout , and is not really indicative of the size or amount of cockroaches which might be living within your walls .
Is this true ?
A : M.I.A. ,
The large roaches are more likely to travel than a small roach .
They do not have a social network that would include scouts .
Bigger stride and wings allow adult cockroaches to travel further .
Some male cockroaches can even gain altitude when they fly , most only use their wings to glide .
Q32 : M.I.A. writes :
My roommate believes that cockroaches do n't like air conditioning .
... we live in Hawaii , and air conditioning makes the temperature around us liveable , plus it can cause droplets of water to form , ....
What is your opinion ?
A : M.I.A. ,
Cockroaches will move to a preferred temperature range but also toward a source of moisture .
They prefer a temperature between 25 - 30°C .
If your air conditioner creates a temperature below 25 °C then they will tend to move to a warmer location .
25 °C is ( 25x9/5 +32 ) = 77 ° F so your air conditioner is probably set to cool below 77 °F and tend to repel them .
If you turn your AC off occasionally , the water the AC has dripped outside may have attracted cockroaches and provide a local source of cockroaches to move into your temporarily unconditioned space .
It is not a simple question .
Q31 : Pam Pollister writes :
What color is the blood of a cockroach ?
A : Pam ,
The long answer :
Cockroach blood is not red because they do not use hemoglobin to carry oxygen .
In fact their bloodstream is not used to carry oxygen either .
They use a system of pipes called tracheae to bring the oxygen and remove carbon dioxide from their tissues .
As a result other factors determine the blood color .
Male cockroaches have relatively colorless blood .
Larval females have colorless blood .
Only adult females which are producing eggs have a slightly orange blood because of the protein vitellogenin which is made in the cockroach liver ( its fat body ) and transported through the blood to the ovary .
This protein like chicken yolk is orange because it carries a carotenoid , which is a vitamin A like molecule needed by embryos to develop normally .
The short answer :
Cockroach female adult blood is occasionally orange .
All other cockroach blood is colorless .
Q30 : Clifford writes :
Are cockroaches really members of the Carp ( fish ) Family ?
A : Clifford ,
A cockroach and a carp are in two different Phyla .
The cockroach is an Arthropod and the carp is a Vertebrate .
The closest traditional link is that they are both in the Animal Kingdom .
Some have been confused perhaps by the close spelling of the Stick Insect 's scientific name , Carausius morosus , URL :
http://www.uni-bielefeld.de/biologie/Kybernetik/research/morphology.html
and the gold fish 's scientific name , Carasius auratus , URL :
http://habitatnews.nus.edu.sg/guidebooks/freshfish/text/210.htm
The similar spelling of the Genera of the stick insect ( Carausius ) which is sometimes grouped with the cockroach and the goldfish ( Carasius ) which is related to the carp could have confused some into thinking a carp and cockroach were closely related .
However your confusion is more likely based on the carp having another common name , the roach , BUT not the cock - roach .
Q29 : Leigh writes :
Me and my friends wanna know if the myth is true or its just an urban legend that cockroachs ' eggs spread when u squish them with your shoe and you can spread them around where you walk ?
A : Leigh ,
You and you friends are possibly responding to the urban paranoia about contracting and spreading cockroaches in ones work and home environments .
It seems that they are everywhere and if your apartment or home gets infested one can begin to speculate on how those buggers got into your ' space ' .
You have correctly identified it as an urban legend .
It is highly unlikely that a cockroach egg case ( ootheca ) would survive a classic smooth leather soled shoe .
But who wears smooth soled shoes these days ?
If an ootheca was lucky enough to lodge itself into the honeycomb of a sport shoe tread and the person took off the shoe in disgust and threw it in the corner , I could imagine the eggs surviving and the brutal attempt to end their young lives might have failed .
However the ootheca and contained eggs are huge and mechanically fairly fragile .
Any good mashing should kill them all .
I am sorry if I have started another urban legend about the paranoia of passing cockroaches with improper footgear !
I am not recommending going back to smooth soled shoes but I would recommend looking at the size of the waffle holes in your sport / walking / running shoes to see how they compare to the size of an ootheca which is about the size of a pea .
Q28 : Lynn Gant writes :
What do cockroaches eat ?
A : Lynn ,
Cockroaches are omnivores , like us .
For the most part they will eat anything organic .
Mostly they eat dead or immobile things .
As indicated elesewhere in the FAQ , they rarely bite a human but might nibble on a sore in the middle of the night when an animal is sleeping .
They will eat the glue off the back of postage stamps and the glue bindings off the backs of books , traditional glue being derived from animal protein .
Q27 : Bill writes :
Do cockroaches live in cold climates .
Or put it another way .
" Can cockroaches live in Canada ? " withstanding long cold winters ?
Please settle an argument !
I have been told cockroaches can not live in Edmonton Alberta .
Is this True ? or False ?
A : Bill ,
Domestic pests certainly can live in houses in Canada but not outside , the way they do in Florida or the Gulf coast .
There are numerous wild cockroach species which can live in Canada as they do in the northern USA .
The adults or larvae over - winter in the ground litter and effectively hibernate .
There are some of these species that I have reared in the lab which queue up at a particular larval stage and refuse to proceed with their development toward the adult stage until you give them an artificial winter .
Q26 : Felicity
West writes :
I would like to know why this is called a German cockroach please ?
There are apparently no cockroaches in Germany so where does the name originate from ?
A : Felicity ,
The chief biologist at the Munich TierPark ( zoo ) said they had no German cockroaches in their zoo and gave me three tropical species that they knew were living in various environments they maintained in the park .
But I knew better .
I went to the reptile house which is kept hot and humid and saw loads of Blattella germanica ( Linnaeus , 1767 ) in the space of a half hour , and during the day at that !
B. germanica , the German cockroach , probably entered Europe with Marco Polo or along early trade routes .
Southeast Asia is its most likely origin .
There are several sibling species that are very close to B. germanica ; some even cross breed with it .
Its relatives are common around pig stys in the outer islands of Hong Kong .
Live pigs were often kept on exploration ships during long trips .
It became associated with man and traveled around the world .
It was formally named by Linnaeus and probably was around in Germany for quite a while before the name was applied .
In Germany it is sometimes called " Die russische Schabe " , The Russian Roach .
In Russia it is called the Polish Roach .
In America it was called the Crotton Bug because it came to NY about the time the Crotton Aqueduct was built which was pilloried in the papers because it took so much land by eminent domain .
The American Cockroach , Periplaneta americana ( Linnaeus 1758 ) likewise is a misnomer since it probably originated in North Africa before becoming a world traveler .
It most likely reached the Americas during the early slave trade .
There are thousands of species of cockroach and only about 10 have become cosmopolitan pests of man .
Most of the others do not even have a common name .
Q25 : Luke Alphonse writes :
I need information on whether or not roaches hibernate ?
A : Luke ,
The wild cockroaches in the northern USA do hibernate .
They go into a suspended state of development in late fall and then they must go through a dormancy phase in the winter before they will resume development in the spring .
If you keep them in a warm environment during the winter they will not develop any further and remain in a suspended state for more than a year .
This phenomenon has not been published on as far as I know .
The species I know this about through my unpublished research are Parcoblatta pensylvanicus and Parcoblatta virginica .
It would be interesting to know if these species go through this hibernation in the southern reaches of their range where a hard winter is not experienced .
Q24 : Mkrs0042 writes :
My daughter told me she was at a friends house and they had WHITE cockroaches !!!
UGH .
I have never heard of them .
Is there a such creature ?
A : Mkrs ... ,
That is a common observation ; look at URL : http://www.bio.umass.edu/biology/kunkel/bgmolt.html
Q23 : Nick writes :
I am deathly afraid of cockroaches and it may soothe my fear a little if I knew they had a purpose .
What are cockroaches good for ?
A : Nick ,
Fear of domestic cockroach pests is perhaps warranted because they have been associated with the development of childhood asthma and thus it is better not to have them in your home environment .
Cockroaches as a group are part of the worldwide food web .
They are omnivore scavengers which clean up our environment and help recycle the organic litter that would accumulate if it were not decomposed by organisms which include cockroaches .
Furthermore they serve as food for small mammals , birds , amphibians and lizards .
There are over 3000 species of cockroaches and only 10 species are on the World Health Organization list of human pests .
The other 3000 species are welcome members of the biodiversity on this planet .
Q22 : Joanna writes :
Is the cockroach 's brain spread around its body ?
A : Joanna ,
Insects as a group are said to think in their periphery .
This is because many of their innate behaviors are hardwired in peripheral ganglions more so than vertebrates .
For instance flying behavior is controlled in the thoracic ganglia and some reproductive behavior such as copulation is controlled in the last abdominal ganglion .
Whenever sexual behavior or flying behavior has to be coordinated with the visual system the behavior includes what you might call the brain ( head ganglion ) .
The standard cockroach escape mechanism involves the tail ( cerci ) sensory signals that impinge on the terminal abdominal ganglion ( A6 ) and giant fibers that communicate an escape signal from A6 to the 3 thoracic ganglia ( T1 - T3 ) which control the legs in running behavior .
So people might say that the cockroach 's brain is spread around the body in abdominal ganglia A1 - A6 and thoracic ganglia T1 - T3 and head ganglia ( brain , frontal and suboesophageal ganglion ) .
Q21 : Ajay writes :
Could
You please let me know how do cockroaches breath ?
A : Ajay ,
Cockroaches , like all insects , breathe through a system of tubes called tracheae , a word similar to the name of the tube leading to our lungs .
The tracheae of insects are attached to the spiracles which are small valved openings on the side of each body segment , excluding the head .
Thus the cockroach can breathe without its head !
The valves open when the CO 2 level in the insect rises to an unacceptable level ; then the CO 2 diffuses out of the tracheae to the outside and fresh oxygen diffuses in .
The tracheal system brings the air directly to cells because they branch continually like a tree until their finest divisions tracheoles are associated with each cell allowing gaseous oxygen to disolve in the cytoplasm lying across the fine cuticle lining of the tracheole .
CO 2 diffuses out of the cell into the tracheole .
Most insects do not have muscular lungs and thus do not actively breathe in the vertebrate lung manner .
However in some very large insects the diffusion process may not be sufficient to provide oxygen at the necessary rate and body musculature may contract rhythmically to forceably move air out and in the spiracles and one can actually call this breathing .
This might be associated with such activities as the energetic flight of the migratory locust .
Q20 : Anthony writes :
... a story ( is ) reputed to have aired on CNN about a woman , who while licking an envelope , got a paper cut from the flap on her tongue and was exposed to a cockroach egg which incubated inside her tongue .
The woman later had the alive roach removed by a doctor .
Is this possible ?
A : Anthony ,
This item is utter trash .
The cockroach egg is huge .
Most eggs are 2 mm long and are closely packed side by side and 2 by 2 like franks in a dozen package .
They do not survive outside of the oothecae or egg case , which contains 12 - 40 of the eggs , and I can not imagine them being associated with the lickable surface of an envelope in any way such that they were transferred into a paper cut tongue .
You just have to sit back and laugh at the gullible nature of the CNN producer / director who did not have enough biology in his education to know when he / she was out of her depth and needed to consult with someone who knew better .
The producer / director of that program should be fired for promoting misinformation .
I almost doubt that it ever aired .
Thanks for playing the skeptic !
Q19 : Rachele Besley writes :
I am a ... student from New Zealand doing a study on Cockroaches and was wondering whether you could tell me something on their response to light , whether they are attracted to it or not and whether it affects their behaviour .
A : Rachele ,
I did a quick search on cockroach circadian behavior and found the following references ... of papers .
I understand that you ... may not be aware of some of the technical language in these ( titles ) but perhaps some of it will be useful .
Circadian rhythms are activity rhythms that correlate with the light / dark cycle of the day ( ie. the normal 24 hour day / night light rhythm ) .
When organisms are put into constant dark they continue to behave as if the normal light / dark cycle was still there ; that is they anticipate being awake when they normally would , during the 4 hours after lights go off at night .
This internal clock can be reset by an artificially imposed lights off that a researcher imposes in a research arena .
This demonstrates that the cockroaches respond to light and can reset their internal clock to a new rhythm as they should be able to since dusk changes its time of onset gradually during the year .
You can do a search of the scientific literature using other key words at the following URL :
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/
For example try searching for the keywords : cockroach vision
This is one of the free ways of searching the scientific literature that you can do yourself .
When you find things you do not understand you can try finding an expert to explain the issue , such as one of the authors in the paper with which you are having problems .
Good luck with your quest !

( CNN ) -- Riots from Haiti to Bangladesh to Egypt over the soaring costs of basic foods have brought the issue to a boiling point and catapulted it to the forefront of the world 's attention , the head of an agency focused on global development said Monday .
Bangladeshi demonstrators chant slogans against high food prices during weekend protests .
" This is the world 's big story , " said Jeffrey Sachs , director of Columbia University 's Earth Institute .
" The finance ministers were in shock , almost in panic this weekend , " he said on CNN's " American Morning , " in a reference to top economic officials who gathered in Washington .
" There are riots all over the world in the poor countries ... and , of course , our own poor are feeling it in the United States . "
World Bank President Robert Zoellick has said the surging costs could mean " seven lost years " in the fight against worldwide poverty .
" While many are worrying about filling their gas tanks , many others around the world are struggling to fill their stomachs , and it is getting more and more difficult every day , " Zoellick said late last week in a speech opening meetings with finance ministers .
Watch what world leaders are doing to solve the problem »
" The international community must fill the at least $ 500 million food gap identified by the U.N. 's World Food Programme to meet emergency needs , " he said .
" Governments should be able to come up with this assistance and come up with it now . "
The White House announced Monday evening that an estimated $ 200 million in emergency food aid would be made available through the U.S. Agency for International Development .
" This additional food aid will address the impact of rising commodity prices on U.S. emergency food aid programs , and be used to meet unanticipated food aid needs in Africa and elsewhere , " the White House said in a news release .
" In just two months , " Zoellick said in his speech , " rice prices have skyrocketed to near historical levels , rising by around 75 percent globally and more in some markets , with more likely to come .
In Bangladesh , a 2 - kilogram bag of rice ... now consumes about half of the daily income of a poor family . "
The price of wheat has jumped 120 percent in the past year , he said -- meaning that the price of a loaf of bread has more than doubled in places where the poor spend as much as 75 percent of their income on food .
" This is not just about meals forgone today or about increasing social unrest .
This is about lost learning potential for children and adults in the future , stunted intellectual and physical growth , " Zoellick said .
Dominique Strauss - Kahn , managing director of the International Monetary Fund , also spoke at the joint IMF - World Bank spring meeting .
" If food prices go on as they are today , then the consequences on the population in a large set of countries ... will be terrible , " he said .
He added that " disruptions may occur in the economic environment ... so that at the end of the day most governments , having done well during the last five or 10 years , will see what they have done totally destroyed , and their legitimacy facing the population destroyed also . "
In Haiti , the prime minister was kicked out of office Saturday , and hospital beds are filled with wounded following riots sparked by food prices .
Watch Haitians riot over food prices »
The World Bank announced a $ 10 million grant from the United States for Haiti to help the government assist poor families .
In Egypt , rioters have burned cars and destroyed windows of numerous buildings as police in riot gear have tried to quell protests .
Images from Bangladesh and Mozambique tell a similar story .
In the United States and other Western nations , more and more poor families are feeling the pinch .
In recent days , presidential candidates have paid increasing attention to the cost of food , often citing it on the stump .
The issue is also fueling a rising debate over how much the rising prices can be blamed on ethanol production .
The basic argument is that because ethanol comes from corn , the push to replace some traditional fuels with ethanol has created a new demand for corn that has thrown off world food prices .
Jean Ziegler , U.N. special rapporteur on the right to food , has called using food crops to create ethanol " a crime against humanity . "
" We 've been putting our food into the gas tank -- this corn - to - ethanol subsidy which our government is doing really makes little sense , " said Columbia University 's Sachs .
Former President Clinton , at a campaign stop for his wife in Pennsylvania over the weekend , said , " Corn is the single most inefficient way to produce ethanol because it uses a lot of energy and because it drives up the price of food . "
Some environmental groups reject the focus on ethanol in examining food prices .
" The contrived food vs. fuel debate has reared its ugly head once again , " the Renewable Fuels Association says on its
Web site , adding that " numerous statistical analyses have demonstrated that the price of oil -- not corn prices or ethanol production -- has the greatest impact on consumer food prices because it is integral to virtually every phase of food production , from processing to packaging to transportation . "
Analysts agree the cost of fuel is among the reasons for the skyrocketing prices .
Another major reason is rising demand , particularly in places in the midst of a population boom , such as China and India .
Also , said Sachs , " climate shocks " are damaging food supply in parts of the world .
" You add it all together : Demand is soaring , supply has been cut back , food has been diverted into the gas tank .
It 's added up to a price explosion . "

The fastest growing sector of global organised crime is cyber -crime .
Internet banking and credit - card fraud is increasing at a rate of about 40 percent per year and is estimated to be worth around $ 100 billion annually .
Brazil produces more cyber - criminals than any other nation .
As Misha Glenny finds out in the final part of this series , How Crime Took on the World , there are particular reasons for this - not least the fact that Brazil has one of the most sophisticated banking systems in the world .
This is because for many years , the Brazilians operated a protectionist economic system , and therefore developed its own highly skilled IT workforce .
And there is a rich , tempting market for cyber criminals in Brazil .
Although only 14 percent of the population are regular internet users , that 's still close to 30 million people .

IBM Develops World 's Tiniest Nanophotonic Switch to Route Optical Data Between Cores in Future Computer Chips
( Nanowerk News ) IBM scientists today took another significant advance towards sending information inside a computer chip by using light pulses instead of electrons by building the worlds tiniest nanophotonic switch with a footprint about 100X smaller than the cross section of a human hair .
The switch is an important building block to control the flow of information inside future chips and can significantly speed up the chip performance while using much less energy .
The silicon broadband optical switch , represented by the black boxes in the figure , performs the key role of directing traffic within the on-chip optical network .
Once the electrical signals from each processor core have been converted into pulses of light , the switch devices are set into the necessary positions , as shown by the arrows , for routing the optical messages from the transmitting core to the receiving core .
( Image : IBM )
Todays announcement is a continuation of a series of IBM developments towards an on -chip optical network :
In November 2005 , IBM scientists demonstrated a silicon nanophotonic device that can significantly slow down and actively control the speed of light .
In December 2006 an analogous tiny silicon device was used to demonstrate buffering of over a byte of information encoded in optical pulses a requirement for building optical buffers for on - chip optical networks .
In December 2007 , IBM scientists announced the development of an ultra-compact silicon electro- optic modulator , which performs the job of converting electrical signals into the light pulses , a prerequisite for enabling on - chip optical communications .
 This new development is a critical addition in the quest to build an on - chip optical network ,   said Yurii Vlasov , manager of silicon nanophotonics at IBMs TJ Watson Research Center .
 In view of all the progress that this field has seen for the last few years it looks that our vision for on - chip optical networks is becoming more and more realistic .
Todays announcement is another significant advance in their quest to develop next generation high - performance multi-core computer chips which transmit information internally using pulses of light traveling through silicon instead of electrical signals on copper wires .
In a paper published in the journal Nature Photonics , IBM unveils the development of a silicon broadband optical switch , another key component required to enable on - chip optical interconnects .
Once the electrical signals have been converted into pulses of light , this switching device performs the key role of directing traffic within the network , ensuring that optical messages from one processor core can efficiently get to any of the other cores on the chip .
The IBM team demonstrated that their switch has several critical characteristics which make it ideally suited to on - chip applications .
First , the switch is extremely compact .
As many as 2000 would fit side - by - side in an area of one square millimeter , easily meeting integration requirements for future multi-core processors .
Second , the device is able to route a huge amount of data since many different wavelengths or colors of light can be switched simultaneously .
With each wavelength carrying data at up to 40 Gb/s , it is possible to switch an aggregate bandwidth exceeding 1 Tb/s -- a requirement for routing large messages between distant cores .
Last but not least , IBM scientists showed for the first time that their optical switch is capable of operating within a realistic on - chip environment , where the temperature of the chip itself can change dramatically in the vicinity of hot - spots ,  which move around depending upon the way the processors are functioning at any given moment .
The IBM scientists believe this temperature - drift tolerant operation to be one of the most critical requirements for on - chip optical networks .
An important trend in the microelectronics industry is to increase the parallelism in computation by multi- threading , by building large scale multi-chip systems and , more recently , by increasing the number of cores on a single chip .
For example the IBM Cell processor which powers Sonys PlayStation 3 gaming console consists of nine brains ,  or cores , on a single chip .
As users continue to demand greater computing performance , chip designers plan to increase this number to tens or even hundreds of cores .
This approach , however , only makes sense if each core can receive and transmit large messages from all other cores on the chip simultaneously .
The individual cores located on todays multi-core microprocessors communicate with one another over millions of tiny copper wires .
However , this copper wiring would simply use up too much power and be incapable of transmitting the enormous amount of information required to enable massively multi-core processors .
IBM researches are exploring an alternative solution to this problem by connecting cores using pulses of light in an on -chip optical network based on silicon nanophotonic integrated circuits .
Like a long - haul fiber - optic network , such an extremely miniature on - chip network will transmit , receive , and route messages between individual cores that are encoded as a pulses of light .
It is envisioned that using light instead of wires , as much as 100 times more information can be sent between cores , while using 10 times less power and consequently generating less heat .
The report on this work , entitled  High - throughput silicon nanophotonic wavelength - insensitive switch for on - chip optical networks  by Yurii Vlasov , William M. J. Green , and Fengnian Xia of IBMs T.J.Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights , N.Y. is published in the April 2008 issue of the journal Nature Photonics .
This work was partially supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) through the Defense Sciences Office program  Slowing , Storing and Processing Light .

Two Greenhills Middle School students who started a project to earn a Girl Scout Bronze Award have ended up rejecting what may be the best known of their organization 's symbols : Girl Scout cookies .
Madison Vorva and Rhiannon Tomtishen , both 12 , started doing research last fall on endangered orangutans in Indonesia as part of their Bronze Award project .
They discovered that the habitat of orangutans is being threatened by conversion of the land to the production of palm oil , which is an ingredient in Girl Scout cookies .
Although they 've sold many boxes of Girl Scout cookies over the years , this year they sold magazines instead because of the palm oil issues .
" Just doing the Bronze Award would n't be enough , " Madison said .
Rhiannon agreed .
" We have stopped selling ( the cookies ) , " she said .
The girls have also launched an education drive , giving presentations at their school in Ann Arbor and other area schools and they have established a
Web site
.
They also recently met Jane Goodall at a youth conference in Chicago , where Goodall signed their petition against palm oil .
Goodall is renowned for her studies of primates and efforts to protect them .
Palm oil production leads to conflict between orangutans and people , the girls said .
" We 've seen pictures of orangutans set afire and beaten .
You really just want to reach out and do all that you can to help save them , " Madison said .
Palm oil , which is produced from a fern - like plant , is grown after the rain forest is logged and then burned - the slash - and - burn agricultural technique practiced for centuries in tropical areas .
The deforestation is increasing rapidly , party because the demand for palm oil , which is trans fat free , has risen , the girls said .
They said that palm oil is found in numerous products , including many candies and snacks that they once enjoyed but now avoid .
Trans fat is unhealthy for humans .
In 2006 , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration began requiring trans fat to be listed on the Nutrition Facts labels on manufactured food products .
Lisa Raycraft , director of funds development for Girl Scouts of the Huron Valley Council , to which Rhiannon and Madison belong , said cookie sales are a vital part of the organization 's funding .
Maintaining two camps that involve girls in nature and outdoor skills would not be possible without the cookie sales , Raycraft said .
Reporter Marjorie Kauth - Karjala can be reached at 734-482-2961 or mkarjala@annarbornews.com .
She also said that
ABC Bakers
, which produces cookies sold by the council , has said it is committed to using palm oil grown on rehabilitated or previously cleared land rather than on land that is deforested specifically for palm oil production .
Raycraft also gave
The News a letter from the company that said it is researching how to use as little palm oil as possible .
The girls said the explanation does not satisfy them and they plan to continue their boycott of Girl Scout cookies .
Raycraft said the council will work with the girls and has invited them to make their presentation about the dangers of palm oil to Girl Scout leaders prior to next year 's cookie sale .
The education effort is to be part of Rhiannon and Madison 's work toward the Girl Scout Silver Award , Raycraft said .
The two girls said they plan to continue as Girl Scouts despite the conflict .
" Overall , it 's a pretty good organization , " Madison said .
An outstanding analysis of the hypocrisy in Bush 's comments to Israel 's Knesset implying Democrats were " appeasing " America 's " enemies , " given his family 's history and involvement very early on with Nazi Germany ; only a few months left in his term !
By : Robert Parry / Consortium News , submitted by S. Fox
End
-- The irony of George W. Bush going before the Knesset and mocking the late Sen. William Borah for expressing surprise at Adolf Hitler 's 1939 invasion of Poland is that Bush 's own family played a much bigger role assisting the Nazis .
If Borah , an isolationist Republican from Idaho , sounded naive saying " Lord , if only I could have talked to Hitler , all of this might have been avoided , " then what should be said about Bush 's grandfather and other members of his family providing banking and industrial assistance to the Nazis as they built their war machine in the 1930s ?
The archival evidence is now clear that Prescott Bush , the president 's grandfather , was a director and shareholder of companies that profited from and collaborated with key financial backers of Nazi Germany .
That business relationship continued after Hitler invaded Poland in 1939 and even after Germany declared war on the United States following Japan 's bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941 .
It stopped only when the U.S. government seized assets of Bush - connected companies in late 1942 under the " Trading with the Enemy Act . "
So , perhaps instead of holding up Sen .
Borah to ridicule , Bush might have acknowledged in his May 15 speech that his forebears also were blind to the dangers of Hitler .
Bush might have noted that his family 's wealth , which fueled his own political rise , was partly derived from Nazi collaboration and possibly from slave labor provided by Auschwitz and other concentration camps .
A more honest speech before the Knesset - on the 60th anniversary of Israel 's founding - might have contained an apology to the Jewish people from a leading son of the Bush family for letting its greed contribute to Nazi power and to the horrors of the Holocaust .
Instead , there was just the jab at Sen.
Borah , who died in 1940 .
President Bush apparently saw no reason to remind the world of a dark chapter from the family history .
After all , those ugly facts mostly disappeared from public consciousness soon after World War II .
Protected by layers of well - connected friends , Prescott Bush brushed aside the Nazi scandal and won a U.S. Senate seat from Connecticut , which enabled him to start laying the foundation for the family 's political dynasty .
In recent years , however , the archival records from the pre-war era have been assembled , drawing from the Harriman family papers at the Library of Congress , documents at the National Archives , and records from war - crimes trials after Germany 's surrender .
Managers for the PowerfulOne can trace the origins of this story back more than a century to the emergence of Samuel Bush , George W. Bush 's great - grandfather , as a key manager for a set of powerful American business families , including the Rockefellers and the Harrimans .
[ See Consortiumnews.com 's " Bush Family Chronicles : The Patriarchs . " ]
That chapter took an important turn in 1919 when investment banker George Herbert Walker teamed up with Averell Harriman , scion to a railroad fortune , to found a new investment banking firm , W.A. Harriman Company .
The Harriman firm was backed by the Rockefellers ' National City Bank and the Morgan family 's Guaranty Trust .
The English - educated Walker assisted in assembling the Harriman family 's overseas business investments .
In 1921 , Walker 's favorite daughter , Dorothy , married Samuel Bush 's son Prescott , a Yale graduate and a member of the school 's exclusive Skull and Bones society .
Handsome and athletic , admired for his golf and tennis skills , Prescott Bush was a young man with the easy grace of someone born into the comfortable yet competitive world of upper - crust contacts .
Three years later , Dorothy gave birth to George Herbert Walker Bush in Milton , Massachusetts .
Lifted by the financial boom of the 1920s , Prescott and Dorothy Bush were on the rise .
By 1926 , George Herbert Walker had brought his son - in - law in on a piece of the Harriman action , hiring him as a vice president in the Harriman banking firm .
By the mid-Thirties , Prescott Bush had become a managing partner at the merged firm of Brown Brothers Harriman .
The archival records also show that Brown Brothers Harriman served as the U.S. financial service arm for German industrialist Fritz Thyssen , an early funder of the Nazi Party .
Thyssen , an admirer of Adolf Hitler since the 1920s , joined the Nazi Party in 1931 when it was still a fringe organization .
He helped bail the struggling party out with financial help , even providing its headquarters building in Munich .
Meanwhile , Averell Harriman had launched the Hamburg - Amerika line of steamships to facilitate the bank 's dealings with Germany , and made Prescott Bush a director .
The ships delivered fuel , steel , coal , gold and money to Germany as Hitler was consolidating his power and building his war machine .
Other evidence shows that Prescott Bush served as the director of the Union Banking Corp. of New York , which represented Thyssen 's interests in the United States and was owned by a Thyssen - controlled bank in the Netherlands .
As a steel magnate , Thyssen was amassing a fortune as Hitler rearmed Germany .
Documents also linked Bush to Thyssen 's Consolidated Silesian Steel Company , which was based in mineral - rich Silesia on the German - Polish border and exploited slave labor from Nazi concentration camps , including Auschwitz .
But records at the National Archives do not spell out exactly when Bush 's connection ended or what he knew about the business details .
In 1941 , Thyssen had a falling out with Hitler and fled to France where he was captured .
Much of Thyssen 's empire went under the direct control of the Nazis , but even that did not shatter the business ties that existed with Prescott Bush and Harriman 's bank .
It was n't until August 1942 that newspaper stories disclosed the secretive ties between Union Banking Corp. and Nazi Germany .
After an investigation , the U.S. government seized the property of the Hamburg - Amerika line and moved against affiliates of the Union Banking Corp .
In November 1942 , the government seized the assets of the Silesian - American Corp .
[ For more details , see an investigative report by the U.K. Guardian , Sept. 25 , 2004 .
]
No Kiss of DeathFor most public figures , allegations of trading with the enemy would have been a political kiss of death , but the disclosures barely left a lipstick smudge on Averell Harriman , Prescott Bush and other business associates implicated in the Nazi business dealings .
" Politically , the significance of these dealings - the great surprise - is that none of it seemed to matter much over the next decade or so , " wrote Kevin Phillips in American Dynasty .
"
A few questions would be raised , but Democrat Averell Harriman would not be stopped from becoming federal mutual security administrator in 1951 or winning election as governor of New York in 1954 .
Nor would Republican Prescott Bush ( who was elected senator from Connecticut in 1952 ) and his presidential descendants be hurt in any of their future elections .
" Indeed , the quick dissipation of the Nazi financial scandal was only a portent of the Bush family 's future .
Unlike politicians of lower classes , the Bushes seemed to travel in a bubble impervious to accusations of impropriety , since the Eastern Establishment does n't like to think badly of its own .
[ For details , see Robert Parry 's Secrecy & Privilege . ]
To this day - as President Bush showed by mocking the long - forgotten Sen.
Borah and then wielding the Nazi " appeasement " club against Barack Obama and other Democrats - the assumption remains that the bubble will continue to protect the Bush family name .
However , the evidence from dusty archives suggests that the Bush family went way beyond appeasement of Adolf Hitler to aiding and abetting the Nazis . # # # Art gallery in Santa Fe for 28 years , with mega interests in Bill Richardson for Secretary of State , consumer protection legislation , public policy , the post 2008 election political climate , United Nations , International Health , Banning Aspartame , ending 8 years of military - glutted kleptocracy in the USA , and other minor concerns .....
Obama Religious Ties Are ' Manna From Heaven ' for GOP Racial uproar sparked by second preacher may damage Obama in general election .
June 2 , 2008  --
The racially inflammatory remarks of a second preacher connected to Sen.
Barack Obama have reignited a divisive racial debate that undermines his candidacy 's unifying theme and appears to be hurting his chances in the general election this fall .
" This is manna from heaven [ for the GOP ] .
...
It raises the risk factor around this young man who would be the first African - American president , " NPR senior political analyst Juan Williams said today .
" People identify Obama as young , energetic , telegenic , intelligent , talking about change and unifying the races .
Then the second thing that comes to mind is , ' Gee , what about this Rev. Wright ?
What about Father Pfleger ?
Why is he associated with these people who are so inflammatory and mean - spirited and even racial ? ' "
Williams was referring to a recent sermon by the Rev. Michael Pfleger , an Obama friend and white Catholic priest who , while visiting Chicago 's Trinity United Church of Christ recently , openly mocked Hillary Clinton as predominately black churchgoers cheered him on .
" I 'm white .
I 'm entitled .
There 's a black man stealing my show , " Pfleger said , impersonating Clinton and then feigning tears to an enthusiastic audience .
Obama , who said he was disappointed in Pfleger 's " divisive , backward - looking rhetoric , " quit Trinity United Friday , where he has been a member for 20 years .
Obama cited , among other things , the uproar surrounding this most recent incident and the earlier comments by the church 's former pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright .
" Barack Obama 's favorability ratings have been sinking , especially with the swing voters as we head toward the general election : white women , Jews , Latinos ; it 's a real problem , " Williams said .
A recent Pew poll shows that the Democratic presidential candidate 's lead has slimmed dramatically to 47 - to - 44 percent in a hypothetical general election matchup against presumptive GOP nominee Sen. John McCain of Arizona .
The tightening coincides with a dip in Obama 's favorability ratings , which have slipped 8 percentage points to 51 percent since late February , just before the Wright controversy broke .
Racial Fury or Misunderstanding ?
Pfleger also said during the sermon that " racism is still America 's greatest addiction .
... I also believe that America is the greatest sin against God . "
Some black church leaders and other supporters said that to understand these kind of comments and the positive reactions they elicit , one needs to understand that this is a church forged in repression and forced separation .
" When you deal with the issue of racism in America , sometimes the recalling of how black people were treated ... causes one to become angry and often take rhetoric to a place that it might turn off not only whites , but even some blacks , " said Calvin Butts , the pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in New York City .
Father Edward Beck , a white priest and host of ABC News Now's " Faith Matters , " defended Pfleger 's intentions but said he understood why some white people " may be a bit frightened " by such negative language .
" You have to understand beneath it there is real sentiment , " he said .
" There is a feeling of being disenfranchised .
Let 's not pretend there is still not a race issue in America . "
NPR 's Williams disagreed with that assessment of Pfleger 's remarks , calling his sermon a " minstrel show . "
" Yes , there 's a history of bitter segregation in a city like Chicago , but what are these ministers doing ?
They 're stirring people up , appealing to their most base racist sentiments .
What you saw from Father Pfleger looked like a minstrel show put on for black people and I thought he was mocking , bitter , " he said .
" Mocking of Hillary Clinton goes beyond any black liberation theology .
That 's putting down somebody who has a fairly progressive record on race in America .
It sounds more like , the whole thing about God , and America coming from Rev. Wright again .
It stirs up all those feelings again . "
Beck acknowledged that such perceived white - bashing or reverse - racism has some whites he knows worried that this kind of controversy would erupt again if Obama were president and that they " are little bit afraid of it . "
Having worked with Pfleger for nearly three years , Beck also said that the characterization of him as a bad parody of an African - American preacher was unfair .
He pointed out that Pfleger had been " arrested for injustice against African - American people and adopted an African - American child . "
Despite Obama 's attempt to quell the racial debate surrounding his candidacy with a speech in Philadelphia in March , this latest round of controversy shows there is still a reservoir of racial tension that has yet to be fully explored .
Liechtenstein will demand Mr Kieber 's extradition if he is arrested abroad
The data is being used in a giant tax evasion probe in Germany and several other countries including Britain .
The Liechtenstein police said on their website that they are looking for Heinrich Kieber , a 42 - year old former employee of LGT Bank .
Police posted a photo of Mr Kieber , showing a balding man with glasses .
" Mr Kieber is subject to an international arrest warrant .
The Liechtenstein law enforcement agencies demand his immediate extradition , " the statement said .
New identity ?
The police statement also referred to media reports that Mr Kieber was issued with a new identity and travel documents by German intelligence .
Germany launched its tax inquiry after reportedly paying 5 m euros ( $ 7.7 m ; £ 3.8 m ) in January 2006 for a list of wealthy Germans with money stashed away in the tiny Alpine principality that has tight bank secrecy laws .
The UK's tax authority , the HMRC , has confirmed it also paid an informant for data regarding UK citizens who have accounts in tax haven Liechtenstein .
Investigators in the US , Australia , Italy , France , Sweden , Canada , New Zealand , Spain and the Czech Republic are among other countries hunting for taxpayers hiding their money in Liechtenstein .
' Uncooperative tax haven '
Authorities in Liechtenstein have condemned the purchase of what it says is confidential bank data .
LGT
Treuhand , part controlled by the principality 's royal family , claims the list of 1,400 customer names are contained on DVDs that were copied by Mr Kieber in 2002 .
The data concerns about 1,400 clients , with close to half resident in Germany , the bank said .
Liechtenstein's ruler - Crown Prince Alois - has also argued that Germany 's investigation is illegal .
But German prosecutors say their investigation has so far netted 163 people and led to the recovery of more than 27 m euros in tax revenue .
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development lists Liechtenstein as one of only three states remaining on its blacklist of " uncooperative tax havens " .
A new Cato study , by Indur Goklany , suggests that instead of carbon taxes we should spend money on better water policy , drought prevention , anti-malarials , sea level protection , and so on .
In general we should make the world as wealthy as possible .
Here is the link , the piece is intelligent throughout and well worth reading .
Two questions suggest themselves .
First , is the choice either / or ?
I do n’t see arguments against a revenue - neutral carbon tax .
Second , is there really enthusiasm for the proposed measures or is the real intent to do little or nothing on carbon ?
Since this is both a Goklany piece and a Cato piece , an interesting question arises : who exactly is now obliged to push for anti-malarial foreign aid ?
Cato ?
Goklany ?
Either / or ?
Both ?
Or is it enough to just make the comparison once and leave it at that ?
The Progress Report
ADMINISTRATION
Alphonso Gets Evicted
This morning , Housing and Urban Development Secretary Alphonso Jackson announced he is stepping down effective April 18 .
While the White House has so far refused to give a reason for his departure , Jackson faces ongoing probes “ by a federal grand jury , the Justice Department , the FBI and the HUD inspector general . ”
Earlier this month , Sens. Patty Murray ( D - WA ) and Christopher Dodd ( D - CT ) sent a letter to President Bush “ urging him to request Mr. Jackson ’s resignation , arguing that accusations of wrongdoing had made him ineffective . ”
Their calls joined similar ones from Sen. Frank Lautenberg ( D - NJ ) , Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) , and Rep. Barney Frank ( D - MA ) in 2006 .
Jackson was one of Bush ’s few remaining holdovers from Texas , after a parade of these loyalists — including Karl Rove , Harriet Miers , and Dan Bartlett — left the White House last year .
Like so many of Bush ’s Texas friends , Jackson ’s legacy will be one of incompetence , corruption , and political cronyism .
While he was busy awarding lucrative no -bid contracts to his golfing buddies and erecting giant photo homages to himself , the nation was spiraling into the worst housing crisis since the Great Depression .
A PHILADELPHIA STORY : One of the most recent scandals to come to light focuses on Jackson ’s willingness to retaliate against employees unwilling to participate in his cronyism .
In 2006 , Jackson allegedly demanded that the Philadelphia Housing Authority ( PHA ) “ transfer a $ 2 million public property ” at a “ substantial discount ” to Kenny Gamble , a developer , former soul - music songwriter , and friend of Jackson’s .
When PHA director Carl Greene refused , Jackson and his aides called Philadelphia ’s mayor and “ followed up with ‘ menacing ’ threats about the property and other housing programs in at least a dozen letters and phone calls over an 11 - month period . ”
For example , Orlando Cabrera , then - assistant secretary at HUD , suggested in an e-mail that the agency “ make his [ Green ’s ] life less happy . ”
Kim Kendrick , an assistant secretary who oversaw accessible housing , proposed that they “ [ t ] ake away all of his Federal dollars . ”
According to Green , Jackson ’s politically motivated plan to remove federal funds from Philadelphia “ could raise rents for most of its 84,000 low - income tenants and force the layoffs of 250 people . ”
“ This kind of stuff undermines public confidence in our officials , ” Sen . Bob Casey ( D - PA ) said to Jackson during a recent congressional hearing .
LOYAL BUSHIES ONLY : In May 2007 , Jackson testified to Congress , “ I do n’t touch contracts . ”
In retrospect , that statement appears to have been at best a gross inaccuracy , and at worst , an outright lie .
In 2006 , Jackson told a group of business leaders in Texas that he refuses to award contracts to people who disagree with the President .
During this controversial speech on April 28 , 2006 , Jackson recounted a conversation he had with a prospective contractor who had a “ heck of a proposal . ”
This contractor , however , told Jackson , “ I do n’t like President Bush . ”
Jackson said that he thought to himself , “ Brother , you have a disconnect — the president is elected , I was selected . ”
Jackson subsequently refused to award the man the contract , despite the merits of the proposal .
A former HUD assistant secretary also confirmed that Jackson told agency employees to “ consider presidential supporters when you are considering the selected candidates for discretionary contracts . ”
He also said that he “ did not want contracts ” awarded to certain “ political groups , ” which included “ Democrats . ”
Jackson ’s actions appeared to violate the Federal Aquisition Reguations ( 48 CFR 3.101 - 1 ) , which states , “ Government business shall be conducted in a manner above reproach and …with complete impartiality and with preferential treatment for none . ”
CRONYISM OVER COMPETENCE : In Oct. 2007 , federal investigators looked into whether , after Hurricane Katrina , Jackson lined up an emergency “ no - bid contract ” at the HUD - controlled Housing Authority of New Orleans for “ golfing buddy ” and friend William Hairston .
According to HUD , the emergency contract paid Hairston $ 392,000 over a year and a half ; Hairston ’s partner companies also received “ direct contracts ” with HUD .
One of the companies which received a contract in New Orleans , Columbia Residential , had “ significant financial ties to Jackson . ”
Jackson ’s wife also had “ ties to two companies that did business with the New Orleans authority . ”
Atlanta lawyer Michael Hollis , another Jackson friend , “ appears to have been paid approximately $ 1 million for managing the troubled Virgin Islands Housing Authority , ” despite having “ no experience in running a public housing agency . ” A “ top Jackson aide ” reportedly made it clear to officials within HUD that “ Jackson wanted Hollis ” for the job .
Curiously , Hollis received more than four times the salary of his predecessor .

Check that bill
According to the charges that appeared on my phone / Internet bill last month , I signed up for some form of voicemail from MyIProducts Imail for $ 14.95 a month .
Maybe I spent much of the month drunk , as I also appear to have signed up for a similar voicemail service from Orbit Telecom , again at the staggering rate of $ 14.95 a month .
A closer look at the bill shows that I may have been high as well , since I went ahead and signed up for a third voicemail service from Selected Services , Inc .
At least I showed better financial judgment this time ; it cost only $ 12.95 .
One of the many services I did not sign up for
Finally , because my three voicemail accounts just were n't enough , my AT&T bill included yet one more $ 14.95 monthly charge from a company called OneMailADay , LLC .
Their product ?
Some kind of daily e-mail digest , the point of which manages to escape me still .
The bottom line from this weirdness : my AT&T bill doubled from $ 50 to $ 100 because of the four charges , and the charges would recur every month until the end of time .
After giving the matter careful thought , I concluded that I had been neither drunk nor high during the previous month and , unless my seventeen - month old had signed up for a series of voicemail services , I was being scammed .
The first hour after this realization was spent concocting elaborate scenarios under which the scammers in question would suffer the torments of the damned ( or at least of the Illinois correctional system ) , but this turned out to be an unproductive use of my time .
Instead , I set out to learn what had happened , stop it from happening again , and recover all of my money .
What I found along the way was troubling : this sort of thing could happen to you , too , with no warning and no verification , and your own phone company can't help you resolve it .
Welcome to Crammerville
What happened to me ( and what happens to thousands of others each month ) is known as " cramming . "
The Federal Trade Commission calls this " the practice of placing unauthorized , misleading , or deceptive charges on your telephone bill .
Crammers rely on confusing telephone bills in an attempt to trick consumers into paying for services they did not authorize or receive , or that cost more than the consumer was led to believe . "
Your phone company will generally pass along third - party charges , assuming that they are valid .
And they can be ; all sorts of charges ( such as collect calls ) can actually be billed to your account by telecom companies but , for obvious reasons like the total lack of verification , this system is also a scam magnet .
When I called AT&T , the customer service rep sympathized but could do nothing .
The charges had not come from AT&T , I was told , and the company simply had no involvement with them .
What I could do was request a block on such third - party charges , but the block would also prevent AT&T from processing any credit that the companies might issue for the charges .
These credits might take two or even three billing cycles .
In the meantime , these companies or others could continue to add charges to each new bill .
This cycle could continue indefinitely .
Surely , given just how common the practice has become , there was a better way to handle the situation ?
I was told that there was not .
The pause in our conversation was filled with the grinding of my teeth .
Surely , I continued , it could n't possibly be true that any billing company on the planet could simply charge me whatever it wanted just by entering my phone number ?
I was told that it could .
Then , cheerfully : " Is there anything else I can help you with today , Mr. Anderson ? "
I hung up the phone , jogged to the gym , and spent the rest of the hour punching a body bag .
It did n't help .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The leaders of the United States and Britain on Thursday pledged a united effort to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon , possibly by expanding sanctions against Tehran .
“ Our position is clear : that we ’re going to work together along with other nations to make it abundantly clear to the Iranian regime that they must not have the capability of developing a nuclear weapon , ” President George W. Bush said at a Rose Garden news conference with Prime Minister Gordon Brown .
His comments came after Mohamed ElBaradei , director - general of the International Atomic Energy Agency , said Iran ’s progress in developing uranium enrichment is slow and that recent additions to its nuclear fuel production complex have only been older - model centrifuges .
“ If they learn how to enrich , it is knowledge which can be used to develop a nuclear weapon , ” Bush said .
The United States has been leading efforts at the United Nations to pressure Iran to halt its nuclear programme , which Tehran says is only for civilian purposes .
“ Iran continues to defy the will of the international community .
And we are agreed on the need to strengthen the sanctions regime and ensure that these sanctions are effectively implemented , ” Brown said .
The United States has repeatedly said it is pursuing a solution through diplomatic efforts .
“ And now is the time to confront the threat .
And I believe we can solve the problem diplomatically , ” Bush said .
Brown said he was talking with other European leaders about how to extend sanctions against Iran .
“ I make no apology for saying that we will extend sanctions , where possible , on Iran , ” he said .
“ So in the next few weeks we want to extend the measures and sanctions to include investment in liquefied natural gas .
I believe that sends another signal to the regime that what is happening is unacceptable , ” Brown said .
A senior U.S. Treasury official in Washington said U.S. sanctions banning transactions with Iran ’s central bank are among the options in the Bush administration ’s “ toolbox ” to pressure Iran to limit its nuclear programme .
About The Implode - o- Meter
ML - Implode.com was created in late 2006 to raise the alarm about the then - burgeoning implosion of the historically - epic housing and economic bubble .
Started as a modest web page created by founder Aaron Krowne , this objective was achieved by , uniquely , tracking the in - progress implosion of independent mortgage lending companies — then being ignored by a mainstream media in denial of even the existence of the housing bubble .
At that time , you were more likely to hear a partyline of " housing always goes up " and juvenile jeers of " bubbles are for bathtubs " from TV 's talking heads , than of even slight concern about a clearly - overextended , already - frozen housing market .
Operated as a broadly - open community forum , ML - Implode quickly took the lead in news about the mortgage implosion and subprime crisis , as industry professionals flocked to the site to share and find out the latest .
The site even became , in part , a whistleblower platform , fighting ( and winning ) half a dozen lawsuits to defend the right of its contributors to post about corruption and malfeasance in financial companies , and be able to do so confidentially .
Despite its initial incarnation being rendered insolvent by these frivolous legal attacks , ML - Implode continues today in a stripped - down , lean - and - mean embodiment , remaining dedicated to tracking the fallout of the 2007 - 2008 credit crisis .
This mission includes keeping tabs on recession / depressionary conditions , the policy response to the economic downturn and continued financial instability , the Fed and other global central bank interventions ( including " ZIRP " and quantitative easing ) , actions and reforms of the monetary authorities , market manipulation ( official and private sector ) , all global geopolitical conflict with economic roots , the evolution of the banking and monetary system ( including dollar - alternative " reserve currencies " , gold , silver , and bitcoin and other " virtual currencies " ) , the effect of the economic turmoil on society , basic themes of economic fairness and justice , and much more .
We continue to doggedly watch all of these interconnected topic areas , daily picking the most important stories and commentaries , and bringing them together in a convenient and comprehensible form on this site .

Burma ' to let in all aid workers '
Some 2.5 million people have been affected by the cyclone Burma 's top leader has agreed to let all foreign aid workers into the country for relief work in cyclone - hit areas , UN head Ban Ki-moon has said .
After talks in Burma 's remote capital , Nay Pyi Daw , with Gen Than Shwe , Mr Ban said the decision was a breakthrough .
But correspondents say Burma has a record of withdrawing promises made to the UN .
The terms under which workers and aid will be let in are unclear .
About 78,000 people died and 56,000 are missing after the 2 May cyclone .
Mr Ban said Burma would now allow the delivery of aid " via civilian ships and small boats " .
But his wording suggests that the US , British and French warships waiting off the coast with supplies may not be able to dock .
Burma 's military leaders had previously refused to allow a full - scale relief effort by foreign aid workers .
They had said that the relief phase of the aid operation was over and that the government was now focusing on reconstruction .
' World is watching '
Speaking to journalists after his meeting with Gen Than , Mr Ban said he was encouraged by his talks with the Burmese leadership and the agreement made .

Than had failed to respond to the secretary general 's letters and phone calls following the disaster .
But Mr Ban said he was pleased with the meeting : " I had a very good meeting with the senior general and particularly on these aid workers , " he said .
" He has agreed to allow all the aid workers [ into Myanmar ] , regardless of nationality , " Mr Ban said .
" He 's taken quite a flexible position on this matter . "
But he stressed that that " implementation will be the key " .
He also said that more needed to be done and warned that what happened next would be closely watched .
" I came here to give the people of Myanmar a message of hope - the world is watching , and that the world is with you , " he was quoted by AFP as saying .
The BBC's Chris Hogg in Bangkok , Thailand , says one of the first priorities for foreign experts was to get a more accurate picture of needs on the ground .
But it is not clear whether they will be granted unfettered access to the worst - affected areas .
Nor is it clear whether Gen Than has agreed to give visas to foreign aid workers or let them into the Irrawaddy Delta to deliver aid .
The tragedy is that , for some people it is already too late , and it is certainly too little compared to the needs
David Miliband
UK Foreign Secretary Will Burma keep its word on aid ?
Burmese anger at junta
The offer also does not specify whether both civilian and military aid workers are included .
Burma has so far refused entry to foreign military personnel , and has asked for helicopters from further afield , mainly Africa , rather than use US helicopters stationed off its coast .
Aid agencies have given the decision a cautious welcome .
" We 're trying to work out what the detail is of it , " said Chris Webster of the World Vision agency .
" I 'm very hopeful about the language and the rhetoric , but whether that 's actually going to turn into action and a significant shift in openness remains to be seen . "
' Show camp '
On Thursday , Mr Ban flew over flooded rice fields and destroyed villages and visited a government relief camp in the Irrawaddy delta .
A UN official privately called it a " show camp " , says the BBC's Laura Trevelyan , in Burma with the secretary general .

Western governments have backed Mr Ban 's visit , calling for pressure on Burma 's leadership to do more to help the cyclone victims .
UK Foreign Secretary David Milliband told the BBC : " The tragedy is that , for some people it is already too late , and it is certainly too little compared to the needs , but we have got to use the opportunity that exists .
" We 've got to keep pushing that door open and working to ensure that those desperate people get the help that they need . "
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the responsibility for the situation lay with the Burmese government .
" It 's a quite unusual situation actually that you have a country in this desperate straits with its population in the circumstances that this population is in - and you get a kind of stone cold face about people who just want help , " she told the BBC .
The UN estimates that only a quarter of the 2.5 million Burmese affected by the cyclone have received the help they need .
The Red Cross has said that in districts further south - west of those shown to Mr Ban , waterways were still clogged with corpses and that many people had received no aid .
One foreign doctor told the BBC many were drinking water from puddles , while children and old people were suffering from dysentery , dengue fever and dehydration .

What are these ?
The bank manager ’s tone was crisp and efficient .
“ Name ? ” he asked .
“ Amit , ” came the reply from beneath a grimy white baseball cap .
“ Father ’s name ? ” asked the manager , 14 years old and all business .
Advertisement
“ Sanjay , ” said the customer , 13 .
With his identity thus established , Amit Kumar Tripathi withdrew 330 rupees , or about $ 8.25 , from his savings account , which Ajay Singh Choudhury , the skinny manager , fished out of a drawer , handed over in a wad of rumpled notes and dutifully recorded in a ledger almost as big as his torso .
Then it was on to the next boy in line at one of the more unusual financial institutions in India ’s capital .
Run almost entirely by and for street children , the bare - bones bank sponsored by a local charity offers the youths a safe place to stash the bits of money they earn picking through trash for recyclables , hawking magazines and fruit at intersections or busing tables at wedding banquets .

India is home to the world ’s largest population of street children , conservatively estimated at 10 million .
Their lives are far removed from the country ’s growing image as an economic juggernaut powered by software engineers and ornamented with Bollywood babes .
Theirs is a parallel world of struggling to survive , a world where adolescent angst is about whether another meal comes your way , or whether you can sleep through the night , unmolested , on a hard patch of pavement .
In Delhi alone , more than 100,000 youngsters are believed to live on the streets .
Many remain with their poverty - stricken families , but thousands do not .
A large number cluster around the city ’s main railway stations -- heavily trafficked areas where they can sell their wares and where passengers leave behind detritus they can pick through .
Boys scooting between train tracks , darting in and out of newly empty railway carriages , are a common sight .
Many are harassed or beaten by police officers , or sexually abused by predatory adults .
A fair number resort to sniffing glue .
Some beg , others steal .
Advertisement
Many of these “ railway children ” are runaways who have come to the Delhi metropolis to escape abusive households or the monotony and poverty of life in the countryside .
Rohit Kumar Prasad , a sweet - faced 13 - year - old who wears a silver talisman of the monkey god Hanuman around his neck , said he fled nearly two years ago from his home in the impoverished state of Bihar , in eastern India , because his father beat him .
He spends three to four hours a day hawking slices of fresh coconut at the Delhi Main Railway Station , in the crowded precincts of the Old City .
He can make about 100 rupees , or $ 2.50 , a day , part of which he sometimes spends on a plate of his favorite food , chicken and rice , as an occasional treat .
Slender and small for his age , Rohit harbors aspirations of becoming a doctor .
“ I want to look after poor people and their children , ” he said .
Advertisement
He sleeps in a shelter for boys run by a local charity called Butterflies .
To help the youths plan for a less bleak future , the charity set up its Children ’s Development Bank in 2001 , a way for street children to learn lessons about money and saving that , for most , their parents are n’t around to teach .
“ We see this as a life skill , ” said Sebastian Mathew , director of the project .
“ How much they save is not important .
It ’s the habit of saving and not spending their money on sniffing glue , smoking , watching the same movie again and again . ”
About 2,000 children have accounts at 12 “ branches ” around Delhi , located in shelters or at sites where the charity runs classes and other activities for homeless youths .
Adult staff members are always present to ensure the safety of the children and to collect the takings at the end of each day , depositing the cash at regular intervals in a dedicated account in a private bank .
But in most respects , it ’s the children who run the show and set the rules .
At each branch , the account holders , who range in age from 9 to 18 , elect two volunteer managers from the group every six months .
The youngsters decided that the bank should do its best not to allow deposits of money made from stealing or selling drugs and pornography .

The branch inside the shelter near the train station sits in the corner , looking more like a lemonade stand than a house of finance .
But the long box full of passbooks , and the earnest expressions of the young managers who staff the branch for an hour each evening , speak to a serious purpose .
“ The children are able to deposit and save money .
If they keep the money on them , it ’ll get stolen , or they ’ll blow it or get addicted to drugs , ” said Ajay , the manager , who shares the post with Rohit .
Tired of school , Ajay ran away from the mountainous state of Uttaranchal and washed up in Delhi a year and a half ago .
He likes the status and responsibility that come with being manager , although it cost him once , when he paid out 20 rupees , about 50 cents , too much to a boy making a withdrawal on a hectic day and had to make up the shortfall with money out of his own pocket .
Advertisement
Sanjay Kumar , a serious 13 - year - old with his hair carefully combed and his shirt tucked into pants that looked a size too big , joined the queue of jostling and roughhousing bank customers one recent evening .
He handed over all of the 150 rupees , about $ 3.75 , he had earned that day from serving drinks and washing glasses at a party , carefully checking his passbook to make sure the deposit had been credited .
He opened his account 2 1/2 years ago .
It now bulges with 3,600 rupees , about $ 90 , and has earned interest of about 90 rupees , or $ 2.25 -- an enviable sum by the standards of children living rough , and an incentive to continue saving .
“ I want to do something when I ’m older , ” Sanjay said .
“ I want to open up a tea shop . ”
Once he turns 15 , he can apply for a loan .
The bank lets older youths borrow money to start businesses or continue their schooling .

Amit , the boy in the baseball cap , needed to tap into his savings for a train ticket to his village in Uttar Pradesh state because his father was laid up with a broken leg .
But at the same time that he withdrew 330 rupees from his savings , the scrappy youth thoughtfully deposited 20 rupees into his separate current account .
“ What little I have I put here , ” Amit said .
“ I ’m saving up because I want to get educated .
This money will go to good use . ”

Cindy McCain said Thursday that she would never release her personal income tax filing even if her husband , Senator John McCain , was elected president .
But Federal Aviation Administration records indicate that she appears to be using her personal wealth to help his campaign , through the continued use of her corporate jet .
The New York Times reported last month that during a crucial five - month period Mr. McCain ’s campaign regularly used a corporate jet owned by the Phoenix - based beer distributor that Mrs. McCain heads , saving the campaign hundreds of thousands of dollars .
His campaign pays rates well below market ones for the plane ’s use because of an unresolved exemption in a recent campaign finance law that Mr. McCain backed .
According to public records , the campaign has continued to use the plane , even as Mr. McCain , of Arizona , became the presumed Republican nominee and his campaign ’s finances have improved .
In late April , for instance , the plane landed in Selma and Birmingham , Ala. , at the same time he was there as part of his tour of impoverished areas .
It also landed last month in New Orleans just before Mr. McCain ’s appearances there .
And , according to aviation agency records , it landed at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey , just outside New York City , on Wednesday evening , apparently to pick up Mrs. McCain , who was in New York with her husband for campaign events and interviews .
The plane left Teterboro on Thursday morning en route to Reagan National Airport outside Washington , where Mrs. McCain had a campaign - related event , records indicate .
Mr. McCain has said his campaign ’s method of reimbursing his wife ’s company for the plane is legal , and no one disputes that .
But critics have argued that Mrs. McCain is effectively subsidizing her husband ’s campaign because either she or her company has to make up for the difference between what his campaign pays for the jet ’s use and what it really costs to operate it .
Two recent reviews discuss the evidence that mitochondria ( specifically , age - and damage - related dysfunction in these organelles ) are responsible for age - related degenerative conditions .
Both reviews focus on oxidative stress as a primary mechanism underlying the connections , but depending on the disease in question , they reach rather different conclusions about the significance of mitochondrial damage .
Kim et al. describe the role for mitochondria ( in particular , reactive oxygen species [ ROS ] produced by damaged mitos and the concomitant inflammation ) in the etiology of late - life insulin resistance .
The authors conclude that the balance of evidence supports a role for mitochondrial damage in late - onset diabetes , and I think their arguments are reasonable ( though I ’m hard pressed to think of a phenomenon that does n’t play some role in diabetes ) .
Meanwhile , Fukui and Moraes critically evaluate the idea that ROS - induced damage causing further ROS production , and the possibility that such a “ vicious cycle ” could participate in the development of neurodegenerative diseases .
Their conclusion is that the field has been led astray by results of in vitro experiments that do n’t accurately model the situation in vivo .
May 24 , 2008 -- Jorge Schafik Handal Vega -- son of the legendary FMLN founder ``Comandante Simon ' '' Jorge Schafik Handal -- joined the militant left in El Salvador in 1968 as a student .
He was a combatant commander throughout the people ’s war in the 1970s and 1980s and , following the 1991 peace accords , was integral to the successful transition of the FMLN ’s combatant structures into the political and civil institutions of El Salvador .
He is currently a deputy for the FMLN in the Central American Parliament .
Handal Vega is toured Australia in May 2008 to build solidarity with the FMLN ’s 2009 election campaign , a message that was enthusiastically received .
All recent opinion polls in El Salvador indicate that the FMLN will win both the mayoral and presidential elections next year , wresting the last Central American country to be governed by the extreme right wing out of its control .
Desperate to prevent this , the US - backed ruling Arena party has launched a massive campaign of bribery and intimidation , which is accompanied by a growing number of brutal attacks on , and murders of , FMLN leaders and activists .
The FMLN is expecting Arena to also use fraud to try to win the elections , and is urging Australian activists to travel to El Salvador in December - January to act as international observers of the election .

3,500 US troops set to leave Iraq in the coming weeks

BAGHDAD ( AP ) – About 3,500 American soldiers are scheduled to leave Iraq in the coming weeks , the U.S. military announced , as part of the Pentagon ’s overall reduction in troop strength following last year ’s “ surge .
” Washington plans to trim it forces in Iraq to about 140,000 soldiers by the summer – from a peak of about 170,000 in October at the height of the troop buildup in Baghdad and surrounding areas .
The departing soldiers , part of the 3rd Heavy Brigade Combat Team , will redeploy to Fort Benning , Ga. , the military said .
The U.S. sent some 30,000 additional troops into Iraq last year to help stem growing violence .
The troop increase , a truce by a key Shiite Muslim militia and the rise of Sunni fighters who allied with the U.S. in the battle against al - Qaida were credited with a sharp decrease in bloodshed during the last 10 months .
The soldiers are part of the third of five “ surge ” brigades scheduled to leave the country .
The other two are expected to return to the U.S. by the end of July .
There are currently about 159,000 U.S. soldiers in Iraq .
“ The continued drawdown of surge brigades demonstrates continued progress in Iraq , ” Brig .
Gen. Dan Allyn said in the statement released late Monday .
“ After July , commanders will assess our security posture for about 45 days and determine future force requirements based on these conditions - based assessments . ”
Gen . David Petraeus , the top U.S. commander in Iraq , has pushed for a so - called “ pause ” in further redeployment of U.S. troops .
Critics have called for a quicker withdrawal of American soldiers , but commanders on the ground insist the slowdown is needed so a sharp increase in violence is not seen when U.S. forces leave .
Separately , the U.S. military said in a statement Tuesday that a brothel in northern Iraq was attacked the day before .
The Americans blamed the attack on al - Qaida insurgents , but local police did not speculate on who carried out the killings .
Iraqi police said the attack in Mosul killed three prostitutes and wounded two others .
There have been a string of attacks against women deemed immoral in recent months , including the bombing of hair styling salons and the frequent murder of women not wearing traditional clothing in the southern city of Basra .
Meanwhile , at least four civilians were killed overnight in the Baghdad Shiite neighborhood of Sadr City , hospital officials said Tuesday .
Some 21 people were wounded at the same time in Sadr City , which has seen fierce fighting between the Mahdi Army militia and U.S. and Iraqi troops .
Clashes in the sprawling slum of 2.5 million people that serves as a power base for radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr and his Mahdi fighters have raged for five weeks , since the Iraqi government began a crackdown on the militants in southern Iraq .
Hassan al - Rubaie , a Sadrist lawmaker , suspended his seat in parliament on Tuesday to protest the fighting in Sadr City .
He said he held the government of Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki responsible for the fighting in the slum .
The lawmaker also blamed Iran for interfering with Iraq ’s security and said the neighboring nation was causing much of the violence by supplying money , weapons and training to Iraqi fighters , a charge U.S. commanders have repeatedly made .
Iran denies the allegations .
Meanwhile , a rocket slammed into Baghdad ’s municipal building in the city ’s center .
Seven people were wounded in the attack , officials said .
Elsewhere in the capital , a mortar hit a college campus , wounding one person .
U.S. and Iraqi forces raided two police stations and arrested 48 policemen suspected of having links to Shiite militias late Monday in the Baghdad neighborhood of Shula , a Shiite stronghold , a policeman said on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak to the media .
Elsewhere , two policemen were killed Monday night in clashes with unidentified gunmen in Mosul , a provincial policeman said on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak to the media .
Around the same time in eastern Mosul , two gunmen were killed by police .
North of Baghdad in Tikrit , a car bomb targeting a police patrol exploded in the central part of the city , killing four people and wounding eight others , local police said .
One policeman was among the dead .
Updated at 12:30 a.m. EDT , April , 27 , 2008
At least 53 Iraqis were killed and 148 more were wounded in the latest security incidents .
Several suicide bombings took place in the Mosul area .
Meanwhile , Turkish air forces bombed Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) locations in northern Iraq , but no casualties were reported .
No Coalition deaths were announced either .
In Baghdad , gunmen killed a shop owner , then planted bombs that wounded 10 more people .
A suicide bomber detonated his car at an Awakening Council ( Sahwa ) checkpoint in Amiriya , killing two people and injuring eight more .
Gunmen injured six people , including three traffic cops , in al - Wathiq Square .
A roadside bomb injured three soldiers in al - Suleikh .
Six people were wounded in a roadside bombing targeting a police patrol on Palestine Street .
Eight al - Qaeda suspects were arrested .
Also , five dumped bodies were found .
The U.S. military reported that only 12 people were wounded today in Sadr City ; however , hospital sources reported that eight people were killed and 47 were wounded since yesterday .
If accurate , the relative peacefulness comes a day after Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr urged followers to observe a cease fire he imposed on them last summer and which held until Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki targeted al - Sadr ’s followers under the guise of a security crackdown .
In Mosul , six people were killed and five others were wounded during a suicide car bombing .
Another suicide car bomber killed three and wounded six at an Iraqi army checkpoint .
A suicide fuel truck bomber wounded 40 at an Iraqi army base .
A car bomb in the Danadan neighborhood wounded three people .

Lou Reed Wants to Talk About His New Radio Show , Does Not Want to Talk About Money
Photo : Getty Images
Last month Lou Reed became the latest rock icon to foray onto satellite radio when he launched “ New York Shuffle , ” a weekly free - form show on Sirius co-hosted by producer Hal Willner ( who also collaborated on Reed ’s new concert doc , Berlin ) .
We spoke to Reed about the show , which broadcasts an eclectic mix of music from Animal Collective to Ornette Coleman to Solomon Burke to Peaches , and — less successfully — his financial stake in the struggling company .
How did this show come into being ?
Did Sirius CEO Mel Karmazin wine and dine you ?
I ’ve always wanted to do a radio show , and I was talking with Hal Willner about doing the kind of radio show that once was here in New York where the guys played whatever they really liked .
You know , I did it when I was in college .
I liked being a D.J. I think the radio is amazing — I learned to play from the radio .
The Sound of the Hound , Magnificent Montague , Alan Freed , people like that .
What kind of audience do you envision when you ’re doing a show ?
The commuter from Staten Island ?
You ’re joking , right ?
Look , they have thousands of people who do things like that .
We ’re just there playing music that we think is really great .
I mean , I was just listening to some theremin music that Moog puts out on a DVD sampler and I ’ve got to play this , it ’s so astonishingly beautiful .
I was listening to another group the other day called the Books that was pretty good .
And then Willner played this amazing old Solomon Burke track .
Ah , fantastic .
Would n’t it be great if there were like hundreds of people playing it like that , turning you on to some really good shit ?
Your show is called the “ New York Shuffle . ”
As music has been migrating from local stores and radio stations to satellite radio and the Internet , do you think there ’s still such a thing as a New York sound ?
I think these days it ’s more of a Brooklyn sound .
It ’s not out of New York anymore ; it ’s all out of Brooklyn .
I go out there to listen to music .
A lot of the stuff we played , when we checked out where it came from , it was from Brooklyn .
The music industry is going through a lot of turmoil , obviously , with labels closing and record stores shutting down all over the country .
What role do you think radio plays today ?
Stations should pay attention to what people really want to listen to and not have these restrictive playlists .
That ’s what I think .
I ’m not usually the one someone turns to about advice on how to make money .
Sirius ’s impending merger with XM is anticipated to boost earnings .
Do you own any stock in the company ?
What are you , a fucking asshole ?
I ’m here telling you the truth about music and you want to know if I have stock in the fucking radio ?
You fucking piece of shit .
What did I do to deserve that ?
Moving on .
You ’ve got a film out , you ’ve got your radio show , you ’ve got a new book of photography coming up — is there a new album in the works ?
No .
Nothing I feel like talking about .
Good - bye .

PHILADELPHIA – Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton made her first - ever appearance on “ The Colbert Report ” on Comedy Central Thursday , and she stayed just long enough to make fun of her image as a know - it - all .
As the host Stephen Colbert began the show , he told the audience that a technical problem had shorted out the enormous screen behind him .
“ Are you telling me there is no one in this theater who can fix the mess we ’re in ? ” Mr. Colbert said .
Enter Mrs. Clinton , who strode out on stage , smiling .
“ I can , ” she said .
“ I can , Stephen ! ”
After pausing for applause , Mrs. Clinton said , “ Let me handle this , ” and squinted up into some imaginary rafters to talk a technician through the problem .
Then she moved onto the issue of Mr. Colbert ’s appearance .
“ You know what , Stephen ? ” she said .
“ Your forehead is a little shiny .
Makeup !
Makeup !
Can we get some translucent powder , please ? ”
Mr. Colbert said in mock amazement , “ Wow , Senator Clinton !
You ’re so prepared for any situation ! ”
Mrs. Clinton replied , “ That ’s O.K. , Stephen .
I just love solving problems . ”
She also got to engage in some backstage chitchat with former Senator John Edwards , who was a guest on the show tonight .
“ They saw each other and talked backstage for a few minutes , ” said Mo Elleithee , a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton , but he declined to reveal what Mr. Edwards and Mrs. Clinton talked about .
Mrs. Clinton has actively courted Mr. Edwards ’s endorsement for months , but Elizabeth Edwards has said that the couple would not endorse before the North Carolina primary .
Mr. Colbert then brought out Mr. Edwards as a surprise guest to talk about what Mr. Colbert said was the most important voting bloc this year : “ White men , ” he said .
Introducing Mr. Edwards , Mr. Colbert said , “ He is out of the race .
He is no longer a factor to be reckoned with . ”
Mr. Edwards played along , saying , “ You know , Stephen , you ’re right about white males playing an important role in this election . ”
“ No white male vote is being courted more vigorously than this one , ” Mr. Edwards said , pointing to himself .
“ There is no secret that both of these campaigns have sought my support . ”
Senator Barack Obama also made a suprise appearance on the show , via satellite .
Mr. Obama recorded his segment Thursday evening from East Carolina University in Greenville , N.C. , where a campaign rally had just concluded .
His appearance – the show ’s closing – was designed to be a surprise .
But from this end of the broadcast , it was unclear if the Senator ’s Comedy Central appearance included comedy .
“ I enjoyed the debate last night , though I have to take issue with you calling some of the questions manufactured political distractions , ” Mr. Colbert said .
“ Well Stephen , ” Mr. Obama replied , “ I think the American people are tired of these political games and petty distractions . ”
“ Sir , speaking for the news media , speaking for the news media , we are not tired of it .
It allows us to ask the same questions over and over again , ” Mr. Colbert said .
“ It ’s a lot less work . ”
“ Stephen , these distractions they wo n’t help us fix our economy , they wo n’t help get people health care , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ They wo n’t get us out of Iraq .
Stephen , I would go so far as to say I want to put these political distractions on notice . ”
Later Mr. Obama added : “ Manufactured , manufactured political distractions , you are officially on notice ! ”
“ Thank you Senator Obama , ” Mr. Colbert said .
“ Thank you Philly !

Thursday ’s arraignment before a military tribunal of five Al Qaeda members accused of planning and assisting the 9/11 terrorist atrocities seemed custom - made to assist the loathsome defendants in achieving exactly what they desire -- an aura of martyrdom .
The prisoners , including the plot ’s apparent mastermind , Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , were called to answer before a military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , on murder , conspiracy and terrorism charges arising from the deaths of 2,973 people at New York ’s World Trade Center , at the Pentagon and in the Pennsylvania field where one of the airliners hijacked that day crashed .
It ’s a sad but salutary thing to recall that number and that terrible day .
The consolations of legal justice never can be complete , but they ’re all we as a society have to offer the injured and the grieving .
That ’s why , when it comes to the handling of these cases , the Bush administration ’s willful overreaching , contempt for fundamental American values and defiance of basic American notions of due process have set the stage for travesty and further tragedy .
By any reasonable standard , the Guantanamo tribunals are a farce .
By the government ’s own admission , Mohammed and other high - level Al Qaeda detainees have been tortured .
The five men arraigned Thursday all face execution if convicted .
Their military defense lawyers say they ’ve been denied adequate access to their clients or time to prepare a reasonable defense .
The pool reporters the Pentagon is allowing to cover the proceedings have to sit behind a glass partition and listen over a sound system with a 20 - second delay .
Ostensibly that ’s to prevent the media from hearing any national security secret inadvertently blurted out during the testimony .
Thursday , it apparently was used to shut off any mention of torture .

Mohammed has confessed his responsibility for 9/11 during an earlier proceeding : “ I was responsible for the 9/11 operation from A to Z. ”
He also claimed he personally murdered Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl , among other atrocities : “ I decapitated with my blessed right hand the head of the American Jew , Daniel Pearl . ”
But because the Bush administration feared bringing him and his accomplices to trial in an ordinary American criminal court -- where the rights of the accused are protected -- Mohammed and his comrades are now in a position to challenge the justice and the legality of the proceedings against them in the court of public opinion .
In this , they ’re taking a page from a script first written by Irish Republicans early in the 20th century , then picked up by Gandhi ’s passive resisters and Jewish freedom fighters in British - occupied Palestine .
It ’s a tactic that usually works -- particularly when the prosecuting state is acting in defiance of its own laws .
That does n’t make Mohammed and his accomplices innocent , and it does n’t make them victims .
However , it may very well make them martyrs in the eyes of marginalized young men in fanatic - infested backwaters across the Islamic world .
It ’s hard , moreover , to imagine this abomination of a “ trial ” coming at a worse time , because the chance to portray the Guantanamo defendants as martyrs is just the lifeline Al Qaeda needs at the moment .
Earlier this month , Lawrence Wright , whose magisterial “ The Looming Tower : Al - Qaeda and the Road to 9/11 " won last year ’s Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction , returned to the subject of the terrorist organization in a brilliantly reported New Yorker magazine article that has been too little noticed .
In his article , Wright demonstrates that , while Al Qaeda continues to enjoy some success in Iraq and increased security and freedom of action in Pakistan ’s tribal areas , the organization is being rocked by an ideological civil war .

When it comes to theological firepower , Al Qaeda ’s big guns always have been Egyptian .
The most important of these is a physician / theologian named Sayyed Imam Sharif , a onetime Koranic prodigy turned Islamic militant and comrade in arms to the Egyptian Ayman Zawahiri and the Saudi Osama bin Laden .
According to Wright , 20 years ago Sharif wrote two books that are essentially the blueprint for what we ’ve come to call jihadism , and he formerly led the murderous Egyptian terrorist group Al Jihad .
Since shortly after 9/11 , Sharif has been in an Egyptian prison , where he ’s now at the center of a movement that renounces violence as an instrument of reform , repenting even of the assassination of Anwar Sadat .
Under the nom de guerre “ Dr. Fadl , ” Sharif has written a book called “ Rationalizing Jihad in Egypt and the World ” that essentially repudiates all Islamic justifications for Al Qaeda ’s actions .
In an interview , the author even called 9/11 “ a catastrophe for Muslims . ”
These views have rocked the jihadist world and forced Zawahiri , as Al Qaeda ’s chief spokesman , on the defensive .
“ It ’s clear , ” Wright says , “ that radical Islam is confronting a rebellion within its ranks , one that Zawahiri and the leaders of Al Qaeda are poorly equipped to respond to . ”
As Karam Zuhdy , leader of Egypt ’s Islamic Group , a now - peaceful offshoot of the jihadist movement , recently told Wright : “ Dr. Fadl ’s revisions and Zawahiri ’s response show that the movement is disintegrating . ”
It would be all of a piece with the Bush administration ’s sputtering and ineffectual engagement with the real Islamic terrorist threat -- as opposed to the one it tried to conjure in Iraq -- if young Islamists now found themselves inspired by the faux - martyrdom of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and his accomplices .
And if they are executed after tribunals involving testimony obtained by torture , in which they ’ve been deprived of an adequate defense and to which the media have been granted only partial access , that ’s exactly what will happen .

' We were still sitting at our desks when we landed in the rubble , ' said one dealer .
' I actually completed three transactions on the way down . '
In fact trading at the buried floor has been so good since 11 September , the bank may sue the New York Fire Dept for digging them out .

Sources say the $ 7 m
Supersophic missiles have a range of only 50 metres because less than a second after launch the onboard computer has worked out that violence only leads to more violence and that all war is futile .
Realising there 's no point any more , the weapon either deliberately crashes itself into a beautiful woman or flies back home to America to spend the rest of its days buzzing round a farm .

But I give the American people my word : bin Laden has definitely been or will be captured .
I have ordered that this box be placed , with its contents either full or empty , at the foot of the Lincoln memorial , and opened in 2099 .
In the meantime , I would ask you to remember that any future video statements by Mr bin Laden could well have been recorded before we put him in this containment .

He was arrested without a struggle after throwing just seven darts through the fire escape window of a nearby office block .

The police report particular difficulties with people claiming to be hoaxers who turn out not to be hoaxers at all .

How can we catch genuine hoaxers if false hoaxers prevent them from making their hoax in the first place ?'
26th : Tony Blair triumphantly announces his UK delegation has persuaded the UN Afghan Conference that the broadcaster John Peel should be the new leader of Afghanistan .
Says the Foreign Office : ' John will appeal both to the conservative Pashtun south - who prefer men to wear beards - as well as to the northern tribes who like music . '
Blair says
The Americans give their approval after he told them Peel is ' the British Tom Hanks ' .
Peel will be required to repair Afghanistan 's shattered infrastructure , restore relations with Iran and Uzbekistan , unify the volatile stand - off between rival factions in the south - west , and continue with his Radio 4 series Home Truths on Saturday mornings , against his will if necessary .

One describes how he also ' felt a system of levers which control all major volcanoes and tectonic faultlines on earth ' .
A White House spokesman said : ' We have no reason to doubt that these apocalyptic savages conceived their children to recordings of passengers screaming in the Lockerbie air crash . '

American researchers at the highly respected Massachusetts Institute of Technology who collated the DNA profiles , conversational attitudes and facial disposition of more than 8,000 Americans are said to be ' devastated ' by the results .
Test supervisor Bill Porman said : ' I 'm sorry to say but spend any time with these people and you start to think , sure , I 'd do it , they 're absolutely fucking insufferable . '
Security Chief John Ashcroft is said to be demanding that , from now on , objective scientific research be classified as an act of terrorism .
January
3rd :
There are calls for immediate review of UK airport security after two journalists from the Daily Mail board a British Airways 737 jet at Manchester airport with two knives and a fork concealed in their hand luggage .
The reporters force their way into the cockpit , overpower the pilot , take control of the plane , and crash it into a tall building , killing over 2,000 people and injuring hundreds more .
An incandescent editorial by Mail editor Paul Dacre describes airport security standards as ' inexcusably laxative ' .
This latest exposure recalls events last September , when Mohamed Atta of the Daily Express , along with a colleague from the Evening Standard , crashed two jets into the World Trade Centre in New York , greatly embarrassing security officers in the US .
4th : A chaotic war of recrimination breaks out between the CIA and MI5 when it is disclosed that Osama bin Laden attended a waxwork sitting at London 's Madame Tussaud 's on 1 September .
A Tussaud 's spokesman says : ' He was extremely polite and bought all the ladies tea .
We just assumed someone would pop in and arrest him when we 'd finished . '
It is believed that bin Laden returned for follow - up sittings on 4 December and shortly after Christmas .
17th : State of the Nation address : Bush declares that countries with which America has ' unfinished business ' constitute a ' spindle of atrocity ' .
These include Libya , Vietnam , Japan , Colin Powell , Germany and the northern anti-slavery states of the US .

Tony Blair is later reassured by Donald Rumsfeld 's guarantee that jettisoned British prisoners will be allowed to fight over a parachute .
Downing Street remains tight - lipped over the restriction of parachute diameter to two inches but sources say Geoff Hoon is persuaded that larger chutes would allow prisoners to strangle themselves .
The US practice of nailing detainees to their seats during transportation from Afghanistan is justified as a precaution ' against them building a terrorist training camp in the aircraft toilet ' although they are criticised for classifying prisoners as ' hazardous invertebrate vermin ' , a term not recognised under the Geneva Convention .
The Red Cross will monitor conditions at Camp X - ray for three months and then publish a report ' under no circumstances whatsoever ' .
February
9th : WTC legal fall - out .
A New York banker whose car was hit by a man jumping out of the burning north tower is suing the dead man 's estate because he failed to curl up into a neat ball to minimise the damage .
The city of New York is to sue firms occupying the upper 38 storeys of both towers because as they crashed earthwards , they added hugely to the numbers of people on the lower floors , thus ' momentarily breaking fire regulations ' .
20th : US is criticised over ' manipulative '
Olympics opening ceremony in which the entire American team form a human twin towers which is then smashed into by a flying snowboarder dressed as an Arab and carrying the ribcage of a genuine New York fireman .
As chained al - Qaeda suspects sing ' God Bless America ' at gunpoint , 100,000 doves with weights tied to their ankles are released to recreate an engulfing mass of white dust and the crowd tearfully applaud for five hours .
24th : Hosting the film Baftas , Stephen Fry delivers an unspeakably trite and fucked - up heap of shit urging film makers to ' keep telling stories ' in the face of world events - as if films make any fucking difference to anything , least of all the advancement of peace , as if in fact they do n't more often promote , through piss like Black Hawk Down , the very surfeit of self - regarding superiority that makes the American West so unpopular in the first place .
Naturally the audience of actors and industry luvvies spontaneously applaud like the blinkered , solipsistic , self - congratulating cunts they are .
March
2nd : The World Trade Centre owners announce plans to rebuild the skyscrapers on exactly the same floorplan as before - but due to the disputed insurance settlement , the towers will only be three storeys high .
24th : As as tribute to America 's pain , President Bush commissions a new book of the Bible , called The Acts of the Folks .
The book comes after Revelations and describes how Manhattan street vendors gained the kingdom of heaven by giving firemen free doughnuts .
The new scripture also praises the ' ordinary folks ' who turned their babies into flags , made bonfires of beards or stood on hills and stared angrily eastwards .
Speaking at an Easter ceremony in Wisconsin in which a shaved rabbit is nailed upside down to a cross , the President said : ' Every Christian on earth will agree this book improves the Bible .
Amen . '
With these words the President offered the rabbit a sponge soaked in vinegar , then shot it in the stomach and called on the local necromancer to ' make it rise on the third day like the shining rabbit in heaven ' .
Dept. of cognitive dissonance
It 's a bit of a puzzle to me , though maybe it should n't be , that some voters seem perfectly able to hold in their heads simultaneously the notion that Obama 's a Muslim and that his Christian pastor is a problem .
A particularly pungent passage from Richmond , IN Palladium - Item :
" I am definitely going to try to go with Hillary , " said [ Mary Bunger , a 44 - year - old single mom from Abington ] .
" I almost feel like [ Obama 's ] anti-Christ from the Middle East . "
Bunger reads news online about the election and has been " trying to talk everybody into voting , especially this year because I 'm really scared for Obama to get it . "
Bunger worries about the Illinois senator 's ties to Rev. Jeremiah Wright , whose recent remarks and former association with the candidate made headlines the past couple months .
ALSO : In my limited anecdotal experience , and as Lynn Sweet reports today , the Muslim smear is in the air a bit in Indiana .
[ Last sentence corrected a bit ; I 'd mischaracterized Sweet 's piece . ]
NOTE : This item , as Josh Marshall noted , was briefly given a headline on Politico 's front page that described Obama as a Muslim .
That 's obviously untrue .
Thanks to the readers who quickly pointed it out , whose displeasure about it I share .
How it happened :
The headline writer cut and pasted a portion of the first sentence to make the headline , and dropped the word " notion . "
Anti-piracy oufits have gained access to private BitTorrent trackers before , but the opposite has never happened , until now .
Over the past few weeks , Unnar Geir , spokesperson of " The Viking Bay " , successfully infiltrated the Icelandic equivalent of the MPAA ( SMÃ ÃS ) , and gathered some valuable information that the tracker can use in its defense .
Unnar first arranged a meeting with SnÃ¦bjÃ¶rn SteingrÃ­msson , the executive of SMÃ ÃS , about a month ago .
He told SnÃ¦bjÃ¶rn that he could provide details about the owners and administrators of the BitTorrent tracker , and said he was willing to testify against them .
The sole purpose of the covert - operation was of course to gather information from SMÃ ÃS on the ongoing investigation on TVB ( Icelanders only ) and Torrent.is , two Icelandic BitTorrent trackers .
“ Me and an administrator at TVB were pondering one morning about what SmÃ¡is actually got on us , and I had this idea to contact SnÃ¦bjÃ¶rn and set up a meeting , ” Unnar explained .
To gain the confidence of SnÃ¦bjÃ¶rn and the other investigators , 15 in total , Unnar led them to believe that the TVB staff was threatening him .
“ I was called in for another meeting and I told him that I had been assaulted because somebody knew I was going to witness against TVB , I made my friend give me some bruises . ”
Undy told TorrentFreak .
The investigators fell for it , and believed that they finally had an insider on their side , so they started to share confidential information .
The cover story had worked , and this Friday Unnar was called in for a meeting where they showed 1000 pages of evidence against TVB .
In addition they told Unnar that they were plotting a criminal case against the tracker , not a civil case as the one against Istorrent .
“ I was shown screenshots of admin profiles on TVB , which showed information only available to administrators .
I asked how they got this information and if somebody else was snitching , but they replied ‘ you can do everything on the internet ’ , ” Unnar said .
The most likely scenario is that SMÃ ÃS used an exploit or some other hack , to gain access to the tracker .
At that point they still thought Unnar was going to testify against the people behind TVB , so they showed him all the info they had gathered on the tracker , and which users they would go after , if it would come to that .
“ They gave me the usernames of two persons who where responsible for 90 % of the Icelandic material on TVB , ” Unnar said .
“ After the meeting I gave this information to those users , so they could take evasive action . ”
“ The most interesting part about this is that I said at the beginning of the meeting : “ No offense , I can help you convict some administrators , but the website is n’t going down just for that , ” to which SnÃ¦bjÃ¶rn replied “ It does n’t matter if we win or lose , we will still bankrupt you . ”
This shows that they are simply using their money to force the trackers to go offline .
All in all Unnar thinks that he has gathered enough information to have a significant advantage in court .
This Friday he publicly shared his covert - ops experiences with other users at TVB , but up until now , he has n’t heard anything from SMÃ ÃS .
Yesterday The Ticket broke the stunning news of America 's acquisition of seven , maybe eight , new states , according to future president Barack Obama .
He was speaking at the start of a two - day swoop through Oregon , which is already a state .
In Beaverton , which is not a state yet , the Democrat let it slip that during this marathon 16 - month party presidential nomination struggle against a bunch of dropouts and this female political zombie from New York who wo n't surrender short of a silver stake , he had already visited 57 states with one more to go .
That 's not counting the existing states of Alaska and Hawaii , he said , which his staff decided are n't important enough to visit .
Unless maybe you 're Mike Gravel or Dennis Kucinich , who were n't very important either , come to think of it .
Here 's the spoof - proof Obama video as evidence :
Has this aging freshman senator -- he 'll be almost 60 in 13 years -- lost his bearings ?
Are the eight new states caucus or primary ?
And will Howard Dean bar them from the convention too ?
Obama 's gaffe caused a noticeable stir online during the day and even the respected Marc Ambinder at The Atlantic anticipated that the political media would kindly write the Democrat 's mis-statement off to fatigue .
But he wrote if , say , the Republican nominee - to - be had uttered the same silly fatigue flub , it would surely be added to eager suspicions of senility .
Besides trying to noodle out what the new states are , some clever campaign folks over at the phenomenal Suitably Flip blog got to thinking right away .
And they 've now unveiled a new patriotic lapel pin that anyone can wear with pride even , say , a Harvard - educated senator from Illinois who 's been trying to make a point about opposing a war before it even started .
Here is the new pin replete with all 57 stars :
You 'll probably want to order several for friends and family .
And any Chablis - sipping senators you might know .

Researchers at the National Institutes of Health have found a correlation between an ingredient found in shampoos and nervous system damage .
The experiments were conducted with the brain cells of rats and they show that contact with this ingredient called methylisothiazoline , or MIT , causes neurological damage .
Which products contain this chemical compound MIT ?
Head and Shoulders , Suave , Clairol and Pantene Hair Conditioner all contain this ingredient .
Researchers are concerned that exposure to this chemical by pregnant women could put their fetus at risk for abnormal brain development .
In other people , exposure could also be a factor in the development of Alzheimer 's disease and other nervous system disorders .
The chemical causes these effects by preventing communication between neurons .
Essentially , it slows the networking of neurons , and since the nervous system and brain function on a system of neural networks , the slowing of this network will suppress and impair the normal function of the brain and nervous system .
These finding were presented December 5th at the American Society for Cell Biology annual meeting .
I have frequently warned readers about the dangers of using brand - name personal care products .
The vast majority of these products contain toxic chemical compounds like MIT that contribute to cancer , liver disorders and neurological diseases .
In fact , this chemical , MIT , is just one of dozens of such chemicals that are found in personal care products .
Why are these dangerous personal care products allowed to remain on the market ?
Because the FDA , which is responsible for regulating these products , spends almost no time , money or effort actually investigating the safety of such products .
Instead , the FDA spends the vast majority of its time approving new prescription drugs rather than protecting the public against the dangers from such drugs or personal care products like shampoos , soaps , deodorants and fragrance products .
In fact , it may surprise you to learn that manufacturers can put practically any chemical they want into shampoos , even if it is a hazardous chemical listed in the RTECS database of toxicity and even if it is considered a toxic waste chemical by the EPA .
The FDA allows all sorts of chemicals to be used in these products , including chemicals that are known carcinogens and that contribute to liver failure and nervous system disorders .
How 's that for protecting public health ?
If you thought prescription drugs were dangerous , just take a look at the toxic chemicals found in personal care products used by virtually all Americans every single day .
Americans bathe themselves in toxic chemicals and they do it by buying and using products made by brand name companies that have premier shelf positioning at convenience stores , grocery stores and discount clubs .
One of the more curious personal care products on the market is Herbal Essences Shampoo by Clairol .
Personally , I think this product is a joke because it 's trying to exploit the word " herbal " to imply that the shampoo is healthy , even though it is primarily made with the same ingredients as other popular shampoos .
The first three ingredients , for example , are : water , sodium laureth , and sodium lauryl sulfate .
Big deal , huh ?
You can find the same three ingredients in 99 - cent shampoo at Wal - Mart .
Plus , the product contains all sorts of other ingredients that I personally would never allow to touch my skin ( like methylchloroisothiazolinone , if you can believe there 's actually a chemical with a name that long ) .
Think the color of the shampoo is from the herbs ?
Think again .
Three other ingredients in the shampoo are Yellow # 5 , Orange # 4 and Violet # 2 .
In other words , this is a shampoo product purchased by naive consumers , in my opinion .
People who really know herbs and natural products can only laugh at a product like this .
Want a real shampoo ?
Buy Olive Oil Shampoo from Heritage Products , available at most natural health stores .
The bottom line to all of this , though , is that every week , it seems like we see a new announcement about some toxic chemical found in personal care products that is related to either cancer or neurological disorders .
And yet week after week these products are being sold by retailers and consumed in large quantities by the American people who remain oblivious to the real damage these products are causing to their health .
Once again , the solution here is to protect yourself by learning the truth about these products and switching to products made with safe ingredients .
There are safe shampoos , safe soaps , safe laundry detergents , dishwashing liquids and even deodorant products .
You do n't have to expose yourself to toxic chemicals to take care of personal hygiene , because whether you agree with it or not , these disease - causing chemicals are going to remain quite legal in the use of personal care products for many years to come .
Why ?
You can bet that the manufacturers of these products will fight against any attempt to regulate or outlaw these toxic chemicals .
That 's because the chemicals are convenient for such manufacturers .
It 's much the same way in which food manufacturers use sodium nitrate in bacon and other packaged meats .
It 's all about their convenience rather than protecting your health .
So , here 's the idiot test for today : if I was standing on a street corner with a bottle of colored liquid , and I told you that liquid contained a toxic chemical that caused neurological disorders , Alzheimer 's disease and birth defects , would you buy that product from me and scrub it into your scalp under warm water ?
Of course not .
But if you 're buying these popular shampoo products , that 's exactly what you 're doing right now .
Such is the power of brand marketing in America .

Council issues 10,000 cards allowing residents to state their right to die
Town hall officials are giving residents advice on ending their lives if they become very seriously ill .
In a move that has triggered controversy , they are handing out ‘ right to die ’ cards that allow holders to refuse emergency treatment .
The cards , which are available in libraries and surgeries , were the idea of an employee of Salford City Council .
Shortcut to euthanasia ?
Salford 's right - to - die card
Designed to be carried in wallets , they instruct medics to withhold treatment if the carrier is too ill to make decisions .
The council insists that the cards allow people to make " informed decisions " about their future medical care .
But pro-life campaigners condemned the ‘ Important decisions ’
Greater Manchester pilot project as a short - cut to euthanasia .
The Mental Capacity Act , which came into force in 1997 , allows adults to draw up advance directives stating the treatments they would reject should they ‘ lose capacity ’ .
The statement is kept by a family member or GP , and used if a patient becomes too ill to make decisions independently .
The Act means doctors are legally bound to follow a patient ’s wish to refuse life - prolonging treatment .
Euthanasia is forbidden , however .
Advance directives have to specify the treatment to be refused and in what circumstances .

Rights : Nurse Jo Cartwight joined a similar scheme in London
Someone catastrophically injured in a road accident might want to refuse to be kept alive on a ventilator .
Salford ’s cards are designed to let doctors know that a patient has made out an advanced directive .
Ten thousand cards have been distributed so far .
A council spokesman said : ‘ The cards have not been produced by Salford City Council alone – local NHS organisations , the voluntary sector and private care organisations have all been involved .
‘ The cards were produced as a way of encouraging people to understand the implications of the Mental Capacity Act and its importance to their lives . ’
The woman social care worker who came up with the scheme has a son with mental health problems .
Pro-life campaigners say the cards might be used by those who have not fully understood the complexity of the issues involved .
Dr Andrew Fergusson , of the Christian Medical Fellowship , said such important decisions should not be committed to paper alone .
He wants individuals to appoint a proxy to speak for them if they become incapacitated .
Choice : The Dying With Dignity charity provides ' advance decision ' cards
‘ One of our concerns is that the things people want when they are well are very different to those they want when they are unwell , ’ he added .
‘ Their values change . ’
He said he is also concerned that a card saying ‘ stop ’ to a doctor could lead to a change of gear in emergency situations that would affect decision - making .
Dignity in Dying , a pro- choice group , provides a similar card to Salford’s .
Jo Cartwright , 23 , who carries one , said she began to worry about her rights while nursing a patient with Huntington ’s disease and cancer .
‘ She had seen her father go through it and knew what was coming , ’ said the North Londoner .
‘ She said she did n’t want to die like he had .
But she had n’t written anything down and her mother and carers had to watch her go through exactly the same thing . ’
Dr Jane Eddleston , clinical director at Manchester Royal Infirmary , said : ‘ It ’s a great idea to be tackling areas that are often taboo , and it ’s an appropriate place to start but it needs to be followed up with further discussion with the individuals concerned . ’

The additional exposure that an official Google Maps application repository will provide should cause a flock of both entrepreneurs and developers to build new applications using the technology .
Google has already shown a penchant for companies that build innovative apps on top of Maps , having acquired photo mapping site Panoramio in May .
I am trying to get my hands on this new report from the Standish Group that says that open source is decimating the traditional software market .
Open Source software is raising havoc throughout the software market .
It is the ultimate in disruptive technology , and while to it is only 6 % of estimated trillion dollars IT budgeted annually , it represents a real loss of $ 60 billion in annual revenues to software companies , " said Jim Johnson , Chairman , The Standish Group International , Boston , MA
If the $ 60 billion is true ( and I would assume based on Standish 's five years of research it is ) then we have been dramatically underestimating the impact open source is having on the traditional vendors .
We 've known there is a effect , and now we finally have some numbers ( and $ 60 billion is a whopper . )
MySQL Marten Mickos has often spoken of " taking a $ 10 billion market and making it a $ 3 billion market . "
If you consider that open source has taken out $ 60 billion of traditional software revenues there will be a bloodletting in the proprietary world soon enough .
It 's a great time to be an open source company .
Springtime for Django
Spring has returned to the northern hemisphere , and everything 's coming up Django .
Here 's a rundown of what 's going on in the wide world of Django :
PyCon 2008 ( March 14 - 16 , with sprints the following week ) in Chicago had a healthy Django contingent ; the official " Birds of a Feather " session was packed , as were the two Django tutorials held the day before the conference and the four Django - related talks during the main conference session :
Adrian Holovaty 's " State of Django " talk covered the past year 's progress in Django development , some of the upcoming features to be found in two development branches of Django ( queryset - refactor and newforms - admin , which will be refactoring and incresing the power and flexibility of the Django object - relational mapper and admin interface , respectively ) , and also announced a new , nonprofit organization dedicated to Django : the Django Software Foundation .
The paperwork is still pending , but once it's up and running the DSF will be a major resource for the community , helping to promote and organize the development of Django .
Marty Alchin's " Django Under the Hood " ( slides are online ) took a peek at some of Django 's internals , and covered useful tricks and techniques any developer of a Django - based application can benefit from .
Steven Wilcox 's talk on the Django admin ( full text is online ) included a tutorial on newforms - admin , showing how Django 's admin application will work once that branch is completed , and hinting at some of the added functionality you 'll be able to access when it lands .
James Bennett covered best practices for developing reusable Django applications ( slides online ) , culling tips and patterns from two years of full - time Django work at World Online .
Slides from the two three - hour Django tutorial sessions are also available :
Jacob Kaplan Moss ' Introduction to Django provides a fast - paced intro for developers who are new to Django .
The Django Code Lab , chaired by Jacob , Adrian and James , provided an opportunity for developers to submit code and questions , and get advice and critiques from three seasond Django developers .
After the conference proper , the week - long sprint session yielded a lot of development activity ; though there was plenty of code checked in during the sprint , the big win at a conference like PyCon is the ability to get developers together in a room to talk about features and hold design discussions that might otherwise involves weeks of back - and - forth posts on the developers ' mailing list .
Some highlights of the sprint were discussions for newforms - admin and for model - level validation to complement and improve the validation Django 's form library offers for web - based input .
In addition to the fun of PyCon , there 's been a flurry of interesting Django - related activity in the past few months :
And , of course , Google announced App Engine , a massively - scalable application hosting service which debuted with support for developing and hosting Python applications on Google 's distributed infrastructure , taking advantage of the same BigTable database engine that powers Google 's own web services .
And Django is available right out of the box .
Meanwhile , Michael Trier has revived the tradition of weekly Django roundups , and launched This Week in Django , a podcast which has regular interviews with interesting folks from the community , useful tips for application developers and weekly summaries of Django development activity .
And if you prefer your Django in dead - tree format , there are two books already on the shelves :
And two more have been announced :
Both are scheduled to be published this summer .
Also this summer , O'Reilly will be holding OSCON 2008 in Portland , Oregon ; as always , expect to see a contingent of Django developers and users hanging out , meeting up and talking Django .
In the meantime , Django development will keep on rolling ; if you 'd like to help out , check out the documentation on contributing , hop onto the django - developers mailing list or the development IRC channel , and join the fun .
A radical new way of looking at compensation for owners and creators in the Net - based economy .
What happens to intellectual property when it gets on the Internet ?
The Net dramatically changes the economics of content .
Because it allows us to copy content essentially for free , the Net poses interesting challenges for owners , creators , sellers , and users of intellectual property .
In this new world of the Net , it is easy to copy information but hard to find it .
It is easy to program software to solve problems but hard to define those problems and questions precisely .
In the new communities of the Net , the intrinsic value of content generally will remain high , but most individual items will have a short commercial half - life .
Creators will have to fight to attract attention and get paid .
Creativity will proliferate , but quality will be scarce and hard to recognize .
The problem for providers of intellectual property in the future is this : although under law they will be able to control the pricing of their own products , they will operate in an increasingly competitive marketplace where much of the intellectual property is distributed free and suppliers explode in number .
What will almost - free software and proliferating content do to commercial markets for content ?
How will people - writers , programmers , and artists - be compensated for creating value ?
What business models will succeed in this foreign economy ?
In a new environment , such as the gravity field of the moon , laws of physics play out differently .
On the Net , there is an equivalent change in " gravity " brought about by the ease of information transfer .
We are entering a new economic environment - as different as the moon is from the earth - where a new set of physical rules will govern what intellectual property means , how opportunities are created from it , who prospers , and who loses .
Chief among the new rules is that " content is free . "
While not all content will be free , the new economic dynamic will operate as if it were .
In the world of the Net , content ( including software ) will serve as advertising for services such as support , aggregation , filtering , assembly and integration of content modules , or training of customers in their use .
Intellectual property that can be copied easily likely will be copied .
It will be copied so easily and efficiently that much of it will be distributed free in order to attract attention or create desire for follow - up services that can be charged for .
Advertising has a poor reputation in many quarters because most advertising is designed for a broad market .
But in the one - to - one world the Net promises , advertising will often be tailored and of higher quality .
Those with more money to spend will get higher - quality advertising .
What should content makers do in such an inverted world ?
The likely best course for content providers is to exploit that situation , to distribute intellectual property free in order to sell services and relationships .
The provider 's vital task is to figure out what to charge for and what to give away - all in the context of what other providers are doing and what customers ( will grow to ) expect .
Of course , there still will be ways for content creators to be paid .
Much content will be developed under service contracts .
A supplier will create high - value content , such as a market research study directly for a paying customer ( or a limited set of customers ) .
Newspapers and online news services will pay reporters and editors to produce content , which will then be resold cheaply in conjunction with advertising that covers most costs ; that same content may also be distributed " free " as part of a subscription service .
Certainly , advertisers will continue to pay people to develop advertising content for them , even if that content is to be distributed free .
I am not saying that content is worthless , or that you will always get it for free .
Content providers should manage their businesses as if it were free , and then figure out how to set up relationships or develop ancillary products and services that cover the costs of developing content .
Or players may simply try their hands at creative endeavors based on service , not content assets : filtering content , hosting online forums , rating others ' ( free ) content , custom programming , consulting , or performing .
The creator who writes off the costs of developing content immediately - as if it were valueless - is always going to win over the creator who can't figure out how to cover those costs .
The way to become a leading content provider may be to start by giving your content away .
This " generosity " is n't a moral decision : it 's a business strategy .
The half - life of value
Imagine you 're a farmer in the 19th century headed into the 20th .
The intrinsic value of food wo n't go away in the new century , but as food becomes cheaper and cheaper to produce , the share of economy devoted to agriculture will shrink , and so will your margins .
Better to get into manufacturing , or at least into food processing .
( But fast - food restaurants .
That may be a little premature . )
Now imagine you are a content maker in the 20th century headed into the 21st .
Until now , content has always been manifested physically - first in people who knew how to do things ; then in books , sheet music , records , newspapers , loose - leaf binders , and catalogs ; and most recently in tapes , discs , and other electronic media .
At first , information could not be " copied " : it could only be reimplemented or transferred .
People could build new machines or devices that were copies of or improvements on the original ; people could tell each other things and share wisdom or techniques to act upon .
( Reimplementation was cumbersome and re-use did not take away from the original , but the process of building a new implementation - a new machine or a trained apprentice - took considerable time and physical resources . )
Later , with symbols , paper , and printing presses , people could copy knowledge , and it could be distributed in " fixed " media ; performances could be transcribed and re-created from musical scores or scripts .
Machines could be mass - produced .
With such mechanical and electronic media , intellectual value could easily be reproduced - and the need ( or demand from creators ) to protect intellectual property arose .
New laws enabled owners and creators to control the production and distribution of copies of their works .
Although reproduction was easy , it was still mostly a manufacturing process , not something an individual could do easily .
It took time and money .
Physical implementation contributed a substantial portion of the cost .
Now we face a new situation : not only is it easy for individuals to make duplicates of many works or to re-use their content in new works , but the physical manifestation of content is almost irrelevant .
Over the Net , any piece of electronically represented intellectual property can be almost instantly instantiated anywhere in the world .
Controlling copies ( once created by the author or by a third party ) becomes a complex challenge .
You can either control something very tightly , limiting distribution to a small , trusted group , or you can rest assured that eventually your product will find its way to a large nonpaying audience - if anyone cares to have it in the first place .
But creators of content on the Net still face the eternal problem : the value of their work generally wo n't receive recognition without wide distribution .
Only by attracting broad attention can an artist or creator hope to attract high payment for copies .
Thus , on the Net , the creators give first performances or books ( or whatever ) away widely in hopes of recouping with subsequent works .
But that breadth of distribution lessens the creator 's control - of who gets copies and what they do with them .
In principle , it should be possible to control and charge for such widely disseminated works , but it will become more and more difficult .
People want to pay only for what is perceived as scarce - a personal performance or a custom application , or some tangible manifestation that can't easily be reproduced ( by nature or by fiat ; that 's why the art world has numbered lithographs , for example ) .
The trick is to control not the copies of your work but instead a relationship with the customers - subscriptions or membership .
And that 's often what the customers want , because they see it as an assurance of a continuing supply of reliable , timely content .
You can , of course , charge a small amount for mass copies .
Metering schemes will allow vendors to charge - in fractions of a penny if desired - according to usage or users rather than copies .
( See " Software Metering , " page 137 . )
Yet much as I find the approach of metering and tagging information intellectually appealing - and I especially like Mark Stefik 's " rights language " ( see " Tracking Usage Rights , " page 140 ) - it wo n't much change the overall approaching - zero trend of content pricing .
At best , it will make it much easier to charge those low , low prices .
Seen one , seen them all
There are other hurdles on the Net for content creators .
One is the rise of a truly efficient market for information .
Content used to be unfungible : it was difficult to replace one item with another .
But most information is not unique , though its creators like to believe so ; there are now " specs " for content such as stock prices , search criteria , movie ratings , and classifications .
In the world of software , for instance , it 's becoming easier to define and create products equivalent to a standard .
Unknown vendors who can guarantee functionality will squeeze the prices of the market leaders .
Of course the leaders ( such as Microsoft ) will continue to win because they can use almost - free content to sell ancillary products or upgrades , and because they 've reinvested in loyal distribution channels ( even though they do n't own them ) .
In a sense , the content is advertising for the dealers who resell as well as for the vendors who create .
Overall , it will become easier either to reimplement the use of a software product - or , more significantly , to implement the solution to a particular problem in an alternative way .
The definition of the problem , rather than its solution , will be the scarce resource in the future .
In entertainment and art , pricing will drop likewise , as more creators compete for attention with content they make using low - cost , easy - to - use production tools .
Rather than hitting the big time , more artists will find their audiences within their local communities - geographical or Net - based .
Local barriers to entry will be low , but global competition will be strong .
There 's the odd movie star or work of art for which no substitute is acceptable , but most entertainment is a way of spending time - not a unique experience .
As Mark Stahlman of NewMedia Associates Inc. points out , almost every variety of recreation - from reading a book to going out on a date - converges on the same amount when figured in dollars per hour of experience ( currently between US $ 1 and $ 2 per hour ) .
People unwittingly value entertainment content by the hour as if it were all an interchangeable commodity .
Paradise lost and regained
The idea that intellectual property on the Net can lose its value horrifies most of its owners and creators , but it 's not new .
It 's happening already in the software business .
Most software products are becoming commodities , not because they are easy to duplicate precisely ( which is illegal ) , but because they are easy to imitate .
Customers tend to want the original product : that forces prices down as knock - offs attempt to gain market share and the original attempts to maintain it by lowering prices .
Overall , in each market , there are likely to be a few leaders who create and protect content with a strong identity ( perhaps promoting it with free content ) .
Other players in each market will have a difficult time selling content as assets and will have to find new ways to collect rewards for their creativity .
Owning the intellectual property is like owning land : you need to keep investing in it again and again to get a payoff ; you can't simply sit back and collect rent .
To some , this state of affairs may seem unfair .
It certainly is if you grew up by the old rules and do n't want to play in a new game .
But if you look at the new rules by themselves , they have a certain moral grounding : peo-ple will be rewarded for personal effort - process and services - rather than for mere ownership of assets .
Owning land gives you the right to charge for the value you put into it .
But the business of real estate is increasingly concerned with location and ancillary conditions such as zoning rights and obligations .
Yes , land ownership matters , but it 's not the most interesting factor in real estate today .
The same is true in the Net world : content ownership matters , but it 's hardly the key factor in intellectual commerce .
The curve of intellectual value
The value of content follows strange curves .
When only a few people are interested enough - to attend the party , watch the TV show , shop at the mall - it 's generally not very valuable .
When or if an item becomes a standard , it gains in value , both in the aggregate and per user .
Users can cooperate with each other and share data : Juan and Alice can share the experience of watching John Malkovich in In the Line of Fire ; the price of gold goes up as more people believe the price of gold will go up and start buying it in hopes of getting rich ; the party 's more fun when all your friends are there .
But at some point that value peaks : the party 's too crowded ; the star is passé .
By contrast , other kinds of value are greater when they 're exclusive : you 're the only one in the market , you have a special formula for toothpaste , or you know a particular place to find oil .
But many kinds of information flow from one bucket to the other ; the first guy gets the advantage , but after that , the value is maximized by spreading the knowledge widely or by postprocessing - adding synergistic value on top of it .
Some aspects of intellectual property can be fixed into a specific medium and copied .
But other less fungible or reproducible aspects of content cannot easily be instantiated or transferred .
Their worth is realized only through human attention and interaction .
Let 's call it intellectual value rather than intellectual property .
Intellectual value comprises content such as performances ; teaching , training , and coaching ; analysis of specific questions applied to specific situations , and personal attention - someone reading and responding to your e-mail , answering questions , or watching you on a video connection .
Intellectual value ( some call it context ) is also simply the presence of other people , often specific ones , interacting casually or formally .
This value is the difference between sitting in a packed stadium and watching a pickup ball game with a couple of friends .
It 's the difference between the $ 500 - a- plate dinner with 1,000 people in a hotel ballroom and the $ 10,000 - a- head 40 - person reception beforehand in the presidential suite .
It 's the difference between an off - the - rack special and an original from Dior - or the " free " gown your mother wore at her wedding 50 years ago .
Value and uniqueness interact in mysterious ways .
The intellectual value of context can't be replicated so easily over the Net .
Unsurprisingly , it depends on the activity or presence of a person - locally or remotely , in real time or at least in individual response .
Intellectual property is the embodiment or automation of effort , replicable easily for all .
Intellectual value , on the other hand , is the effort , service , or process itself ; it can sometimes be shared , but the effort can't be replicated without another person around to do the same task .
Precisely because it is scarce and unreplicable , this unreplicable kind of content is likely to command the highest rewards in the commercial world of the future .
Approaching zero
These trends are already beginning to play out .
For example , while most packaged software vendors continue to fight the perennial battle against software piracy , others have chosen to begin adopting a different business model .
Except for the leader in each field ( Microsoft Corp. , Oracle Corp. , Autodesk Inc. , and a select other few ) , not many software companies can survive on the sale of intellectual property alone .
The price of most packaged software tends toward ( although it rarely reaches ) zero .
So , what happens in a world where software is basically free ?
Successful companies are adopting business models in which they are rewarded for services rather than for code .
Developers who create software are rewarded for showing users how to use it , for installing systems , for developing customer - specific applications .
The real value created by most software companies lies in their distribution networks , trained user bases , and brand names - not in their code .
What Novell Inc. really is selling is its investment in training certified NetWare engineers , instructors , and administrators , and its perceived ability to produce and sell widely the next release of NetWare .
( Selling the next release is essentially selling vaporware , but note that vaporware is not just a spurious form of advertising .
Well - managed vaporware enables developers and customers to plan effectively ; it is part of the value a software vendor can provide .
But it works in the long run only if it is legitimate . )
Packaged software is a property , but in many ways it is becoming simply an advertisement for follow - up goods and services - bug - fixing , support , upgrades , training , implementation , and development services .
The price of the software covers production and distribution ; the intellectual content is free .
Consider Cygnus Support , a profitable five - year - old company ( on whose board I sit ) ; had 1994 revenues of more than $ 5 million and whose customers include Cisco Systems , Hitachi America Ltd. , Motorola Inc. , and Sun Microsystems Inc. Cygnus successfully sells support and implementation services , along with free copies of software from the Free Software Foundation ( GNU C compilers , Unix , tools , et cetera ) .
Much of its work is porting free system software to a particular vendor 's hardware implementation , a task paid for by the hardware vendor , or by the customer .
The resulting implementation is freely redistributable ( as provided by the rules under which the free software is distributed ) .
Of course , the hardware vendor gets the benefit of its existence , since it makes his hardware products more attractive and " advertises " them .
A single company , or individual , may create the intellectual property , while others may provide support services .
A similar situation often crops up in publishing .
" Give us your information , " a publisher says to an author , " and we 'll classify it , put it online , and send you a royalty depending on how many people access it or how long they spend with it . "
Yes , the content creator is selling intellectual property , but unless this creator has a very strong identity , the balance of power will shift to the publisher , who controls the channel to the customer .
The bifurcation of content
Would you pay more for Michael Crichton 's words , or for the ability to suggest a new plot to him or name a hero ?
How much was his book worth to the movie Disclosure ?
How much was his name worth ?
In the world of media and entertainment , there is not very much of a support or training market per se .
( Classes in playing Fig Mutant Space Rangers , anyone ? )
The payments to creators are most likely to come not from the viewers , readers , or listeners , but from advertisers .
The challenge for advertisers is to make sure that their advertising messages are inextricable from the content .
In some cases , it will mean that advertising will be as good as editorial content : truly funny commercials , informative , truthful product information , and so forth .
Advertisers will pay for the services of the creators , if not necessarily for the content .
As is happening now , famous people will contract to promote products or companies .
In essence , advertisers will sponsor lives , or online forum hosts , rather than content .
Just as prominent patrons such as the Medicis sponsored artists during the Renaissance , corporations and the odd rich person will sponsor artists and entertainers in the new era .
The Medicis presumably had the pleasure of seeing or listening to their beneficiaries and sharing access to them with their friends .
This won them renown and attention as well as a certain amount ( we hope ) of sheer pleasure at experiencing the art .
Of course , they could also hike over to the studio at any time to watch their artist at work ( and perhaps find him at play ? ) .
Overall , entertainment will become cheaper and cheaper , since so much of it will be sponsored .
Rights to transmit or display particular creative works will exist , but they will usually be purchased by third parties rather than consumers - for redistribution to consumers .
However , those rights will be hard to protect or exploit thereafter .
Much information and entertainment , once paid for , will simply be disseminated free , as consumers wo n't pay more than a little , and competing suppliers will bid prices down .
The advertiser will gain from being the first to deliver the content , and possibly from redistribution of its ads along with the content and identification with it .
Product placement within content will be much more effective than placing advertising alongside content where it can more easily be removed or completely ignored by customers .
With the means of production growing cheaper and easier because of the Net , a bifurcation will take place : more and more people will produce material for smaller audiences of their friends , while those seeking large audiences will give their stuff away or seek payment from a sponsor - and try to persuade influencers to recommend it .
In the end , the only unfungible , unreplicable value in the new economy will be people 's presence , time , and attention ; to sell that presence , time , and attention out - side their own community , creators will have to give away content for free .
As John Perry Barlow points out in " The Economy of Ideas " ( see Wired 2.03 , page 84 ) , that 's exactly what the Grateful Dead do by encouraging people to tape their performances ( and a performance is not just the Grateful Dead on the stage ; it 's all the people there with you ) .
Enough of the people who copy and listen to Grateful Dead tapes end up paying for hats , T - shirts , and performance tickets .
In the new era , the ancillary market is the market .
The vacuum of attention
The popular notion about cyberspace is that it is infinite and unbounded .
But it , too , is limited by the amount of human attention available in it .
Does a place in cyberspace exist if no one visits it ?
What makes any kind of real estate valuable ?
Just ask a restaurateur !
It 's not mere buildings .
There 's a complex interaction among tenants and visitors , the physical plant and the services , as well as the location .
Real estate in cyberspace works similarly .
The initial appeal of real estate may be proximity to other space - it 's easy to find on your way somewhere else .
The Net equivalent ( more or less ) is a listing in someone 's guide , for example , a pointer in a Web page , or highlighted availability through a service such as CompuServe or Poland Online .
The virtual space near any particular location is limited - just like retail space along Fifth Avenue in New York , Bond Street in London , or Nevsky Prospekt in St. Petersburg .
There are just so many services to highlight or point to a particular location .
But you can also build your land up so that more people want to pass through it .
You can add restaurants or tony shops .
On the Net , content can draw people in .
It can attract a certain crowd , tune out others ( there 's a story about mall owners who played classical music to drive the teenagers away ) , and provoke all sorts of interesting interaction among the visitors .
Just as shopping malls offer rides , and cafes are not only places to buy lattés but places where people can meet , so will cyberspace real estate provide environments for engaging social interaction .
People draw more people : they exist as content that no one owns , but content that is sold to other members of the market .
Live performances and the presence of others attract still more visitors or customers .
Free copies of performances and videos can serve as advertising for live performances , genuine two - way interaction with the performers , or membership in the community where these things happen .
Content and people ( like goods ) that get visibility in favorable locations gain in popularity ( to some limit ) , and can thereafter be used in other locations to raise value elsewhere ( within limits ) .
This is all a delicate game , appropriately reminiscent of the intricate arrangements of broadcast programming and counter - programming .
Return of the middlemen
Aside from a few leaders who manage to sell brand - name content widely and cheaply , the most promising businesses in the Net world will be services and processes .
They will include selecting , classifying , rating , interpreting , and customizing content for specific customer needs .
Other services will include access to various sorts of performing , interacting with people , and all kinds of other activities that require the time of a live , talented person .
Even those who sell content will invest in distribution channels , whether or not they own them ; the value added in those channels will be tied to ( and will enhance ) the value of the content they sell .
Much chargeable value will be in certification of authenticity and reliability , not in the content .
Brand name , identity , and other marks of value will be important ; so will security of supply .
Customers will pay for a stream of information and content from a trusted source .
For example , the umbrella of The New York Times sanctifies the words of its reporters .
The content churned out by Times reporters is valuable because the reporters undergo quality - control , and because others believe them - context , again .
The New York Times can almost make the truth - for better or worse .
Contrary to the notion that the Net will be a disintermediated world , much of the payment that ostensibly goes for content will go to the middlemen and trusted intermediaries who add value - everything from guarantees of authenticity to software support , selection , filtering , interpretation , and analysis .
The redistributor 's goal is to be the most convenient source of content and to put its own attitude or personality around the content ; the underlying content is unlikely to be exclusive , since the content provider wants to maximize its distribution ( either for revenues - however small per item - or for advertising breadth ) .
The problem for owners of content is that they will be competing with free or almost - free content , including their own advertising as well as the output of myriad creators who launch products on the Net .
Creators worry that they wo n't be paid , and that their creative efforts may be discouraged .
The free - content market will discourage redundant effort , since the wheel wo n't need to be reinvented .
The almost - free content market might also discourage a lot of crummy content and marketing designed to draw attention to such content .
Why market a book that 's free ?
It should sell by itself ( drawing attention to the author ) or not at all .
There 's no external reason to sell it , so poor novels wo n't be foisted on the public , and good ones may find their audience by themselves - or through the efforts of filter agents who get rewarded for finding ( not creating ) good content .
The novelist , then , will be rewarded by fees for his or her performances , or perhaps by finding sponsors for future work .
He or she may write serials and find people who are willing to pay for this service .
The final result for creators in this new world is that intellectual value markets will bifurcate into content assets of premium prices and high value , and services and processes built around free or cheap content .
The middle disappears .
To many people , such a world is frightening , since it does not require any laws to change or be broken .
It 's simply the unfolding expression of economic laws - of demand and scarcity - applied in the future world of electronic content and commerce .
It 's not the world most creators and intellectual property owners have been planning for , contracting for , securing rights for .
Of course , this new world will distribute its benefits differently than how they are distributed today .
But as long as the rules are the same for everyone - and predictable - the game is fair .
The big issue is the transition .
And there will be rules : copying content will be easy and acceptable in most cases ; protected content will be " special , " presumed to be of high value .
( And it will have to be if the creators want to keep their reputations . )
Protected content will be tagged and monitored ( for one method , see " Digital Watermarks , " page 141 ) , and use will be metered .
Some payments will be for content , some for time , some for transactions .
This system of control will be managed by efficient , well - designed computer systems - a delightful intellectual engineering challenge that will keep many programmers and companies busy for years , and that will reward some venture capitalists .
There will also be strong legal and social pressures for authenticity , integrity , trademarks , and identification .
Most often , you will be able to copy something freely , but you can't claim for it an identity or origin it does n't have .
Discrete works must be attributed ; derivative works ( assembled or modified from identified original components ) will have to find their own value .
A market of visibility
All these emergent economic pressures and social conventions will spill over into the framework of organizations in this new world .
What 's a company 's greatest asset , according to many annual reports ?
People and partners , of course , not computers or even intellectual property .
In the new world of the Net , much will change .
Everyone knows about flatter organizations and virtual corporations .
But how do they play out in texture as opposed to structure ?
The short answer is that companies will - must - become more visible .
More of what any company sells will comprise information - whether it 's plain bits over the Net or consulting services , design services , management development .
As in the past , some companies will sell products to myriad customers ; others will add value to only a few key ones .
But in a knowledge world , the quality of those relationships will matter more than the contractual conditions ( as in a marriage ) .
The best cement is a two - way flow of information , or visibility .
Companies will try to find partners not by offering discounts but by sharing information about themselves and by exchanging their competitive wisdom .
In order to make their wisdom credible , they will have to be self - revealing .
Moreover , whether or not a company chooses to be visible , it will happen .
You can't hide .
And the image you project - on your Web home page or elsewhere - will and should be true .
It 's not just outsiders peering in , it 's your own employees out in the electronic world : they are the company .
As both physical and intellectual products lose their value ( in the manner described above ) , the interactions with your company will be what you sell .
And the quality of the interactions you foster will be what draws employees to your firm or community .
People want to buy information - based services and products from visible companies that operate as partners .
They do not want commodity products from black boxes .
The question of what happens to intellectual property on the Net may be summed up like this : value shifts from the transformation of bits rather than bits themselves , to services , to the selection of content , to the presence of other people , and to the assurance of authenticity - reliable information about sources of bits and their future flows .
In short , intellectual assets and property depreciate while intellectual processes and services appreciate .

Software Metering
" We 're turning the infobahn into a toll road , " claims Peter Sprague , the avuncular CEO of Wave Systems Inc .
It may sound like just one more overwrought metaphor , but it precisely describes the future Sprague and competing Infosafe Systems Inc. are racing to build .
Both New York - based companies have recently announced data metering systems - hardware devices that attach to your computer and act as toll collectors , charging you for the data you download and the programs you use .
Infosafe and Wave are betting that such a system will fundamentally transform information economics by making unauthorized copying more difficult while taking advantage of information 's natural tendency to spread far and wide .
The concept is simple : instead of charging a flat fee for a software program , or an hourly fee for access to a database , data metering allows companies to charge per use .
So , if you need to use a CAD program only a couple times a year , you could pay just a few dollars each time rather than hundreds of dollars to buy the program .
Or , if you need to look up a statistic , instead of buying an entire reference CD - ROM , you could pay for just the facts you need .
Think of this metering device as an electricity meter that keeps track of the flow of data into your computer and bills you accordingly .
The meters developed by Infosafe and Wave are similar in every way but their dimensions .
While Infosafe 's device is a small box attached to a computer and a phone line , Wave 's solution is a single chip that must be integrated into a computer .
With either system , a user can transfer money onto the meter by providing a credit card number , which the meter then verifies by modem .
When a user requests a program off a CD - ROM or an online database , the meter subtracts the appropriate amount from the user 's credit balance and then downloads and decrypts the data .
Downloaded programs may be set so that they live for only a few days or uses .
Sprague likes to illustrate how data metering will change the software business with this challenge : " Go out and try to find a spell checker for German .
Chances are you wo n't be able to find it in any store . "
His point is that with limited shelf space , stores can stock only the products they know will attract a large audience .
But metering schemes afford infinite shelf space , because the store is virtual .
That means niche applications are economically viable .
And it means customers can instantly obtain almost any program they want .
Data metering exploits the fundamental ease of distributing digital information .
By collecting a toll at the user 's computer rather than at some distribution point , you can cut out a lot of the middlemen , as well as the costs of packaging .
And that means cheaper software .
Metering systems will also help eliminate software piracy , says Thomas Lipscomb , CEO of Infosafe .
Software will have built - in hooks that start the meter ticking .
So , it does n't matter if you copied the program from a friend - you 'll still have to pay to use it .
These software hooks also allow a wide variety of charging policies .
Five dollars , say , every time you print , or US $ 20 every time the program is run .
The advantages of data metering have been known for a long time .
Ryoichi Mori , a professor at the University of Tsukuba , in Japan , first came up with the idea more than 10 years ago .
But only now has the technology become cheap enough and secure enough to be practical .
This is n't to say all the problems have been solved : there remain nagging technological , social , and business issues , any one of which could stop these metering schemes in their tracks .
Surprisingly , it 's the technical issues Infosafe and Wave worry the least about .
True , both products use powerful encryption schemes and patented security techniques to protect the user 's credit balance and the data being delivered .
But neither Infosafe nor Wave claims its system is impervious to a determined hacker .
Instead , the two are staking their reputations on the belief that if it is hard enough to break the system 's security , most people will just pay .
As Lipscomb points out , the existence of the copy machine has n't destroyed the publishing industry .
Besides , argues Sprague , " total security would require a complete change of computer architecture .
And that is n't going to happen . "
Infosafe and Wave are only slightly more worried about social issues , such as privacy concerns .
True , metering systems keep close track of what programs you use and what data you download .
But , as metering advocates are quick to point out , the same can be said of credit cards .
Nonetheless , computer users are notorious for their dislike of anything that smells like " Big Brother inside . "
It 's the cold business realities that make Sprague and Lipscomb lose the most sleep .
Who 's going to buy these metering devices if there is no software out there for them ?
And who 's going to develop software for meters that no one has ?
The solution Infosafe and Wave have come up with is , as Sprague puts it , " to sell the chicken with the egg . "
In other words , bundle the meter along with the software .
Indeed , Infosafe is already doing that with Design Palette - a collection of 43 CD - ROMs , packed with tools and images for graphic designers , that comes with a meter included .
In the end , most software industry analysts agree that metering devices will eventually be used with expensive , business - to - business content .
But for consumer applications like games , experts are more pessimistic .
The only way it will work , they suggest , is if meters are built into the motherboard of every PC .
That 's not completely out of the question .
After all , DAT players are sold commercially with circuits that prevent unauthorized copying , despite the added cost .
But then again , consumers never really adopted DAT players , as they did n't seem to offer much of an advantage .
And that 's the situation Wave and Infosafe find themselves in now : they need to convince us that the benefits of metering are significant enough for us to put a toll collector in our computers .

Infosafe Systems Inc. : +1 ( 212 ) 867 7200 .
tracking usage rights
According to Mark Stefik , a scientist at California - based Xerox PARC , " the seeming conflict between digital publishing and commerce " can be overcome by fundamentally redesigning computer systems .
In his paper " Letting Loose the Light , " Stefik proposes a solution reminiscent of software metering , but far more radical .
It rests on two key components : trusted systems to store information , and usage rights to define exactly what a user can do with a digital work .
Think of a trusted system as a device that can be trusted to follow the law .
The device might be a computer or a CD player - whatever medium , the owner would be unable to use it to make an illegal copy .
By storing unencrypted digital information only on these trusted systems , the fluidity of information can be controlled .
In Stefik 's scheme every digital work is assigned several levels of usage rights .
For example , the usage rights for a CD might allow the user to listen for 25 cents , or make a copy for US $ 5 .
These usage rights can be nested , one within another , so that a digital work can include other people 's work while ensuring everyone gets paid .
A music compilation might have a separate usage right for each track , defined by that track 's creator , as well as a usage right for the entire CD , defined by the CD 's publisher .
Stefik is n't stopping with the paper description of his scheme : he 's filed for a number of patents on the underlying technology and has put together a business team .
But Stefik admits that compromises are in order to make his scheme economically viable .

Digital Watermarks
When Geoffrey Rhoads , an engineer from Portland , Oregon , thought about selling some of the digital astronomical images he'd been developing , he hit on a critical problem .
Once in digital form , there was no easy way to " sign " his planetary pictures to prove they were his .
It took him only a few weeks to come up with a solution .
The answer lay in a mathematical technique to hide data , such as a signature or ID number , inside an image .
The data is invisible , but a computer can analyze the photograph and pull out the hidden data .
Here 's why his development is so innovative : it 's impossible to strip the invisible code out of the photo without completely mangling the image .
Think of Rhoads 's scheme as a digital watermark , a unique identifier that becomes part of the document and can't be removed .
Rhoads has filed five different patent applications to cover his technique , and started a company , Digimarc Corporation , to commercialize the new technology .
Roger Dillan , a member of Digimarc 's management team , says photographic stock houses are an example of where digital watermarks will be used .
" By placing invisible codes into their digitized images , stock houses will be able to distribute photographs with less fear of piracy , " he says .
In fact , if the code number is changed every time the photograph is sold , the stock house will even be able to track the piracy back to the original source .
Digimarc is n't the only group working in this area , but it seems to be closest to a market - ready product .
Digital information may never quite be the same .

Men who drink alcohol regularly are more likely to have better semen quality while men in certain occupations are more likely to have poor semen quality , according to research carried out by scientists from the Universities of Sheffield and Manchester .
The research , published in the journalOccupational Environmental Medicine , shows that men who work with solvents such as glycol ether have a 2.5 fold increased risk of having a low motile sperm count compared to men with low exposure .
Glycol ethers are widely used in many products including water - based paints .
The concentration of motile sperm has been shown to be linked with conception .
The findings come from a major study to determine the occupational risks of male infertility through chemical exposure in the workplace .
The study , undertaken in 14 fertility clinics in 11 cities across the UK , examined the working lives of 2,118 men .
The researchers concluded that , apart from glycol ether , there are currently few workplace chemical threats to male fertility .
In additional to chemical exposure , the study also looked at other non-chemical factors in the men ’s lifestyles .
Interestingly , the researchers discovered that men who had undergone previous surgery to the testicles or who undertook manual work were more likely to have low motile sperm counts , whereas men who drank alcohol regularly or wore boxer shorts were more likely to have better semen quality .
“ We know that certain glycol ethers can affect male fertility and the use of these has reduced over the past two decades .
However our results suggest that they are still a workplace hazard and that further work is needed to reduce such exposure , ” said Andy Povey , senior lecturer in Molecular Epidemiology at the University of Manchester .

It has long since come to universal notice that Time and Newsweek , the Coke and Pepsi of weekly print journalism , have slid to the level of what were once considered lowbrow publications like People and Entertainment Weekly .
Needless to say , these latter two journals threaten to assume the Darwinian niche previously occupied by the lamented Weekly World News .
So where does a reader of more elevated tastes seek enlightenment ?
Many people who aspire at least to a middling rung in the American establishment would instantly reach for The Economist .
No doubt its editorial line would soothe the prejudices of the ruling class , both senior and apprentice , for its hectoring monomania about free trade suffuses every leader , article , and book review the magazine has ever published .
It is also British , a real plus for our Anglophile proconsuls in training .
Its only failing is that it lacks an insider ’s knowledge of the workings of the American governmental machinery .
That deficiency is corrected by two publications that are little known outside the Capitol Beltway : the staid , magisterial Congressional Quarterly and its slightly breezier cousin , National Journal . [ 1 ]
Aficionados of how the government sausage gets made  from conference committee reports to OMB circulars to federal acquisition regulations  grit their teeth and pay the stiff subscription fee for the wisdom they impart .
They give the kind of in - depth political coverage lacking in their more down - market journalistic counterparts .
But they also share a characteristic with Time , Newsweek , and all the rest of the conventional - wisdom brigade : a propensity to frame issues in a manner that reinforces the status quo .
A salient example of this reflex is the 15 March , 2008 National Journal cover story , “ Burned Out . ”
It posits as an emergent “ crisis ” something everyone with the remotest knowledge of U.S. military programs has known for years : that the Air Force ’s inventory of fighter aircraft has been falling in number and rising in age , to a current fleet average of over 20 years .
The reason is self - evident : in the 1990s , the Air Force bet the farm on the F - 22 and the Joint Strike Fighter ( now the F - 35 ) and , instead of spending money on brand new F - 15s or F - 16s , plowed the money into the exorbitantly expensive research and development effort to obtain the next - generation aircraft .
The service deliberately burned its bridges behind itself in the tacit assumption that regardless of the complications inherent in the new generation of aircraft , the taxpayer would come to the rescue .
In other words , the Air Force front - loaded its outyear budgets with a couple of programs whose costs were vastly understated and whose schedules were grossly optimistic .
But “ optimistic ” may not convey the actual motivation of Air Force budget programmers .
Some officers in the World ’s Most Expensive Flying Club may have genuinely deluded themselves about the technological issues inherent in developing third - generation stealth aircraft .
But more likely , the cause was a pervasive cynicism that the taxpayer would always be there to bail out the program , and that by eliminating an insurance policy , the Air Force could truthfully tell Congress “ there is no alternative . ” [ 2 ]
The National Journal glides over this history in considerably more delicate fashion : “ The Air Force , by contrast [ to the Navy ] , bet all of its chips on stealth .
Disappointed by the handling and maintenance problems of its F - 117 stealth fighter and B - 2 stealth bomber , the service invested heavily in a ‘ third generation ’ of stealth that would combine radar - evasion with high - agility aerodynamics , supersonic speed , and manageable maintenance . ”
But the author never unpacks the hidden arguments and assumptions in that bland narrative .
If the Air Force was “ disappointed ” by the handling and maintenance problems in its previous stealth aircraft , where was the analysis to show that these problems could be solved at an affordable cost in a third generation of stealth aircraft ?
Second , the figures the author blithely accepts as the so - called “ flyaway ” ( procurement ) costs of the F - 22 and the F - 35  $ 122 million and $ 51 million each , respectively  are ludicrous .
According to the Government Accountability Office in a current report [ pdf ] , the average procurement price for the F - 35 is calculated at $ 104 million each  more than double the unit procurement price claimed by National Journal .
And the F - 22 ’s flyaway cost is more plausibly represented by a Congressional Research Service estimate of $ 185 million each .
Thus , the Air Force ’s cost problem is in aggregate nearly twice as bad as claimed in a magazine read and believed by Beltway insiders .
The only way one could remotely posit such low flyaway costs as posted by the National Journal is by assuming those would be the ideal unit costs that might be achieved at some utopian level of “ efficient ” production that would be impossible in practice to achieve .
Or perhaps the Air Force now perversely defines flayaway cost as a euphemism meaning “ without engines or cockpit instruments . ”
But beyond that  and deeper than that  the National Journal article accepts as a given that the Air Force needs advanced fighter aircraft , and the question inevitably devolves into how many , on what schedule , at what cost , and what do the mandarins in the Air Force staff , Capitol Hill , and the think tanks opine about it ?
Absent is any discussion of Fourth Generation Warfare  the kind of warfare that any plausible adversary is highly likely to engage in if faced with fighting the U.S. military ; a mode of warfare that this country faces now in two significant conflicts .
In Fourth Generation Warfare , the adversary avoids the staggeringly expensive stair - step of radar / electronic countermeasures / stealth / counterstealth by simply declining to play the game , and for a convincing reason : he is usually broke and does n’t have an air force , anyway .
But a $ 50 road - side bomb or a sufficiently well - motivated suicide bomber can deliver ordnance every bit as accurately as a $ 380 - million F - 22 .
( $ 380 million is the unit acquistion cost : a far better measure of what the taxpayer actually pays for each aircraft , since it includes a pro-rata share of sizable research and development expenses ) .
Another factor in the Air Force ’s “ crisis ” that the National Journal neglects to mention is the fact that the service is exacerbating its aging and maintenance problem by having to fight two wars of a type it would prefer not to engage in .
Rather than grappling in the central blue with a more worthy foe ( one with a combat air arm , and one which would obligingly pit its weakness against our strength ) , the Air Force is reduced to the pedestrian if relatively safe business of hauling loads of ordnance to undefended Third World targets while supporting ground forces .
Helicopters may face measurable risks from ground fire in Iraq and Afghanistan , but that risk is close to negligible for any tactical combat aircraft , be it a paid - for F - 16 or an F - 22 that costs more than what J.P. Morgan paid for Bear Sterns . [ 3 ]
By not purchasing good - enough aircraft , and instead mortgaging the country to the mirage of affordable stealth , the Air Force set the pattern for a procurement train wreck .
The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have merely accelerated the arrival of that problem by requiring intensified flight time ( in more rugged in - theater conditions ) on a declining inventory of aircraft .
One would think that the dubious suitability of pie - in - the - sky stealth aircraft for the real - world wars the U.S. government actually chooses to indulge in , and the accelerated depreciation of Air Force assets as a result of those wars , would be key topics in any discussion about future fighter procurement .
Yet the article in the authoritative National Journal does not mention the words “ Iraq ” or “ Afghanistan ” once .
It is almost as if the media gatekeepers took the advice of John Cleese ’s comic character , Basil Fawlty : “ for God ’s sake , do n’t mention the war ! ”
The service procurement staffs certainly would rather not mention it .
The Army would rather get on undisturbed with its $ 160 - billion Future Combat Systems  although one is constrained to ask , what does FCS prime contractor Boeing know about building tanks ?
The Navy would prefer to get away from this silly brown water nonsense in the Shatt - al - Arab and get back to re-fighting the Battle of the Philippine Sea with its $ 5 billion - a- piece DD - 1000 destroyer ( does anyone remember when destroyers were called tin cans ? ) .
And , as we have seen , the Air Force is still planning to sweep the skies of MiGs above the Fulda Gap .
And so it goes with the rest of the establishment .
At the good , gray Brookings Institution , the great budgetary minds of Washington are assembling at the end of this month for a conference about the federal government ’s long - term deficit problem .
The notice for this event , titled “ Taking Back our Fiscal Future , ” warns about the fiscal time bomb of “ Social Security , Medicare , and Medicaid  the major drivers of escalating deficits … ” [ emphasis added ] .
Do any of the eminentos at this conference  who include three former directors of the Congressional Budget Office  know or care that military spending has grown at a higher rate than Social Security since 2001 , and is now at a higher absolute level than that social insurance program ?
Ah , but only if you count the war .
And for God ’s sake , you must not mention the war .
[ 1 ] I am focusing here on publications which report on newsworthy happenings across the U.S. government , not the hundreds of special - interest publications which cover only narrow aspects of it .

If that sounds vaguely like extortion , the F - 22 actually played a central role in a real case of extortion .
The only time the aircraft faced a serious challenge from Congress was in 2000 , when the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee boldly zeroed F - 22 procurement in its annual funding bill .
Eventually , the funding was restored , and most observers chalked it up to the usual log-rolling , combined with Congress ’s deep - seated fear of actually canceling a major weapon system .
In reality , Jerry Lewis ( R - CA ) , the chairman of the subcommittee , zeroed the F - 22 at the behest of his buddy , Randy “ Duke ” Cunningham ( R - Incarcerated ) , so as to pressure the Air Force to grant Cunningham ’s briber , Brent Wilkes , a $ 10 - million contract increase .
The F - 22 funding was quickly restored once Wilkes got his money .

The risk might not be negligible if the mission were ground strafing , in which case the pilot would want to be protected by armor and inherent air frame ruggedness .
The only aircraft in the service inventory that meets those criteria is the A - 10 , a cheap , subsonic , 30 - year old design the Air Force has been trying to get rid of for almost two decades .
NYT Op / Ed : Democrats continue to display natural knack for losing elections RAW STORY
Published : Saturday April 19 , 2008
|
Print This Email This The Democrats , at the delight of the GOP , are once again showcasing a long established natural aptitude for losing elections , says New York Times columnist Bob Herbert today .
The post - Carter days , Herbert says , have left the Democratic party so battered that they consider the Clinton presidency a " period of triumph , " despite Clinton 's efforts to " throw the presidency away " during his two terms , the first of which Clinton owes , Herbert opines , to Ross Perot .
In the meantime , Herbert continues , Senator Obama is losing his way in his bid for the presidency , falling prey to character attacks from the Clintons and not doing enough to clarify his message beyond his speeches .
With the panelists in the recent ABC debate between Sens. Clinton and Obama getting a much deserved reprimand from the public , Herbert goes on , Obama still could have held up his end better .
EXCERPTS : # Voters across the country seem disgusted with this state of affairs .
George Stephanopoulos and Charles Gibson of ABC
News are being pilloried for the way they conducted Wednesdays debate .
Hillary Clintons disapproval ratings have climbed into a zone that makes it legitimate to wonder whether she could defeat Senator McCain .
And much of the excitement and enthusiasm surrounding Mr. Obamas candidacy has cooled .
That raucous laughter you hear in the background is coming from the likes of Karl Rove , Dick Cheney , President Bush and Senator McCain .
They cant believe their good fortune .
There was always going to be resistance in the U.S. to putting a black person or a woman of any color in the White House .
To overcome that built - in resistance , three things are crucially important : new voters have to be brought into the process ; the nominee must have an exciting and compelling message ; and the party has to be extraordinarily unified behind its standard - bearer .

Our baby asked us why we waited so long !! , March 30 , 2007
By Mute208 ( Bay Area , CA )
We were originally going to get our 8 month old a jumper that you hang from the door .
After reading some reviews about injuries and mishaps from jumping into the door frames , we firmly decided against that and researched floor models .
We were between this Jumperoo and another one that has 4 support poles as the base .
The square Jumperoo did n't have nearly as many toys for her to discover and it seemed to take up much more space .
We decided on this Jumperoo because it took up less room and had more toys for only slightly more money .
The investment was worth it for just the first 10 minutes of fun !
When we first put her in , she was n't quite sure what to make of it and just looked around at the toys grabbing for them .
After she realized ( in the first 2 minutes ) that she could jump , she did with great joy .
Her face was all smiles and watching her kick her feet out while jumping had us all rolling on the floor hysterically .
The toys she likes best are the ones that spin and she reaches for the parrot and frog that hang .
The tiger that comes up when you push on the button seems pretty useless , as does the color wheel .
The whole thing took us about 10 minutes to put together and another few minutes to wash the toys .
Remember not the submerge the electronic one and to put 3 AA batteries in it .
The box does not include the batteries and you 'll need a screwdriver to remove the battery cover .
Also , the large spinning ball has a rainbow sticker along the sides that if you do n't dry right away , well , they 'll start to wrinkle .
The Jumperoo does fold up for easier carrying / stowing but it 's not a smooth transition .
I do n't see us doing it that often however .
As I mentioned , the entertainment that the adults got was well worth the cost initially .
And now , our baby girl has a great time bouncing on it while strengthening her legs .
She does n't seem to like jumping without an audience but maybe she will when she gets a little older .
Do n't wait to get this , you wo n't regret it !!

Scientists have developed a mind - reading technique which could one day allow them to take pictures of memories and dreams .
By comparing brain activity scans , they were able to correctly predict which of 120 pictures someone was focusing on in 90 per cent of cases .
The technique could one day form the basis of a machine to project the imagination on to a screen .
Professor Jack Gallant led the Californian research team .
Writing in the journal Nature , he said : " It may soon be possible to reconstruct a picture of a person 's visual experience from measurements of brain activity alone .
" Imagine a general brainreading device that could reconstruct a picture of a person 's visual experience at any moment in time . "
Two scientists volunteered to look at 1,750 images while data was recorded from their brains and linked mathematically to the " points " that make up a 3D thought image .
This link between brain activity and image was then used to identify which images were seen by each volunteer from a new set of 120 , just by looking at their brain scans .
The research evokes sci-fi film Minority Report , where police in the future read people 's minds and arrest them for " thought crimes " .
But such a situation is a long way off , as the technique currently only works on viewed images , not imagined ones , and it takes hours for the scanners to take the brain images .
Professor Gallant said : " It is possible that decoding brain activity could have serious ethical and privacy implications in 30 to 50 years .
" We believe strongly that no one should be subjected to any form of brain - reading involuntarily , covertly , or without complete informed consent . "
Bennett , Garland , McNamara and Liddy were convicted of murder Four teenagers who kicked and stamped to death a cyclist in Bedfordshire have been jailed for life .
Stephen Green , 55 , from Luton , was attacked in an underpass by a gang as he cycled home last May , and died in hospital nine days later .
Darryll Bennett , 18 , Richard McNamara , 19 , Nicholas Garland , 18 , and Shane Liddy , 19 , all from Luton , were convicted of murder last month .
They were given minimum sentences of between 12 and 19 years .
Bennett , said to be the ring - leader , was given a minimum term of 19 years at Luton Crown Court on Friday .
He is currently serving a three - year sentence for two robberies and a theft for which he was on bail when he killed Mr Green , a former soldier .
Despicable , self indulgent cowardice seems to fit your behaviour .
You were all out of control
Judge Bevan McNamara was sentenced to a minimum of 15 years , Garland a minimum of 12 years and Liddy a minimum of 16 years in jail .
The court was told that the gang had been drinking brandy and strong beer and smoking cannabis before attacking Mr Green , of Ackworth Crescent , Luton .
At court last month , Bennett , of Eighth Avenue ; McNamara , of Butely Road ; Garland , of Bradley Road and Liddy , of Brickley Road , all of Luton , pleaded not guilty to murder .
Bennett , McNamara and Garland pleaded guilty to the alternative charge of manslaughter , and also admitted conspiracy to rob .
Stephen Green was attacked in an underpass in Dunstable Judge John Bevan QC told them : " You behaved as a pack that night for entertainment .
I do n't think animals behave in such a way .
" Despicable , self indulgent cowardice seems to fit your behaviour .
You were all out of control . "
Mr Green 's brother Richard said : " He cycled because he loved nature and animals and was doing his bit for the planet .
" He saw the best in everyone and did n't have a bad word to say about anything or anyone .
" It is terrible what these people have done .
They have devastated our family . "

Unfortunately , car computers are generally built with highly proprietary software platforms that are difficult to hack and largely closed to after - market third - party applications .
Intel plans to change that with a new project which aims to make it possible for developers to pimp their rides with prodigious penguin power .
Intel is collaborating with vehicle manufacturers in an effort to build an open Linux - based software platform for next - generation automotive computing systems .
The project will extend Intel 's Moblin initiative and provide car makers with a complete , preintegrated software solution for what Intel refers to as in-vehicle infotainment ( IVI ) technology .
Intel launched the Moblin project last year with the intention of encouraging community - driven development of a complete Linux - based software stack for Intel - based mobile devices .
The software leverages a variety of GNOME mobile technologies and uses the GTK - based Hildon framework , which is also used in Nokia 's Internet Tablet operating system .
The Moblin software platform will primarily be used on devices that are built around Intel 's new Atom processor architecture .
Featuring small size , extremely low power requirements , and support for the conventional x86 instruction set , Atom offers a very compelling option for mobile and embedded tech — including car systems .
During an interview last week , Intel IVI director Staci Palmer told Ars that the Atom processor and Moblin software stack will provide a complete solution that can be used across a broad spectrum of transportation - related devices , including built - in car systems and external touchscreen GPS products .
Support for a standardized , open software platform will make it possible for third - party software developers and open source enthusiasts to build custom applications that can be deployed on compatible devices and systems .
Moblin will appeal to car makers because the collaborative development model and high level of portability will reduce their development costs .
Another major advantage , says Palmer , is that it will make it easy for the software to be upgraded later with new features and capabilities .
Navigation systems are already practically ubiquitous in luxury vehicles but modern multimedia functionality is rapidly climbing to a level of comparable popularity .
Palmer cites the iPod as the likely catalyst for this trend and notes that over 15 million iPod docking stations have been factory - installed in cars .
Consumers increasingly carry a large amount of audio and video content everywhere they go and they expect their vehicles to provide seamless support for this technology .
Palmer says that Atom and Moblin are equipped to handle emerging multimedia requirements as well as more conventional navigation systems .
Moblin - based infotainment applications can be used by all occupants of a vehicle : navigation consoles for the front seat , and video entertainment systems for the back seat .
Intel also intends for Atom and Moblin to be used with mobile connectivity technologies to bring the Internet into vehicles .
There is a lot of potential for innovation in this area , particularly for integration of increasingly popular location - aware web services such as Brightkite .
Moblin will be able to accommodate virtually all of these capabilities with open source software , but there are still some gaps .
Multimedia codecs are highly proprietary and suffer from serious patent - encumbrance issues that largely preclude open source implementations .
Car manufacturers will still have to license those codecs from third parties in order to support the audio and video formats that are widely used by consumers .
Major players in the automotive industry could potentially combat this issue by encouraging the content industry to move towards unencumbered codecs like BBC's Dirac ( the open source Schrodinger implementation is compatible with Moblin 's GStreamer - based multimedia framework ) .
Intel appears to be creating a foundation for a very strong IVI solution that is open and conducive to third - party development .
Adoption of Moblin and Atom would transform the simple appliance - like car consoles we know today into extensible computers that can run custom software and offer a wide range of new features .
This is another big step forward for Linux in the mobile and embedded space , where it is also gaining a strong position in the phone handset market .

The British troops encamped outside Basra resemble Davy Crockett 's colleagues in the Alamo .
Nobody will come to their rescue .
Their position is hopeless .
They can not win .
They can not escape .
Their boss , the defence secretary Des Browne , has emphasised their political entombment by reneging on Gordon Brown 's pledge to reduce their numbers by a half this spring .
The American general , David Petraeus , yesterday said the same of his troops .
He wants 140,000 of them to remain at the end of the current surge , dashing hopes that their numbers might come down .
The occupation of Iraq is now officially indefinite .
Too many politicians have too much to lose by contemplating retreat .
Reports from Iraq indicate that the military operations of the past two weeks in Basra and Baghdad were treated by the Americans ( or at least by the vice - president , Dick Cheney , who visited Baghdad last month ) as a milestone in the occupation of Iraq .
Coalition spokesmen were to declare themselves in the dark , indicating Iraq 's ability to look after itself and thus vindicating the 2006 surge policy .
The military objective of the policy was clear .
The " awakening " movement divided the Sunnis into good guys and bad guys and has largely worked , backing to the hilt any gunmen likely to hold al - Qaida influence in check .
A policy of ghetto-isation in Baghdad has kept Sunnis and Shias apart and reduced the body count .
Phase two was aimed at the Shias .
The prime minister , Nouri al - Maliki , was told to show his ability to end the emerging civil war within the Shia community .
On the one side were the trained Mahdist irregulars of Moqtada al - Sadr , on the other a ramshackle alliance of an unreliable army , a corrupt police and various Badr militias loyal to the moderate Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq .
If Maliki could not put an end to Sadr 's chaotic insurrection , progress in Iraq would be inconceivable .
The assault on Sadr 's forces was double - pronged , intended to end their presence in Basra since the British withdrawal , and to suppress their stronghold of Sadr City in Baghdad .
Maliki showed considerable bravery in going to Basra two weeks ago to oversee the assault of his troops on the rebels .
But the operation failed , leaving some 500 dead and only an agreed ceasefire .
British forces on the outskirts of Basra offered the Iraqis surveillance , some occasional shelling and rescue snatch squads , but critically they did not intervene sufficiently to ensure victory for Maliki .
While this proved that Maliki 's forces could not handle Basra unaided , the value of such proof is moot .
Britain can hardly now re-assert authority over Basra when Maliki has failed .
Yet if Britain remains aloof during such critical encounters , why be in Iraq at all ?
The operation in Sadr City has been different .
With American armour fully deployed , the sprawling settlement has been subjected to another Falluja , with tanks and bombers seeking to terrify the indigenous population into turning against Moqtada .
Here sheer firepower could win the day .
The Shia religious leadership of Ayatollah Ali al - Sistani is being consulted on a theocratic ceasefire , to stop a Shia civil war - but as of yesterday there was no sign of this .
As Petraeus told Congress yesterday , the surge has been a partial success in that crudest of measures : body count .
But what next ?
Maliki has shown that he still cannot command authority in Iraq 's two biggest cities without calling on foreign firepower .
Sunni warlords have been armed , ghettos created and the Mahdists possibly silenced for the time being .
But these are sticking - plaster jobs .
They have done nothing to bring Iraq 's communities together in some sort of political concord .
It has rather realigned them for future conflict .
Maliki 's survival may be crucial to Iraq 's stability , and the surge important to that extent .
But as so often with military operations there has been no political follow - through .
Iraq has not found a leader remotely capable of ruling his country autonomously .
While the Sunnis may rest content for the time being in their partitioned statelet , that does not apply to the Shias .
Here Sadr will present a menace to Maliki as long as the foreign occupation is in place , and certainly given this week 's proposal to make it indefinite .
Moqtada can turn his gunmen on and off at will .
In Vietnam , American military mythology holds that if only the army had been more steadfast in opposing the Tet offensive , it could have won the war .
It was " lack of will " at home that led to eventual defeat .
Hence there should be no lack of will in Iraq , or America 's friends will fall before an army of Iranian imams .
There is no way of sustaining a client who no longer exists except by virtue of being sustained .
The past fortnight has shown conclusively that the Maliki government is wholly dependent on America .
The surge was a military tactic , not a strategy .
It was supposed , in that old cliche , to " supply politics with a breathing space " .
But hundreds have continued to die , and Iraq 's politics remain rooted in the embattled culture of the green zone .
The truth is that there will be no peace within the Shia regions , no peace between Sunnis and Shias , and no resolution of the issues dividing Arabs and Kurds until the occupation is over .
The occupation freezes politics .
All else is tinkering .
It is a truism that somewhere between the government , the Mahdists , the Badr brigades , the army , the police and the Sunni warlords an understanding will one day be reached .
When that will be depends on the length of the occupation .
Departure was meant to be after six months and has been postponed five years , while western strategists test to destruction their belief in military conquest as their preferred route to nation - building .
The surge sheds no light on this route .
Iraq remains the most wretched country in Asia , its children dying youngest , its minorities most terrorised , its infrastructure most wrecked .
Politics is in suspense , and the middle classes in exile or living in perpetual fear of death .
The claim that America and Britain , who created this mess , can best serve it by continuing to hang around , bombing and shooting , is laughable .
Maliki may be the west 's baby , and leaving him on the bare mountain may be harsh .
But tough love is long overdue .
The new Iraq , whatever that may be , has not seen an end to the beginning of its misery , let alone a beginning to the end .

Flame weighs about 40 pounds ( 15 kg ) and is 4 feet tall ( 1.3 meters ) .
It moves at 1 mph and can negotiate slight steps down .
A new robot that walks like humans is one of the most advanced of its kind .
Attempts to get robots moving like people typically result in very stilted gaits and limited range of motion .
Human walking is " really very similar to falling forward in a controlled fashion , " researchers at TU Delft in The Netherlands explained .
" Adopting this method replaces the cautious , rigid way in which robots walk with the more fluid , energy - efficient movement used by humans . "
The new robot , Flame , weighs about 40 pounds ( 15 kg ) and is 4 feet tall ( 1.3 meters ) .
Its got several moving joints attenuated by springs .
An inertia sensor ( called an " organ of balance " ) helps keep the ' bot stable .
Seven motors get it all going .
Flame can move at 1 mph ( 0.45 meters per second ) and deal with steps down as long as they 're not more than one - third of an inch ( 8 mm ) .
As it walks , swaying side - to - side like a flat - footed human , Flame uses its organ of balance to dictate how far apart its feet are placed , to prevent falls .
Project leader Daan Hobbelen gets his Ph.D. this week for all the work .
Hobbelen said Flame is the most advanced walking robot in the world , at least in the category of robots which apply the human method of walking as a starting principle .
Research done to build the robot provides insight into how people walk , the researchers say , and this could lead to better training and rehabilitation equipment .

Going negative worked for Hillary Clinton in Ohio and Texas and the Obama campaign knows it .
On a conference call with reporters this afternoon , Obama ’s chief strategist David Alexrod acknowledged Clinton ’s kitchen sink strategy and said , “ What ’s good for the goose is good for the gander . ”
Get ready for an ugly six weeks until Pennsylvania , folks .
Axelrod started in on Clinton with the tax return issue .
“ The vetting of Hillary Clinton has yet to start .
The hard questions have n’t been asked , ” he said .
“ They ’ve talked about change you can Xerox .
You can Xerox a tax return .
There ’s not a lot of preparation … it ’s important people understand what the sources of income are for the household that is going to be the next president . ”
This all followed on the heels of a memo from the campaign earlier this morning titled , “ TAX RETURNS : What does Clinton have to hide ? ”
For the record , Clinton has said that she will release her tax returns on April 15 .
The Obama campaign contended today that 80 percent of Democrats will have voted by that time , and that the returns ought to be released immediately .
Axelrod called Clinton a “ habitual non-discloser , ” suggesting that the tax return issue was part of a larger problem .
The only other thing Clinton has n’t disclosed , as far as anyone can tell , are her records from the White House , which are held at the Clinton library .
The Clinton campaign claims that the Bush Administration is the reason for the delay on that issue .
( More on that scandal from Michael Isikoff . )
Axelrod spoke directly the press , saying , “ We ’re asking you guys to do your jobs . ”
It was a familiar line for the press on the call .
It echoes a refrain from Clinton communications director Howard Wolfson , who has insisted almost daily on Clinton conference calls that the press has been giving Obama a free ride .
But can Obama replicate Clinton ’s tactics while maintaining his new politics sheen ?
Axelrod addressed the question by saying , “ This is not a decision to go negative .
This is an attempt to see to it that both campaigns are held to the same yardstick . ”
It was a stretch of the truth , but if the Obama camp is going to use the Clinton game plan going forward , stretching the truth in conference calls is going to become standard practice .
Axelrod is already getting good at it .
Commenting on the person in America who has received either the most or the second most scrutiny over the last fifteen years , he managed to say , “ I do n’t think there ’s any candidate who has been vetted less than Senator Clinton . ”
On a recent visit , I noticed that the water had risen nearly to the top of the levee on one side , while the land had subsided at least 30 feet below on the other side .
The water pressure against the decrepit berm was palpable .
Should the levee crack , be overtopped by a storm or liquefied by an earthquake , saltwater will surge inland , destroying lives , perhaps flooding Sacramento and paralyzing California .
A year ago the United States Army Corps of Engineers , which builds and maintains many of these levees , admitted that 122 are at risk of failure .
California , with 37 at - risk levees , and Washington State , with 19 , are the worst off .
But the list includes levees near Albuquerque , Detroit , Hartford , Honolulu , Los Angeles , Omaha and Washington .
These levees were designed poorly and built of whatever material was close at hand  clay , soft soil , sand mixed with seashells .
Tree roots , shifting stones and rodents weaken them further .
The land the berms are built on often subsides , while the waters they restrain constantly probe for weak spots .
Sadly , America ’s flood - protection system has long been undermined by bureaucratic turf wars , chronic underfinancing by Congress and a lack of political leadership .
The heart of the problem is the Corps of Engineers , which Congress has “ streamlined ” relentlessly for decades , imperiling its mission through budget cuts and neglect .
The Corps has a good set of engineering guidelines for levees , but it does n’t always follow them .
Now largely staffed by civilians , the Corps has a backlog of projects it does not have the money to accomplish .
Business has also ignored the levee problem .
Developers , abetted by the Supreme Court ’s vague 2006 ruling on the Clean Water Act , have rushed to fill in wetlands and build in floodplains .
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
The top economic officials of the wealthy Group of Seven nations said Friday that the global economy faces " a difficult period " with a raft of woes that could cause more trouble in the coming months .
" We met today amid ongoing challenges to the world economy and international financial system , " the finance ministers and central - bank governors of the G7 said in a sober statement , released after their closed - door meeting at the Treasury Department .
" The global economy continues to face a difficult period , " the G7 added .
The top finance officials and central bankers of the group expressed unhappiness with recent volatility in foreign - exchange trading , saying : " Since our last meeting , there have been at times sharp fluctuations in major currencies , and we are concerned about their possible implications for economic and financial stability . "
These latest comments will be dissected by the foreign - exchange markets .
When asked for clarification , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said that the wording simply reflected recent developments .
" If you never changed a communiqué language no matter happened around the world , it would be pretty meaningless , " he remarked .
“ ' It is not a pretty picture for these leaders .
They enjoy their work much more when there is good news . ' ” — Lex Rieffel , Brookings Institution
Paulson said that he reiterated his support for a strong dollar to his G7 colleagues .
The G7 also urged banks to disclose " in their upcoming midyear reporting " full information about their risk exposures , write - downs and the fair - market value for complex and illiquid instruments .
The leaders went into the meeting Friday with the stated goal of rebuilding confidence and stability in financial markets .
The group consists of Canada , France , Germany , Great Britain , Italy , Japan and the United States .
The G7 must " do whatever it takes to restore stability to markets as quickly as we can , " said Alistair Darling , the British chancellor of the exchequer in an interview with reporters .
Before the meeting , experts said that they expected a public show of confidence and unity from the G7 leaders , with disputes over the weak dollar , the Chinese trade imbalance and anxiety over the duration of the current credit crunch to be swept under the rug .
" The main goal of the G7 at these meetings is to avoid any sense of controversy or any sense of alarm that might further roil the markets .
They have to maintain a public front of confidence and camaraderie , " said Fred Bergsten , the head of the Peterson Institute for International Economics , in an interview on Bloomberg Television .
No happy faces
But the G7 emerged from their meeting revealing some of their anxieties .
" The turmoil in global financial markets remains challenging and more protracted than we had anticipated , " the statement said .
The leaders had little to cheer about , saying only that they are positive about the long - term .
" But near - term global economic prospects have weakened , " the statement added .
The list of woes in the grim statement was long .
The U.S. housing market continues to weaken ; global financial - market conditions remain stressed , while oil and commodity prices remain high and have rekindled inflation .
" It is not a pretty picture for these leaders .
They enjoy their work much more when there is good news , " said Lex Rieffel , an analyst on the international economy at the Brookings Institution .
Bergsten said that the G7 should have contingency plans for a possible freefall in the dollar given the Federal Reserve 's dramatic reductions in short - term interest rates , expectations of anemic U.S. growth and the massive U.S. trade deficit .
Even Paulson was more downbeat than usual .
He told reporters at a press conference after the meeting that the first two quarters of the year would be " tough . "
" The first quarter was a tough quarter and I expect the second quarter to be a relatively tough quarter , " he added .
" There may be more bumps in the road . "
The Treasury secretary is usually upbeat about the economy , fearing that any negative comments that he made could further depress consumer confidence .
But Paulson noted that none of the G7 leaders believes the global economy could somehow be " decoupled " from the U.S. slowdown .
Later this evening , the G7 will meet with 10 leaders of global banks , investment banks , and the head of TIAA - CREF .
Attending the dinner will be Josef Ackermann , the chief executive of Deutsche Bank AG DB , - 1.89 % ; Herbert Allison , the retiring chief of TIAA - CREF ; Sir Win Bischoff , the chairman of Citigroup Inc. C , - 2.12 % ; Bob Diamond , head of Barclays PLC's BCS , - 0.60 % investment - banking division ; Brady Dougan , chief executive of Credit Suisse Group CS , - 0.70 % ; Laurence Fink , chief executive and chairman of BlackRock Inc. BLK , - 0.68 % , Richard Fuld , chief executive of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. LEH , ; John Mack , chief of Morgan Stanley MS , - 2.35 % ; Yasuhiro Sato , chief executive of Mizuho Corporate Bank ; and Richard Waugh , chief executive of Toronto - based Scotiabank .
Darling said that it was important for the G7 government leaders to meet with the bankers " to get an assessment of where they are at the moment , but also what we can do to restore confidence . "
Europe unhappy on currency
European officials made it clear going into the meeting that they wanted stronger language on currency .
E.U. economics minister Joaquin Almunia complained in a speech Friday afternoon before the start of the G7 meeting that Europe was bearing " more than a fair share " of the burden in the adjustment in global imbalances .
In simple terms , this meant that the euro is overvalued , he said .
The dollar , after posting a modest rebound earlier this month , came under renewed pressure this week -- falling to yet another new all - time low against the euro , with the shared currency rising as high as $ 1.5911 on Thursday .
The dollar also saw renewed weakness against the Japanese yen .
The weak dollar has raised hackles in Europe , where officials say it has undermined their exports .
Before the meeting , economists said market fundamentals probably are n't right for the G7 to attempt coordinated intervention in an effort to end the dollar 's slide .
After all , fears remain of a deepening U.S. downturn .
The Fed is expected to further cut interest rates , while the European Central Bank has left rates on hold and is n't expected to follow through with cuts anytime soon , with near - term inflation pressures surging .
In fact , the ECB may welcome the strong euro for its inflation - damping effects , some economists said .
U.S. officials , while paying lip service to a " strong dollar , " see the weaker currency as a boon to their own exporters .
" Unfortunately , a turn in the U.S. dollar at this point is not in the best interest of either party , " said Kathy Lien , chief strategist at DailyFX.com .
" If the diverging monetary - policy directions of the Federal Reserve or the ECB tell us anything , it is that there is n't much spirit for cooperation . "

The G7 agreed on proposals to keep closer tabs on global commercial and investment banks and make sure that these institutions maintain access to capital .
See full story .
The roots of the current global market turmoil are in the U.S. subprime - mortgage sector .
But major banks soon found that their plans to raise capital in tough times were inadequate , because there were no buyers for the complex derivatives they had on their books .
The G7 endorsed a plan negotiated under the auspices of the Financial Stability Forum , a little - known umbrella group of the world 's top central bankers , supervisors and other financial officials .
Measures include risk management at banks , more transparency and common accounting .
In addition , the valuation of structured products , reform of credit - rating agencies and cooperation among supervisors was covered .
Creativity is not just for artists and poets .
Everybody has the potential to exercise creativity , to innovate new ways of accomplishing things that will ultimately make life easier and more gratifying .
Creativity magnifies the quality and effectiveness of your natural talents , creating an elevated rate of success by injecting a greater sense of passion and fortitude into whatever you do .
Happiness is not in the mere possession of money ; it lies in the joy of achievement , in the thrill of creative effort .
– Franklin D. Roosevelt
Acts of creativity can be found in every facet of life .
We are surrounded by the byproducts of creative ideas , both big and small .
And the small acts of creativity are no less important than the big ones .
In fact , the more creative you are with the small things in your life , the more creative you will likely be with the big things .
Remember , creativity is a mindset , not an accomplishment .
The creative mindset is basically an everlasting devotion to approaching various problems and circumstances in innovative ways .
Three core traits sit at the foundation of creativity : awareness , confidence and enthusiasm .
I consider these to be the three pillars of creativity .
Awareness
Awareness is an absolute necessity .
Creativity cannot be practically applied until a certain level of fundamental knowledge is gathered about the current situation or problem at hand .
Creativity actually relies on both sides of the brain , the creative right side and the logical left side .
The first steps the brain takes when tackling a creative venture are actually governed by logic , not creativity .
The logical left side of your brain analyzes the situation and all the known facts , defines the problem that must be solved and then hands the data over to the creative right side of your brain .
Without this logical information review process , creativity will drown in misdirection .
Confidence
Creative ventures step into the unknown , slowly moving in directions no one has gone before .
Any journey into the unknown holds a certain level of inherent risk .
Most people are scared to accept this risk , which effectively squashes all their creative ideas before they have a chance to develop them .
Creativity can also be hindered by the frustration of initial failure or third - party ridicule .
Confidence is the key .
If you have confidence in yourself and your ideas , you will be far more willing to accept calculated risks , take creative chances and thwart off all the other stress factors attempting to restrain your creative edge .
Enthusiasm
Enthusiasm is the lifeblood of creativity .
It is vital because creativity only blossoms when you are passionate and enthusiastic about what you are doing .
It ’s nearly impossible to pioneer creative solutions for something you have absolutely no interest in .
However , when your mind is stimulated by a fundamental curiosity and interest in the subject matter , your creativity will run rampant and your motivation will skyrocket .
Conclusion :
When the mind is aware of the circumstances , confident in its abilities and enthusiastic about the material , creative ideas may flourish into ground - breaking , sensible solutions .
The size of the audience will be limited , with about 60 to 70 people …
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert ’s visit to the U.S. is part of a concerted effort , by the Israeli government and its American lobbyists , to convince U.S. lawmakers  and , most of all , President George W. Bush  that the time to attack Iran is now .
The Israeli newspaper Yediot Achronot reports that Olmert will tell Bush “ time is running out ” on diplomacy and that he ’d better launch an attack .
In his speech to the AIPAC conference , Olmert ’s message was harsh and unrelenting : Iran , he said , “ must be stopped by all possible means ” from acquiring a nuclear capability .
Yes , sanctions must be tightened , but these are only “ initial steps ” : what ’s needed , he averred , are “ more drastic and robust measures ”  and that can only mean one thing .
Israel would rather not act alone , but Olmert signaled that he was willing to do so if pushed : “ ” Israel will not tolerate the possibility of a nuclear Iran , and neither should any other country in the free world , ” he declared , in what was clearly a threat of unilateral action .
Citing Israel ’s record in regard to Iraq in the eighties and Syria last year , Tim Butcher warned in the Telegraph : “ The speech shortens the odds significantly on military action against Iran ’s nuclear program . ”
The U.S. would almost certainly be drawn into the conflict if Israel carried out its threat , and Olmert knows that .
So does Bush , who , in any case , may not need much persuading .
After all , in his speech to the Israeli parliament last month , the President declared :
“ Permitting the world ’s leading sponsor of terror to possess the world ’s deadliest weapons would be an unforgivable betrayal for future generations .
For the sake of peace , the world must not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon . ”
For the sake of peace , we must make war : a familiar refrain that echoes down through the years , mocking the living and the dead .
The clock is ticking , and time is running out for the War Party : they must get in their licks before the most pro-Israel president , ever , leaves office .
As Butcher writes : “ Among Israeli supporters of military action against Iran there is concern something must be done before Mr. Bush ’s end of office next January as Mr. Bush is perceived as closer to Israel than any potential successor . ”
Do n’t look to Barack Obama for deliverance from this looming conflict .
In his speech to AIPAC , he clearly signed on to the Lobby ’s latest project , departing from his prepared text to declare :
“ I will do everything in my power to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon .
Everything in my power .
Everything . ”
“ Everything ” includes murdering tens of thousands of Iranians , mostly civilians  driving the price of oil up above $ 300 a barrel and destroying the US economy  and involving us in a war that will make the Iraq conflict look like a Sunday school picnic .
And for what ?
The irony , of course , is that Iran is nowhere near obtaining nuclear weapons , as the President ’s own intelligence agencies recently informed him : but no matter .
That ’s a small obstacle to those who disdain “ the reality - based community , ” and see themselves as Making History while the rest of us watch , helpless and aghast .
As Ha’aretz recently reported
“ Olmert will try to convince Bush to set aside the National Intelligence Estimate on Iran ’s nuclear program in favor of data presented by Israel , and determine the administration ’s policy on Iran accordingly . ”
The coming war with Iran has nothing to do with “ weapons of mass destruction ”  no more than the invasion of Iraq ever did .
It ’s all about preserving Israeli hegemony in the Middle East by wiping any and all recalcitrant Arab - Muslim states off the map .
First Iraq , then Iran  and Syria will have its turn soon enough , along with poor prostrate Lebanon , once the jewel of the eastern Mediterranean and now an economic and political basket case .
It is almost certain we will be at war with Iran before a new President is inaugurated : now that Obama has capitulated to the Lobby , nothing but Divine Providence can stop it .
God help us all .
I have to say I was wrong  dead wrong  about Obama .
In my eagerness to find a bright spot in a rapidly darkening world , I grasped on to his alluring rhetoric and his at - times trenchant critique of the Bush foreign policy , like a sinking man holding on to a life - jacket .
But looking for hope in all the wrong places does n’t create opportunities for peace  it only prolongs our illusions .
We must face the prospect of a much more terrible conflict than we have ever known , and look it squarely in the face , without flinching or looking for false messiahs .
I know many of you are disappointed , and some of you are now exclaiming “ I told you so ! ”
All that we can do now is hope , and pray , that our country  and the Iranian people  will somehow survive the coming catastrophe .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
I ‘m sitting here looking at the just - published reprint of my 1993 book , Reclaiming the American Right : The Lost Legacy of the Conservative Movement , and it sure is handsome !
With a great painting by Jasper Johns on the cover , and a new introduction by Professor George W. Carey of Georgetown University .
Here ’s what Ron Paul had to say about it :
“ When I was deciding whether or not to run for President as a Republican , I re-read Justin Raimondo ’s Reclaiming the American Right and it gave me hope that the anti-interventionist , pro-liberty Old Right , which had once dominated the party , could and would rise again .
Here is living history : the story of an intellectual and political tradition that my campaign invoked and reawakened .
This prescient book , written in 1993 , could not be more relevant today . ”
What more do you need to know ?

Oh , and do n’t forget : I ’ll be speaking this coming Saturday at the Future of Freedom conference : get a day pass and please come up and say hello .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Resource nationalism in oil producing countries is cordoning off valuable supplies and the United States has precious few options to battle the trend amid a looming supply crunch .
As U.S. oil prices CLN8 marched above $ 135 a barrel last month -- and settled up 8.4 percent at a record - high $ 138.54 on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Friday -- international firms have found themselves faced with tougher terms and shut out of the globe 's most promising oil basins , a trend known as " resource nationalism . "
The United States -- the world ’s biggest oil consumer -- stands mostly powerless as national oil companies like Venezuela ’s PDVSA and Russia ’s Gazprom block access to key oil reserves and demand a larger share of the profits in exchange for allowing international oil companies to drill .
“ There are few good foreign policy options because oil really is our economic jugular , ” said Anne Korin , co-director of the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security , a nonprofit energy think tank .
Conventional wisdom in past years has been that when oil prices rise high enough , oil companies will have the profit motive to spend the billions of dollars needed to bring new supply sources online .
UNCONVENTIONAL WISDOM
But resource nationalism has turned such wisdom on its head , investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a recent report .
Resource nationalism “ imposes significant policy constraints on the free flow of capital , labor and technology that are substantially limiting supply growth , ” Goldman Sachs said in its report , which also called for benchmark U.S. oil prices to average $ 141 a barrel in the second half of 2008 .
Such constraints have reduced oil supply growth by 1 percent per year , even while the global economy grows at nearly 4 percent , the bank said .
In recent congressional testimony , a top executive with ConocoPhillips COP.N said resource nationalism was " the biggest constraint " blocking access to new oil supplies .
High oil prices have emboldened big oil producers to tighten their grip on their oil resources .

In Venezuela , President Hugo Chavez ’s nationalization crusade has forced out two of the world ’s largest energy companies and the OPEC nation is preparing a “ windfall ” oil tax to boost its share of profits from its fields .
Under President Vladimir Putin , Russia brought more than half of its oil industry back under state control , wrestling control away from global majors like BP Plc BP.L and Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L as the Kremlin tightened its grip .
Limiting access to oil reserves can lead to oil output declines , but not always .
In Venezuela , oil production by state - owned PDVSA has sagged since a crippling 2002 strike , where half its employees walked off the job to protest Chavez ’s rule .
But other big producers that limit foreign access -- notably Saudi Arabia and Brazil -- buck the trend of declining output .
Saudi Arabia , the world ’s biggest oil exporter and de facto leader of OPEC , has consistently managed to boost supply through the efforts of state - owned Saudi Aramco .
In Brazil , state - owned Petrobras is recognized for its deepwater drilling expertise , which it will need to develop the giant Tupi field -- the biggest deep - water find ever .
LIMITED OPTIONS
Options to address rising producer influence include making oil access a precondition to joining the World Trade Organization and rethinking nuclear and weapons technology deals with big OPEC producers like Saudi Arabia , experts say .
But one option that is not on the table is U.S. military action to secure hydrocarbon resources .
Though some observers have said U.S. occupation of Iraq was aimed in part at securing oil supplies , the reality has been markedly different , with oil production still lagging below pre-war levels due to attacks on export pipelines .
“ Even if you take over the fields , you ’re not going to get the oil , ” Korin said .
“ That ’s the deal here . ”
The United States should up the ante in negotiations with big oil suppliers like Saudi Arabia , and use its prized weapons and nuclear energy technology as leverage to extract oil supply concessions , said James Woolsey , a former Director of Central Intelligence during the Clinton administration .
“ We ’ve got to let them know that our dander is up , ” Woolsey said .
“ We are not going to take it anymore . ”
The United States already missed a golden opportunity to extract more energy access pledges when it allowed Saudi Arabia to enter the World Trade Organization , Korin said .
“ Other OPEC countries that are clamoring to enter the WTO -- we should hold that up and say ‘ no way unless you leave OPEC , ’ ” Korin said .
But an aggressive U.S. foreign policy response could make things worse if supplier nations respond by tightening their grip even further , said Robbie Diamond , president of Securing America ’s Future Energy .
“ Going at resource nationalism itself is in some ways pointless , and could hurt us more , ” said Diamond , whose nonpartisan group wants to reduce U.S. oil import dependence .
“ It really is for the United States to do what is tried and true and boring : Reduce demand and increase supply , ” Diamond said .
I still do n’t know why Sallie and I bothered to go to that party in the forest slope above Aspen .
The people were all older than us and dull in a distinguished way , old enough that we , at 40 - ish , passed as the occasion ’s young ladies .
The house in Colorado was great -- if you like Ralph Lauren - style chalets : a rugged luxury cabin at 9,000 feet , complete with elk antlers , lots of kilims , and a wood - burning stove .
We were preparing to leave when our host said , “ No , stay a little longer so I can talk to you . ”
He was an imposing man who ’d made a lot of money in advertising or something like that .
He kept us waiting while the other guests drifted out into the summer night , and then sat us down at his grainy wood table and said to me , “ So ? I hear you ’ve written a couple of books . ”
I replied , “ Several , actually . ”
He said , in the way you encourage your friend ’s 7 - year - old to describe flute practice , “ And what are they about ? ”

They were actually about quite a few different things , the six or seven out by then , but I began to speak only of the most recent on that summer day in 2003 , my book on Eadweard Muybridge , the annihilation of time and space and the industrialization of everyday life .
He cut me off soon after I mentioned Muybridge .
“ And have you heard about the very important Muybridge book that came out this year ? ”
So caught up was I in my assigned role as ingenue that I was perfectly willing to entertain the possibility that another book on the same subject had come out simultaneously and I ’d somehow missed it .
He was already telling me about the very important book -- with that smug look I know so well in a man holding forth , eyes fixed on the fuzzy far horizon of his own authority .
Here , let me just say that my life is well - sprinkled with lovely men , including a long succession of editors who have , since I was young , listened and encouraged and published me ; with my infinitely generous younger brother ; with splendid male friends .
Still , there are these other men too .

So , Mr. Very Important was going on smugly about this book I should have known when Sallie interrupted him to say , “ That ’s her book . ”
Or tried to interrupt him anyway .
But he just continued on his way .
She had to say , “ That ’s her book ” three or four times before he finally took it in .
And then , as if in a 19th century novel , he went ashen .
That I was indeed the author of the very important book it turned out he had n’t read , just read about in the New York Times Book Review a few months earlier , so confused the neat categories into which his world was sorted that he was stunned speechless -- for a moment , before he began holding forth again .
Being women , we were politely out of earshot before we started laughing .
I like incidents of that sort , when forces that are usually so sneaky and hard to point out slither out of the grass and are as obvious as , say , an anaconda that ’s eaten a cow , or an elephant turd on the carpet .
Yes , it ’s true that guys like this pick on other men ’s books , and people of both genders pop up at events to hold forth on irrelevant things and conspiracy theories , but the out - and - out confrontational confidence of the totally ignorant is , in my experience , gendered .

Men explain things to me , and to other women , whether or not they know what they ’re talking about .
Some men .
Every woman knows what I mean .
It ’s the presumption that makes it hard , at times , for any woman in any field ; that keeps women from speaking up and from being heard when they dare ; that crushes young women into silence by indicating , the way harassment on the street does , that this is not their world .
It trains us in self - doubt and self - limitation just as it exercises men ’s unsupported overconfidence .
This syndrome is something nearly every woman faces every day , within herself too , a belief in her superfluity , an invitation to silence , one from which a fairly nice career as a writer ( with a lot of research and facts correctly deployed ) has not entirely freed me .
After all , there was a moment there when I was willing to believe Mr. Very Important and his overweening confidence over my more shaky certainty .
More extreme versions of this syndrome exist in , for example , those Islamic countries where women ’s testimony has no legal standing ; so that a woman ca n’t testify that she was raped without a male witness to counter the male rapist .
Which there rarely is .
Credibility is a basic survival tool .
When I was very young and just beginning to get what feminism was about and why it was necessary , I had a boyfriend whose uncle was a nuclear physicist .
One Christmas , he was telling -- as though it were a light and amusing subject -- how a neighbor ’s wife in his suburban bomb - making community had come running out of her house naked in the middle of the night screaming that her husband was trying to kill her .
How , I asked the physicist , did you know that he was n’t trying to kill her ?
He explained , patiently , that they were respectable middle - class people .
Therefore , her - husband - trying - to - kill - her was simply not a credible explanation for why she was fleeing the house yelling that her husband was trying to kill her .
That she was crazy , on the other hand ....

Even getting a restraining order -- a fairly new legal tool -- requires acquiring the credibility to convince the courts that some guy is a menace and then getting the cops to enforce it .
Restraining orders often do n’t work anyway .
Violence is one way to silence people , to deny their voice and their credibility , to assert your right to control over their right to exist .
About three women a day are murdered by spouses or ex-spouses in this country .
It ’s a leading cause of death among pregnant women in the U.S.
At the heart of the struggle of feminism to give rape , date rape , marital rape , domestic violence and workplace sexual harassment legal standing as crimes has been the necessity of making women credible and audible .
I tend to believe that women acquired the status of human beings when these kinds of acts started to be taken seriously , when the big things that stop us and kill us were addressed legally from the mid-1970s on ; well after my birth , that is .
And for anyone about to argue that workplace sexual violence is n’t a life - or - death issue , remember that Marine Lance Cpl.
Maria Lauterbach , age 20 , was apparently killed by another Marine in December while she was waiting to testify that he allegedly raped her twice .
The burned remains of her body and her fetus were found in the fire pit in his backyard in January , and he was arrested last week in Mexico .
Being told that , categorically , he knows what he ’s talking about and she does n’t , however minor a part of any given conversation , perpetuates the ugliness of this world .
Several years ago , I objected to the behavior of a couple of men , only to be told on both occasions that the incidents had n’t happened at all as I said they had , that I was subjective , delusional , overwrought , dishonest -- in a nutshell , female .
Most of my life , I would have doubted myself and backed down .
Having public standing as a writer of history has helped me stand my ground , but few women get that boost , and billions of women are out there on this 6 - billion - person planet being told that they are not reliable witnesses to their own lives , that the truth is not their property , now or ever .
This goes way beyond Men Explaining Things , but it ’s part of the same archipelago of arrogance .
Men explain things to me , still .
And no man has ever apologized for explaining , wrongly , things that I know and they do n’t .
Not yet , but according to the actuarial tables , I may have another 40 - something years to live , more or less , so it could happen .
Though I ’m not holding my breath .

A few years after the idiot in Aspen , I was in Berlin giving a talk when a writer friend invited me to a dinner that included a male translator and three women a little younger than me who would remain deferential and mostly silent throughout the meal .
Perhaps the translator was peeved that I insisted on playing a modest role in the conversation , but when I said something about how Women Strike for Peace , the extraordinary , little - known antinuclear and antiwar group founded in 1961 , helped bring down the communist - hunting House Committee on Un- American Activities , Mr. Very Important II sneered at me .
The House committee , he insisted , no longer existed in the early 1960s and , anyway , no women ’s group played such a role in its downfall .
His scorn was so withering , his confidence so aggressive , that arguing with him seemed a scary exercise in futility and an invitation to more insult .
I had written a book that drew from primary documents and interviews about Women Strike for Peace .
But explaining men still assume that I am , in some sort of obscene impregnation metaphor , an empty vessel to be filled with their wisdom and knowledge .
A Freudian would claim to know what they have and I lack , but intelligence is not situated in the crotch -- even if you can write one of Virginia Woolf ’s long mellifluous musical sentences about the subtle subjugation of women in the snow with your willie .
Back in my hotel room , I Googled a bit and found that Eric Bentley in his definitive history of the House Committee on Un - American Activities credits Women Strike for Peace with “ striking the crucial blow in the fall of HUAC ’s Bastille . ”
In the early 1960s .
Dude , if you ’re reading this , you ’re a carbuncle on the face of humanity and an obstacle to civilization .
Feel the shame .
The battle with Men Who Explain
Things has trampled many women -- of my generation , of the up - and - coming generation we need so badly , here and in Pakistan and Bolivia and Java , not to mention the countless women who came before me and were not allowed into the laboratory , or the library , or the conversation , or the revolution , or even the category called human .

After all , Women Strike for Peace was founded by women who were tired of making the coffee and doing the typing and not having any voice or decision - making role in the antinuclear movement of the 1950s .
Most women fight wars on two fronts , one for whatever the putative topic is and one simply for the right to speak , to have ideas , to be acknowledged to be in possession of facts and truths , to have value , to be a human being .
Things have certainly gotten better , but this war wo n’t end in my lifetime .
I ’m still fighting it , for myself certainly , but also for all those younger women who have something to say , in the hope that they will get to say it .
Now I ’m not the first person to hear “ Barack ” and think “ Baraka . ”
But I do think I might be the first , or at least one of the few , to hear “ John McCain ” and think of “ Johnny Cage . ”
So I decided to take the two and put them together into a Mortal Kombatish battle screen .
And I ’m also really pleased with how it turned out .
You know what else I ’m really happy about ?
I ’m done with the five comics for the week .
AND they were all on time , too .
I usually can’t manage that with two comics , let alone five .
So thanks again everyone who donated for my Cintiq so that we could have this week of five .
And of those people who have n’t received their artwork yet , I will be finishing them within the next week .
See you Monday for a regularly scheduled week of comics .
Conservative host : ' We 're at the big boy table , stop the pouting , support McCain ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday February 15 , 2008

Print This Email This Mitt Romney announced on Thursday that he is backing John McCain and will encourage his delegates to switch their support as well .
However , many conservatives remain extremely dissatisfied with McCain as the presumptive Republican nominee .
Fox News turned to a frequent guest , conservative radio talk show host Mike Gallagher , to ask about the discontent .
" This is a painful chapter for me , " Gallagher replied .
" Sean Hannity is one of my closest friends in the world , and Sean has had real struggles with Senator McCain , I believe .
I do n't like to disagree with Sean about anything , but the fact is , Mitt Romney 's endorsement yesterday kind of slams the lid on any of the temper tantrums that have been going on . "
Gallagher 's fellow radio host , Rush Limbaugh , has been perhaps the most outspoken of the anti-McCain pundits .
On Wednesday , he even said jokingly , " I would like today to announce a tentative decision -- I m still thinking about it -- to endorse Barack Obama . "
Fox News asked Gallagher about Limbaugh 's suggestion that Obama " stands for everything to everybody . "
" Including , I guess , to some Muslims , " Gallagher replied , " because , remember , his middle name is Hussein .
So everybody 's happy ! "
More seriously , though , Gallagher emphasized again that " you ca n't keep the temper tantrums up . "
" There 's a pesky little part of the process , that we radio hosts do n't always like to acknowledge , that 's called the voters , " Gallagher stated .
" They go to the polls , they decide who they want .
Republicans have decided it 's John McCain .
" You 're being a little modest , " Fox host Alisyn Camerota insisted .
" Talk radio hosts are so influential .
...
Now that Mitt Romney has endorsed John McCain , do you think that talk radio hosts ... will now get behind him ? "
" We 're not king - makers , " retorted Gallagher .
" Rush and the rest of us threw everything we had and the kitchen sink at Bill Clinton in 1996 .
And boy , that worked out real well for us . "
" Now it 's time to act like big boys and big girls again , " Gallagher concluded .
" We 're at the big boy table .
Stop the pouting , stop the temper tantrums , and support John McCain . "

we will talk to you on the other side about what conservative talk radio hosts do not want :: steve : our buddy radio talk show host mike gallagher .
mike , i heard ali talking to you about talk radio and the problem with some of your colleagues have with john mccain two days ago rush limbaugh suggested on the air that he was thinking about finally endorsing barack obama .
because barack obama stands for everything to everybody . :: including to some muslims his middle name is husain .
everybody is happy .
is he barack husain obama .
ann coulter says she is going to vote and campaign for hillary clinton .
listen , george will said it at cpac .
this is the downfall of achilles .
you can't keep the temper tantrums up .
i heard mitt romney described as the conservative 's conservative at the cpac convention .
he did n't give up conservative ideology or principles by endorsing senator mccain there is a pesky part of the process that we radio hosts do n't always like to acknowledge that 's called the voters .
they go to the polls .
they decide who they want .
republicans are deciding it 's john mccain .
we better support him .
alisyn : you are being a little modest because talk radio hosts are so influential and such opinionmakers now that mitt romney has endorsed john mccain , do you think that talk radio hosts , the biggest names that we know will now get behind him ? :: ali , we are not kingmakers , we never have been .
if we were , rush and the rest of us threw everything we had and the kitchen sink at bill clinton in 1996 , that worked out well for us .
we had eight years of bill clinton .
it 's a clearing house of ideas and opinions .
we were effective in the illegal immigration debate .
we all have different views about who should be the next president .
now it 's time to act like big boys and big girls again .
we are at the big boy table .
stop the pouting and temper tantrums and support john mccain .
steve : we know you have got to do your table -- radio show . :: thanks .
THE socio-economic system which has governed much of the globe for over a century finally stopped working at around 9 pm last night , the United Nations has confirmed .
UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon made the announcement as retail giant Wal - Mart stopped Americans from buying rice and the cost of butter in British supermarkets reached 94p .
With poor people in fertile countries rioting because they could not afford to eat the food they had just grown , the UN chief said it was time for him to hide in a cupboard .
He added : “ As of this moment , free markets , capitalism and the rule of law are – oh , how should I put this ?
– fucked into a cocked hat .
“ We ’re planting crops for fuel instead of food in order to make it cheaper to drive to the shops where we then buy food that is much more expensive because we ’ve planted crops for fuel instead of food .
You can see where I ’m going with this , right ?
“ Meanwhile , the banks are borrowing money from taxpayers so that they can then lend the same money back to the taxpayers at a higer rate of interest than they borrowed it from them in the first place .
Seriously , is it just me ?
“ Anyway , point is , we ’re a bit stumped .
The communist one does n’t work either – in fact it ’s probably even worse , and you just end up queuing to buy matches and soap and huddling around oil drums , swigging home made vodka and smoking pathetic , little fags made out of hedge clippings .
“ So , if anyone does have any spare systems lying around that they ’re not using , please do email me at [ email protected ] ”
Wayne Hayes , a shopper from Gloucester , said : “ I do n’t know nothing about systems , all I know is I just paid 94 p for some butter .
What the fuck is that about ? ”
In a defeat for the union movement , the Supreme Court on Thursday struck down a first - in - the - nation law adopted in California that would have barred companies from speaking out against unions if they received state funds .
The justices in a 7 - 2 decision said the state measure conflicts with the free - speech zone created by federal labor law .
The ruling is likely to benefit especially companies in the healthcare industries , such as nursing homes , that receive some state funds and have low - level employees who are not unionized .
It is a sharp setback for unions seeking to organize janitors , nurses , clerical workers and other employees in those areas .
Labor organizers may encourage workers to join unions , the high court said , but the employers also are free to try to persuade them against unionizing .
Employers do not lose this right simply because they take the government ’s money , the justices said .

The California law was triggered by a campaign to organize janitors in the Los Angeles area .
Mike Garcia , a union leader , complained to lawmakers that some companies were using state money “ to pay for aggressive anti-union tactics . ”
State lawmakers , led by Sen. Gil Cedillo ( D - Los Angeles ) , won approval of a bill to stop this practice .
The measure , known as AB 1889 , said state contractors and other private employers may not use state money “ to assist , promote or deter union organizing . ”
The sponsors described this as the “ nation ’s first state neutrality law ” on labor organizing .
The state law “ simply prevents the misuse of state funds , ” Art Pulaski , secretary - treasurer of the California Labor Federation , said .
“ Our unions do n’t use state funds to help workers gain a voice at work , so employers should n’t use them to prevent workers from organizing for improved wages , benefits and working conditions . ”

Since California adopted its law in 2000 , at least 10 other states , including New York and Florida , have passed similar measures .
But the U.S. Chamber of Commerce sued to stop enforcement of the measure , and a federal judge in Los Angeles agreed it wrongly “ regulated employer speech about union organizing . ”
The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed and said the state could put restrictions on the use of its own funds .
But the law remained on hold while the Chamber of Commerce challenged the measure in the Supreme Court .
Thursday ’s ruling voids the state law .

This “ shuts the door on attempts by other states to use their spending powers to get around federal labor laws , ” said Robin Conrad , vice president of the National Chamber Litigation Center .
“ The impact of the court ’s decision will be sweeping . ”
The ruling was at least the third major decision this year to read federal law broadly to “ preempt ” or trump state laws .
In February , the justices struck down a Maine law that sought to limit shipments of cigarettes to homes .
The court said it conflicted with a federal law that deregulated the trucking industry .
At the same time , the justices also ruled that a federal law regulating medical devices preempts lawsuits by injured patients .
The decision threw out a suit brought under New York ’s general consumer - protection law .
In the union case , Justice John Paul Stevens said labor law since 1935 has tried to maintain a level playing field for unions and management .
The court has said the laws favored “ uninhibited , robust and wide - open debate ” between unions and employers and “ create a zone free from all regulations ” by the government .
Stevens said the state may not limit one side from making its case to workers .
Advertisement
Justices Stephen G. Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented .
They said the state law does not restrict what employers can say , and therefore does not violate the free - speech rule set by federal labor law .
Normally , legislatures have “ broad authority to decide how to spend the People ’s money , ” Breyer said .
If Californians do not want their tax money used against union organizers , he said , “ why should they be conscripted into paying ? ”

Fox Television said it wo n't pay its part of a $ 91,000 indecency fine levied recently by the Federal Communications Commission for a 2003 episode of a reality TV show that featured strippers and whipped cream .
Fox said in a statement that it wo n't pay the fine imposed against five of its stations because it believes the FCC 's decision that the show in question was indecent was " arbitrary and capricious , inconsistent with precedent , and patently unconstitutional . "
The network said it will appeal the FCC 's decision and proposed ...
Who speaks for John D. Rockefeller ?
Is it Rex Tillerson , the chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil , who presides over the forest of oaks that began in 1870 in Cleveland as Rockefeller 's little acorn known as Standard Oil ?
Or is it the descendants who speak for the grand old man ( 1839 - 1937 ) , who invoke the family name in their efforts to make Exxon more positive about global warming and more aggressive in the pursuit of renewable energy sources ?
Tillerson is in the Rockefeller mode , Mark I .
He knows how to make money .
For the first quarter , Tillerson turned in a profit of nearly $ 11 billion .
It 's the kind of figure that enrages people paying $ 4 a gallon and certainly galvanizes Democrats eager to impose windfall taxes — whereas the real criticism should be that not enough of the very necessary profit is invested to develop the viable fuels of the future .
Most of the money Exxon makes goes to dividends and stock buybacks — returns have averaged an annualized 24 percent or more in the past five years — which is why at their Dallas meeting , 60 percent of the shareholders did n't vote for a change in the company 's conduct .
Shareholders are not by nature inclined to look beyond tomorrow 's stock tables .
John D. was a lot more adventurous than that .
As his economist great - granddaughter Neva Rockefeller Goodwin put it , " my great - grandfather saw the need to change from whale oil to petroleum - based fuels , " and Exxon is not showing the " nimbleness and entrepreneurial imagination " to cope with the rapidly changing world .
She is surely right .
Supplies of oil just cannot keep pace with the guzzlers — and I do n't just mean the SUVs and trucks getting an absurd 12 miles to the gallon , which is bad enough , but the fast - developing countries like India and China .
About a year ago , my colleague Mortimer Zuckerman foresaw the trend , warning that the overwhelming mismatch between supply and demand " could produce oil prices well over $ 100 a barrel ... with massive consequences for the world 's economy . "
Well , he 's won the cigar with that forecast , and it is no use wishing he had n't .
Held hostage .
We are more or less captives to the big state - owned oil companies run by those friends of ours in Iran , Venezuela , and Russia .
The West 's big international companies are now minnows in the pond , controlling only 10 percent of world oil today .
Quick guess :
How much of the world 's reserves do they control ?
The Rockefellers who paid due respect to chairman Tillerson are closer to Rockefeller Mark II , the moral visionary , than to Mark I , the robber baron .
No fewer than 73 of 78 members of the family have been trying for some years to get Exxon to think more strategically and make its own contribution toward the transition to an economy less dependent on carbon .
They have the support of the patriarch David Rockefeller , retired chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank .
It must mean something when he , one of the most prudent of men , backs the family effort because of the need " to sharpen Exxon Mobil 's focus on the environmental crisis facing all of us . "
To which Tillerson 's brusque predecessor , Lee Raymond , would have snorted , " What crisis ? "
Of all the energy companies , Exxon Mobil , as exemplified by Raymond , has been the most vehemently in denial about global warming .
Tillerson seems inclined to change the company 's course , but it 's like watching a new captain trying to turn a giant oil tanker heading for the rocks , not quite sure he believes his instruments .
Exxon has funded more than a score of groups masquerading under names that suggest science but actually spell antiglobal - warming propaganda : the Advancement of Sound Science Coalition ; Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow ; Heartland Institute , and so on .
Tillerson says Exxon is simply joining the " debate " about global warming , which sounds fair enough , but why not insist that to qualify for Exxon dollars the groups must come clean with titles that do n't mislead the public ?
They all seek to suggest that the 2,000 concerned scientists in 100 countries are pseudos — the malevolent plotters of Michael Crichton 's novel State of Fear .
Crichton memorably said , " If it 's consensus , it is n't science .
If it 's science , it is n't consensus . "
Tillerson tops that , saying a scientific consensus is an oxymoron .
I suppose we should bring the same skepticism to the old consensus that the Earth is flat .
HONG KONG / SINGAPORE ( Reuters ) - Chinese metal fabricators are starting to feel the pinch from a slowdown in U.S. export orders , indicating that internal demand from the Asian giant may not be able to sustain the metals price boom .

Auto part makers to tube manufacturers in China are reporting lackluster order books going into the second half of the year .
Together with efforts by Beijing to curb economic expansion , analysts fear that industrial commodities will be hit by a double whammy -- a U.S. recession and moderating growth in Asia .
“ It ’s pretty obvious that if the external economy does n’t perform -- i.e. the United States -- then the internal economy is also going to suffer badly , ” said Jonathan Barratt , managing director of Commodity Broking Services .
Many analysts had said earlier this year that China was experiencing a temporary slowdown in demand brought on by record metal prices , bad weather and the Lunar New year holidays , and domestic consumption will pick up again .
But Barratt added : “ It looks like we are heading towards a nightmare stagflation scenario and the crescendo could come around the Beijing Olympics . ”
China is the world ’s largest copper consumer , using an estimated 4.5 million tonnes of the metal a year , or about a quarter of global production .
A large part of that is used domestically as China develops its power infrastructure , but a lot also gets exported , contained in products from tubes and power cables to air - conditioners .
However , the country ’s copper imports fell 5 percent in February from the previous month , customs data earlier this week showed , and could slow even further in coming months .
An official at copper wire maker Tai - I Copper , a subsidiary of Tai - I International 1808 .HK , said the firm was worried about lower export orders in the second half of this year , following a flat performance in the first two quarters from a year earlier .
But a purchasing manager at Golden Dragon , a major copper tube producer in China , said the company ’s exports , which run at 6,000 tonnes a month , half of which go to the United States , had not so far been affected by the slower pace in the U.S. economy .
“ The big issue is whether this stable situation can continue in the second half ? ” he said .
Copper prices , up by a third this year to a record $ 8,820 a tonne last week MCU3 , have scared off Chinese consumers , leading to a doubling of stocks in warehouses monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange since early February .
INFLATION CONCERNS
Adding to fabricators ’ concerns is soaring domestic inflation -- running at an 11 - year high -- and likely government attempts to cool rising prices , forcing analysts to trim growth forecasts .
Beijing plans to cut economic growth to 8 percent this year from 11.4 in 2007 which is also likely to weigh on consumption .
“ If you are looking for China to take up the slack , you are asking a lot , especially as China wants to put on the brakes , ” said analyst William Adams at BaseMetals.com .
“ China and Asia are going through an industrial revolution and that is bullish , but we may be cooling off from a hot bull trend to a warm trend .
Overall , China will remain strong but not as a strong as we have become used to . ”
For the aluminum industry , the effect of the problems in the United States are already being felt .
Fabricators in Guangdong , an industrial heartland , say they have seen a 50 percent cut in orders for aluminum products ranging from window frames to computer and car parts from U.S. customers .
“ The whole industry knows that U.S. orders in the second quarter have fallen by a half from a year ago , ” a manager at a aluminum product plant in Nanhai city said .
Some U.S. buyers had also asked for longer payment times in the first quarter or delayed deliveries , making many fabricators in Guangdong cautious about taking new orders , he said .
And it ’s not just analysts and exporters who are getting worried about the health of the world ’s largest economy .
Insurance premiums for shipments from China to the United States , to cover in case a buyer defaults , have risen to 1 percent now from about 0.75 percent in December , as underwriters price in growing risk , exporters said .
Premiums for Europe at about half this level are stable , they said .

Exploration at the Limits of Space & Time ( NASA 's " Beyond Einstein " Program )
Description :
Albert Einstein's General
Theory of Relativity predicted results that were so incredible that even he did not accept them : space is expanding from a Big Bang , space itself contains an energy that is pulling the Universe apart from within , and deep chasms of gravity called black holes actually exist .
Astonishingly , all of these wild ideas are now known to be true .
But now we need to build on Einstein 's work to take the next step -- to study the underlying physics of the very phenomena that came out of his theories .
NASA 's Beyond Einstein program consists of a series of space missions , large and small , that push Einstein 's theories to their limits , using increasingly more sensitive probes .
The two flagship missions now in development , Constellation - X and LISA , will explore extremes of space , measuring X - rays and gravitational waves .
The smaller missions , the Einstein probes , will target specific science questions such as " What is Dark Energy ? " and " What powered the Big Bang ? "

Challenge in Astrophysics
Lecture description :
The GR avitational l E nsing A ccuracy T esting 2008 ( GREAT08 ) Challenge focuses on a problem that is of crucial importance for future observations in cosmology .
The shapes of distant galaxies can be used to determine the properties of dark energy and the nature of gravity , because light from those galaxies is bent by gravity from the intervening dark matter .
The observed galaxy images appear distorted , although only slightly , and their shapes must be precisely disentangled from the effects of pixelisation , convolution and noise .
The worldwide gravitational lensing community has made significant progress in techniques to measure these distortions via the Shear TEsting Program ( STEP ) .
Via STEP , we have run challenges within our own community , and come to recognise that this particular image analysis problem is ideally matched to experts in statistical inference , inverse problems and computational learning .
Thus , in order to continue the progress seen in recent years , we are seeking an infusion of new ideas from these communities .

Manipulation of Nanoscale Charged States in Manganites
Lecture description :
The complicated interplay among charge , spin and lattice degrees of freedom in manganites is believed to induce the unexpected magnetic and transport phenomena , such as the colossal magnetoresistance ( CMR ) .
Manganites display also a variety of useful multiferroic properties such as colossal magnetocapacitance effect and high dielectric constant .
In multiferroics ferromagnetic order can be controlled by an electric field , or ferroelectric order can be controlled by a magnetic field .
Among them , La1 - xSrxMnO3 is the most attractive candidate for multiferroic applications because of a combination of desirable properties .
In this work lecturer reports the observation of the high contrast of electric field induced charged polar states after the local application of the electric field to the surface of samples via several Scanning Probe Microscopy ( SPM ) techniques in La0.9Sr0.1MnO3 and La0.89Sr0.11MnO3 single crystals .
The electric - field - induced contrast is observed in Kelvin mode ( KFM ) confirming local modification of the surface properties of manganites .
Piezoelectric effect of the induced states is assessed using Piezoresponse Force Microscopy ( PFM ) .
These results are complemented by the measurements of piezoresponse hysteresis and surface potential hysteresis loops at some area in standard pulse dc mode .
The induced polar charged states relax with characteristic time constant of about 80 hours at room temperature , which exceeds Maxwell relaxation time by many orders of magnitude .
The mechanisms of the observed phenomena are discussed along with the possible instrumentation effects .
The origin of the effect can be related to the nanoscale charge and spin dynamic inhomogeneities appearing in manganites due to a delicate balance of charge , lattice and magnetic order .
The injection of the additional charge carriers in the induced area promotes the appearance of the polar charged states .
The long relaxation time for the induced charged state may be explained by the existence of the intrinsic inhomogeneous states .
All these results show that the existence of the stable areas with the increased charge concentration is possible and thus it confirms the tendency towards charge segregation in manganites .

I am getting my physics degree in 25 days so I am excited to bring another collection of free physics videos and full physics video courses !
This time I found a lot of modern physics videos for general public : talks on string theory , universe and particle supercolliders .
I also found videos on cosmology , modern physics , particle physics , nanophysics , more string theory and various physics demonstrations .
Course description :
The primary emphasis of the lectures will be the study of non-perturbative regimes of string theory .
The first lecture will be broad and at a general level , touching on a number of topics .
The remaining lectures will be more detailed , exhibiting some key tools and phenomena which have formed the foundation for several recent advances in the field .
Among these are D - branes , which will be studied from several points of view , leading to ideas such as strong / weak coupling dualities , open / closed dualities , holography , and gauge / gravity dualities .
If time permits , the last lecture will discuss " minimal string theories " , which are simple but powerful exactly solvable systems which exhibit a range of key non-perturbative phenomena .

Singapore Superhero : Batman Bin Suparman
You should never judge a book by its cover , but what if that book turned out to be a comic ?
Batman Bin Suparman might not be a joke , but his name sure is .
In Singapore , English is the most widely used language and all names are translated or converted to English when their Birth Certificate is issued .
On May 13 , 1990 , this young man was blessed with being named after two superheroes : Batman and Superman .
Unfortunately we were unable to find the boy for comment , as no one seems to know his alter egos …

Ford put Jaguar and Land Rover up for sale last June Car giant Ford has sold its luxury UK - based car brands Jaguar and Land Rover to Indian company Tata .
Tata , India 's biggest vehicle maker , is paying $ 2.3 bn ( £ 1.15 bn ) for the British brands after months of negotiations over price and supply relationships .
The negotiations started last June when Ford announced its intention to sell the companies as a package .
Jaguar and Land Rover employ about 16,000 staff at UK plants in the West Midlands and Merseyside .
Although Land Rover remains profitable , Ford has never managed to make money from its investment in Jaguar .
Now , it is time for Ford to concentrate on integrating the Ford brand globally

Who gains from the deal ?
Jaguar workers cheer Ford has been forced to sell the two companies , based at Solihull and Castle Bromwich in the West Midlands and Halewood on Merseyside , in order to concentrate on its loss - making core US car business , which it hopes to turn around in the next two years .
The $ 2.3 bn price tag is about half the amount Ford originally paid for the marques , leading some analysts to argue that the purchase was a mistake .
" How can you call it anything else ? " said Erich Merkle , an auto expert for US consulting company IRN .
" You have to cut your losses at some point .
It 's been draining them of cash and resources . "
Ford sold its iconic Aston Martin marque to a UK - led investment consortium in a deal worth $ 955.2 m last year .
No significant changes
The companies said there would not be any " significant changes " to Jaguar or Land Rover employees ' terms of employment on completion of the sale .
They said that staff , trade unions and the UK government had been kept informed of developments and supported the move .
Tata said the deal should be completed by the end of the summer , subject to applicable regulatory approvals .
The purchase will give Tata the opportunity to expand its presence in the passenger car market beyond India and gives it the clout necessary to compete with international players .

In January , Tata launched the world 's cheapest car , the Nano , priced at $ 2,500 ( £ 1,250 ) .
By contrast , the starting price for Jaguar 's latest sports car , the XF is more than £ 32,000 ( $ 64,000 ) .
" We are very pleased at the prospect of Jaguar and Land Rover being a significant part of our automotive business , " Tata said .
" We have enormous respect for the two brands and will endeavour to preserve and build on their heritage and competitiveness , keeping their identities intact .
" We aim to support their growth , while holding true to our principles of allowing the management and employees to bring their experience and expertise to bear on the growth of the business . "
Alan Mulally , the president and chief executive of Ford , said he was " confident " that the brands would continue to thrive under Tata 's stewardship .
" Now , it is time for Ford to concentrate on integrating the Ford brand globally , as we implement our plan to create a strong Ford Motor Company that delivers profitable growth for all , " he added .
Terms
Under the terms of the deal , Ford will contribute about $ 600 m to the Jaguar and Land Rover pension plans .
Ford will continue to supply Jaguar and Land Rover for differing periods with engines , stampings and other car components , in addition to a variety of technologies .
In addition , Ford Motor Credit Company will provide financing for Jaguar and Land Rover dealers and customers during a transitional period of up to 12 months .
" It seems as though they have resolved some tricky supply issues , " said Ernst & Young 's automotive expert Eric Wallbank .
" The deal will give Ford the cash to revive its fortunes in the US and focus on its core brand , while it adds an important plank to Tata 's automotive ambitions , " he added .
