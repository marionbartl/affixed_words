The following is the text of a pamphlet I wrote for an organization at UMASS amherst
It is an attempt to point out some of the absurdities in the marijuana - is - bad - for - you - like - cigarettes bullshit , as well as take a few cheap ( but well aimed ) shots at the tobacco industry .
It is written from a pro-marijuana - relegalization perspective , and if you want a copy , mail us a Self Addressed Stamped Envelope .
( we 're poor . )
An address and some sources are at the end .
So , you thought it was the tar that caused cancer ...
Think again .
Cigarette companies will have you believing anything just as long as you continue to buy their products .
The fact is , although insoluble tars are a contributing factor to the lung cancer danger present in today 's cigarettes , the real danger is radioactivity .
According to U.S. Surgeon General C. Everette Koop ( on national television , 1990 ) radioactivity , not tar , accounts for at least 90 % of all smoking related lung cancer .
Tobacco crops grown in the United States are fertilized by law with phosphates rich in radium 226 .
In addition , many soils have a natural radium 226 content .
Radium 226 breaks down into two long lived ' daughter ' elements -- lead 210 and polonium 210 .
These radioactive particles become airborne , and attach themselves to the fine hairs on tobacco leaves .
Studies have shown that lead 210 and polonium 210 deposits accumulate in the bodies of people exposed to cigarette smoke .
Data collected in the late 1970 's shows that smokers have three times as much of these elements in their lower lungs as non smokers .
Smokers also show a greater accumulation of lead 210 and polonium 210 in their skeletons , though no studies have been conducted to link these deposits with bone cancer .
Polonium 210 is the only component of cigarette smoke which has produced tumors by itself in inhalation experiments with animals .
When a smoker inhales tobacco smoke , the lungs react by forming irritated areas in the bronchi .
All smoke produces this effect .
However , although these irritated spots are referred to as ' pre- cancerous ' lesions , they are a perfectly natural defense system and usually go away with no adverse effects .
Insoluble tars in tobacco smoke can slow this healing process by adhering to lesions and causing additional irritation .
In addition , tobacco smoke causes the bronchi to constrict for long periods of time , which obstructs the lung 's ability to clear itself of these residues .
Polonium 210 and lead 210 in tobacco smoke show a tendency to accumulate at lesions in specific spots , called bifurcations , in the bronchi .
When smoking is continued for an extended period of time , deposits of radioactivity turn into radioactive ' hot spots ' and remain at bifurcations for years .
Polonium 210 emits highly localized alpha radiation which has been shown to cause cancer .
Since the polonium 210 has a half life of 21.5 years ( Due to the presence of lead 210 ) , it can put an ex-smoker at risk for years after he or she quits .
Experiments measuring the level of polonium 210 in victims of lung cancer found that the level of ' hot spot ' activity was virtually the same in smokers and ex-smokers even though the ex-smokers had quit five years prior to death .
Over half of the radioactive materials emitted by a burning cigarette are released into the air , where they can be inhaled by non-smokers .
In addition to lead 210 and polonium 210 it has been proven that tobacco smoke can cause airborne radioactive particles to collect in the lungs of both smokers and non-smokers exposed to second hand smoke .
Original studies conducted on uranium miners which showed an increased risk of lung cancer due to exposure to radon in smokers have been re-run to evaluate the radioactive lung cancer risk from indoor air radon .
It turns out that tobacco smoke works as a kind of ' magnet ' for airborne radioactive particles , causing them to deposit in your lungs instead of on furniture .
( Smoking indoors increases lung cancer risks greatly . )
It has been estimated that the total accumulated alpha radiation exposure of a pack - a- day indoor smoker is 38 to 97 rad by age 60 .
( Two packs a day yields up to 143 rad , and non-smokers receive no more than 17 rad . )
An exposure of 1 rad per year yields a 1 % risk of lung cancer ( at the lowest estimate . )
Do n't smoke .
Or if you do , smoke lightly , outdoors , and engage frequently in activities which will clear your lungs .
Imported India tobacco has less than half the radiation content of that grown in the U.S.
Kicking the nicotine habit is not easy , and nobody has the right to expect it of you .
Often physical addictions are reinforced by emotional and psychological needs .
Filling or coming to terms with those needs can give you the inspiration and added freedom to succeed .
Most of all , inform yourself , even if the information is disturbing .
You are a lot less likely to be taken in by tobacco advertising once you know the facts .
Nicotine , the active ingredient in tobacco smoke , has long been known to be highly addictive .
In fact , doctors and pharmacologists are not in consensus as to which is more addictive -- nicotine , or heroin .
Physical addiction occurs when a chemical becomes essential for the body or metabolism to function .
In other words , a substance is said to be physically addictive if extended use results in a build up of tolerance in the body to the extent that discontinuing use of the substance results in negative side effects .
Called " withdrawal symptoms , " these consequences can include anxiety , stress , trauma , depression and physical conditions such as shakes or nausea .
It is to avoid these consequences that an addict will keep using his or her substance .
In addition to being addictive , nicotine is also a toxin ( i.e. lethal if ingested in sufficient quantities . )
Nicotine has been shown to have a negative effect on the heart and circulatory systems , causing a constriction in veins and arteries which may lead to a stroke or heart attack .
In fact , nicotine is so poisonous that smokers who ignore their doctor 's advice and continue to smoke while using dermal nicotine patches have managed to overdose and die of heart seizure .
Many people think smoking marijuana is just as harmful as smoking tobacco , but this is not true .
Those who hold that marijuana is equivalent to tobacco are misinformed .
Due to the efforts of various federal agencies to discourage use of marijuana in the 1970's the government , in a fit of " reefer madness , " conducted several biased studies designed to return results that would equate marijuana smoking with tobacco smoking , or worse .
For example the Berkeley carcinogenic tar studies of the late 1970 's concluded that " marijuana is one - and - a - half times as carcinogenic as tobacco . "
This finding was based solely on the tar content of cannabis leaves compared to that of tobacco , and did not take radioactivity into consideration .
( Cannabis tars do not contain radioactive materials . )
In addition , it was not considered that : 1 ) Most marijuana smokers smoke the bud , not the leaf , of the plant .
The bud contains only 33 % as much tar as tobacco .
2 ) Marijuana smokers do not smoke anywhere near as much as tobacco smokers , due to the psychoactive effects of cannabis .
3 ) Not one case of lung cancer has ever been successfully linked to marijuana use .
4 ) Cannabis , unlike tobacco , does not cause any narrowing of the small air passageways in the lungs .
In fact , marijuana has been shown to be an expectorant and actually dilates the air channels it comes in contact with .
This is why many asthma sufferers look to marijuana to provide relief .
Doctors have postulated that marijuana may , in this respect , be more effective than all of the prescription drugs on the market .
Studies even show that due to marijuana 's ability to clear the lungs of smog , pollutants , and cigarette smoke , it may actually reduce your risk of emphysema , bronchitis , and lung cancer .
Smokers of cannabis have been shown to outlive non- smokers in some areas by up to two years .
Medium to heavy tobacco smokers will live seven to ten years longer if they also smoke marijuana .
Cannabis is also radically different from tobacco in that it does not contain nicotine and is not addictive .
The psychoactive ingredient in marijuana , THC , has been accused of causing brain and genetic damage , but these studies have all been disproven .
In fact , the DEA 's own Administrative Law Judge Francis
Young has declared that " marijuana in its natural form is far safer than many foods we commonly consume . "
The disturbing thing about all of this information is that the majority of Americans are as yet unaware of the radioactive risk in cigarettes .
In fact , many professionals : doctors , scientists and health administrators , either have never heard of polonium 210 or consider it to be just another scare story .
Why is this information so hard to come by ?
When the studies were first released in the late 70's , many magazines were unable to print articles because their main advertisers , cigarette companies , threatened to pull support if they published the facts .
Although network news did pick up the story , virtually nothing came out in print .
Those who heard were hard pressed to produce collaborating evidence , and were eventually convinced it was nothing to worry about .
The power of the cigarette industry to suppress information goes far beyond magazines , however .
A well financed tobacco lobby has been very active in the United States Congress for decades procuring subsidies and fighting laws and proposed research which could hurt the American tobacco industry .
Tobacco interests practically own Senate and House seats , as many campaign contributions come from cigarette profits .
Tobacco pay - offs also go to fund organizations such as the Partnership For A Drug Free America , which adopt a harsh anti-drug agenda yet seem to omit alcohol and tobacco ( claiming they are harmless . )
As an example , a 1984 law which was intended to require tobacco companies to release to the public a list of additives used in the manufacture of cigarettes was watered down to the extent that the list is now released only to the Department of Health and Human Services on the condition that it not be shown to anyone else .
Companies have been known in the past to add chemicals to cigarettes for flavor , and , many assert , for their addictive properties .
In Britain such chemicals have included acetone and turpentine , as well as an assortment of known carcinogens .
Tobacco companies argue that revealing their ' secret ingredients ' would hurt their competitiveness .
In fact , when Canada passed legislation forcing additive lists to be released , one large company reformulated its recipe for its Canadian distribution ; another took its product out of Canada entirely .
Tobacco companies do not have the right to poison the public .
Do n't trust them .
Get the information you need to make your own decisions , and restore government to the people .
Another destructive aspect of the Drug War is the unreasonable measures taken as a result of " reefer madness . "
Because of the long standing anti-pot - smoking paranoia begun in the 1930's , many law enforcement agencies have taken it upon themselves to censor and limit the marijuana culture through whatever channels they can find .
This includes the banning of various forms of drug " paraphernalia " ( pipes , clips , rolling papers , etc . )
Water pipes , or " bongs , " are quite often the target of such efforts .
Claiming that water pipes are constructed to allow marijuana smokers to inhale " dangerous " marijuana smoke deeper into their lungs , many states and towns have passed laws controlling the sale , manufacture , and possession of these items for " health " reasons .
The sad fact is , water pipes have been shown to be extremely effective in removing harmful materials from smoke before it reaches the lungs .
They also cool the smoke and prevent injury and irritation to lung passages .
In effect , laws against water pipes hurt all smokers , cannabis and tobacco , by preventing the development of safer forms of consumption .

To the Editor : During the 17 years since the Surgeon General 's first report on smoking , intense research activity has been focused on the carcinogenic potential of the tar component of cigarette smoke .
Only one definite chmical carcinogen -- benzopyrene -- ( typist note :
He was later corrected on this " fact " ) has been found .
Conspicuous because of its absence is research into the role of the radioactive component of cigarette smoke .
The alpha emitters polonium - 210 and lead - 210 are highly con- centrated on tobacco trichomes and insoluble particles in cigarette smoke ( 1 ) .
The major source of the polonium is phosphate fertilizer , which is used in growing tobacco .
The trichomes of the leaves con- centrate the polonium , which persists when tobacco is dried and processed .
Levels of Po-210 were measured in cigarette smoke by Radford and Hunt ( 2 ) and in the bronchial epithelium of smokers and nonsmokers by Little et al . ( 3 ) After inhalation , ciliary action causes the insoluble radioactive particles to accumulate at the bifurcation of segmental bronchi , a common site of origin of bronchogenic carcinomas .
In a person smoking 1 1 / 2 packs of cigarettes per day , the radia - tion dose to the bronchial epithelium in areas of bifurcation is 8000 mrem per year -- the equivalent of the dose to the skin from 300 x -ray films of the chest per year .
This figure is comparable to total - body exposure to natural background radiation containing 80 mrem per year in someone living in the Boston area .
It is a common practive to assume that the exposure received from a radiation source is distributed throughout a tissue .
In this way , a high level of exposure in a localized region -- e.g. bronchial epithelium -- is averaged out over the entire tissue mass , suggest - ing a low level of exposure .
However , alpha particles have a range of only 40 um in the body .
A cell nucleus of 5 to 6 um that is traversed by a single alpha particle receives a dose of 1000 rems .
Thus , although the total tissue dose might be considered negligible , cells close to an alpha source receive high doses .
The Po-210 alpha activity of cigarette smoke may be a very effective carcinogen if a multiple mutation mechanism is involved .
Radford and Hunt have determined that 75 per cent of the alpha activity of cigarette smoke enters the ambient air and is unab - sorbed by the smoker , ( 2 ) making it available for deposit in the lungs of others .
Little et al. have measured levels of Po-210 in the lungs of nonsmokers that may not be accounted for on the basis of natural exposure to this isotope .
The detrimental effects of tobacco smoke have been considerably underestimated , making it less likely that chemical carcinogens alone are responsible for the observed incidence of tobacco - related carcinoma .
Alpha emitters in cigarette smoke result in appreciable radiation exposure to the bronchial epithelium of smokers and probably secondhand smokers .
Alpha radiation is a possible etio- logic factor in tobacco - related carcinoma , and it deserves further study .

Brief Prepared by UMASS CANNABIS verdant@titan.ucs.umass.edu
Scientists have proposed that the lowlands of Mars 's northern hemisphere were once covered in water .
Image Credit : NASA
Mars is frozen today , but when it was young there may have been liquid water on its surface .
What does the latest evidence indicate about the ancient martian climate ?
Understanding the past environment of Mars can help future missions " follow the water " in the search for alien life .
On Mars today , water is frozen solid .
The average temperature of the Red Planet is negative 55 degrees Celsius ( - 67 F ) , and when the temperature rises -- the highest recorded temperature is a balmy 20 degrees C ( 68 F ) -- this ice turns directly into a gas , skipping the liquid phase entirely because of the low atmospheric pressure .
Mars may have had a thicker atmosphere and liquid water on its surface between 3.5 and 4 billion years ago .
Satellites orbiting Mars have taken images of ancient ocean shorelines , river beds and canyons - features all thought to be caused by flowing water .
The chemistry of the martian soil also suggests that liquid water may have been present once on the surface .
If so , then perhaps life could have emerged on Mars during this time in its history .
Many scientists think Mars was cold when it was young - cold enough so that surface water should have been frozen solid .
One way around this problem is if the chemistry of the water was such that it could remain liquid at lower temperatures .
On Earth , the salt in seawater prevents it from freezing at the same temperature as freshwater .
For early Mars to be cold but still wet , however , the water would have had to be much saltier than seems likely .
Another possibility is that Mars was warmer in the past .
At first glance this idea does n’t make sense -- the Sun was fainter back then , so the planet should have been even colder in the past and then gradually warmed up as the Sun grew brighter .
But sunlight is not the only way to warm a planet ; an atmosphere also can help keep conditions toasty .
Just look at Venus -- its thick greenhouse atmosphere has raised its average surface temperature to a searing 464 degrees Celsius ( 867 F ) .
Could Mars also once have had a greenhouse atmosphere that warmed the planet enough to keep water flowing across its surface ?
Jim Kasting of Penn State and Brian Toon of the University of Colorado discussed the possibility of a warm and wet Mars at the recent NASA Astrobiology Science Conference in League City , Texas .
Surface features of Venus can not be seen in visible light by orbiting spacecraft , due to the thick greenhouse atmosphere .
Could Mars also once have had a thick greenhouse atmosphere that kept the planet warm ?
Image credit : NASA
Kasting explained that the climate models have n’t found a solution for warming early Mars , because the greenhouse effect is “ self - limiting . ”
Adding different types of gases to the atmospheric models can help increase the temperature , but these same gases create clouds which reflect sunlight back into space , cooling the planet .
The two effects compete with each other up to a point , but then eventually you end up with a colder planet because the added gases develop so much cloud cover .
Climate modelers have looked at greenhouse gases like methane , carbon dioxide , sulfur dioxide , and water vapor , but so far have not hit upon a good way to warm ancient Mars .
" We 've spent 30 years on the greenhouse effect and no one has solved the problem in a credible way so far , ” noted Toon .
“ On the greenhouse problem , we 're just drifting into deeper and deeper complexity . "
Why does the greenhouse climate work so well to heat up Venus but not Mars ?
The thick clouds of Venus also bounce a lot of sunlight off into space , and that reflection is why we ’re not able to see the surface of Venus in the visible light spectrum .
One answer is that Venus is much closer to the Sun , so it receives substantially more sunlight than Mars does .
According to Toon , another reason is that Mars is little .
The lower gravity of a less massive world reduces the rate that air cools with altitude .
On Earth this rate is about 10 degrees Kelvin per kilometer , but on Mars the rate is about half that .
“ This makes it harder to get a greenhouse effect , giving you less ‘ bang for the buck ’ for your greenhouse gases , ” Toon said .
“ Mars is hard to warm up because it ’s so small . ”
Toon believes that , rather than a greenhouse atmosphere keeping Mars warm and wet , the canyons and river beds we see on Mars formed due to periodic asteroid and comet impacts .
In this scenario , impacts would have filled the atmosphere with vaporized rock and ice and resulted in several years of rainfall and flooding that created the erosion features on Mars .
“ We know the impacts occurred - we can see the craters there , ” said Toon .
“ It 's pretty much impossible to avoid there being large amounts of water coming from them . ”
Kasting , however , does n’t agree that impact events created the features seen on Mars .
He pointed to Nanedi Valles on Mars , which he said was " essentially a Grand Canyon , on a slightly smaller scale . "
Kasting estimates it took roughly 5 million meters of water to form the Grand Canyon on Earth over 17 million years .
The same amount of rainfall would have been needed to form a feature like Nanedi Valles on Mars , ten to one hundred thousand times more water than an impact could generate .
Kasting also noted that features in Warrego Valles looked similar to oxbow lakes on Earth , which are made slowly over time by meandering rivers .
If the formations on Mars were made by a similar process , then the water must have been flowing persistently , rather than quickly and catastrophically as would have been the case from impact - related flooding .
This artist 's depiction shows the disappearance of Mars ’s magnetic field , which may have triggered the loss of much of its atmosphere .
Image credit : NASA
Toon countered this by pointing to features on Earth that formed quickly , such as the Salton Sea flood in California where a river was carved in approximately nine months to a similar depth and length as some of the channels on Mars .
“ You can certainly carve significant terrain in nine months , ” he said .
Scientists disagree on how long it might take such features to form on Mars because of the lack of absolute age data .
To get that information , we would need to analyze rock samples from the features in the laboratory .
“ All our age dates come from crater counts , and that is not an accurate science by any means , especially when you ’re trying to resolve issues of how long it took to form valleys , ” said Kasting .
“ The only thing we know how long it takes to form are impact craters , because they ’re created instantaneously . ”
The quality of the soil may provide some clues to the time it took features to form on Mars .
If the soil is looser , in the manner of loamy sand rather than bedrock , it would erode much more quickly .
Kasting said the surface of Mars is mainly basalt - a hard crust that would be comparatively resistant to erosion .
“ The surface of Mars may be somewhat more erodible than rocks on Earth , but not by a factor of ten to the fourth , " he said .
Toon disagreed .
" If you have all these large impacts , you 're going to create about a kilometer of regolith , ” he said .
“ This is loosely consolidated material that 's covering the planet about a kilometer deep , and that 's very likely where these rivers formed due to impacts . "
The chemical make - up of the soil is another avenue for trying to understand early Mars .
On Earth , carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reacts with water and silicate rocks and is converted into calcium carbonate ( limestone ) .
The martian atmosphere today is primarily composed of carbon dioxide , and scientists have long wondered why we could never find evidence for carbonates in the soil .
NASA ’s Phoenix mission finally found carbonates on Mars , but in very low amounts .
Warrego Valles is a suite of branching valleys located in the martian southern hemisphere .
The valleys are old , and many have been modified by later processes that obscure the original geologic features related to their origin .
Image Credit : NASA / JPL / Malin Space Science Systems
Earth ’s carbonates tend to form in shallow warm waters like the sea near the Bahamas , rather than in colder areas like the North Sea .
The low abundance of carbonates on Mars may indicate the planet has always been cold .
However , the carbonates found by Phoenix are not thought to have formed in standing water .
Instead , scientists think they formed through the chemical interaction of carbon dioxide and water vapor as minute particles of basalt blew on the wind .
The paucity of carbonates may tell us something about the composition of the early atmosphere .
If , for instance , sulfur dioxide was ever part of the martian atmosphere , carbonates would have had a hard time forming .
“ Sulfate in rain would prevent carbonates on surface , but you do n’t even need that , ” said Kasting .
“ If you had a 3 bar carbon dioxide atmosphere on Mars , rainwater would be pH 3.7 and would dissolve any carbonates . ”
In the end , Kasting and Toon were in perfect agreement on one point : the environment of ancient Mars remains a mystery .
Every new bit of information is another piece of the puzzle , and eventually we ’ll fit enough of these pieces together to construct a clear picture of the Red Planet ’s earliest days .

Islam made me a better citizen and patriot .
The Prophet Muhammad 's teachings strengthened my belief in freedom and democracy .
Independence Day once meant nothing more to me than an excuse to party .
Prior to my acceptance of Islam , my personal behavior demonstrated all too well why July 4th ranks as the holiday most associated with alcohol - related deaths .
When I first read the Quran , Islam 's revealed text , and the traditions ( hadith ) of the Prophet Muhammad I expected to find something totally alien to American ideals .
Instead , I found many of the same democratic principles that emerged from the Continental Congress in that summer of 1776 .
Democracy - The Quran promises rewards for those " who ( conduct ) their affairs by mutual consultation . "
( Quran , 42:38 ) Political Activism - The Prophet Muhammad said , " The best jihad in the path of God is ( to speak ) a word of justice to an oppressive ruler . " ( Sunan of Abu - Dawood ) Justice - " O believers !
Stand firm for justice and bear true witness for the sake of God , even though it be against yourselves , your parents or your relatives .
It does not matter whether the party is rich or poor - God is well wisher of both .
So let not your selfish desires swerve you from justice .
If you distort your testimony or decline to give it , then you should remember that God is fully aware of your actions . "
( Quran , 4:135 ) The Burden of Political Authority - The Prophet Muhammad said , " He who has been ruler over ( even ) ten people will be brought shackled on the Day of Resurrection until justice loosens his chains or tyranny brings him to destruction . "
( Sahih Muslim ) Islam 's lifestyle of self - restraint , abstinence from drugs and alcohol , respect for the institution of marriage , concern for neighbors regardless of their faith , duty to parents , and respect for the rule of law resulted in my becoming a better person and a better American .
Thomas Jefferson once said , " Dissent is the greatest form of patriotism . "
On July 4th , we celebrate one of history 's great acts of dissent : the signing of the Declaration of Independence .
The men who put their signature on that document literally put their lives and property on the line to voice their disagreement with British government policies that they believed to be tyrannical .
This July 4th offers an opportunity to renew our commitment to the patriotic nature of political dissent .
I and many other Americans are deeply disturbed by events in Iraq , by reports of torture and desecration of the Quran in Guantanamo Bay , by Patriot Act abuses , by the rising tide of anti-Muslim rhetoric in our society , and by domestic and international policies that seem to create more problems than they solve .
But my love for America is not diminished because it is sometimes flawed .
I love my nation because , despite its flaws , the majority of its people remain committed to tolerance and respect for one another , whatever their faith or viewpoint .
After the 9/11 attacks , my neighbors could have turned their anger on me as a Muslim .
They did not .
They came to me and offered both support and their horror that someone would twist my faith in such an evil manner .
But of greatest inspiration to me are the words written in 1998 by a Muslim 10th grader living in California .
Following the attack on the USS Cole , he wrote a letter to Osama bin Laden .
In that letter he wrote : " If you are keen to murder Americans , kill us before you kill non-Muslim Americans .
Bomb our mosques and Islamic Centers .
We are Americans as much as others . "
This July 4th , let us all remember that we love this nation and will heed Jefferson 's advice by offering a word of justice to any of our representatives who stray from the ideals set forth in that revolutionary document signed 231 years ago in Philadelphia .
Corey Saylor is an expert on political communications , media relations and anti-Islam prejudice in the United States with over two decades of experience .
The Wall Street Journal , New York Times , and Washington Post have sought his opinions .
He has appeared on outlets ranging from Fox News to CNN , the BBC , and Al Jazeera .

Wait … hold on .
Firstly , what are MyISAM and InnoDB ?
MyISAM and InnoDB are the two commonly used MySQL engines for database tables .
MyISAM is the default database engine for new tables created in MySQL 4 and 5 .
So , why would I want to use one over the other ?
Good question .
Perhaps it is best answered by going through the differences between the two database engines .
InnoDB is a more modern database engine than MyISAM , so some could say MyISAM is more reliable due to this , although there is very little evidence to support this .
However !
Even though InnoDB is newer , it has much better error recovery .
Corrupt tables are ( with all hope ) quickly restored to a functional state when the InnoDB engine is in use , however recovery of MyISAM powered tables is significantly slower and less reliable .
Corrupt MyISAM tables have been known to hold up the starts and restarts of the MySQL daemon .
InnoDB supports foreign keys natively , meaning you can enforce referential integrity at a database level rather than ensuring integrity at the application level .
Insertions and updates in InnoDB utilise row level locking , whilst MyISAM only supports full table locking .
This means that mass inserts and updates , MyISAM table access can become significantly slowed down as MySQL has to wait for the database engine to release the lock on the table caused by the insert or update .
InnoDB defaults to locking only the rows which are affected by the insert or update query , meaning the rest of the table can still be accessed without waiting for a lock release .
MyISAM supports full - text indexing .
This means MyISAM tables can have text fields indexed , which significantly increasing SELECT queries which contain text type fields .
The InnoDB table has no support for full - text indexing .
It looks like there is no clear winner ?
You ’re right .
Even though InnoDB is , as said , much more modern , both database engines still have their place in modern database structures .
In fact , your choice should be dependant on how you anticipate the table will be used .
So , when would I want to use an InnoDB table ?
If data integrity is important to you , multiple related InnoDB tables inherently take care of the data integrity between tables due to their support of foreign keys and enforcement of referencial integrity .
Additionally , if your table will be used for intensive write operations ( inserts and updates ) the InnoDB engine can handle this much better than MyISAM , due to row level locking .
InnoDB does fall down however in the fact that it does utilise more memory than MyISAM and as previously mentioned it lacks full text indexing .
InnoDB sounds great .
What need do I have for the MyISAM engine ?
You do n’t need to deal with referential integrity or building DBMS enforced relationships between tables with MyISAM , simply because the engine does not support it .
One could argue this makes MyISAM tables quicker to create and useful for smaller , quicker tasks as well as initial system prototyping .
MyISAM also tends to be faster at many operations , especially large scale SELECT queries returned many results .
For tables which will be used mainly for data retrieval with less in the way or inserts or updates , the performance of MyISAM may be a deciding factor .
As well as this generalised speed , the MyISAM engine supports full - text indexing , which would be useful for large tables that contain textual data that needs to be fully searched and / or sorted on a regularly basis .
Okay .
So , which would you suggest ?
Give me a quick summary .
InnoDB should be chosen where data is written reguarly and data integrity and security is critical .
MyISAM is the best choice for tables in which there is large amounts of data , especially textual data , that is read from significantly more than written to .
Thanks !
No problem . 🙂

We live in climate controlled houses that protect us from wind , weather , and predators ; we eat food that is safety tested and heavily regulated ; we wear fire retardant clothing that wicks away moisture to regulate our body temperature ; we have emergency services standing by to protect us from criminals , to rescue or resuscitate us , or to whisk us to a hospital ; we drive cars that are basically rolling safety cells ; and we have regulatory bodies and watchdog groups that constantly , round the clock , comb over every imaginable substance in the environment trying to figure out how to make things even safer .
Today ’s world is the safest it has ever been .
No previous generation of humans has ever had it so good .
How , then , did we ever get this far without wearing hazmat suits ?
Obviously Parents ’ depiction of the hazmat suits is a little tongue - in - cheek ( or so I hope , anyway ) — even the dog is wearing goggles ; so let ’s turn to the actual article to see what they really want us to think .
The article begins , keeping step with the popular formula , with a touching personal anecdote of someone whose life is shattered by toxins .
“ I was shocked to learn what my unborn baby and I were exposed to , ” says the frightened mom .
And what was this ?
It turns out the levels of BPA and DEP in her blood place her in the top 10 % .
BPA ( Bisphenol A ) and DEP ( Diethyl phthalate ) are well - publicized endocrine disruptors : they bind to a living cell ’s hormone receptors , thus taking the place of the body ’s natural hormone that would normally bind there .
Sounds scary !!
What effect will that have on her unborn baby ?
Well , none , in all probability .
Simply being in the top 10 % still places her far , far below dangerous levels .
As far as is known , nobody has ever been found to have suffered any harmful effects from environmental levels of endocrine disruptors .
The theory and the threat are certainly there : lab animal tests have proven the potential effects at high levels , and a few small studies find correlations ( other studies fail to replicate these results ) ; but so far , no victims .
It ’s still something to be concerned about , and this is why we regulate these compounds so closely , and such concerns are why the established safe level of BPA is currently being reduced even farther .
Endocrine disruptors are natural compounds that are found throughout the environment .
They always have been , they always will be ; even our natural - living forebears 100,000 years ago had to deal with endocrine disruptors .
To put it in perspective , you get more from a single serving of sunflower seeds , soybeans or alfalfa sprouts than you do from a lifetime use of water bottles containing BPA .
Yet articles like this one still feel the need to trumpet calls like “ Take Action for Tougher Chemical Laws ” , which is the name of a sidebar in the article advising you to write your Congressperson and to join a variety of Internet activism web sites .
The article ends with a section called “ Safer Swaps ” , suggesting a variety of natural products instead of more common developed products .
It says “ Whether you make one , some , or all [ of these recommended changes ] , your family ’s health will benefit — and fast . ”
This is an outright lie .
I challenge the editors to present even a single plausible example of a family whose health is currently proven to be impaired by any of the products in the list , and who make a dramatic , fast turnaround simply by switching to one of the alternatives offered .
This is irresponsible shock - jock journalism , plain and simple .
The article concludes with :
… We wait for chemical - policy reform and for scientists to understand the full scope of these daily yet preventable ( endocrine disruptor ) exposures .
There are so many things wrong with this sentence that it ’s hard to keep track .
It starts with the weasel - word “ chemical ” which pretends that some compounds are evil “ chemicals ” while natural alternatives are not .
That ’s wrong .
But let ’s pretend that there is a “ chemical policy ” that needs “ reform ” .
What does Parents magazine think the EPA and the FDA do all day ?
They regulate these things .
These policies are constantly being revised and improved , and guidelines constantly changing as our knowledge improves daily .
It is irresponsible and wrong to say that we need to write our Congresspeople to demand that somebody improve “ chemical policy ” .
( Go ahead , post your comment charging me with claiming that everything about government is perfect . )
And , note the obligatory jab at scientists , who have yet to “ understand the full scope ” of endocrine disruptors .
What , because they have not read this article ?
I would like to assure the readers of Parents that the scientists whose jobs are to study these things are much better informed than is the author of this article .
It is due to the work of scientists that we know about the risks of endocrine disruptors to begin with .
Finally , the author suggests that exposure is preventable .
As endocrine disruptors are found naturally throughout the environment , preventing such exposure is neither possible nor practical .
They are part of our world .
Manmade chemicals have certainly increased their levels measurably , and scientists and policymakers have been on the job ever since we learned about the problems .
The products we use and the food we eat is tightly regulated by science - driven policy to ensure that it ’s not a danger .
Consumers do not need to panic and rush out to replace everything they own or put on hazmat suits .
Is the world perfect ?
No .
Are you in grave danger from endocrine disruptors simply by living in our “ toxic world ” ?
No , and Parents ’ editors should know better than to promote such baseless sensationalism .
That is not serving parents .
Wow , on this one .
Enjoy ...

Smissmas , the magical time of year when men with big guns , questionable morality , and an unusual commitment to a two - tone color scheme are given all - new , all - festive ways to inflict violence upon one another , has once again come to Team Fortress 2 !.
This year 's magical event features a slew of new Festivizer weapons , 17 winter - themed community cosmetics , and — just in time for the holiday season — three new taunts .
Apart from the new stuff , the holiday update will also make some improvements to Casual matches and autobalancing .
At the end of Casual matches , players will now automatically be formed up into a new match with the same players and teams , and will be given the opportunity to vote on which map is played .
A new autobalancing system will encourage players to switch sides when necessary by offering bonus XP to volunteer turncoats .
And of course there will be stuff to buy in the Mann Co. Store , much of it on sale .
It does n't look to be the biggest Smissmas update of all time , but then again , as Valve says , giving people gifts can bite you in the ass .
Maybe you should just be thankful for what you get .

The Facist Farmer Strikes Again
Rand and I drove down to Portland a few weeks ago for his birthday .
It ’s a drive we do often , and one that ’s so familiar to me , one that so rarely changes , even our jokes have become recycled .
And believe me , the jokes are terrible .
When we pass the exit labeled “ Toledo / Vader ” it always goes something like …
“ That ’s where Darth ’s cousin from Ohio lives ! ”
What ?
I told you – the jokes are terrible .
And nothing ever changes , save for the messages on the billboard between exits 72 and 73 .
It will occasionally have a different message on it , though most of them lean heavily towards the right ( and well beyond it , into no man ’s land . ) .
We ’ve dubbed the gentleman who owned the billboard “ The Fascist Farmer ” .
Here ’s a brief analysis of the political spectrum and his location therein …
–
You can see a larger version of this graphic here .
–
For years , Rand and I braced ourselves for the billboard , delighting in its ever - changing , ever - conservative , occasionally enigmatic sayings .
Sometime around exit 68 we ’d grab the camera and anxiously wait .
For years , information on the Fascist Farmer was scarce .
I knew only that he had put the billboard up decades ago , and that he was getting progressively older .
Still , the messages changed semi-regularly , so we assumed that all was well with the Farmer .
And while I agreed with not a single idea expressed on his billboard , I still found it comforting to see .
It was like an old , hateful , crazy relative : they ’re mean and racist and homophobic , but you ’re stuck with them .
The fight you ’re about to have is a familiar one , and you ’re ready for it , long before they ’ve opened their mouths to unleash their particular brand of stupidity .
I only recently found out that the man behind the billboard is Alfred Hamilton , and that he passed away in 2004 .
Since then , one of his sons has taken up the role of updating the billboard .
I ’m sure the “ Where ’s the Birth Certificate ? ” tagline that was posted in response to rumors that Obama was n’t a U.S. citizen would have made dad proud .
I learned a little about Hamilton , too – it ’s hard for journalists to avoid editorializing about him , especially since his views were so pronounced … ( note : I do n’t consider myself a journalist , so I can editorialize all I want . ) .
In 2008 , the Seattlest blog wrote :
Like many of his politically like - minded brethren , Hamilton could n’t be troubled to bother actually going to war , despite the fact that later in life he had plenty to say about those who did n’t “ support ” the troops .
–
In 2004 , after Hamilton ’s death , The New York Times described the billboard thusly :
It has been a kind of grouchy chronicle of one man ’s one - sided take on things .
–
I learned that the billboard is in Chehalis , WA ( I had incorrectly assumed Centralia , since that ’s the next exit ) , that Hamilton was a tall man who left college without graduating to avoid fighting in WWII , and that , looking back on the entire legacy of his billboards , it ’s likely I ’ve never agreed with a single thought he ’s chosen to express ( he was particularly hateful towards homosexuals , putting up such taglines as “ AIDS turns fruits into vegetables ” and “ Evergreen State College – Home of Environmental Terrorists and Homos ? ” on his billboard ) .
And now he ’s gone .
But the damn billboard still waits for us , and every time we approach it , my camera is pulled out .
A few weeks ago , we were treated to these messages , presumably written by one of Hamilton ’s sons , and much more delicate in nature than what his dad composed …
–
–
The billboards are stupid , poorly constructed , and more than a little crazy , but they ’re part of my home .
I loathe them more than anything – and I love doing so .

We knew Google had the power to remotely remove Android apps -- Microsoft and Apple have backdoors into their mobile operating systems , too -- but it 's always a little disconcerting to see a kill switch used .
Such is the case today , as we 've just heard Google unleashed the hounds this week , siccing bits and bytes of remote deletion power on a pair of " practically useless " but still Terms of Service - infringing apps .
Curiously enough , Google admits that most who'd downloaded these programs had deleted them already , and that this " exercise " of the remote application removal feature was merely a cleanup operation .
Google says users will get a notification beamed to their phone if an app is removed , however -- so as Big Brother as that all sounds , at least the company 's being nice and transparent about the whole matter , eh ?
Update :
To be clear , the developers of the offending apps had already removed them from the Android Market , so this was technically a cleanup .
The only question is why Google would go out of its way to mop up an app that absolutely no one would miss .
[ Thanks , Matt ]
I understand that my chipmunk photography can seem unbelievable at times , and I ’m used to getting questions such as « How did you do that ? » and « Is it all Photoshop ? »
As this video will show , it ’s all happening right there in front of the camera .
I get no satisfaction out of a composited photo — the challenge for me is to capture the chipmunk engaged in a real and rather extraordinary situation .
And keep in mind that this is a wild chipmunk , not my pet .

LURKING BENEATH some of the biggest prescription drug scandals of our time is the specter of unflattering data that was known to pharmaceutical companies and could have revealed problems sooner had it been made public .
Now , an international federation of drug manufacturers , whose members include the industry ’s main players , has pledged to submit most clinical trial results for publication in peer - reviewed journals , whether the outcome is positive or negative .
This step should inject transparency into the now - murky process of data disclosure .
But it will work only if there is a concerted effort by companies , journals , and regulators to ensure that all trials are published , and in a timely manner .
Disclosure of unflattering data does n’t just provide a fuller picture of how useful and safe a drug might be in treating a given medical condition ; it also provides some guidance to researchers studying similar drugs and similar illnesses .
Until now , the industry ’s track record has left much to be desired .
Currently , companies seeking approval for new drugs must supply basic information about all their completed studies with ClinicalTrials.gov , a government website .
But fewer than half of the studies registered there are published in journals .
One - quarter to one - half of clinical trials for drugs that gained Food and Drug Administration approval remain unpublished several years later .
A much higher proportion of the unpublished studies turn out to have unfavorable results for the marketed treatment .
In line with the new policy , adopted in June by the trade associations for drug manufacturers in Europe , Japan , and the United States , companies have agreed to submit results from “ phase III ’’ clinical trials ( the most expensive kind , in which a drug is tested in large groups of people for safety and efficacy ) , as well as other smaller but medically relevant trials , to peer - reviewed journals .
The commitment is to submit studies within 12 months , and no later than 18 months , of a drug either being approved or discontinued from development .
The success of this plan depends on the willingness of peer - reviewed journals to seek and accept more submissions of the not - so - sexy type — studies showing no difference between treatments .
It is n’t unheard of : according to The New England Journal of Medicine , about 30 percent of the studies it published in 2008 and 2009 were negative .
If established journals are unable to publish all this new data , it ’s possible that new peer - reviewed forums will emerge , either in print or on the web .
Also , the FDA should take a stronger stance against companies that avoid publication of unflattering results .
It should be more vigilant , too : More than one study has found a surprising number of clinical trials whose results , as registered with ClinicalTrials.gov or as sent to the FDA , did not fully match what was later published in a journal ; the statistics looked better , or certain failures were omitted , in the published version .
The FDA should do a better job at policing companies ’ publication records , especially now that the industry has made a formal pledge to publish .

Deputy : " “ I am a non -believer , there is no God , there is no Jesus , there is no Satan , ” “ You must have a crush on me , man are you like a gay homosexual , you keep filming me , ” Goff said .
Comments on the video state that the harrassment from the Christian group towards concert ticket holders in line for Rob Zombie 's Mayhem was edited out .
Investigators of the incident hope to view a full copy of the video .
Updated : Sunday , 25 Jul 2010 * Reporter : Crystal GutierrezALBUQUERQUE
( KRQE ) - A Bernalillo County Sheriff 's deputy was caught on video erupting with personal comments while escorting a religious group away from a recent concert .
BCSO Deputy Jim Goff is a veteran of the department and years away from retirement .
The religious group was protesting outside a Rob Zombie concert on July 17th at the Pavilion .
Deputies were called to escort them out .
Goff was among them .
The religious group recorded the ordeal and put it on YouTube .
It started with Goff asking the protestors to leave the property but the group was not taking the orders well .
“ This is private property , leave you can go or you can go to jail , ” Goff said .
“ It ’s against my constitutional right , these people are free right here are fee to be out here ?
Why cant we , " said one protestor .
That 's when Goff got the crowd involved and asked what they wanted the group to do .
“ You guys , do you want them to stay or go , ” Goff said .
The protestors eventually started to leave as they continued preaching to the crowd and the deputies .
Goff responded .
“ There is only one way to heaven and that 's through Jesus Christ the Lord , ” said a protestor .
“ I am a non-believer , there is no God , there is no Jesus , there is no Satan , ” Goff said .
Through all the shouting , arguing and antagonizing the other deputies kept their cool .
Goff , however , had one more questionable comment .
“ You must have a crush on me , man are you like a gay homosexual , you keep filming me , ” Goff said .
Sheriff Manny Gonzales called the deputy 's comments very inappropriate .
“ I watched the video and it's an edited version .
We 're going to make a request from our internal affairs unit to get a full , a full copy so we can make the right responses , ” Gonzales said .
The video is on at least three different websites including YouTube , where more than 7,000 viewers have already seen it .
Gonzales said he will not comment on if Goff will be reprimanded until they conduct a complete investigation .
The sheriff also said he did not know about the concert confrontation until News 13 called and asked about it .
Some of the protestors were arrested .
uMap is a new App that allows uTorrent users to display all the peers they are connected to on Google Maps .
While the App provides a good visualization of global BitTorrent swarms , it also demonstrates that anonymity is hard to find for the regular torrenter .
In order for BitTorrent to work , clients need IP - addresses of people who are sharing the same files .
Aside from being linked to a customer account at an ISP , IP - addresses also provide data on the geographical location of its users .
Although not always 100 % accurate , IP - addresses can be linked to the physical location of users , or at least to the city they ’re in .
Quite a few BitTorrent users are probably already aware of this since most BitTorrent clients list the countries fellow downloaders come from .
One of the latest additions to uTorrent ’s App directory takes location awareness a step further .
Named uMap , the application displays all your peers on a Google Map , with the option to zoom into the street level .
With uMap you can literally check where your peers live .
The App has several ways to display the data .
File - sharers can be viewed by the BitTorrent client they use , the country they come from or the swarm they ’re currently participating in .
uMap was added to the App directory and can now be installed in the latest Griffin release of uTorrent .
uMaps in action
We ’ve tried the App , and although it ’s not really that useful , it is interesting to see the huge differences between various torrents and the sites one downloads from .
On most public torrents uTorrent and Vuze were the dominant clients , but on a private tracker quite a few seedboxes showed up , some packed together near a big datacenter .
For some novice users uMap might be an eye - opener , since it shows that BitTorrent transfers are far from anonymous .
Those who want to hide their real location from other BitTorrent users might want to consider renting a seedbox or signing up for an account at specialized privacy services such as VPNs .
An Islamic community center is clearly off limits but strippers are A - OK , apparently .
What could be more hots dogs and apple pie than lap dancing at Ground Zero ?
There are actually a couple of adult entertainment venues that show up on Google Maps if you search around the former site of the World Trade Center .
Internet reviewers seem to like New York Dolls best , due to its sexy , disproportionately Russian staff , mirrored stage and purportedly high - quality lap dances .
As yet , I have n’t heard anyone wonder why our political class is silent as the sex industry operates on sacred ground .
It would be a bizarre complaint :
It ’s Manhattan , where you can find anything mere blocks from a given location .
The closest strip club to Ground Zero happens to be two blocks away , a fact that has nothing to do with our reverence for the place where so many Americans were killed by terrorists .
As you ’ve probably noticed , it does n’t even make sense to call it The Ground Zero Strip Club .
But it makes no less sense than naming an Islamic community center “ The Ground Zero Mosque ” –as much of the media have done –because it ’s going to be located a couple blocks away .
Even worse , opponents of the project are opportunistically invoking the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks , even going so far as to appropriate their imagery .
“ Join the fight to kill The Ground Zero Mosque , ” intones a video advertisement released by a group called National Republican Trust PAC .
“ A mosque at Ground Zero must not stand .
The political class says nothing .
The politicians are doing nothing to stop it .
But we Americans will be heard . ”

There are 8 million stories in the naked city — and almost as many ways to break the law .
The 21 volume New York City Charter and Administrative Code , and the 14 volume Rules of the City of New York , go way beyond stealing and murder , encompassing an array of strange regulations .
Years ago , savvy officials began to repeal many of the city ’s most outdated laws , so New Yorkers are no longer arrested for fancy riding , charging more than 50 cents to move a piece of furniture or driving faster than 8 mph .
But old school has n’t disappeared entirely ; its still illegal for “ pullers - in , ” or street touts , to solicit and to run horses up and down the street .
And some older buildings still have private bylaws barring minorities from occupying units , and banning single women from entertaining men past a certain hour .
Put your lawyer on speed dial if you wish to own a mountain lion , grizzly bear , aardwolf , kinkajou or odd - toed ungulate — all illegal .
And what New Yorker can forget Rudy Giuliani ’s notorious on - the - air scolding of a ferret - fancying legal advocate : “. . .
This excessive concern with little weasels is a sickness . . . you need help ! ”
Rooster - owning is similarly verboten , at least in “ a built up portion of the city ” ( is there anything else ? ) .
And even the most fashion - forward can’t dye pet rabbits in the season ’s newest shade , or any color at all .
While the ends might justify the means , tampering with a horse ’s tail earns a year in jail .
But beekeeping is now legal , although the change comes too late for Kathleen Boyer of Flatbush , who just last year was stung by a $ 2,000 fine from the Department of Health .
Spitting on New York streets and sidewalks is illegal , as is littering them with dead animals and offal .
Those itching to grow poison ivy will brush up against the Department of Health , as will residents beating their dirty carpets onto city sidewalks .
But the placement of a gala “ red carpet ” on a sidewalk is strongly recommended , maybe because of required red-carpet licensing fees of up to $ 24,000 .
Even the most obscure laws can sometimes become political footballs , as City Hall interns scramble to provide legal cover for the latest lifestyle crackdown .
Mayor Giuliani padlocked nightclubs by requiring a cabaret license for establishments where three or more people were found dancing , a law still on the books despite a Million Mambo March in protest ; Mayor Bloomberg is reconsidering .
Politicians themselves are n’t exempt from odd laws — “ Candidate Statement ” rules outlaw profanity , “ obscene hand gestures ” and , thankfully , candidate nudity .
Tourist favorite three - card monte is now prohibited , a century after Oliver Utley , an out - of - town farmer , was swindled out of $ 2,000 by card sharpers .
But the 2010 Frommer ’s Travel Guide still puts the pastime on its list of things not to do in New York City , along with New Year ’s Eve in Times Square and rickshaw rides .
And think twice if you get hustled and then decide to make a citizen ’s arrest ; the use of handcuffs or leg - irons is prohibited to all but law enforcement types .
Landlord - tenant laws continue to prohibit more than three unrelated people from living in the same apartment , a statute still used by owners trying to evict huddled masses of cash - strapped newcomers .
And those hipster butchers in Williamsburg can keep cattle and swine in their back yards , as long as they ’re securely fenced .
Butchers must grind chopped meat in plain view , and those that sell hamburger with more than 30 % fat face 30 days in the slammer .
Brighton Beach favorite kopchonka was recently banned — botulism or whatever .
But storekeepers can still sell horsemeat , if anyone wants to buy it .
Using poisonous cyanide to clean food utensils is understandably frowned upon .
Swill milk laced with plaster and chalk was banned in the 1870s , and the milk we drink today can’t contain blood , puss , manure or even vermin .
But Title 24 does allow us to drink chocolate milk , and we are even permitted to slurp our milk through a straw , as long as the straw comes individually wrapped .
Law - abiding citizens may also enjoy malted milk , provided “ full enzymatic action ” is secured , and “ frozen desserts ” are dispensed by “ mobile frozen dessert units , ” otherwise known as ice cream trucks .
Even our leisurely pursuits carry worrisome legal risks .
Tongue - splitting , the “ cutting of a person ’s tongue into two or more parts ” can only be performed by doctors or dentists .
Parachuting is banned except for those in danger or ordered to do so .
Less adventuresome New Yorkers can relax by taking a shvitz , though city regulations seem less than comforting , allowing steam rooms to reach 120 degrees and saunas 194 .
No wonder signs saying , “ Use of steam room or sauna should not exceed 30 minutes ” are mandatory .
New York does have an awful lot of rules , and if history holds true , plenty more are in the works .
But unique people need unique laws .
Leave the kinkajou and the kopchonka to the Californians .
Nathan Belofsky is the author of “ The Book of Strange and Curious Legal Oddities ” ( Penguin ) , out this week .
From now until 2 November , the Republican party will be the party of unemployment .
The logic is straightforward : the more people who are unemployed on election day , the better the prospects for Republicans in the fall election .
They expect , with good cause , that voters will hold the Democrats responsible for the state of the economy .
Therefore , anything that the Republicans can do to make the economy worse between now and then will help their election prospects .
While it may be bad taste to accuse a major national political party of deliberately wanting to throw people out of jobs , there is no other plausible explanation for the Republicans ' behaviour .
They have balked at supporting nearly every bill that had any serious hope of creating or keeping jobs , most recently filibustering on bills that provided aid to state and local governments and extending unemployment benefits .
The result of the Republicans ' actions , unless they are reversed quickly , is that hundreds of thousands more workers will be thrown out of work by the mid-terms .
The story is straightforward .
Nearly every state and local government across the country is looking at large budget shortfalls for their 2011 fiscal years , most of which begin on 1 July 2010 .
Since they are generally required by state constitutions or local charters to balance their budgets , they will have no choice except to raise taxes and / or make large cutbacks and lay off workers to bring spending and revenue into line .
State and local governments have cut their workforce by an average of 65,000 a month over the last three months .
Without substantial aid from the federal government , this pace is likely to accelerate .
The Republican agenda in blocking aid to the states may add another 300,000 people to the unemployment rolls by early November .
The blocking of extended unemployment benefits promises similar dividends .
As Paul Krugman rightly notes this week , unemployment benefits are not just about providing income support to those who are out of work , they also provide a boost to the economy .
Since unemployed workers generally have little other than their benefits to support themselves , this is money that will almost immediately be spent .
The benefits paid to workers are income to food stores and other retail outlets .
Unemployment insurance provides the sort of boost to demand that the economy desperately needs .
That is why neutral parties such as the congressional budget office or economist Mark Zandi , a top adviser to John McCain 's presidential bid , always list unemployment benefits as one of the best forms of stimulus .
Republicans give two reasons for opposing benefits .
First , they claim that benefits discourage people from working .
Second , they object that the Democrats ' proposal will add to the national debt .
On the first point there is a considerable amount of economic research .
Most indicates that in periods when the economy is operating near its capacity , more generous benefits may modestly increase the unemployment rate .
However , they are less likely to have that effect now .
The reason is simple : the economy does not have enough jobs .
The latest data from the labour department shows that there are five unemployed workers for every job opening .
In this context , unemployment benefits may give some workers the option to remain unemployed longer to find a job that better fits their skills , but they are unlikely to affect the total number of unemployed .
In other words , a $ 300 weekly unemployment cheque may allow an experienced teacher the luxury of looking for another teaching job , rather than being forced to grab a job at Wal - Mart .
However , if the teacher took the job at Wal - Mart , then this would simply displace a recent high - school graduate who has no other job opportunities .
That might be a great turn of events in Republican - econ land , but it does not reduce the overall unemployment rate , nor does it benefit the overall economy in any obvious way .
The other argument the Republicans give is that these bills would add to the national debt .
For example , the latest extension of unemployment benefits would have added $ 22bn to the debt by the end of 2011 .
This means that the debt would be $ 9,807,000,000 instead of $ 9,785,000,000 at the end of fiscal 2011 , an increase of the debt - to - GDP ratio from 65.3 % to 65.4 % .
It is possible that Congressional Republicans , who were willing to vote for hundreds of billions of dollars of war expenditures without paying for them , or trillions of dollars of tax cuts without paying for them , are actually concerned about this sort of increase in the national debt .
It is possible that this is true , but not very plausible .
The more likely explanation is that the Republicans want to block anything that can boost the economy and create jobs .
Throwing people out of work may not be pretty , but politics was never pretty , and it is getting less so by the day .
Truthfully it does n't feel like the Islanders ' magical 92 - 93 playoff run was nearly 20 years ago .
It was the first season I started watching the Islanders and probably the most fun I had watching them ' till this last season .
It was somewhat amazing how quickly the team was dismantled following this run .
In 93 - 94 the Isles just barely made the playoffs , beating out the first year expansion Florida Panthers by a point for the right to be destroyed by the Rangers .
In the strike - shortened season the Islanders finished ahead of only the Ottawa Senators .
To highlight how quickly and badly the team had fallen , they managed only 7 more wins in 95 - 96 than they did during the strike shortened year .
The two biggest moves did n't even involve anyone on the ice : Bill Torrey was the obvious architect of the ' 93 team despite being forced out just the year before .
Add Al Arbour 's retirement following the 93-94 season and the Islanders lost two Hall of Famers .
It is n't surprising that Torrey turned the Panthers into a Cup finalist in only three years , as he grabbed some character players the Islanders could n't protect .
You really can't say anything about Arbour that has n't been said before .
After he left , the Islanders Head Coaching position became a constant rotating door , with no one lasting more then two years until Scott Gordon .
But when it comes to the on ice players , it 's amazing how quickly players from the Islanders playoff run were scattered throughout the league .
For this list I 'm mainly sticking to players who produced for the Islanders ' 93 run and played a good amount of the playoff games .
Glenn Healy :
The hero of the run , he quickly became a dagger in the heart of Islander fans as he became the long - term backup to Mike Richter for the Rangers .
An infamously repeated story says after the Lightning claimed him in the expansion draft they were prepared to trade him back to the Islanders , but GM Maloney kept Lightning GM Esposito on hold for so long he became enraged and dealt him to the Rangers .
Ray Ferraro :
If anyone took the ball and ran with it in the ' 93 playoffs it was the big ball of hate .
Following a season of 46 GP and 27 Points , Ferraro put up 20 points in 18 playoff games .
including the assist on the series - winning David Volek goal in Game 7 .
He left as a free agent in ' 95 , signing with the New York Rangers .
Steve Thomas :
He found himself traded on the eve of the ' 95 season in a three - way deal that sent Wendel Clark to the Islanders .
During his four seasons on the Island he had three 70 + point seasons , with the exception being the strike shortened year .
During the ' 93 playoff run he put up 17 points in 18 games .
Derek King : A former first round pick , King had a solid career as an Islander .
King put up 14 points in 18 playoff games in ' 93 , but went on a bit of a career slump in '95 and 95 - 96 .
In his contract year of 96 - 97 he put up 50 points and was dealt for a 7th round pick .
Pierre Turgeon :
Since we all know this one , the short explanation is he was dealt in April of ' 95 for an eternally disgruntled Kirk Muller .
Benoit Hogue :
In 3 full seasons with the Isles Benoit put up 75 , 75 and 69 points .
He struggled during the strike shortened season and was traded in April of ' 95 for prospect Eric Fichaud .
Although he had some good seasons following the trade , he never did return to his Islanders form .
Vladimir Malakhov :
The former 10th - round pick was traded away in the Turgeon deal .
Although his two best seasons were with the Islanders , he was still a solid defenseman for the Canadians and Rangers in his later years .
Patrick Flatley :
The long serving Islanders captain was bought out of his contract following the 95 - 96 season .
His veteran leadership was sorely missed on a young Islanders team .
To make matters worse , he signed with the Rangers for his final NHL season .
Flatley played 245 games as Islander captain ; since he left only Micheal Peca has come close playing 222 games as captain .
Tom Fitzgerald :
This ended up being Fitzgerald 's one full season on the Island .
He was claimed in the expansion draft by the Panthers .
Ironically Fitzgerald was traded to the Avalanche a few years later for Mark Parrish .
It 's the Islanders circle of life .
Uwe Krupp :
The lovable defenseman was traded during the ' 94 draft in order for Maloney to move up and draft Brett Lindros ( we also got Ron Sutter , who lasted 27 games ) .
Although a bit older , he put together some solid seasons for the Avs and scored the Cup - winning goal in overtime in 95 - 96 .
Darius Kasparaitis :
One of the guys without whom the Islanders probably lose Game 7 against the Pens , Kaspar 's huge hits are legendary .
In November of '96 he was traded to those same Penguins for Bryan Smolinski .
Yet another player who finished his years playing for the Rangers .
David Volek :
The hero of Game 7 , a herniated disc the following year forced him to retire .
He was another Round Ten diamond in the rough on the team .
Travis Green : Green went from being either the third or fourth line center up to playing major minutes on the second line during the series .
He did alright and had the best years of his career on the Island .
Ended up being traded for scraps in Feb , of ' 98 .
Rich Pilon :
If you ever watch the video of Dale Hunter 's cheap shot , Pilon is the human cannonball that comes flying into the screen after the hit .
Although he lasted with the Islanders till ' 99 he was always injured and if memory serves me right he was waived to make room for Eric Cairns .
The Rangers claimed him off of waivers .
Mick Vukota :
The Islanders career leader in Penalty Minutes , he found his one - dimensional play less popular following the change in GM .
He played 96 - 97 on the Isles but only for 17 games .
He played with the Lightning and the Habs for a season before playing in the IHL and then retiring .
Mark Fitzpatrick : A solid backup , he actually split starts during the season with Healy .
The Islanders tried to replace Healy and sent Fitzpatrick to the Nordiques for Hextall .
He was then picked in the expansion draft by the Panthers .
There 's two interesting trends here .
First that the Rangers appeared to at one point or another signed almost every player who was part of the ' 93 Playoff run .
Secondly , by the time the Islanders were going into the 95 - 96 season almost every important piece from the 1993 playoff run was gone .
It 's no surprise then that the 95 - 96 team was one of the all - time worst Islanders teams .
They gave up the 3rd most goals against in team history , had the third worst point total and the third highest amount of losses .
A motorcycle laden with explosives detonated Sunday at a market in Helmand Province , killing five people - including four children - and injuring eight others , NATO 's International Security Assistance Force said Saturday .
An ISAF statement said a second explosive device discovered on a donkey in the area was successfully defused .
There was no way to independently verify the information .
U.S. Gen. David Petraeus , who assumed command of the Afghanistan mission on Sunday , accused insurgents of " killing and maiming innocent Afghan civilians on a daily basis . "
" No tactic is beneath the insurgents ; they repeatedly kill innocent civilians , and they frequently seek to create situations that will result in injury to Afghan citizens , " Petraeus said in the statement .
Also Sunday , ISAF reported two members of the coalition military force died in separate incidents in southern Afghanistan .
One soldier was killed in a bomb explosion Sunday , and another died while on combat patrol on Thursday , according to an ISAF statement .
No further details were available .
`
In 1998 , yielding to the international pressure , the Sudanese government allowed good aid to be distributed to the south .
British photojournalist Tom Stoddart travelled with Medicins Sans Frontieres ( MSF ) to a camp in Ajiep , where more than 100 people were dying every day .
There he took the above photo of a crippled boy who had queued hours for food , only to find it robbed away from him by a fit man who strides confidently away .
Stoddart received overwhelming criticism for his image , people demanding why he did not intervene .
He responded , “ I am a photographer , not a policeman or an aid worker .
All I can do is try to tell the truth as I see it with my camera . ”
However , Stoddart requested that the papers that print his Sudan photos run the credit card hotlines of aid agencies next to the photos .
On the day the above photo appeared in the Guardian , MSF had 700 calls and £ 40,000 was pledged .
The Daily Express raised £ 500,000 .
Le Figaro ran 10 pages of his pictures , Stern magazine nine pages .
On a deeper level , the photo is a symbol of Africa ’s continuing problem — the big man with the stick rules .
Large amount of food aid disappears from the camps in much needed areas and appears for sale in the market places in neighboring countries .
Not to be anecdotal but I once volunteered in an African country that should remain nameless .
Food and medical aid that Western governments sent there were regularly pilfered by corrupt bureaucrats and sometimes aid is withheld or rediverted to areas that do n’t need them because the governments there like to use foreign aid as a bargaining chip to subdue / cleanse tribes and ethnicities they do n’t like .
Yet , Western governments and aid agencies continue sending aid because sometimes getting a little aid to affected areas is better than cutting off aid .
I put some links to donation webpages of some international organization helping aid efforts in Africa .

VANCOUVER , Canada –
In the video below , Richard Trumka , president of the AFL - CIO , addresses the International Trade Union Confederation ’s second world congress , June 21 here in Vancouver , Canada .
Trumka ’s speech summarizes the overwhelming majority of positions expressed during the congress by trade unionists from around the world .
Delegate after delegate called for a new world economic order and demanded national and international stock transaction taxes to “ make the financial institutions pay to clean up the mess their greed created . ”
Much attention was given to rising inequality heightened by the global economic crisis .
Delegates called for united international efforts to organize workers in the “ informal ” or “ underground ” economies .
Many called for special efforts to organize women and young workers , disproportionately the victims of the informal economy .
Delegates also strongly rejected corporate and government voices calling for austerity programs that cut jobs , wages , and social programs for workers in the name of “ balanced budgets . ”
Instead they called for new massive public investments in emerging green industries and infrastructure projects that benefit people and put money in circulation to create jobs .
And they did n’t just talk .
Delegates from the European Union countries developed plans for EU - wide protests on September 29 that will include general strike action in Spain and other countries .
The ITUC elected its first woman general secretary , Sharan Burrow .
Burrow was elected president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions ( ACTU ) in 2000 , a post she will now give up to devote full time to the ITUC .

Welcome to the era of the algorithm as editor .
For as long as hot lead has been used to make metal type , the model for generating news has been top - down : editors determined what information was important and then shared it with the masses .
But with the advent of technology that allows media companies to identify what kind of content readers want , that model is becoming inverted .
The latest and perhaps broadest effort yet in democratizing the news is under way at Yahoo , which on Tuesday will introduce a news blog that will rely on search queries to help guide its reporting and writing on national affairs , politics and the media .
Search - generated content has been growing on the Internet , linked to the success of companies like Associated Content , which Yahoo recently bought , and Demand Media , which has used freelance writers to create an online library of more than a million instructional articles .
YouTube previously limited its non-partners to just 10 minutes or under for video uploading , but now the Google - owned video service has increased that time to 15 minutes , giving users more control over the content they upload .
Advertising
The ten -minute cap before was instituted in large part due to copyright concerns–YouTube and Google did n’t want users to upload a full TV show or movie and infringe upon the copyright holder ’s rights to the film , but now that YouTube has implemented better safeguards , the company is moving the maximum upload length to 15 minutes .
According to YouTube product manager Jshua Siegel , the Content ID system implemented helps identify content that may be protected : “ Now , all of the major U.S. movie studios , music labels and over 1,000 other global partners use Content ID to manage their content on YouTube . ”
To promote the change , YouTube is asking users to step into the limelight with their new - found 15 minutes of fame by creating a video of themselves .
Siegel says , “ Imagine that this video is all the world will ever know about you : what would you want to communicate ?
What will be the enduring stamp you ’ve left on us all ? ”
Users should upload their videos by August 4 with the tag “ yt15 minutes . ”
Winning videos will be featured on the front page .
As to past video uploads that had received error messages saying that the videos were too long , Siegel advises users to delete those videos from their account page and re-upload them .

I 'm not too thrilled about day vs tasteless I hope they got better since the HDH because their games were painful to watch .
The commentator who said it was ' strategic ' by dropping like 6 rax at once was pretty funny .
He was behind on his macro ... nothing strategic about that .
I 'll still watch though since nothing else to do .
:D

Hey there , time traveller !
This article was published 9/6/2010 ( 3766 days ago ) , so information in it may no longer be current .
If the City of Winnipeg is still looking for rapid transit options , it might want to check its own backyard .
New Flyer Industries , the largest heavy - duty urban bus maker in North America , said a home - grown solution is available but it's only going to fly if some long - held stereotypes can be destroyed in the process .
JANEK LOWE / WINNIPEG FREE PRESS Paul Smith , executive vice - president of New Flyer Industries , with one of their buses destined for Miami .
" The public 's perception of transit is a dirty , noisy , rattling bus , " said Paul Soubry , CEO of New Flyer , which is headquartered in Transcona .
" Our latest offering , which we 've been delivering for a few years to North American customers , is a very different bus .
It 's got Wi -Fi , it 's more comfortable , it 's fuel - efficient with lots of natural light and it has ease of entrance and accessibility for disabled people . "
Bus rapid transit , or BRT , also has the flexibility to adapt and add routes with a fraction of the infrastructure costs of light rail transit ( LRT ) , he said .
Soubry said BRT has proven to be a very cost - effective means of moving people around in mid-sized to large cities , including Halifax , Ottawa , Brampton and Cleveland .
" If you invest in the assets and make it complementary to the existing bus fleet , ( BRT ) can be a very progressive way for a city to get people out of cars and into public transit , " he said .
It did n't take long to twist the arms of Cleveland residents .
The Ohio city spent about $ 200 million -- including $ 950,000 each for 21 buses -- on its own BRT , which went live in the fall of 2008 .
( All figures are in U.S. dollars . )
Within the first 12 months , ridership was up 48 per cent .
Its system includes exclusive BRT lanes , buses with doors on both sides , cameras at the rear and sides and bus stops on the far side of traffic lights .
There 's even a feature called " signal prioritization , " which keeps green lights lit longer so buses can get through the intersection , shortening commute times .
The Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority even found a pair of hospitals willing to pay for the naming rights of the BRT corridor -- dubbed the HealthLine -- which will provide $ 250,000 per year over 25 years to city coffers .
Sponsors of each of the 26 stations shell out another $ 30,000 annually .
In total , between $ 15 million and $ 18 million will be collected and reinvested back in the line by 2033 .
Joe Calabrese , general manager of GCRTA , said it looked at every possible people - moving option and went with the bus route .
" The BRT will cost one - third to build and one - third to operate as LRT .
The one question we heard over and over again was , ' Will development happen around the stations ? '
The answer is yes , it will , without any doubt .
We 've seen much more development around our BRT than with any of our light or heavy rail systems , " he said .
Calabrese said more than $ 4 billion of new development along the corridor , including retail , housing and factories , has sprung up or is in the planning stages .
A City of Winnipeg spokeswoman confirmed a meeting has taken place between New Flyer executives and city officials .
New Flyer provided information on its product offering , some perspective on the competitiveness of BRT versus LRT and invited Glen Laubenstein , the city 's chief administrative officer , to come to its plant and check them out .
Laubenstein accepted .
" In terms of any decisions being made or whether we 're looking at going further and signing on with New Flyer , it 's all premature , " city spokeswoman Michelle Bailey said .
Paul Smith , New Flyer 's executive vice - president of sales , said it can also provide different propulsion systems , such as hybrid vehicles or electric trolleys .
The latter existed for many years in Winnipeg until the infrastructure was torn out in the 1960s .
" We can put electronic trolley service back in with rubber wheel transit .
You do n't need steel wheels to put that in but there are a lot of infrastructure and maintenance costs with it , " he said .

BARRIE , Ont. - Police say a woman went to a Barrie , Ont. , business to apply for a job over the weekend wearing clothes she 'd stolen from the same place just the day before .
The woman allegedly stole from the store for a second day in a row when moments after dropping - off her resume with the manager on Saturday , she was seen taking several more items .
Police say the woman then left the premises with the stolen goods but was easily tracked down using the resume she 'd left behind .
The 40 - year - old Barrie woman has been charged with two counts of theft under $ 5,000 .
Police say the woman is unlikely to get a job interview any time soon .

" this was not a typical case , in which suspension and notification would be the norm .
This was a critical matter brought to our attention by law enforcement officials .
We had to immediately remove the server . "
" Simply put :
We cannot give him his data nor can we provide any other details .
By stating this , most would recognize that something serious is afoot . "
TorrentFreak is reporting that a company , Blogetery , that hosted about 73,000 blogs , has been shut down by US authorities .
Details are , admittedly , sketchy at this point , but the entire site has been taken down , and the company 's ISP claims that they had to terminate the account immediately due to the " request of law enforcement officials , due to material hosted on the server . "
The ISP also claimed : That seems odd .
If there was problematic content from some users , why not just take down that content or suspend those users .
Taking down all 73,000 blogs seems ... excessive .
Torrent Freak speculates that this may be a part of the recent Homeland Security efforts to shut down file sharing site , and points to some evidence that there were at least a few Blogetery blogs that shared copyrighted works .
However , no one 's talking , and the ISP seems spooked , saying that it's " serious " : I 'm still wondering what could be so serious that the specific problems could n't be pinpointed ?
Taking down 73,000 blogs with no notice seems like overkill , no matter what the actual issue turns out to be .

CASH - flow issues ?
Global recession getting you down ?
No budget , no problem – these destinations will blow your mind without breaking the bank .
INDIA
India has been known as a cheap destination for ages .
But what you might not realise is that there is a lot more to India than just Bollywood films , elephant rides and crazy traffic .
Forget just checking out the Taj – what about a trip to the north ?
Go climbing in Ladakh , where the peaks are huge and the air is cool .
Or what about surfing in Port Blair – it ’s in the middle of the Bay of Bengal and still cheap as chips .
This classic shoestring destination is still ripe for adventure .
Port Blair ’s cheapest accommodation is the Youth Hostel on Aberdeen Bazaar .
Dorm stay is INR50 ( $ 1.25 ) per night .
NEPAL
The home of Mt Everest and the Sherpa people has long been on the radar of the budget traveller .
After decades in the limelight Nepal still remains one of the best budget destinations around .
The trekking is awesome and the fractional cost of being in the country means that the treks can go on and on .
Many a seasoned traveller has Nepal at the top of their best - of list – and the best part is , it wo n’t cost a fortune to add it to yours .
INDONESIA
Indonesia has had a bad run of terrible press over the past few years .
Between bombings and other strife it ’s fallen off the to - do lists of many tourists .
Their loss is our gain : the pristine beaches are still the drawcard and you can experience the same dirt - cheap living that has always been on offer .
If you ’re keen to surf or lie on the beach you ’re all set to have an adventure for peanuts .
As long as you steer clear of tourist - trap resorts , you ’ll struggle to spend more than $ 23.50 a day .
Nourish your inner cheapskate and buy souvenirs away from the tourist areas ; head to the central market in Denpasar or Ubud ’s Pasar Sukowati .
IRAN
Iran ?
The same Iran that ’s in the ‘ Axis of Evil ’ ?
Forget that propaganda and get stuck into a country that meets all the requirements .
For a start it ’s cheap : for $ 25 a day you can live it up in a midrange hotel and eat your heart out .
What you wo n’t find is a glut of other travellers and the hindrance of mass tourism .
You ’ll see the wonders of the ancient world without a tour group in sight .
In fact this is a country that is crying out for visitors , and is deserving of them – the locals are unbelievably welcoming to travellers .
Arrive in January for the ancient Persian midwinter festival of Sadeh , which celebrates the creation of fire .
POLAND
Eastern Europe used to be dirt cheap back in the good old days of the Cold War .
Now that peace has broken out , costs are on the up .
Poland , though , is still at the inexpensive end : a daily budget of $ 29 will easily get you around the country .
Poland is a nation that ’s been run over so many times by invading forces that it ’s become bulletproof .
Now this EU member is on the rise , so get in quick before the prices go up for good .
Rural towns are picturesque and cheap to visit ; tiny towns like Krasnystaw in the Lubelskie region are a miser ’s wonderland .
LAOS
Southeast Asia is the promised land of cheap travel – for years Thailand was the de facto destination for the cash poor but these days travellers are looking beyond the old standards for more intrepid el- cheapo places to check out .
Enter Laos .
It may not have the beaches of Thailand or the notoriety of Vietnam but it ’s got what counts .
For just $ 18 a day you will get all you need , leaving you free to get out among the untouched river valleys and chilled - out microvillages along the Mekong River .
The cheapest way to get there is to enter via boat from Chiang Khong , Thailand .
The boat ride costs around $ 0.60 ; the visa , payable in Laos , should be around $ 35 .
SUDAN

Sudan is in the news for all the wrong reasons – what people should know about is the locals ’ pride in welcoming guests and the amazing things that can be seen around the country .

At Least Motorola Admits It
I 've written before about the software freedom issues inherent with Android / Linux .
Summarized shortly : the software freedom community is fortunate that Google released so much code under Free Software licenses , but since most of the code in the system is Apache - 2.0 licensed , we 're going to see a lot of proprietarized , non-user - upgradable versions .
In fact , there 's no Android / Linux system that 's fully Free Software yet .
( That 's why Aaron Williamson and I try to keep the Replicant project going .
We 've focused on the HTC Dream and the NexusOne , since they are the mobile devices closest to working with only Free Software installed , and because they allow the users to put their own firmware on the device . )
I was therefore intrigued to discover last night ( via mtrausch ) a February blog post by Lori Fraleigh of Motorola , wherein Fraleigh clarifies Motorola 's opposition to software freedom for its Android / Linux users :
We [ Motorola ] understand there is a community of developers interested in … Android system development …
For these developers , we highly recommend obtaining either a Google ADP1 developer phone or a Nexus One …
At this time , Motorola Android - based handsets are intended for use by consumers .
I appreciate the fact that Fraleigh and Motorola are honest in their disdain for software developers .
Unlike Apple — who tries to hide how developer - unfriendly its mobile platform is — Motorola readily admits that they seek to leave developers as helpless as possible , refusing to share the necessary tools that developers need to upgrade devices and to improve themselves , their community , and their software .
Companies like Motorola and Apple both seek to squelch the healthy hacker tendency to make technology better for everyone .
Now that I 've seen Fraleigh 's old blog post , I can at least give Motorola credit for full honesty about these motives .
I do , however , find the implication of Fraleigh 's words revolting .
People who buy the devices , in Motorola 's view , do n't deserve the right to improve their technology .
By contrast , I believe that software freedom should be universal and that no one need be a “ mere consumer ” of technology .
I believe that every technology user is a potential developer who might have something to contribute but obviously cannot if that user is n't given the tools to do so .
Sadly , it seems , Motorola believes the general public has nothing useful to contribute , so the public should n't even be given the chance .
But , this attitude is always true for proprietary software companies , so there are actually no revelations on that point .
Of more interest is how Motorola was able to do this , given that Android / Linux ( at least most of it ) is Free Software .
Motorola 's ability to take these actions is a consequence of a few licensing issues .
First , most of the Android system is under the Apache - 2.0 license ( or , in some cases , an even more permissive license ) .
These licenses allow Motorola to make proprietary versions of what Google released and sell it without source code nor the ability for users to install modified versions .
That license decision is lamentable ( but expected , given Google 's goals for Android ) .
The even more lamentable licensing issue here is regarding Linux 's license , the GPL v2 .
Specifically , Fraleigh 's post claims :
The use of open source software , such as the Linux kernel … in a consumer device does not require the handset running such software to be open for re-flashing .
We comply with the licenses , including GPLv2 .
I should note that , other than Fraleigh 's assertion quoted above , I have no knowledge one way or another if Motorola is compliant with GPL v2 on its Android / Linux phones .
I do n't own one , have no plans to buy one , and therefore I 'm not in receipt of an offer for source regarding the devices .
I 've also received no reports from anyone regarding possible non-compliance .
In fact , I 'd love to confirm their compliance : please get in touch if you have a Motorola Android / Linux phone and attempted to install a newly compiled executable of Linux onto your phone .
I 'm specifically interested in the installation issue because GPL v2 requires that any binary distribution of Linux ( such as one on telephone hardware ) include both the source code itself and the scripts to control compilation and installation of the executable .
So , if Motorola wrote any helper programs or other software that installs Linux onto the phones , then such software , under GPLv2 , is a required part of the complete and corresponding source code of Linux and must be distributed to each buyer of a Motorola Android / Linux phone .
If you 're surprised by that last paragraph , you 're probably not alone .
I find that many are confused regarding this GPL v2 nuance .
I believe the confusion stems from discussions during the GPLv3 process about this specific requirement .
GPLv3 does indeed expand the requirement for the scripts to control compilation and installation of the executable into the concept of Installation Information .
Furthermore , GPLv3's Installation Information is much more expansive than merely requiring helper software programs and the like .
GPLv3's Installation Information includes any material , such as an authorization key , that is necessary for installation of a modified version onto the device .
However , merely because GPLv3 expanded installation information requirements does not lessen GPLv2's requirement of such .
In fact , in my reading of GPL v2 in comparison to GPLv3 , the only effective difference between the two on this point relates to cryptographic device lock - down .
I do admit that under GPL v2 , if you give all the required installation scripts , you could still use cryptography to prevent those scripts from functioning without an authorization key .
Some vendors do this , and that 's precisely why GPLv3 is written the way that it is : we 'd observed such lock - down occurring in the field , and identified that behavior as a bug in GPL v2 that is now closed with GPLv3 .
However , because of all that hype about GPLv3's new Installation Information definition , many simply forgot that the GPL v2 is n't silent on the issue .
In other words , GPLv3's verbosity on the subject led people to minimize the important existing requirements of GPL v2 regarding installation information .
As regular readers of this blog know , I 've spent much of my time for the last 12 years doing GPL enforcement .
Quite often , I must remind violators that GPL v2 does indeed require the scripts to control compilation and installation of the executable , and that candidate source code releases missing the scripts remain in violation of GPLv2 .
I sincerely hope that Android / Linux redistributors have n't forgotten this .
I have one final and important point to make regarding Motorola 's February statement : I 've often mentioned that the mobile industry 's opposition to GPLv3 and to user - upgradable devices is for their own reasons , and nothing to do with regulators or other outside entities preventing them from releasing such software .
In their blog post , Motorola tells us quite clearly that the community of developers interested in … experimenting with Android system development and re-flashing phones … [ should obtain ] either a Google ADP1 developer phone or a Nexus One , both of which are intended for these purposes .
In other words , Motorola tacitly admits that it 's completely legal and reasonable for the community to obtain such telephones , and that , in fact , Google sells such devices .
Motorola was not required to put lock - down restrictions in place , rather they made a choice to prohibit users in this way .
On this point , Google chose to treat its users with respect , allowing them to install modified versions .
Motorola , by contrast , chose to make Android / Linux as close to Apple 's iPhone as they could get away with legally .
So , the next time a mobile company tries to tell you that they just can't abide by GPLv3 because some third party ( the FCC is their frequent scapegoat ) prohibits them , you should call them on their FUD .
Point out that Google sells phones on the open market that provide all Installation Information that GPL v3 might require .
( In other words , even if Linux were GPLv3'd , Android / Linux on the NexusOne and HTC Dream would be a GPLv3 - compliant distribution . )
Meanwhile , at least one such company , Motorola , has admitted their solitary reason for avoiding GPL v3 : the company just does n't believe users deserve the right to install improved versions of their software .
At least they admit their contempt for their customers .
Update ( same day ) : jwildeboer pointed me to a few posts in the custom ROM and jailbreaking communities about their concerns about Motorola 's new offering , the Droid - X . Some commentors there point out that eventually , most phones get jailbroken or otherwise allow user control .
However , the key point of the CrunchGear User Manifesto is a clear and good one : no company or person has the right to tell you that you may not do what you like with your own property .
This is a point akin and perhaps essential to software freedom .
It does n't really matter if you can figure out to how to hack a device ; what 's important is that you not give your money to the company that prohibits such hacking .
For goodness sake , people , why do n't we all use ADP1's and NexusOne 's and be done with this ?
Updated ( 2010-07-17 ) :
It appears that cryptographic lock down on the Droid - X is confirmed ( thanks to rao for the link ) .
I hope everyone will boycott all Motorola devices because of this , especially given that there are Android / Linux devices on the market that are n't locked down in this way .
BTW , in Motorola 's answer to Engadget on this , we see they are again subtly sending FUD that the lock - down is somehow legally required :
Motorola 's primary focus is the security of our end users and protection of their data , while also meeting carrier , partner and legal requirements .
I agree the carriers and partners probably want such lock down , but I 'd like to see their evidence that there is a legal restriction that requires that .
They present none .
Meanwhile , they also state that such cryptographic lock - down is the only way they know how to secure their devices :
The tablet version of MeeGo is built on the same underlying software as the netbook version , but the interface is drastically different .
There are two basic areas of the OS -- the simple and panel mode .
The simple mode is a basic grid of applications , while the panel mode is a series of vertical panes that can be customized with pictures , social networking feeds , and web bookmarks .
The latter was quite impressive as it will be entirely user customizable .
We also caught that Intel 's App Up store was preloaded , but we were told that there will be a separate SDK released this August for developing multitouch applications .
On the hardware front , the 1.5GHz Moorestown chip seemed to be super snappy and we witnessed it play a 720 p clip smoothly .
The actual 10 - inch Quanta Redvale tablet was incredibly thin and light , but the viewing angles of the reference design 's screen were poor to say the least .
However , the resistive panel was very responsive to taps on the screen and pinching to zoom .
Despite the pre-alpha label we have to say we were very impressed with what Intel is up to here -- it 's all looking polished and very simple to navigate .
The only bad news we have right now is that we have to wait until early 2011 to see it on some actual devices .
CBC ’s Eric Solomon interviews Allan Williams , a former Assistant Deputy Minister responsible for hardware procurement with Canada ’s Department of National Defence during a regular episode of “ Power & Politics ” on CBC Newsworld .
( July 16 , 2010 –Source : CBC Power & Politics )
A
new controversy erupts with an announcement by Canada ’s Defence Minister , Peter MacKay this week with the announcement Canada will purchase 65 F - 35 “ Joint Strike Fighter ” jets from Lockheed - Martin , a major defence contractor based in the United States .
But critics of the proposal argue that nobody can know for certain that it ’s a good deal for Canada — because the bid process was closed .
In this article ( updated periodically as debate ensues in forums online ) , I will share my views on the matter and commentary from the pundits ; including both professional and casual commentators , using CBC News video and forums content .
Excerpts will be aggregated here over the next few days , so check back and see how the online debate evolves …

“ The attack is intentional , the types of weapons used we know will cause " collateral damage " .
The West knows that the methods being used will cause devastation beyond belief to peoples that have done nothing to deserve the wrath being brought upon them . ”
I find this kind of thinking extremely presumptuous and ignorant .
It ’s all well and good to join the " blame the west " ( and never “ blame the terrorists ” ) club for the aforementioned collateral damage , but there ’s simply never been a war that did n’t involve unintentional casualties and damage to property .
This expectation that bombs will fall and missiles will hit their targets with flawless accuracy is unrealistic .
War just is n’t a safe endeavour , so if anyone wants to support a war , they need to do so with that expectation in mind .
But to think that because “ collateral damage ” is a feature of war that anyone advocating a war must necessarily also want the collateral damage is a gap in reason .
War might not be safe , but neither is either appearing weak on the world stage or allowing ones enemies ( and we _do_ have them ) to commit acts of terrorism with impunity .
Western leaders are n’t evil people in favour of strife and misery ; they ’re responsible to their country and ensuring its protection .
And the reality is that in a world full of unreasonable , violently - minded people , doing that job will sometimes necessitate war and , just as surely , collateral damage .
Those people who think of themselves as proponents of peace would do well to occasionally check their high - minded ideals and acquaint themselves not only with the effects of war , but of its causes .
Because it ’s a huge oversimplification to think it ’s all caused by a bunch of greedy , evil westerners .

“ Although we both agree that the F - 22 Raptor is the better jet , there ’s just one small issue with Canada purchasing them .
That being that the US congress wo n’t allow the US to export these units to any country , something which will not change for the foreseeable future . ”
Now I ’m not at all sure this is true .
I ’ve read on a few other websites that the option for certain countries to purchase the F - 22 has been extended : the examples I am aware of are Britain and Australia .
In fact , Australia , according to the " Australia Air Power " site reports that country is on the verge of making changes to its defence strategy and merging the F - 22 into its fighter jet fleet instead of going with the F - 35 .
( See http://bit.ly/cYbyX3 for more info .
Thanks to kyle1984 for the source . )
And if those countries have access to the F - 22 , it ’s a safe bet Canada can get it too ( due to the nature of our alliance ) .
But even if so , it ’s also a safe bet we wo n’t be getting 65 F - 22s for under $ 20 billion ….
or even a little more than $ 20 billion .
Plus the F - 22 does n’t offer everything the F - 35 does ; and vice - versa — a decision would have to be made around how much budget there is to buy these aircraft to replace the CF - 18s and whether they ’re a better fit for our military needs looking ahead into the next 20 - 35 years ( the estimated lifespan of the F - 35 air frame ) .
I think the Liberals might have said something of this sort recently … 😉

“ … the UK , who is the biggest contributor the R&R project was saying that the procurement costs of the F - 35 progressively converge with the unit costs of the F - 22A Raptor , and that the F - 35 was becoming less survivable as threats evolve . ”
The website you were quoting from provides some new insight , but I ’m forced to eye it critically because there was little critique I could find on the F - 22A Raptor , which , as you probably know , has experienced serious cost overruns in its production ( in the US ) .
In fact , the F - 22 has only survived this long as a manufactured aircraft because parts supplies are spread broadly across the continental US providing jobs in many US states , making it extremely difficult to cancel for political reasons .
Also , a senior software developer , I often write proposals and recommend technology solutions for both private and public sector organizations and I would never write a paper that was quite as one - sided as the quoted source ; regardless of what technology I was recommending .
So I ’m doubly - suspicious because it was written by an Engineer / Fighter - Pilot who , in my view , oughtta know better . 😉
Not that this diminishes his analysis concerning the F - 35 on its own .
It is of some concern that he cites UK sources as saying F - 35 costs could rise to the level of the F - 22 ; there certainly is nothing in the Canadian government announcement about the F - 35 purchase , which is of course one of the major criticisms being put forth by the Liberals .
The survivability of the F - 35 seems a bit of a weak argument to me too .
He ’s suggesting that you ca n’t upgrade the plane as readily as the F - 22 , but I ca n’t quite figure out why that might be .
And I ’d need to understand that better before changing my mind .

I ’ll refer you to what Allan Williams , former Assistant Deputy Minister , DND ( chief procurement officer ) said on Eric Solomon ’s Power & Politics ( used to be linked here , but it ’s still linked off main article : http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2010/07/16/canada-jets.html.
As anyone who ’s ever had any experience with project management will tell you , it ’s pretty silly to argue against due diligence and going through an open bid process .
Why ?
A number of reasons ( watch the video ) ; but chief among them it helps prevent you from getting ripped off or taken advantage of .
So I ’m afraid , I simply can’t agree that it ’s a waste of money — even if it looks at the outset very likely that the F - 35 would be the successful bid in any event .
And the Liberals are quite correct in pointing this out … not to mention reminding Canadians of the extremely risky pattern the Conservatives follow with respect to non-disclosure .
( As everyone now knows , the old Reform promises of " openness " and " transparency " in government were dead and buried pretty much the day the Conservatives took power for the 1st time and were faced with practicing what they ’d preached . )

Sometimes there is a distinction between what you want and what you need .
I think it the Governments ’ job to provide the financing but it should be the C - Forces making the decision as to what they need . ”
Well , I dunno if we should just leave it entirely up to the military .
I think ideally , the political leaders should state what the policy goals and objectives are , and then ask the military about how to best equip Canada to achieve them , in the context of national defense .
I also just wanted to add that I did a bit more research after reading the article you quoted earlier , and the F - 22 is actually not considered a direct 1:1 competitor for the F - 35 .
It turns out that it would cost Canada considerably more to purchase F - 22s than F - 35s and the interop features would n’t be as great , so there are some trade - offs — though it must be said there ’s broad consensus that the F - 22 is a superior air - to - air weapons platform .
But I could n’t find any good cross-references for the notion being argued by Dr. Kopp , that the F - 35 was a " technological failure " so for now I have to stand by my earlier comments that this analysis seems highly subjective .
And it now appears , insofar as the Canadian purchase is concerned , that the Conservative ’s numbers on the maintenance costs ( which are still secret ) could lead us closer to the $ 16 - 18 billion mark than the lower $ 9 billion figure cited at the news conference .

Sorry , but there is a level of ignorance beyond which people really ought to keep their mouths shut and you are about $ 282 billion short of being allowed to open yours without being hollered at by me .
=P
Do you have the foggiest idea how much it costs to design a modern jet fighter , capable of operating in the modern theatre of warfare ?
Nope — did n’t think so .
Well the Americans have invested well in excess of $ 300 billion just developing the F - 35 to date ; that does n’t even begin to include manufacturing or maintenance costs for the 1200 - unit fleet of F - 35 s they want deployed in the next 5 - 10 years .
It is n’t in dispute whether Canada has the know - how to build a jet fighter on its own ( ‘ cuz we sure do ! ) ; but I ’d have to seriously doubt that there ’s 10 people in this country who’d get behind the idea of spend upwards of half a trillion dollars on what you ’d call a " built - in - Canada " solution .
We just do n’t have that kind of money to spend without disastrous economic consequences .

“ I really wish poeple would remove their own political views when detailing with issues such as this .
Whelther you like or dislike the Conservatives it has no bearing on this issue . ”
I agree , in principle .
Ideologically - based policy decisions seem to be happening with alarming frequency , and so goes the political debate — which is n’t healthy .
Having said that , however , there ’s more than one issue on the table here : whether to buy the fighters and whether the ongoing pattern of the Conservatives governing in camera is the right way of doing things .
And while I may agree with the decision to buy into this F - 35 deal , I remain vehemently opposed to the air of secrecy that is the hallmark of this government .
It really would n’t have hurt anyone to have an open bid process ( because I ’m pretty darned sure Lockheed - Martin would ’ve won anyways ) .
" The Liberal ’s already sent us down this road long before the Conservatives made this purchase .
They signed up us up for the Joint Striker program to start with , they approved the what 500 M in funding to the program with the idea of purchasing the jets . "
And I ’m getting tired of this Conservative refrain that ’s little more than typical Tory disinformation .
The Liberals did n’t " send us down " any road .
They simply made Canada part of the JSF R&D program , which , yes , was the right thing to do .
But nothing in that agreement stated we were obliged or needed to buy fighters afterward ; we had the option to do so .
So it ’s not really " hypocritical " as McKay keeps trying to paint it ; though I admit it makes a great sound - bite .
Add to this a reminder that the Liberals are n’t opposing the F - 35 at all , in fact — they ’re advocating a review and an open bid instead of ramming the deal thru .

Yeah , I heard about that theory recently too .
And I ca n’t argue the facts about whether the Arrow had been compromised ( though the documentation of this theory rather sketchy so far ) ; but if that really was the problem , it seems that it could ’ve been dealt with a whole lot better than scrapping the programme .
( Generally , ya do n’t scrap production on a jet fighter because security leaks are suspected , though this was the rationale given by the RCMP for destroying the design materials . )
Not to again mention that the Americans were n’t hugely keen on being upstaged by Canadian technology ( which is well - documented ) , and there were strong economic incentives for Truman to convince Diefenbaker to purchase a number of Bomarc missiles for northern air defense instead .
( Missiles that were obsolete within 10 years of deployment , and scrapped shortly thereafter . )
As a student of history , I tend to buy into the economic incentives as being the stronger of the two motives for the Arrow ’s termination ; if , in fact , they were ever in competition .
After all , there ’s still no declassified evidence that suggests the Americans knew or even suspected that Arrow security had leaks .

As another posted pointed out , you ’re talking about the Avro Arrow .
And yes , Diefenbaker should have been hauled up on charges of treason both for killing the deal — and again for killing the deal because he was a Conservative PM manifestly doing what he was told to do by the U.S. !
But this is the 21st century and your comment reflects the fact that most people just do n’t understand that modern planes are n’t built by individual countries anymore .
And nobody should be under the illusion that the F - 35 is exclusively an American plane — they might ’ve manufactured and assembled it , but plenty of Canadian design went into it too .
And I suspect more will follow with upgrades and maintenance in the years to come if we do the right thing and buy these planes .

Under the new rules , drivers aged 21 and under cannot consume any alcohol before getting behind the wheel .
“ My hope is that this legislation will contribute to a reality where adults in the future will not drink and drive at all , ” Transportation Minister Kathleen Wynne said at a news conference Monday .
In 2008 the Ontario government backed off from a larger set of proposed restrictions on young drivers , including a change that would have limited the number of teen passengers in a teen - driven car , after a Facebook campaign stirred public outrage .
The tough - on - youth driving legislation was strongly encouraged by Tim Mulcahy , whose son Tyler was killed in a July 2008 car crash after he and friends spent the afternoon eating and drinking at a restaurant in Port Carling .
Tyler and two of his friends died when his Audi veered into a river .
His girlfriend Nastasia Inez Elzinga , then 19 , survived after she managed to swim to shore .
Tyler , 20 , was in danger of losing his driver ’s licence for several traffic charges at the time .
After his son was killed , Mulcahy took out full - page newspaper ads urging Premier Dalton McGuinty to tighten rules for young drivers .
Many say his personal crusade was instrumental in getting the zero tolerance legislation .
Reached on holiday , Mulcahy said he did n’t want to comment on the changes for personal reasons .
Statistics show people aged 19 to 21 are nearly 1.5 times more likely than older drivers to be involved in fatal crashes and injuries as a result of drinking and driving .
Under the legislation , drivers 21 and under found to have alcohol in their systems will face an immediate 24 - hour licence suspension at roadside , a fine of up to $ 500 and a 30 - day licence suspension .
New drivers of all ages will also be subject to zero tolerance until they get their G2 licence , which can take upwards of two years to acquire .
“ There will be people that are unhappy with this , including some people in my own household , but we know this is the right legislation , ” said Andrew Murie , chief executive officer of Mothers Against Drunk Driving .
He said he expects the new rules will result in a 15 to 25 per cent decrease in impaired driving deaths of young people .
Ontario is the fourth province to implement zero tolerance legislation for young and new drivers , after Manitoba , Nova Scotia and New Brunswick .
Some say the changes unfairly target young people .
“ We believe that all drivers in the G1 , G2 , M1 and M2 class of licence should face the same sanctions regardless of age , ” Ontario Safety League president Brian Patterson said .
“ It ’s a step forward and it ’s going to save lives , [ but ] at the end of the day I think it should apply to everyone . ”
That sentiment was echoed by young drivers at the Advanced Motoring Bureau driving school at Danforth and Broadview Aves .
“ I think they should keep an eye on people older than 21 , too , ” said Joe Zambri , 18 .
Classmate Jon Bentley , 16 , agreed drinking and driving is n’t a big problem among his peer group .
“ If the legal drinking age is 19 , then why increase this to 21 ? ”

The changes also include a measure the ministry hopes will alter the behaviour of first - time drunk - driving offenders .
Under current laws , a person convicted of impaired driving must serve a driver ’s licence suspension of at least a year .
However , research has shown that many drivers with a suspended licence continue to drive .
Under the new law , first - time offenders will be eligible for a reduced suspension if they agree to an ignition interlock installed in their vehicle .
The device is a breathalyzer attached to the vehicle ’s dashboard that prevents the person from driving unless they blow under a set limit .
Offenders must pay for the lock themselves .

When women ’s rights activist Wajiha Al - Huwaidar flew out of Saudi Arabia last week for a holiday in Italy with her family , she was hoping for a brief respite from what she describes as the ‘ gender apartheid kingdom .
’She was n’t so lucky .
As she left , her husband received an automated SMS text message from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs informing him that his wife , legally considered his ‘ dependant ’ under Saudi Arabia ’s strict gendered guardianship system , had left the country .
Al - Huwaidar ’s husband received the same text , she learned last week , when she had left Saudi Arabia on another recent trip to Germany .
“ It is sad how Saudis use technology in a way not intended to be used for , ” she told The Media Line .
“ In Saudi Arabia , technology brings more restrictions and misery !
They use it to have more control over people ’s lives , especially women . ”
“ I am an adult woman that has been earning my own income for over a decade now but according to the Saudi government , I am a dependent until the day I die because of my gender , ” Al - Huwaidar said .
“ I 'm not sure how it works , but lately we get to be informed through our mobile phones about our bank accounts , sale ads , jobs , donation campaigns and others .
I 'm sure it 's a new service that the government is using for different purposes .
They do n’t state which country the dependent left for , but simply state that they did leave .
” Saudi authorities did not respond to requests to comment on this article , and whether the text messages received by Al - Huwaidar ’s husband indicate a new system of monitoring or a case - specific effort to track Al - Huwaidar ’s movements .
“ I ’m a member of the Saudi women ’s rights group and my husband did not tell me he received a message which means he probably didn’t , ” Reem Asaad , a Saudi economics lecturer and women ’s rights activist told The Media Line .
“ It ’s possible that Wajiha [ Al - Huwaidar ] has been spotlighted by the authorities .
” Saudi Arabia ’s strict patriarchal guardianship system requires all women to be represented by men -- either their husband , father or son -- in all public and official spheres of life .
Women are not allowed to drive , inherit , divorce or gain custody of children ; and cannot enter most public spaces without a male guardian .
“ My husband had to fill out a form at the passport control authority to allow me and my children to travel outside the country whenever I like , ” Asaad explained .
“ He has to renew that with each passport every five years .
Most women travel this way .
” Nadya Khalife , the Middle East Women 's Rights researcher at Human Rights Watch , said the guardianship system presents an enormous barrier to Saudi women ’s freedom of movement .
“ Guardianship is a really complicated system and has a great effect not only on women ’s travel within Saudi Arabia but also to the outside world , prohibiting women ’s freedom of movement in a very critical way , ” she told The Media Line .
“ A woman cannot leave the country without the permission of her guardian , who might be her youngest son .
The text messages just adds another level of controlling women ’s movements .
I guess they ’re getting more technologically advanced .
” The Saudi government has gone to great efforts recently to improve the image of the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice , the country ’s religious police who are tasked with enforcing the guardianship system .
Earlier this year the commission ’s national director was fired and the new director , Sheikh Abdul Aziz Al - Humain , announced a series of training programs and a special unit to handle complaints against the religious police .
“ The government has promised to change the system and said that women over 40 can travel a bit without a guardian , ” Khalife said .
“ But from what we ’ve seen and the complaints we ’ve received from women in Saudi , the system is still very much in place .
Women still need their guardian ’s permission to travel , to study , to work , and even to go to a court to complain about domestic violence .
So there ’s a bit of a disconnect between the promises that have been made and the reality on the ground .
” Dr. Edit Schlaffer , founder of the advocacy group Women Without Borders , said the Saudi guardianship system is in violation of international law .
“ The guardian system is one of these things that is not justified by the Qu’ran , ” she told The Media Line .
“ No other Muslim country has a system like this .
It ’s a unique Saudi interpretation of Islam and according to the freedom of movement provisions under the Human Rights
Act the guardianship system is totally unacceptable to the international community .
But unfortunately , women ’s rights are not at the forefront of international humans rights issues . ” Dr. Schlaffer , who recently concluded an extensive study on gender in Saudi Arabia , argued that while there is a growing Saudi movement opposed to the guardianship system , outside pressure will not help .
“ There is a growing movement within Saudi Arabia which is supported by women and forward - looking men who oppose the guardianship system , ” she said .
“ But Saudi Arabia is outside the international time zone so change is extremely slow .
”
“ At the same time I feel that interferance from outside is helpful , ” she continued .
“ It creates new blockages .
The way forward is to help civil society within Saudi to provide a space for change . ”
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - When Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf decided to build a Muslim cultural centre in lower Manhattan , the model he chose could n’t have been more mainstream American -- the Young Men ’s Christian Association chapters found in cities across the United States .

The institution he had in mind was the 92nd Street Y , a Jewish adaptation of the YMCA concept that is one of New York ’s leading addresses for residents of all religions or none to visit for public lectures , debates , concerts or educational courses .
But Rauf ’s project is better known here now as the “ Ground Zero mosque , ” after the term for the World Trade Centre site .
Families of victims of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks and conservative politicians have mounted an emotional campaign to block it , claiming that locating it only two blocks north of the site was a provocation .
“ We repeatedly say we are neither a mosque nor within Ground Zero , but they just shout back ‘ Ground Zero mosque , ’ ‘ Ground Zero mosque , ’ ” Rauf , 61 , told Reuters in an interview .
The planned building will have a prayer room for Muslims , he said , but it would only be a small part of the 13 - story complex .
Rauf said the YMCA , which began in London in 1844 as Christian centre for young working men and quickly spread to the United States and other countries , had long worked to promote understanding across religious , ethnic and social dividing lines in modern societies .
Now called simply “ the Y , ” its facilities across the United States offer exercise classes , education and community activities .
“ We are trying to establish something that follows the YMCA concept but is not a church or a synagogue or , in this case , a mosque , ” he said by telephone from Kuala Lumpur , where he is visiting .
“ We are taking that concept and adapting it to our time and the fact that we ’re Muslims .
It ’s basically a Muslim Y . ”
SUPPORTED AND SLAMMED
The plan won overwhelming support at two community board meetings in May after they heard the $ 100 million complex would include a 500 - seat auditorium , swimming pool , meeting rooms , art exhibition spaces , bookstore and a food court featuring dishes from around the Muslim world .
But critics promptly branded the prayer space a mosque , as if the building would feature domes and minarets rather than the sleek modern lines its architects have designed for it .
Mark Williams , a spokesman for the conservative “ Tea Party ” political movement , alleged the centre would be used for “ terrorists to worship their monkey god . ”
Rick Lazio , Republican candidate for New York state governor in November ’s elections , said its finances should be probed for possible links to extremist groups .
The building now on the site , built in 1858 , has been shut since landing gear from one of the Sept. 11 planes crashed through its roof .
Critics of the mosque said that made the building a “ sacred ” or “ historic ” structure that should be preserved .
Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin weighed in on her Twitter feed over the weekend , urging “ peaceful Muslims ” to reject the project she compared to a “ stab in the heart . ”
Mayor Michael Bloomberg has firmly supported the project , saying : “ The government should never , never be in the business of telling people how they should pray or where they can pray . ”
Manhattan borough president Scott Stringer who , like Bloomberg , is Jewish took aim directly at the Tea Party ’s Williams .
“ His spewing of racial hatred reminds me ... of Adolf Hitler .
We reject him .
We reject his bigotry , ” he said .
Many religious organizations in New York have supported the imam and his project .
Matthew Weiner , program director at the Interfaith Centre of New York , praised Rauf as an active participant in dialogue among the city ’s religions .
“ There is no question in the mind of any religious leader who has worked with Imam Feisal about his honesty and sincerity , ” he said .
Rauf said the project “ could n’t be more urgent than right now .
One thing I hear all the time is , ‘ Where are the moderate Muslims ? ’
We are moderates and we ’ve condemned radicalism .
But moderation does n’t sell newspapers . ”
The imam said Muslim communities in Kuala Lumpur and Mumbai were considering copying his project to help build bridges among religious groups there .
Asked why he chose to build close to the World Trade Centre site , Rauf said : “ I ’ve been in this community for the last quarter century .
I ’m the imam of a mosque 10 blocks from there .
But we now have to hold three sessions of Friday prayers because the space is so tight . ”
New York ’s Landmarks Preservation Commission will rule next month whether the current building on the site can be torn down , but Rauf ca n’t imagine anything will hold up his project .
“ The people supporting it have far outnumbered those opposing it , ” he said .
“ The politicization of religion goes against the American ideal of the separation of church and state . ”
Remember print ?
Your kids might not .
This week , it emerged that newspaper sales are plummeting in Britain , with only 33 per cent of the population now claiming to be regular readers of analogue news .
As more and more of us cherry - pick our media online , drawing little distinction between the mainstream press and the popular blogosphere , industry insiders are beginning to panic , predicting the violent death of quality commentary and investigative journalism at the multifarious hands of the internet .
On several baffling occasions in recent months , I have found myself at snooty media events where hosts introduce me and my colleagues gingerly as " bloggers " , rather as if we were the grinning emissaries of a rogue state , ambassadors from a territory of violent cultural change which the authorities might soon see fit to brutally suppress but which , for now , must be appeased with canapés and party invitations .
Cosy members of the established commentariat eye bloggers suspiciously , as if beneath our funny clothes and unruly hair we might actually be strapped with information bombs ready to explode their cultural paradigms and destroy their livelihoods .
This sort of prejudice is deeply anodyne .
Bloggers are n't out to take away the jobs of highly paid columnists : we 're more ambitious than that .
We 're out for a complete revolution in the way media and politics are done .
While the media establishment guards its borders with paranoid rigour , snobbishly distinguishing between bloggers and journalists , people from the internet have already infiltrated the mainstream .
Raw power
Many influential writers now work across both camps , such as the author , blogger and digital activist Cory Doctorow , who observes that the blogosphere need not threaten paid comment journalism .
“ Commercially speaking , newspapers can make enough money from advertising to pay reasonable rates for opinion , ” says Doctorow .
“ I know of at least one that does , and that 's my site , BoingBoing , which reaches millions of readers every month .
By operating efficiently , we can more than match the fees paid by the New York Times , for example , which always pays peanuts for op - eds because the glory of being published in the NYT is meant to be its own reward .
" After you take away the adverts , the personals , the filler and the pieces hacked together from press releases , the average paper contains about 15 column inches of decent investigative journalism and commentary , ” said Doctorow .
“ And the internet is more than capable of financing 15 column inches a day . ”
What the blogosphere threatens is not the survival of comment journalism itself : it threatens the monopoly of the media elite , holding the self - important fourth estate to a higher standard than bourgeois columnists and editors find comfortable .
We are , in effect , a fifth estate , scrutinising the mainstream media and challenging its assumptions .
Last month , when Danny Dyer appeared to advise a reader of Zoo magazine to cut his girlfriend 's face , the feminist arm of the fifth estate responded angrily , prompting a retraction and apology from Zoo , and also successfully organised a donation drive to raise more money for women ’s refuge charities than the discredited Dyer ’s violently misogynist film Pimp made in its first week of release .
That ’s the type of power that scares the wits out of the dinosaurs in analogue media .
Every day , the British blogosphere becomes less amateurish and more relevant .
This weekend , the popular forum Liberal Conspiracy will host Blog Nation , an event bringing together bloggers , journalists and politicians on the left to determine how the internet can build progressive campaigns to fight public - sector cuts .
“ We have a strong community that can do activism and provide niche information that escapes mainstream newspapers , ” said the Liberal Conspiracy editor , Sunny Hundal .
“ We want to use the net to get the left to think more about strategy and action -- and get people to work together , better ! ”
Permanent revolution
The long - term effect of the internet on human cultural production may not be ascertained in my lifetime .
Certainly the baby boomers who control most major news outlets today will not live to see what change may come .
" Where we end up in five years is n't where we are today , " says Doctorow . "
We 're not headed towards a period of technological stability where we 'll know what our media will look like ; we 're headed for more technological change . ”
Doctorow is right to suggest that we are living through what Marx and Engels might term a “ permanent technological revolution ” .
Last weekend , in an incisive essay in the Guardian , John Naughton observed that being a consumer of media and journalism during the transformation of today 's communications environment is a little
like being a resident of St Petersburg in 1917 , in the months before Lenin and the Bolsheviks finally seized power .
It 's clear that momentous events are afoot ; there are all kinds of conflicting rumours and theories , but nobody knows how things will pan out .
Since we do n't have the benefit of hindsight , we do n't really know where it 's taking us .
One thing , however , is certain : journalism is changing for ever .
The notion of political commentary as a few - to - many exercise , produced by highly paid elites and policed by big business , has been shattered beyond repair .
The internet is a many - to - many medium , and those who write and comment here are not media insiders , nor are we the mob .
We are something altogether new .
We are the fifth estate , and we are forging a path through the miasma of technological change towards a more honest , democratic model of commentary -- alongside a lot of porn and some pictures of amusing cats .
The media revolution continues .
Whatever comes next , the bloggers ' battle cry must be " Permanent technological revolution " .

Google announced Friday that China had renewed its license to operate in the world 's largest market , at least for another year .
The announcement comes after the Chinese government looked likely to shut down the Google.cn web site in late June , six months after Google started a showdown with the Communist regime by saying it would no longer censor search results as it had agreed to when it entered China in 2006 .
The renewal followed another clever concession from Google , which initially resolved the problem by automatically redirecting all mainland Chinese searchers to its uncensored Hong Kong search site , Google.com.hk .
While brazen , the automatic redirect initially placated authorities .
By the end of June the government made it clear it was n't enough .
Google then put up a facsimile of a search box on Google.cn , which when clicked on , takes users to Google.com.hk .
The extra click seemed to do the trick .
" In China , it is very common that you need to give the government face if you want to do business here , " Edward Yu of Analysys International told Reuters .
" The double - click rule ( so as not to automatically reroute searches ) shows that Google can compromise and give them face . "
Google downplayed the announcement – one sentence tacked on to a 10 - day - old blog post by chief legal officer David Drummond in which the company announced the end of the automatic redirect .
" We are very pleased that the government has renewed our ICP [ Internet Content Provider ] license , and we look forward to continuing to provide web search and local products to our users in China , " the update simply said .
Google 's decision 11 days ago to completely abandon the auto - redirect appears to have been a key concession to stay in the country , where it has a number of business interests in addition to search .
But doing so likely means giving up on lucrative search partnerships with ISPs , portals and mobile phone makers , because no one wants a default search engine they have to double - click to use .
Instead , those lucrative partnerships will likely go to Baidu , a Chinese search company that dominates the search market in China .
The game of cat and mouse began when Google unexpectedly warned in January it might quit the country over censorship concerns , after suffering a hacker attack it said came from within China .
Only two days ago China said there would be no particular deadline for the review and that Google 's submission for renewal had been " relatively late . "
ICP licenses are reviewed annually in China .

The teaser trailer for the live - action adaptation of Yogi Bear has gone online .
When we reported on the project last November , I was negative about it .
This teaser trailer makes me feel completely justified in that negativity .
There ’s crummy animation , slapstick jokes , and nothing approaching the charm of the original cartoon .
Just because you quote the show , does n’t mean you ’re honoring it .
Of course , as I said then , I ’m sure the soundbites will be about how everyone involved with the movie loved the show and want to bring it to a new generation .
Directed by Eric Brevig ( Journey to the Center of the Earth 3D ) and stars Anna Faris , Tom Cavanagh , and T.J. Miller as well as the voices of Dan Aykroyd and Justin Timberlake as Yogi and Boo Boo , respectively .
Hit the jump to check out the teaser trailer as well as the the poster that we put up yesterday .

Christina Hendricks , who plays sassy secretary Joan Harris in television drama Mad Men , has been identified as the woman with a body others should healthily aspire to .
But how realistic is it for women to look like her ?
She 's the unlikely star of Mad Men , the foxy secretary who sashays through the offices of advertising agency Sterling Cooper as if she runs it .
And if it was today , and not the 1960s , then maybe she would .
Her hips are probably the most hypnotic on television , and now Christina Hendricks , who plays Joan Harris ( nee Holloway ) , and is reportedly a size 14 , has had her body officially endorsed by the British government .
" Christina Hendricks is absolutely fabulous , " says Equalities Minister Lynne Featherstone , who held up Hendricks ' outline as an ideal shape for women .
Highlighting the " overexposure " of skinny models and the impact they have on body image among young people , Ms Featherstone went on : " We need more of these role models .
There is such a sensation when there is a curvy role model .
It should n't be so unusual . "
So what makes Hendricks ' figure distinctive , and how attainable is it ?
In many ways , the character revolutionised perceptions of beauty on television screens , says the Los Angeles Times television critic , Mary McNamara .
" When Joan first showed up on American TV , she turned the beauty ideal on its ear , reminding everyone that generous curves were once considered sexy , and that pre-Twiggy , women 's clothing was designed to accommodate and enhance ample breasts and hips and thighs .
" Marilyn Monroe often wore a size 12 and very thin women wore padded bras and often had to shop in the boys department to find clothes .
Hendricks is , of course , gorgeous by any era 's standards and shows no signs of succumbing to the traditional pressure to slim down . "
Unlike actresses America Ferrara ( who plays Ugly Betty ) and Britain 's Kate Winslet , Ms Hendricks has kept her full figure , adds McNamara , who last week reviewed Mad Men Series 4 .
That figure is reportedly in possession of dimensions around 36 - 32 - 36 - although some reports suggest 38 - 32-38 - and her breasts variously described as a C or D cup .
That kind of body requires a lot of exercise and healthy eating to maintain , says Deanne Jade , a psychologist at the National Centre for Eating Disorders .
" Usually in the real world , the bigger breast goes along with a bigger tummy , wider waist or protruding abdomen .
' Stop objectifying us ' " I would prefer women not to be appraised as objects of appearance but rather on what they are able to do , but given the spread of BMI and weight [ issues ] , having a realistic image of size 14 is at least more appropriate " Professor Janet Treasure , expert in body image , Institute of Psychiatry , King 's College London
" So it 's unusual to have someone with these curves .
Therefore to get a figure like that , you would have to work hard or be naturally well - endowed . "
While she agrees with the minister that role models need to be a fuller and more realistic shape , Ms Jade says women with eating disorders will always seek out images of the thinnest women to confirm their own distorted view of how they look .
And magazines they read are full of stereotyping images that link " thin " with " success " .
" It 's an interesting soundbite but it takes more than that to change the messages that are going out . "

One way to an hour - glass figure
Identifying any particular body shape as the ideal one is fraught with difficulty and can just add to female anxiety , says Shade Adeoye , who is researching female perceptions of body image for a PhD at Leicester University .
She says Hendricks has a much more realistic figure than many models , but women looking to match it will end up falling short .
" I would say they will be almost 100 % disappointed , because her level of upkeep will be far higher than for a normal person .
The kind of money you need to spend - on the gym , cosmetics or even new breasts - is far beyond a normal person working nine to five .
" There is a possibility of getting this body by exercise and being careful what you eat - some people have ideal bodies without having surgery - but it requires a big investment in time and money .
It 's a full - time job in itself . "
What makes Joan special ?
" Joan is a wonderful character : strong , funny , sexually alluring but also - as fans of the show will know - admirable .
In Matthew Weiner 's world , she was on the one hand the ideal office manager : capable , assertive and sexy , and then was revealed to be just as insecure as the rest of the characters , desperate to get married and acquire some kind of status .
She ran the office with a rod of iron , fairly unsupportive of Peggy 's proto - feminist determination to rise in the hierarchy .
But she was also shown ultimately not to be her new husband 's passive victim " Tim Teeman , The Times US correspondent The look of Mad Men
Given her popularity as a character , can we expect to see a proliferation of Joan - shaped women on television ?
There are some signs , says Ms McNamara .
" One hopes that the very obvious proof that women who weigh more than 98lbs [ 44.5 kg ] can be sexy will translate beyond the Joan character , and I think we 're seeing a little of that with shows like Drop Dead Diva , Huge and the upcoming Mike and Molly .
" But none of those characters is treated with the same kind of bombshell reverence that Mad Men creator Matt Weiner clearly has for Joan . "
( CNN ) --
The days of digital birthday cakes , virtual bottles of champagne and other cutesy icons from Facebook are numbered .
Facebook Gifts , the virtual shop born out of a 2007 " hackathon " by FB staffers , will close on August 1 , even as the social networking giant looks for other ways to make money .
" Closing the Gift Shop may disappoint many of the people who have given millions of gifts , but we made the decision after careful thought about where we need to focus our product development efforts , " product manager Jared Morgenstern wrote on Facebook 's official blog .
" We 'll be able to focus more on improving and enhancing products and features that people use every day , such as Photos , News Feed , Inbox , games , comments , the ' Like ' button and the Wall . "
Facebook allows users to buy virtual credits that can be cashed in for digital gifts , such as bouquets of flowers , to be sent to friends ' pages on the social networking site .
Most of the virtual items cost the equivalent of about $ 1 apiece .
Ditching the gift shop suggests that its popularity has dipped as it competes with free Facebook apps , like Pieces of Flair and Birthday Calendar , that let users hand out similar digital goodies .
People who have gifts displayed on their wall will not lose them when the store is closed , Morgenstern wrote .
Users also will still be able to view a page showing all the gifts they 've given and received .
Morgenstern , who helped create Facebook Gifts for Valentine 's Day in 2007 , called the ending bittersweet .
But he credited the feature with launching Facebook Credits , the virtual cash used most often for premium items in massively popular Facebook game apps like FarmVille .
Reactions to the blog post were mixed .
Some users mourned the end of the gift shop .
" I am actually upset by this , " one user wrote .
" I hate third - party apps for it because they are full of spam and stuff you do not want .
I fail to see why this has to actually disappear .
It 's working fine right now as it is . "
But many of the more than 1,000 commenters appeared to be less concerned about the change .
" Yay !
Who wants to pay real money for fake gifts anyway ? " a user wrote .
US - British tensions over Afghan occupation
By Harvey Thompson
22 June 2010
The Times of London recently carried a series of highly critical comments by senior US officials in regard to the deployment of British forces in southern Afghanistan from 2006 onwards .
The candid statements express longstanding tensions between the two powers .
Michael Evans , Pentagon correspondent for the Times , revealed , “ When senior Pentagon officials paid a visit to London not long before the British deployment to Helmand , they came with a recommendation that the planned force might not be strong enough .
Their words went unheeded .
“ The American view was that a brigade of only 3,300 soldiers would not be sufficient to take on the Taleban and that the British were being complacent about the capability of the enemy . ”
Eric Edelman , former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy in the Bush administration , met with officials from the British Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) .
He comments , “ I remember going to London and saying it would be good to have more troops , but I was told that Britain could n’t add more until they were out of Iraq .
“ The MoD made clear that they had done plenty and that France , Spain and others needed to step up first , ” he said .
Edelman said he was surprised about the tactics adopted by the British in Helmand , especially the decision to set up “ platoon houses ” in which soldiers found themselves fighting round the clock against insurgents in remote isolated places .
“ When the troops arrived they kept putting small units into isolated places and there was a bit of a surprise that it was like Custer ’s last stand .
“ We tried to be understanding and not to pressurise the British too much but we ended up having to provide many of the ‘ enablers ’ [ support equipment such as helicopters and intelligence back - up ] , ” he said .
Lieutenant - General David Barno , commander of US forces in Afghanistan from 2003 to 2005 , also indicated the platoon houses as a weakness : “ One of the things that hurt the British was the decision to send out very small units expecting to work among a friendly or neutral population with a limited enemy threat .
The reality proved to be much different . ”
Andrew Krepinevich , who served on the personal staff of three US defense secretaries and is a former US Army officer , said he was surprised by the complacent approach of both the UK and NATO , telling the Times , “ It ’s hard to see what was in their mind at the time .
There was clearly a gross underestimate of the threat then posed by the Taleban in Helmand .
Just because the Taleban were relatively quiet , that did n’t mean they had been pacified .
“ But of course as soon as more than 3,000 British troops arrived , they stirred up a hornet ’s nest .
Then the resources that the British had assigned to the operation turned out to be substantially inadequate for the task . ”
Anonymously , a former Pentagon adviser on Afghanistan said he believed that British and other NATO units were sent to Afghanistan lacking proper logistical support , and that there had been “ a state of denial ” in NATO about the situation in the south of the country : “ The trouble is there was a stabilization , peacekeeping mentality , ” he said .
“ It was the wrong paradigm . ”
The Times reported , “ American military and diplomatic officials believe that a disastrous intelligence failure early in 2006 incorrectly persuaded both Britain and the rest of NATO that the Taleban were defeated and no longer posed a threat in southern Afghanistan .
Warning signs late in 2005 that violence was on the increase in Helmand were ignored , because ‘ no one wanted to send bad news up the chain . ’ ”
The paper concluded with Edelman saying , “ I do n’t point the finger at the British ; everyone got it wrong .
It was seen to be a reconstruction and stabilization operation , not a full - scale insurgency .
[ The US ] used to get pummelled for causing civilian casualties , but often it was because British and other NATO troops were over - exposed and calling up for air support , which we had to provide . ”
Despite the attempts at damage limitation — by the appearance of General David Petraeus at a June 9 conference of the Royal United Services Institute in London to acknowledge the contribution of UK forces — the fault lines are apparent .
The appearance of such open recriminations between the US and UK military forces is rare , but increasingly evident .
In 2008 , US generals criticised British - backed plans to arm local militias in the south of the country to aid them in defeating the insurgency .
More significant was the publication of documents in November 2009 revealing disputes between the British military establishment and their US counterparts over the handling of the invasion and occupation of Iraq .
A major reason for the re-surfacing of tensions in Iraq was the drive by rival imperialist powers to secure their share of lucrative construction contracts , in the face of US efforts to monopolize them .
The worsening problems besetting the US - led occupation of Afghanistan , the increasing scope of the insurgency , the rising civilian and troop fatalities , the growth of domestic opposition to the war and the potentially bloody struggle for lucrative mining contracts for the recently “ discovered ” mineral deposits across the country are all set to further intensify inter-imperialist rivalries .
Despite Prime Minister David Cameron ’s demands that the public “ revere and support ” the troops so they can later go home with “ heads held high , ” during his recent visit to Camp Bastion , the reality remains that his government is prosecuting a deeply unpopular neo-colonialist war that is escalating in violence and casualties .
On Monday it was announced that the number of British military personnel killed on operations in Afghanistan since the US - led invasion in 2001 had reached 300 .
The 300th fatality died in Birmingham ’s New Queen Elizabeth Hospital after he had been wounded in a blast in the Sangin district of Helmand on June 12 .
Of these casualties , 55 have died within the first six months of 2010 .
The Observer June 20 quoted analysis by the Medical Research Council ’s biostatistics unit at the University of Cambridge that says the rate at which British soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan is almost four times that of their US counterparts , and double the rate that is officially classified as “ major combat . ”
The death rate of UK troops is twice that of 2006 when major deployment to Helmand province first began .
There has also been a spike in the number of British soldiers killed by gunfire as opposed to roadside bombs .
The head of the United Nations monitoring mission on the Taleban recently criticized attempts by British and American forces to expand their control over Afghan territory over the past 12 months as having been counterproductive and worsening the security situation .
The UN statement has been viewed as particularly directed at the recent assessment of the British MoD and its announced “ progress ” in Helmand .
If it seems as if the tax code was conceived by graphic artist M.C. Escher , wait until you meet the new and not improved Internal Revenue Service created by ObamaCare .
What , you 're not already on a first - name basis with your local IRS agent ?
National Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson , who operates inside the IRS , highlighted the agency 's new mission in her annual report to Congress last week .
Look out below .
She notes that the IRS is already " greatly taxed " — pun intended ? —" by the additional role it is playing in delivering social benefits and programs to the American public , " like tax credits for first - time homebuyers or purchasing electric cars .
Yet with ObamaCare , the agency is now responsible for " the most extensive social benefit program the IRS has been asked to implement in recent history . "
And without " sufficient funding " it wo n't be able to discharge these new duties .
That would n't be tragic , given that those new duties include audits to determine who has the insurance " as required by law " and collecting penalties from Americans who do n't .
Companies that do n't sponsor health plans will also be punished .
This crackdown will " involve nearly every division and function of the IRS , " Ms. Olson reports .
Ms. Olson also exposed a damaging provision that she estimates will hit some 30 million sole proprietorships and subchapter S corporations , two million farms and one million charities and other tax - exempt organizations .
Prior to ObamaCare , businesses only had to tell the IRS the value of services they purchase .
But starting in 2013 they will also have to report the value of goods they buy from a single vendor that total more than $ 600 annually — including office supplies and the like .
La Secretaría pudo identificar que 37 mil 071 que se presentaron a la evaluación el año pasado también lo hicieron en este
[ email protected ]
El maestro que se identificó bajo la clave 090900123675 en el Distrito Federal es uno de los 109 mil 099 aspirantes a profesor , esto es casi 75 % de los concursantes que deberán regresar a la escuela al no lograr el nivel requerido para obtener un empleo en las aulas públicas de preescolar , primaria y secundaria del país .
Este profesor que buscaba un puesto de trabajo en una primaria obtuvo únicamente un acierto en la parte de contenidos curriculares .
Él aspiró a formalizar la plaza que ya tiene , pero al ser de los 3 mil 746 profesores que reprobaron dos de las tres áreas de evaluación no lo podrá lograr , debido a que obtuvo entre 13 y 24 aciertos en la prueba , colocándose así como “ no aceptable ” .
Algo similar le ocurrió a quien se presentó con el registro número 15100083902 en el estado de México , y obtuvo 13 aciertos de un examen de 123 preguntas .
Al publicarse los resultados del examen para quienes aspiraron a un empleo dentro del magisterio , la Secretaría de Educación Pública ( SEP ) informó que de esta prueba se seleccionaron a sólo 36 mil 884 que obtuvieron una calificación promedio en la prueba .
Estos resultados revelan que la proporción de maestros que tuvieron calificaciones equivalentes a reprobar la prueba o requerir una nivelación académica ascendió ligeramente respecto al año pasado , de acuerdo con los criterios de la representación de la SEP y el Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educación ( SNTE ) .
Esto , debido a que en 2009 fueron 92 mil 770 ( 74.9 % ) los que regresaron a las aulas para compensar su deficiente formación .
Según las bases del concurso , a estos que competían por una de las 32 mil 536 plazas se sumarán los profesores que también presentaron el examen del año pasado y están en la lista de quienes obtendrán una plaza dentro del sindicato a lo largo del ciclo escolar que inicia en agosto .
Significa que de los 145 mil 983 sustentantes al Examen Nacional de Conocimientos y Habilidades Docentes , un 25.3 % ( 36 mil 884 ) se ubicó en el nivel de “ aceptable ” y el 74.7 % restante está formado por 105 mil 352 en el nivel de “ Elegible , condicionado a Nivelación Académica ” y 3 mil 747 en “ no aceptables ” .
Modifican números Estos números fueron modificados por la dependencia por la tarde , luego de que en su página de internet — por la mañana — exhibió otras cifras totales .
Decía que eran 39 mil 141 los aceptables , 103 mil 986 los condicionados y 3 mil 746 los “ no aceptables ” .
A estos se les sumarán los 32 mil 391 participantes del del año pasado que aún tienen derecho a una plaza .
La Secretaría pudo identificar que 37 mil 071 que se presentaron a la evaluación el año pasado también lo hicieron en este .
Con el propósito de distribuir las plazas existentes , la dependencia y el SNTE acordaron integrar ambos exámenes de manera que 44 mil 565 obtuvieron nivel “ aceptable ” .
Será a ellos a quienes se les asigne una de las 22,546 plazas de jornada y 119 mil 883 plazas por hora semana mes concursadas , para beneficiar a casi 33 mil docentes .
De ambos concursos se pudo obtener que Elvia Carmina Flores Marroquín , del estado de Nuevo León , en la categoría de nuevo ingreso , aspirante a una plaza de educación inicial y preescolar , obtuvo la mejor calificación con un porcentaje de aciertos de 93.75 % .
Ella es egresada de la Escuela Normal “ Profr. Serafín Peña ” .
Entre las listas de los mejores profesores en la prueba aplicada a más de 145 mil aspirantes la semana pasada está Ángel Huerta Larios , que con 72 aciertos es uno de los que tuvo mejor desempeño en el examen para obtener un puesto de trabajo en las primarias del país .
Martha Alicia Gómez Gómez , en el estado de México , también es de las más destacadas en la prueba al obtener 72 aciertos y un promedio de calificación de 9 .
Con ello busca conseguir una plaza de primaria , revela la primera revisión a la base de datos de cada una de las entidades , en lo referente a los profesores que ya trabajan como interinos .
La Secretaría especificó que en el caso de 16 estados ( Campeche , Chiapas , Distrito Federal , Guerrero , Hidalgo , Jalisco , Estado de México , Morelos , Puebla , Querétaro , San Luis Potosí , Sonora , Tabasco , Tamaulipas , Veracruz y Yucatán ) , los aspirantes a un puesto de trabajo deberán acreditar aún las evaluaciones adicionales que deberán presentar en los siguientes días de acuerdo con cada una de las convocatorias .
Estos exámenes adicionales son de conocimientos y habilidades específicas como idiomas , sicológicas y presentación de portafolios en las áreas de artes o tecnologías .
Los resultados del examen son definitivos para los estados de Aguascalientes , Baja California , Baja California Sur , Chihuahua , Coahuila , Colima , Durango , Guanajuato , Nayarit , Nuevo León , Querétaro Sinaloa , Tlaxcala y Zacatecas .
Esta es la tercera vez que se aplican las pruebas para asignar las plazas de docentes , lo cual pretende acabar con el esquema de corrupción nacional en el que los empleos se asignan por la venta de plazas y acoso sexual , entre otras prácticas .

These were absolutely delicious !
I cooked the zucchini in the microwave face down with a small amount of water for 5 min .

The scientists discovered the " nervous systems " of Arabidopsis plants
Plants are able to " remember " and " react " to information contained in light , according to researchers .
Plants , scientists say , transmit information about light intensity and quality from leaf to leaf in a very similar way to our own nervous systems .
These " electro - chemical signals " are carried by cells that act as " nerves " of the plants .
Image caption
The researchers used fluorescence imaging to watch the plants respond
In their experiment , the scientists showed that light shone on to one leaf caused the whole plant to respond .
And the response , which took the form of light - induced chemical reactions in the leaves , continued in the dark .
This showed , they said , that the plant " remembered " the information encoded in light .
" We shone the light only on the bottom of the plant and we observed changes in the upper part , " explained Professor Stanislaw Karpinski from the Warsaw University of Life Sciences in Poland , who led this research .
He presented the findings at the Society for Experimental Biology 's annual meeting in Prague , Czech Republic .
" And the changes proceeded when the light was off ...
This was a complete surprise . "
In previous work , Professor Karpinski found that chemical signals could be passed throughout whole plants - allowing them to respond to and survive changes and stresses in their environment .
But in this new study , he and his colleagues discovered that when light stimulated a chemical reaction in one leaf cell , this caused a " cascade " of events and that this was immediately signalled to the rest of the plant via a specific type of cell called a " bundle sheath cell " .
The scientists measured the electrical signals from these cells , which are present in every leaf .
They likened the discovery to finding the plants ' " nervous system " .
Thinking plants
What was even more peculiar , Professor Karpinski said , was that the plants ' responses changed depending on the colour of the light that was being shone on them .
Plants perform a sort of biological light computation , using information contained in the light to immunise themselves against diseases Stanislaw Karpinski , Warsaw University of Life Sciences
" There were characteristic [ changes ] for red , blue and white light , " he explained .
He suspected that the plants might use the information encoded in the light to stimulate protective chemical reactions .
He and his colleagues examined this more closely by looking at the effect of different colours of light on the plants ' immunity to disease .
" When we shone the light for on the plant for one hour and then infected it [ with a virus or with bacteria ] 24 hours after that light exposure , it resisted the infection , " he explained .
" But when we infected the plant before shining the light , it could not build up resistance .
" [ So the plant ] has a specific memory for the light which builds its immunity against pathogens , and it can adjust to varying light conditions . "
He said that plants used information encrypted in the light to immunise themselves against seasonal pathogens .
" Every day or week of the season has … a characteristic light quality , " Professor Karpinski explained .
Image caption
The images showed chemical reactions in leaves that were not exposed to light
" So the plants perform a sort of biological light computation , using information contained in the light to immunise themselves against diseases that are prevalent during that season . "
Professor Christine Foyer , a plant scientist from the University of Leeds , said the study " took our thinking one step forward " .
" Plants have to survive stresses , such as drought or cold , and live through it and keep growing , " she told BBC News .
" This requires an appraisal of the situation and an appropriate response - that 's a form of intelligence .
" What this study has done is link two signalling pathways together ... and the electrical signalling pathway is incredibly rapid , so the whole plant could respond immediately to high [ levels of ] light . "

The logbook was written by Andrew Service when he served on HMS Medusa
A personalised account of life on board one of Lord Horatio Nelson 's ships during the Napoleonic Wars has been made available online .
The logbook by Andrew Service charts his experiences on the 38 - gun frigate Medusa in the early 1800s .
The Royal Navy Sailor , who was born in Port Glasgow in 1871 , saw action in the Mediterranean , the East and West Indies and the North and South Americas .
His family donated the logbook to the University of Glasgow in the 1980s .
The account , in ink , which was completed exactly 200 years ago , is believed to have been set down by Service from pencil - written notes he kept on the ship .
The logbook has been stored in the university 's archives since it was donated as it was in a fragile condition and could not be read .
It is a fascinating read of far - flung places from the icy waters of Newfoundland to Sri Lanka as well as descriptions of sea battles , the seizing of enemy ships and the deaths of fellow shipmates Emily Graham , Student
It was finally published online on Tuesday after conservation work allowed it to be transcribed and fully researched .
The account shows that Service joined the Royal Navy as a landsman with no marine skills but left as a fully - fledged seaman .
He boarded the Medusa in 1801 , aged 20 , and was present at the battle of Cape Santa Maria , off southern Portugal , in 1804 .
He also saw action at the Battle of Montevideo , Uruguay , in 1807 and escorted the Governor General of India back to the sub - continent in 1805 .
The Battle of Cape Santa Maria was a British success with the seizing of a cargo of gold and silver valued at £ 1 m and led to Spain joining the war on the side of the French .
However , the Battle of Montevideo was a disaster with more than 2,500 men killed or taken captive .
The transcription and background research on the log book was carried out by history student Emily Graham , 19 , from Bristol .
' Missing ports '
She completed the work as part of a university work experience programme .
" The most difficult part of deciphering Andrew Service 's handwriting was the names of the places that the ship visited , " she said .
" The spelling is erratic and you have to sound out the letters to get the word .
Place names were really hard to decipher , so I had to use an atlas to check for possible places on the sea routes .
" There are still a few that we have to crack and I hope that someone reading the logbook online may be able to provide the missing ports of call . "
The book is considered to be a rare source of naval history from below decks , as it was officers who kept the official log of voyages .
Ms Graham added : " It is a fascinating read of far - flung places from the icy waters of Newfoundland to Sri Lanka as well as descriptions of sea battles , the seizing of enemy ships and the deaths of fellow shipmates .
" Even Andrew did not escape unscathed , crushing a finger which had to be amputated .
But the one image that sticks in my mind is that of a sailor going ashore with bags of clothes and food singing Rule Britannia . "

Dozens of blogs by some of China 's most outspoken users have been abruptly shut down while popular Twitter - like services appear to be the newest target in government efforts to control social networking .
More and more Chinese bloggers are using the newer microblogs as their primary publishing tool , using their brief , punchy message format to chat with one another and promote their longer blog posts .
But one of the country 's top four microblog sites is now down for maintenance , and the other three show a " beta " tag as if they are in testing , though they have been operating for months .
The companies that run the websites are n't saying why .
" I was writing a new post and suddenly my blog could n't open , " lawyer Pu Zhiqiang told The Associated Press .
Legal expert Xu Zhiyong said his blog on the popular Sohu portal was also shut down Wednesday , a day after his Sohu microblog was closed .
Both men are well known for taking on sensitive issues .
Chinese officials fear that public opinion might spiral out of control as social networking — and social unrest — boom among its 420 million internet users .
China maintains the world 's most extensive internet monitoring and filtering system , and it unplugged Twitter and Facebook last year .
Blogger Yao Yuan listed at least 61 closed Sohu blogs , including his own , on a separate , unblocked blog Thursday .
He called the closings mass murder .
Controls increasing
" If internet users do n't speak out , all sites will be cracked down on in the future , " said Yao , who owns an internet - promotion company in Shanghai .
" Ordinary people will forever lose their freedom to speak online , and the government can rest without worrying anymore . "
Microblogs can quickly aggregate critical voices , which is why authorities have been increasing controls , said Xiao Qiang , director of the China Internet Project at the University of California - Berkeley .
" However , given the speed and volume of microblogging content produced in Chinese cyberspace , censors are still several steps behind at this stage , " he said in an e-mail .
China 's government actually embraced microblogs earlier this year , with the Communist Party newspaper , the People 's Daily , launching a microblog of its own .
The People 's Daily microblog showed no sign Thursday of new restrictions .
Meanwhile , Beijing 's public security bureau announced it would set up a microblog for the city 's police , the state - run Xinhua News Agency reported Wednesday .
But in April , a leading internet regulator called for requirements that people use their real names when going online .
" As long as our country 's internet is linked to the global internet , there will be channels and means for all sorts of harmful foreign information to appear on our domestic internet , " Wang Chen , director of the State Council Information Office , said in comments released this week by the New York - based group Human Rights in China .
' Weak links "
" Many weak links still exist in our work .
These problems have weakened our ability to manage the internet scientifically and effectively . "
Privately run microblogs are showing signs of feeling pinched .
The Netease.com microblog is down for maintenance , while the Sina , Sohu and Tencent microblogs display a beta tag .
Sina president Chen Tong responded Wednesday night to speculation that the site could be shut down .
" Of course not , " he said on the site 's microblog .
" I 've said that sentence more than any other one today . "
Government officials could not be reached for comment .
Despite Beijing 's extensive restrictions , technologically savvy users can still jump China 's " Great Firewall " with proxy servers or other alternatives .
And they can just keep publishing .
Pu , the lawyer , said he has already set up a new Sohu blog — his 13th so far .
MIAMI ( Reuters ) - U.S. authorities charged 94 doctors , nurses and clinic owners with scheming to defraud the taxpayer - funded Medicare program out of $ 251 million , Attorney General Eric Holder said on Friday .
Attorney General Eric Holder testifies on Capitol Hill , March 16 , 2010 .

He said 36 defendants had been arrested so far in five cities in “ the largest federal healthcare fraud take - down in our nation ’s history . ”
The suspects submitted false claims for equipment and services that were not medically necessary and in many cases not actually provided , Holder said .
The claims were filed through the Medicare program that provides healthcare to elderly and disabled Americans .
“ These criminals have siphoned resources from the most vulnerable among us , ” Holder said , referring to suspects in Miami , Detroit , New York , Houston , and Baton Rouge , Louisiana .
“ With today ’s arrests , we ’re putting would - be criminals on notice : Healthcare fraud is no longer a safe bet .
It ’s no longer easy money , ” Holder told a news conference in Miami .
The sweeping healthcare overhaul that President Barack Obama and his fellow the Democrats pushed through Congress in March relies partly on cutting waste and fraud to help offset the expansion of government - subsidized healthcare for more than 30 million uninsured Americans .
Fraud bleeds $ 60 billion a year from the Medicare program and South Florida is regarded as the national epicenter , accounting for a third of U.S. healthcare fraud prosecutions .
That is partly because of the region ’s large population of elderly people and of non-English speakers , prosecutors have said .
Those charged on Friday included doctors , nurses , clinic owners and administrators and recruiters who persuaded patients to let their names be used on the claims .
“ A lot do n’t understand how valuable their Medicare ID information is , ” said Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius .
She said the government is working to educate people to better protect the information .
It is also consolidating various Medicare data banks and using analytical tools similar to those used by credit card agencies to find suspicious billing patterns before claims are paid , Sibelius said .
Holder and Sibelius were in Miami on Friday for a healthcare fraud summit , the first of a series planned for other large U.S. cities .
More than 360 law enforcement agents from various federal , state and local agencies took part in the crackdown announced on Friday , Holder said .

Apple just finished their press conference about the iPhone 4 antenna issues that have been widely reported and discussed in the past few weeks .
Steve Jobs started by showing that the problem was n't limited to iPhones , using videos of the BlackBerry Bold 9700 , the HTC Droid Eris , and the Samsung Omnia 2 as examples , all of which dropped bars while being gripped in certain ways .
He said , " This is life in the smartphone world .
Phones are n't perfect .
It 's a challenge for the whole industry .
Every phone has weak spots . "
He went on to say that only 0.55 % of all iPhone 4 users have called in to complain about reception problems , and that the return rate on the iPhone 4 so far is less than a third of the return rate for the 3GS .
Jobs then said that according to their data , the iPhone 4 drops an average of less than one additional call per hundred than the 3GS .
He continued by pointing out that because the 3GS was based on the 3G , there was already a large supply of Bumpers , which most customers left the store with .
When the iPhone 4 came out , the old Bumpers did n't fit , so stock was lower and fewer customers used them ( 80 % vs. 20 % ) .
Therefore , Apple 's solution to the antenna problems is to give a free case to every iPhone 4 purchaser before September 30 .
Refunds will be offered for those who already purchased one .
Since they can't make the Bumpers fast enough , they 'll be supplying other cases from third parties .
Jobs also acknowledged recently reported problems with the proximity sensor , promising a future software update to fix it .
Engadget 's liveblog of the conference has a ton of pictures and more direct quotes from Jobs .
It 's worth looking at if only for pictures of Apple 's anechoic testing chambers .
Police in Ecuador seized a 100 - foot submarine being built by suspected drug traffickers capable of carrying a crew of six and 10 tons of cocaine on underwater voyages lasting up to 10 days — a “ game changer ” for U.S. anti-drug and border security efforts , officials said Monday .
A raid Friday by 120 police officers and soldiers netted the fiberglass sub as it was nearing completion in a clandestine “ industrial complex ” hidden in mangrove swamps near San Lorenzo , a town just south of the Colombian border .
The craft was outfitted with a conning tower , a periscope , air conditioning and “ scrubbers ” to purify the air , and bunks for a maximum crew of six .
But what set the craft apart from semi-submersible craft that drug traffickers have used for years was a complex ballast system that would have enabled it to dive as deep as 65 feet before surfacing .
Previously , drug traffickers were known to use ships that resembled submarines but that actually cruised just below the ocean surface to avoid visual detection .
Since 2006 , when the first semi-submersible craft was detected , 47 have been captured at sea and on land , including 17 last year .
But so far this year , only three such craft have been captured .
The number of voyages has probably dropped , officials said , because of the success in detecting the vessels with a variety of methods , including aircraft that can identify their wakes in the water .
The sub that Ecuadorean police seized on their Pacific coast is much more technologically advanced and will require the U.S. and its allies in the drug war to deploy “ every resource ” in anti-submarine warfare technology , said Jay Bergman , the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration ’s Andean director .
Those countermeasures could include added oceangoing and airborne surveillance vessels and aircraft , he said .
“ This is a game changer for us and will prompt an array of countermeasures , ” Bergman said in a telephone interview .
“ This has the national security community concerned as much as the drug interdiction community . ”
U.S. military officials have long expressed the fear that narco - submarines could , in addition to carrying illicit drugs , be used to smuggle terrorists to U.S. shores or nearby .
One Ecuadorean national was captured by police and soldiers , some of whom swooped in by helicopter .
The suspect is cooperating with authorities .
The shipyard included a camp that was big enough to accommodate 50 workers , officials said .
Ecuadorean authorities said in a statement Monday they believe the ship had a maximum speed of 8 knots and could have made underwater voyages lasting up to 10 days , long enough to reach the Pacific coast of Mexico .
The cost of the ship , which had twin diesel engines , was estimated at $ 4 million .
Neither the designer of the sub nor the provenance of the equipment was known .
The periscope appeared to be military - issue , but Bergman declined to speculate on which country it came from .
Counternarcotics officials have long expected to find a submarine such as the one captured in Ecuador , Bergman said , seeing it as the logical step in the gradual evolution of traffickers ’ methods , which include human “ mules , ” private aircraft , speedboats and concealment in bulk cargo .
Officials at Bogota ’s El Dorado airport last week seized more than 24 pounds of cocaine hidden inside a facsimile of the World Cup championship soccer trophy .
The seizure of the submarine also reinforced concerns that Ecuador is becoming increasingly important for drug traffickers squeezed by interdiction efforts in Colombia , where the U.S. government spends $ 550 million a year on counternarcotics and anti-terrorism operations .
The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime said in its annual report last month that the number of acres Colombian farmers dedicate to illegal crops of coca , cocaine ’s base material , declined last year to 170,000 from 250,000 in 2008 .
Meanwhile , Ecuadorean anti-drug police last year seized a record 68 tons of cocaine , more than double the 2008 total .
“ As far as the engineering that went into this , you have to marvel at the lengths they are going to avoid capture , ” Bergman said of the captured submarine .
“ The real technological trick is not building a sub that will dive down , but one that will come back up , and they seem to have mastered the challenge . ”

A reader sent us this camera phone photo of a sinkhole in Northern Milwaukee that swallowed a road , traffic light , and a Cadillac Escalade Thursday night .
The giant sinkhole is likely the result of ongoing flooding in the area .

This photo appears to show a newer SUV trapped in a large hole filled with crumbled asphalt and a traffic light near North and Oakland Avenues .
Milwaukee Police confirmed the incident happened the driver escaped without serious injury and the officer we spoke with was unaware of any other sinkholes in the area , though added there was still significant street flooding in the area .
Mark Pawlik was waking along the avenue when the incident happens and helped rescue the driver .
" The Escalade just went wham !
Everything went down .
The power line went like " pow " and then I think it was sewer water was just pouring into the hole . "

The driver pulled himself onto the hood of his car before falling into the hole .
Eventually , Pawlik was able to grab the driver 's belt loop and pull him to higher ground .
The street remains closed .
Here 's another photo of the incident from @ Mike_ Thiel .

An East Peoria woman will find out on July 13 how much money she will have to pay back for pretending to be a breast cancer survivor when , in fact , she was n't .
Judge Richard Grawey will hold a hearing at 10:30 a.m. in his Tazewell County Circuit Courtroom to determine the restitution amount for Michel Mayberry - Pawlak , who was convicted in May of forgery in connection with a Jan. 27 , 2007 , fundraiser at the American Legion in Washington .
An East Peoria woman will find out on July 13 how much money she will have to pay back for pretending to be a breast cancer survivor when , in fact , she was n't .
Judge Richard Grawey will hold a hearing at 10:30 a.m. in his Tazewell County Circuit Courtroom to determine the restitution amount for Michel Mayberry - Pawlak , who was convicted in May of forgery in connection with a Jan. 27 , 2007 , fundraiser at the American Legion in Washington .
At that fundraiser , she told friends she was suffering from breast cancer and allowed several people to organize a fundraiser for her .
So far , Mayberry - Pawlak is linked to about $ 500 taken from La Gondola restaurant which provided the food for the event .
Tazewell County State 's Attorney Stuart Umholtz said recently that his office has had trouble finding others who might have given money at the fundraiser .
" We are kind of hopeful that after this case was resolved , that we would have some other victims come forward and get restitution ordered for them , " Umholtz said .
" So far , we have n't had much luck in locating victims other than the band . "
The case began in late 2006 when Mayberry - Pawlak began to tell others she had cancer .
" I think what happened is that she made a representation to a small group of people and it took on a life of its own , " Umholtz said .
" When they decided to have a fundraiser for her , she did n't know how to back out of it .
" She did n't plan it , but she did n't have to go along with it , " he said .
Her attorney , Steve Bush , said Mayberry - Pawlak did not wish to comment for this story .
Mayberry - Pawlak was sentenced to 30 months of probation .
She also received six months in jail but that time was stayed pending a review next year .
If she abides by the terms of her probation , she would n't to go to jail .
Such a move is common for probationers and is seen as a way to convince people to comply with their probation .
This is n't the first time Mayberry - Pawlak has been in trouble .
In March 2009 , she was convicted in Woodford County of forgery and she was sentenced in Tazewell County to court supervision for driving under the influence in 2008 .
The Woodford County conviction stemmed from Mayberry - Pawlak using her employer 's checks for her personal expenses , said Woodford County State 's Attorney Michael Stroh .
The total amount taken was around $ 5,500 , which was paid back before she pleaded guilty .
She was on probation for that case when she was convicted of the Tazewell County charges .
But because the fundraiser occurred first , neither Woodford County nor Tazewell County could use it as a way to either revoke her probation or seek an enhanced sentence .
A leaked World Bank report into investors from rich nations buying up African farmland has intensified campaigners ' fears that the growing trend is marginalising local producers .
After a spate of investments in African land by sovereign wealth funds looking for gains on rising commodity prices and by countries such as China worried about their own food security , the World Bank launched research into the area .
Its report is due to be published next month , but a draft copy leaked to the Financial Times painted a picture of largely speculative investment badly lacking agricultural expertise , and a rush towards countries with lax laws .
It mentioned only a handful of successes .
" Investor interest is focused on countries with weak land governance , " the draft said .
Although investment deals promised jobs and infrastructure " investors failed to follow through on their investment plans , in some cases after inflicting serious damage on the local resource base " .
The report also flagged that " the level of formal payments required was low " , thereby fuelling speculative investment .
As commodity prices have soared on the back of rising global food demand , weather fluctuations and a growing biofuels industry , anti-poverty campaigners have grown increasingly concerned about speculative land - grabbing in Africa and other developing regions .
They argue that investors crowd out the poorest local producers and at the same time invest little in improving the agricultural processes needed to meet the huge jump in world food production required to feed a burgeoning population .
Aurelie Walker , Fairtrade Foundation 's trade policy advisor , said : " With the policy frameworks in place , investment in land for agriculture can potentially act as a catalyst for development .
But this is rarely the case .
Governments with weak institutions laws and regulations are easy targets for wealthy investors . "
The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation , the UN Conference on Trade and Development ( Unctad ) and the World Bank have been discussing a code of conduct for land buyers in Africa and this latest research on patterns so far is likely to feed into that .
A spokesman for the World Bank confirmed the report The Global Land Rush : Can it yield sustainable and equitable benefits ?
would be released in August but said that it was still being revised .
" The World Bank undertook research on farmland acquisitions at the request of developing countries , and to help ensure that their citizens , including the poor and farmers , benefit from foreign investments in this area , " he added .
While campaigners will likely welcome the wide - ranging report as a base for creating more enforceable guidelines , some bodies argue there will still be big questions over implementing new rules .
The United Nations , for example , believes African governments themselves must be more demanding in their trade relationships with other countries , something that the Fairtrade Foundation echoes .
" It 's also the responsibility of governments in poor countries to consult with local communities and ensure land sales are in the best interest of their people and not an opportunity to make a fast buck , " said Walker .

The players are signed , the " Decision " is made , but the passions around this year 's extraordinary class of NBA free agents refuses to die down .
What surprises me is the amount of negative commentary directed at the three top free agents ( especially LeBron James ) who decided to play on the same team and to create a great franchise together .
Of course , any club owner dreams of having those players , including me , but all questions of how the announcements were made aside , I respect their choice , and no one has the right to judge them .
I want to say that I support LeBron , the best athlete in the NBA .
He had a truly difficult choice to make .
Any move he made was sure to be viewed as wrong , and to leave many unhappy fans .
Basing his decision on achieving results on the basketball court shows that the sportsman won the day , not the showman or the businessman .
What is wrong with that ?
We are seeing the birth of a new , dynamic team with such star players , and all of us can await the new season with great anticipation .
I wish them success and give them my moral support .
I will be happy for us to beat the Miami Heat in the conference finals , maybe not this season , but in the very near future .

Tribute to a mother Kudos to Michael Medved for his warm - hearted piece " Liberal mom , conservative son . "
It was a thoughtful tribute to an exceptional mother ( The Forum , July 8 ) .
Although she never converted Medved to her New Deal , liberal philosophy , no doubt she demanded of him fair - mindedness and well - reasoned arguments in support of his beliefs .
Consequently , Medved is a thoughtful conservative with none of the slash - and - burn rhetoric heard at some " Tea Party " gatherings .

BRIEF HAS BEEN FILED WITH THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS
by Sharon Rondeau
( Jul. 30 , 2010 ) — The State of Arizona has filed an appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals over the ruling handed down by federal judge Susan Bolton on Wednesday .
Arizona is requesting an expedited appeal to be heard by September 13 , 2010 , which the Department of Justice has already opposed .
The judge ’s ruling blocked “ controversial ” provisions of the bill from taking effect on July 29 , 2010 .
The constitutionality of the de facto president has been questioned by millions due to lack of proof that he meets the requirements set forth in Article II , Section 1 , clause 5 of the U.S. Constitution , which raises the issue of whether or not the Department of Justice has the authority to sue Arizona .
Recently a Republican Senator has voiced his support for lawsuits attempting to force Obama to prove that he is eligible to serve .
Some lawmakers have questioned the legality of other actions of the Obama regime .
Following the judge ’s ruling on Wednesday , Arizona Governor Janice Brewer made the following statement , in part :
When I signed the bill on April 23rd , I said , SB 1070 – represents another tool for our state to use as we work to address a crisis we did not create and the federal government has actively refused to fix .
The law protects all of us , every Arizona citizen and everyone here in our state lawfully .
And , it does so while ensuring that the constitutional rights of ALL in Arizona are undiminished – holding fast to the diversity that has made Arizona so great .
I will battle all the way to the Supreme Court , if necessary , for the right to protect the citizens of Arizona .
Meanwhile , I also know we still have work to do in confronting the fear - mongers , those dealing in hate and lies and economic boycotts that seek to do Arizona harm .
Judge Susan Bolton ruled that most of the provisions of the law should not be implemented .
Bolton has reportedly received “ some threats ” as a result of her decision as well as supportive phone calls and emails .
Some of Bolton ’s experience in dealing with immigration cases is detailed here .
While the referenced article is entitled “ Judge who ruled on Arizona law is well versed in immigration cases , ” this writer takes exception to the evidence presented to support that contention .
One lawyer stated that Judge Bolton did not even have the authority to hear the case , citing Federalist No. 81 , paragraph 13 , and Article III , Section 2 , clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution , which reads :
In all Cases affecting Ambassadors , other public Ministers and Consuls , and those in which a State shall be Party , the supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction .
In all the other Cases before mentioned , the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction , both as to Law and Fact , with such Exceptions , and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make .
A recent report from the governor ’s section of the Arizona government website indicates that illegals are frequently found by the Border Patrol on the Arizona side , some of them admitted gang members or who already have warrants out for their arrest .
Some are in need of , and receive from the American taxpayer , medical care on the spot or at local hospitals .
Many have been caught transporting drugs across the border .
The Southern Arizona Project Fiscal Year 2009 Fact
Sheet reports that illegal immigrants impact the land by littering “ layup ” locations with trash , clothing , abandoned vehicles , and the creation of “ unauthorized roads and trails . ”
On July 22 , Governor Brewer submitted a report to the U.S. House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee ’s Subcommittee on Border , Maritime and Global Counterterrorism which stated that “ The issues are not new and the federal government has neglected to solve them for over a decade or longer . ”
The Tenth Amendment Center cites “ Thirty Enumerated Powers ” which were assigned to Congress in the Constitution .
A comprehensive history of U.S. immigration law can be found here , including the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 ( IIRIRA ) passed by Congress and signed by President Bill Clinton wherein the number of Border Patrol agents was doubled and which “ mandated the construction of fences at the most heavily trafficked areas of the U.S. - Mexico border . ”
The Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states :
The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people .
Photos of local television coverage of a protest staged yesterday in Phoenix , AZ regarding the implementation of the parts of the immigration law not blocked are here .
Some protesters were reportedly arrested , and Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio was quoted as having said that “ nothing in Bolton ’s ruling prevented him from continuing his sweeps , ” despite protesters “ chaining themselves to the building . ”
Some have compared the Rhode Island governor ’s 2008 Executive Order regarding illegal immigration in his state to the Arizona law .
Regarding the federal lawsuit against Arizona , Ernest Huber , candidate for U.S. Congress from Washington State , stated , “ The Obamunists are trying to misframe the issue to one of immigration , but it ’s not immigration ; it ’s invasion . ”
China ’s 2,000 Year Temperature History
While Mann claims his hockey stick science to be “ vindicated ” , we have this from World Climate Report , a new peer reviewed study that illustrates that the current warm period we live in is neither unique nor unprecedented .
They also manage to point out the key issue , the uncertainty of proxies such as used by Mann et al .
– Anthony
We constantly hear that the warmest years on record have all occurred in the most recent decades , and of course , we are led to believe this must be a result of the ongoing buildup of greenhouse gases .
In most places , we have approximately 100 years of reliable temperature records , and we wonder if the warmth of the most recent decades is unusual , part of some cyclical behavior of the climate system , or a warm - up on the heels of a cold period at the beginning of the record .
A recent article in Geophysical Research Letters has an intriguing title suggesting a 2,000 year temperature record now exists for China – we definitely wanted to see these results of this one .
The article was authored by six scientists with the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing , the State University of New York at Albany , and Germany ’s Justus - Liebig University in Giessen ; the research was funded by the Chinese Academy of Sciences , National Natural Science Foundation of China , and the United States Department of Energy .
In their abstract , Ge et al. tell us “ The analysis also indicates that the warming during the 10 – 14th centuries in some regions might be comparable in magnitude to the warming of the last few decades of the 20th century . ”
From the outset , we knew we would welcome the results from any long - term reconstruction of regional temperatures .
The authors begin noting that “ The knowledge of past climate can improve our understanding of natural climate variability and also help address the question of whether modern climate change is unprecedented in a long - term context . ”
We agree !
Ge et al. explain that :
“ Over the recent past , regional proxy temperature series with lengths of 500 –2000 years from China have been reconstructed using tree rings with 1 – 3 year temporal resolution , annually resolved stalagmites , decadally resolved ice - core information , historical documents with temporal resolution of 10 – 30 years , and lake sediments resolving decadal to century time scales . ”
However , the authors caution “ these published proxy - based reconstructions are subject to uncertainties mainly due to dating , proxy interpretation to climatic parameters , spatial representation , calibration of proxy data during the reconstruction procedure , and available sample numbers . ”
Ge et al. used a series of multivariate statistical techniques to combine information from the various proxy methods , and the results included the reconstruction of regional temperatures and an estimate of uncertainty for any given year .
They also analyzed temperature records from throughout China over the 1961 to 2007 period and established five major climate divisions in the country ( Figure 1 ) .
Figure 1 . Types , lengths , and locations of proxy temperature series and observation used in the Ge et al. study .
The five climate regions were based on a “ factor analysis ” of the 1961 –2007 instrumental measurements .
Grey shading indicates elevation ( from Ge et al. , 2010 ) .
The bottom line for this one can be found in our Figure 2 that shows the centennially - smoothed temperature reconstruction for the five regions of China .
With respect to the Northeast , Ge et al. comment “ During the last 500 years , apparent climate fluctuations were experienced , including two cold phases from the 1470s to the 1710s and the 1790s to the 1860s , two warm phases from the 1720s to the 1780s , and after the 1870s .
The temperature variations prior to the 1500s show two anomalous warm peaks , around 300 and between approximately 1100 and 1200 , that exceed the warm level of the last decades of the 20th century . ”
The plot for the Northeast shows warming in the 20th century , but it appears largely to be somewhat of a recovery from an unusually cold period from 1800 to 1870 .
Furthermore , the plot shows that the recent warming is less than warming that has occurred in the past .
Figure 2 .
Five regionally coherent temperature reconstructions with 100 - year resolution ; the dashed line is the part with fewer series used ; and the solid line is the mean value .
The shaded areas are the two coldest periods , during the 1620s –1710s and 1800s –1860s ( from Ge et al. , 2010 ) .
The Central East region also has a 2,000 year reconstruction and Ge et al. state “ The 500 - year regional coherent temperature series shows temperature amplitude between the coldest and warmest decade of 1.8°C .
Three extended warm periods were prevalent in 1470s –1610s , 1700s –1780s , and after 1900s .
It is evident that the late 20th century warming stands out during the past 500 years .
Considering the past 2000 years , the winter half - year temperature series indicate that the three warm peaks ( 690 s –710s , 1080s –1100s and 1230s –1250s ) , have comparable high temperatures to the last decades of the 20th century . ”
No kidding – the plot for the Central East region shows that the warmth of the late 20th century was exceeded several times in the past .
Commenting on the Tibet reconstruction , Ge et al. state “ The warming period of twenty decadal time steps between the 600s and 800s is comparable to the late 20th century . ”
In the Northwest , they note “ Comparable warm conditions in the late of 20th century are also found around the decade 1100s . ”
Unfortunately , no long - term reconstruction was possible for the Southeast region .
In summarizing their work , Ge et al. report :
From Figure 3 [ our Figure 2 –eds . ] , the warming level in the last decades of the 20th century is unprecedented compared with the recent 500 years .
However , comparing with the temperature variation over the past 2000 years , the warming during the last decades of the 20th century is only apparent in the TB region , where no other comparable warming peak occurred .
For the regions of NE and CE , the warming peaks during 900s –1300s are higher than that of the late 20th century , though connected with relatively large uncertainties .
We get the message – the recent warming in at least several regions in China has likely been exceeded in the past millennium or two , the rate of recent warming was not unusual , and the observed warming of the 20th century comes after an exceptionally cold period in the 1800s .
Declaring that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have pushed modern temperature beyond their historical counterparts disregards the lessons of 2,000 years of Chinese temperatures .

Exclusive interview with music producer Joey Sturgis
If you have n’t yet heard of Joey Sturgis , you might be too old you will soon .
He is very quickly becoming the CLA of my generation and the go - to guy for modern hard rock .
His success has earned him a lot of fans and even more critics .
Recently he started releasing drum and cymbal sample libraries from some of the records he ’s done .
Over the weekend I had the pleasure of interviewing Joey via email .
When did you start recording and producing ?
I started recording when I was about 19 years old ( 2004 ) .
I played drums in several bands around that time and it came time for us to create a demo , so I learned what was necessary to do it on my own .
My friend had a make shift recording studio in his garage and he lent me the key .
What gear were you using back then ?
We had a custom built pc running Windows 98SE , the interface was an Aardvark Q10 ( PCI based ) .
We had Behringer preamps and a Behringer mixer .
It was the worst of the worst .
Wow , that ’s pretty ghetto even for 2004 , ha ha .
You must have been doing something right though because it was n’t long before you were making records for Rise Records , producing The Devil Wears Prada , Miss May I , and Attack Attack !
among others .
Yeah after The Devil Wears Prada got signed from the EP I made for them , the label owner caught wind of me and took some interest .
Prada came back to me for the full length .
The album was successful and then i went on to do a few more projects on my own before helping to realizing the creation of before their eyes with a few members of past bands I had done demos with prior .
Soon after that , they were signed by rise and once again Craig was seeing my name .
At this point I think he saw real potential in me and decided to give me a call .
He suggested managing my schedule and helping me get bigger better projects .
I was hesitant at first but decided to go for it .
The first email i sent him was this list I had fathomed up , almost as a joke , of demands I wanted from him .
Things like “ I want to do a Metal Blade cd , I want to work with Adam D ” etc .
I knew those things would never happen but somehow Craig helped make every single thing on that list happen .
So for that I am extremely grateful .
Which bands have you worked with in the past year or two ?
In the past two years I have worked with :
Kramus
The Devil Wears Prada
Miss May I
For The Fallen Dreams
The Color Morale
Asking Alexandria
We Came As Romans

In the past year you went from running Nuendo to a full Pro Tools HD 3 rig and back to Nuendo a few months later .
What were some of the reasons for moving to PT HD and what made you decide it was n’t right for you ?
I wanted to move to PT HD because that is what most of the professional world was working on .
Some of my clients were reaching such a big status that there were several talks of having multiple name producers on projects , and in researching these people I discovered they were all in PT .
I figured if I wanted to be included , I had better step up now .
I had 1 year to prepare ahead of time .
Also , in researching PT in general , I discovered some of the advertised features sounded great ( like track gaurantee , and better use of DSP ) .
The biggest feature that drew me towards PT and the one I still miss today is Elastic Audio .
After learning PT , and even getting the hang of its quirks and bugs , I began a few of my “ big projects ” of the year in PT .
Everything was going smooth with the audio end of things ….
then came keyboards .
I do most of my production effects , and all of my keyboards using plugins and virtual instruments .
Unfortunately , I have to say that Avid does not win on this one .
It is so picky about plugins and plugin stability that you might as well mic a keyboard amp …
Seriously .
I had to move on , because most of “ my sound ” comes from post production , and PT was n’t giving me any stability during post production .
Some projects actually stopped opening towards the end .
I had to rebuild from raw audio in Cubendo to finish .

Your production and mixing style is very modern and polished .
For some reason it seems to polarize opinions on the internet .
Countless arguments and flamewars have been started at the mere mention of your name and techniques .
Why do you think that is ?
It ’s human nature .
I think anyone involved in this industry has their own idea of how things should sound .
Listeners have their own taste in what they want to hear .
Fans are the result of these two things matching .
It does n’t always match , and it does n’t need to .
At the end of the day , I ’m just a guy that helps these people be creative and entertain other people .
There ’s definitely a lot of in - between stuff that could be said , but at it ’s core its an age old concept .
We ’re all just trying to make people feel something by what we create .
I think the criticism helps me to grow .
At the same time , criticism is just the result of a personal opinion .
Everyone ’s got their own opinion .
In the end , you ’ve just got to do what YOU think is right .
Why do you think so many young guys , new to recording , try to copy you and get your sound ?
Is this weird for you ?
I think my sound is “ popular ” .
In the 90′s you had literal pop-music , and it had a certain sound to it .
Well , I think what I ’ve done today is created the “ pop ” sound of these up - start heavy bands ( metalcore / hardcore ) .
If these band ’s have fans , its inevitable that there will be people who want to produce music with a similair sound .
Parts of this are weird for me , because I sit in my control room day in and day out listening to the sonic characteristics of what I ’m working on and I ’m thinking , “ I have a long way to go to make this sound right . ”
But in terms of producing , I am content .
I am always struggling sonically .
From a sonic perspective its weird , but on the production end of things I can definitely see the correlation .
My productions just sound heavy man !
It ’s the “ it ” factor that people are after .
Many of my clients always tell me “ just put the sturgis on it . ”
They ’re talking about that “ it ” factor when everything comes together and makes the song slam .
Are there any engineers or producers you look up to and inspire you ?
There are several .
I am very inspired by Jason Suecof , Adam D , Andy Sneap , Chris Lord - Alge , Ross Robinson , and many more .
All for different reasons .
On Joey Sturgis Dot Com you ’ve started putting up drum and cymbal samples for sale .
Tell us the story behind these .
After Steven Slate put out SSD , and I had quite a long time to live with them .
Life moved on and people started to pick these sounds out from all the productions using it .
Early on , I began to feel I should be making my own stuff .
When I started getting pretty decent at it , I decided to see what would happen if I tried to sell it my self .
My approach is a little different , and the cost is very low .
It seemed to catch on with some people , so I ’ve kept it going .
I think its cool that I can share the exact same sounds I ’m using in my mixes .
How many more sets of samples do you plan on releasing ?
Well it ’s up in the air because I just wait until I have something good enough and then release it .
But I do n’t plan on stopping .
I sample everyone ’s kit but the turn out is n’t always great .
I could use a drum tech you know .
Hint hint .
Are you only going to add samples for the most recent ( and future ) projects you ’ve worked on or will you dig into the sample library for previous projects over the years ?
I have slowly begun to dig into the older stuff .
The problem is , nothing is labeled very well from back then , and even with contacting the band members , they often have no idea what we actually used either .
It becomes a questionable product at this point , because I can’t even tell the customer what the cymbal is .
I have some real gems , but ca n’t release to the public for reasons such as , only recorded hard hits , or lost the multiple session so I ca n’t go back and remix anything .
Anyone that ’s been following you on Twitter knows that your schedule is crazy .
It ’s not uncommon to see you still mixing at 5 am to meet deadlines .
I ’m sure you love every minute of it .
Any tips for keeping the quality level high while working all day , everyday ?
Ears :
First and foremost , Turn your monitors down .
Then turn your monitors down some more .
Learn to seperate what you hear .
Most of the time I ’m listening to timing , editing , pitch , or something else .
Not the mix .
Listen for mix when you and the song are ready .
Until then , listen for what needs improvement to become ready …
I spend a few months getting to that ready state .
Then the actual mix takes about 30 minutes .
If you ’re mixing for hours and hours , you ’re going to get lost in all the relativity of volume and frequencies and end up with something thats leaning too much in one direction .
Mental :
Be appreciative .
When I start to edit something I just think about how the money I am earning has put this roof over my head and fed me earlier that day .
It really comes full circle when I finish things and just feel grateful to be lucky enough to do this for a living .
When you think about things in the way that none of what you have would exist without these people who you are sharing a creation with , you really gain a lot of patience and determination .
The mental stability that comes from this is what makes it possible .
What is the typical production schedule for a band coming to work with you in your studio ?
The first week or so is pre production , scratch & click tracks , drum sampling , and drum tracking .
Then there ’s a long editing process where I build the final production ready drums .
This means quantizing actual performances / sample replacement , or completing samples and programming .
Then the drum mix is made and printed .
At this point we ’re around the 1/3 or half way mark and from here we alternate guitars + bass with vocals ( instruments one day , vocals the next , repeat ) .
If there are keys , we do them on vocal days instead of vocal editing , and I hire someone to edit the vocals for me .
On the last day we either have a whole album ready for post production , or a whole album ready for vocal editing .
Once vocal editing is finished , post production begins .
This all happens after the band is long gone .
The post production and mixing period is always solo for me .
I send the songs out one by one to the band and we correspond over email .
Then the final is sent off .
This whole process takes about 2 – 2.5 months for every band .
It should be noted that after the 1.5 month mark , I am already starting something else .
So at any given time , I am working on 3 or 4 completely different things each day .
Do you have any advice for young engineers trying to be the next Joey Sturgis ?
Everyone says this , but learn the basics and the fundamentals .
After you ’re book smart , you ’ll still need experience time to vibe with what you know .
I ’m still learning how to approach the sonics of every day things like kick drums and snares .
Also … do n’t take anything for granted , and appreciate what you have .
Are there any bands you ’d like to work with in the future ?
I want to record BTBAM ( Between The Buried and Me ) , haha .
My favorite kind of project is the one that takes you around the world , and to another world .
I love mixing as many different sounds and styles as possible .
Bands like that can put any kind of weird stuff in their music and it will work .
That ’s what I enjoy most .
I would also love to record something like Dimmu Borgir or Behemoth and finally , Dragonforce . =]
What ’s next for Joey Sturgis ?
A day off perhaps ?
Actually you are exactly right .
A month off actually , for the first time in three years .
After that I finish off with Asking Alexandria and then another Sumerian project to be determined ( most likely Born Of Osiris ) .
Then hopefully a studio remodel .

In 2010 , I was a web designer , tired of seeing my work disappear .
I wanted to create something real ; something that would last ; something I could put on my bookshelf .
So , perhaps selfishly , I decided to launch 8 Faces : a printed magazine about type , typography , and lettering .
But it turns out that other people wanted this , too , and we sold out of 8 Faces # 1 in just a couple of hours .
And so it went with all eight of our issues , which were published between July 2010 and May 2014 .
Over the course of 8 Faces ’ life , we interviewed 64 graphic designers , web designers , illustrators , and artists , and set some beautiful type specimens for their eight favourite typefaces .
We also published forewords and essays by a number of thought - leaders in the design industry , making 8 Faces a source of knowledge as well as inspiration .
It 's hard to overestimate the importance of having a solid , memorable name if you want to have a successful show business or literary career .
So if you 're born with a dud moniker , it might not hurt to change it .
Have you ever wondered how some famous writers and performers came up with their pseudonyms ?
Here 's a look at how some notables got their stage names .
1. Snoop Dogg
Snoop Dogg was born Calvin Broadus , but his parents nicknamed him " Snoopy "  because he looked like the famous cartoon beagle .
2. Albert Brooks
Albert Brooks is a brilliantly funny man , but even he might not have made it too far in show business with his birth name : Albert Einstein .
Brooks originally tried to go by his first and middle names , Albert Lawrence , but decided that " sounded like a Vegas singer . "
The name Brooks was already in his family , so he ran with that .
His brother , Bob Einstein , actually kept the family surname when he entered show biz , but even he 's better known by an alias : Super Dave Osborne .
3. Whoopi Goldberg
Whoopi Goldberg took her stage name from the whoopee cushion .
The actress , who was born Caryn Johnson , said that a tendency to break wind led a number of friends and colleagues to accuse her of being " like a whoopee cushion . "
According to Goldberg , she considered going by the name " Whoopi Cushion "  when she advanced her comedy career , but her mother warned her that nobody would take her seriously with such a silly name .
Her mom thought it would be smarter to pair " Whoopi "  with a more serious name and proposed that her daughter use " Goldberg . " 
4. Jackie Chan
Jackie Chan was working at a construction site in Australia when he got his famous nickname : one of his co-workers could n't pronounce Chan 's first name , Kong - sang , so he called him " Little Jack " instead . 
The name soon morphed into " Jackie , "  and stayed that way .
5. Harry Houdini
Harry Houdini was born Ehrich Weiss , but he took on the stage name Harry Houdini as a tribute to famed French magician Jean Eugene Robert - Houdin .
" Harry "  was the Americanized version of his childhood nickname , " Ehrie . " 
6. MC Hammer
MC Hammer got his nickname from his childhood job with the Oakland Athletics .
Eccentric longtime A's owner Chuck Finley loved Stanley Kirk Burrell , the talented kid who danced in the team 's parking lot and eventually became a batboy for the club .
The benevolent owner called him " Little Hammer "  because he thought Burrell looked like " Hammerin ' " 
Hank Aaron .
When Little Hammer picked up the mic , he became MC Hammer .
7. Alice Cooper
Alice Cooper , who was born Vincent Furnier , was supposedly playing with a Ouija board in the late 1960s when a 16th - century witch doctor named Alice Cooper contacted him .
Furnier and his buddies then started a band called Alice Cooper with the magnetic Furnier in the lead role of " Alice . " 
Since the name originally referred to the whole band and not just Furnier , he continues to pay an annual royalty to his old bandmates for the commercial use of the Alice Cooper name .
8. Sugar Ray Robinson
Sugar Ray Robinson was born Walker Smith , Jr. , but once he began to make some noise as a boxer , commentators described his fighting style as " sweet as sugar . " 
So beginning in 1939 , his manager began promoting him as " Sugar Ray Robinson , "  and every future boxer named Ray suddenly had a nickname .
9. Michael Keaton
Michael Keaton was born Michael Douglas .
He changed it because we already had a famous actor by that name .
You may have heard of him .
10 . LL Cool J
LL Cool J stands for " Ladies Love Cool James , "  as you may already know .
What you might not know , though , is that the name was n't necessarily true when it made its debut .
When James Todd Smith and a buddy were 16 years old , they began calling themselves LL Cool J and Playboy Mikey D in the hopes that it would help their stock with the girls they tried to woo .
In a 2008 interview with CBS ' Early Show , LL admitted that the ladies did n't actually love cool James quite yet , saying , " It was just wishful thinking , just hoping for the best . " 
11 . Pee-wee Herman
Paul Reubens '
Pee - wee Herman character got his name from two different sources : Reubens owned a brand of harmonica called a Pee- wee , and he remembered a particularly high - strung grammar school classmate named Herman .
Reubens later told Vanity Fair that he ran with the combination because , " I like that it did n't sound like a made - up name , that it was just kind of cruddy . " 
12 . Sid Vicious
Sid Vicious — who was born John Simon Ritchie , and later went by John Beverley — got his famous stage name from Sex Pistols frontman John " Johnny Rotten " 
Lydon 's old pet hamster , Sid .
The bassist was playing with Lydon 's hamster one day when the rodent bit him and forced him to exclaim , " Your Sid is vicious ! " 
Lydon thought the remark was so amusing that he started calling his friend " Sid Vicious . " 
13 . O. Henry
O. Henry wanted to send out some of his stories when he was a young writer working in New Orleans , but he wanted to use a pseudonym in case the tales were n't very good .
One of his chums suggested that they scour the society page of a local newspaper for a good name , so they read an account of a fashionable ball and settled on the last name Henry .
The writer then said he did n't want a long first name , so his buddy suggested going by an initial .
They decided " O "  was the easiest letter to write , so that 's the initial that went on the stories .
14 . John le Carré
John le Carré was working as a diplomat when he began writing novels , but the British Foreign Office did n't allow its employees to publish under their real names .
The writer , who was born David John Moore Cornwell , claims that he took his pseudonym from a store he saw in London called " Le Carre . "
15 . Iron Eyes Cody
Iron Eyes Cody was one of Hollywood 's most beloved Native American actors throughout the 20th century ; you might remember him as the " Crying Indian "  in the famous " Keep America Beautiful "  ads .
One thing most audiences did n't know , however , was that Cody was actually the son of Sicilian immigrants , not Native American .
For most of his life , though , he maintained that he was actually part Cree and part Cherokee and even married a Native American woman .
This arrangement surely made it easier to land Native American roles than his real name , Espera Oscar de Corti , would have .

Rich people have been in the news a lot this week ( like every other week ) .
And we 've learned some new things about them .
For instance , they are mean .
Also , the lady - rich crave a personal touch .
Advertisement
In addition to the fact that they swim in giant pools of gold coins and you do not , here are some ways the rich are different from average joes :
They 're stingier .
According to a study by Dr. Paul Piff and his team at Berkeley , people who saw themselves as having low " levels of education , income and occupational status " were more likely to give away money to fellow participants than were people who thought they were high - status .
Also , while lower - class participants , on average , thought that 5.6 % of a person 's income should go to charity , richies put that figure at just 2.1 % .
There 's hope , though — a task that was supposed to make rich people feel poorer also made them slightly more generous .
They could also be " primed " with video clips to treat people more nicely .
Writes The Economist , " That suggests the rich are capable of compassion , if somebody reminds them , but do not show it spontaneously . "
They like plain watches .
Advertisement
If they 're really rich , that is .
Writes Robert Frank of The Wall Street Journal , " The most expensive , in - demand watches these days are solid black , ultrathin timepieces with little or no identifying brand markers .
They are designed not to be noticed . "
That 's because some rich people —
Frank calls them " patricians " — like to spend gazillions of dollars on products only recognizable to other patricians .
Sneaky !
Frank breaks other consumers down into " parvenus " ( show - offs who like Louis Vuitton ) , " poseurs " ( status - hungry plebes who like fake Louis Vuitton ) , and " proletarians " ( lumpen peasants who tell time based on whether there is a potato famine yet ) .
Rich guys like business , rich ladies like empathy .
Also according to the Journal , the male rich " see[s ] the wealth - adviser relationship strictly through a business lens " ( this is in contrast to poor people , who do not see the wealth - adviser relationship ) .
The female of the species , meanwhile , craves " empathy , trust and customized advice . "
She does n't just want to know how to make more money — that would be crass .
Instead , she needs tips on how to spend her income on a five trillion dollar rhino - skin watch that looks like a Timex — because otherwise she might have to give some of it to charity .

Monty Python , laser sharks add quirk to grassroots GOP outreach .
GOP policy site nets wacky ideas
What happens when the marketplace of ideas meets the free - for - all medium of the Internet ?
Republicans might be learning the hard way .
Advertisement
House GOP members this week launched a website called America Speaking Out , which encourages visitors to suggest policy initiatives on issues ranging from national security to fiscal accountability — and to vote on the best ideas .
But the site suddenly took on the vibe of a " Saturday Night Live " script .
The fourth most popular idea for improving national security is “ we need to employ some of those invincible black knights from Monty Python and the Holy Grail . ”
Another hot idea was that “ all Americans should bathe in Nuclear Waste .
This has been shown to be an effective tactic in the past of transforming the human body into something more powerful and superhuman .
With a nation of powerful mutants , not only would we prevent ourselves from being invaded , we would have a wildly powerful offense with millions able to fly , shoot lasers from their eyes and take bullets . ”
One poster advises that “ The Republicans need to get as far away from Socialism as possible .
Therefor [ sic ] , they need to shed associations with one of the most socialist figures in our country : Jesus Christ !
Yes , this man took from the rich and gave to the poor . ”
Separately , a number of visitors seem to favor legalizing marijuana .
Their promotion of America Speaking Out , the Republican lawmaker edge on Twitter and a new initiative called YouCut indicate that Republicans think they ’ve taken the lead leveraging social media for grassroots outreach .
Rank - and - file members are touting the initiative on websites from Red State to the Huffington Post and on local political blogs , and GOP leadership made it the subject of their weekly Republican address .
“ We still have more than our share of dinosaurs , but we are dragging our members into the 21st century kicking and screaming , ” says Jason Chaffetz , a Utah freshman who has found his own creative ways to use new media , including recording video chats beside the cot he sleeps on while legislating in Washington .
“ These are the new innovative ways that we have to do both politically and in the Congress . …
Twenty - four months ago , a lot of people were n’t thinking of this stuff , but it ’s imperative if you ’re going to communicate with the masses . ”
Yet , liberals have been having a field day with the barrage of inane ideas on the America Speaking Out site .
The America Speaks
Out project — designed as sort of an crowd - sourced precursor to a 2010 version of Contract with America — is only the latest Republican effort to leverage social media .
Republican Whip Eric Cantor ’s effort to get Americans to vote for spending cuts , YouCut , has also run into a few obstacles .
The DNC is calling it a gimmick and suggesting Americans go on YouCut and vote to end America Speaking Out , saying that its “ electoral purposes … violate ethics laws in using taxpayer dollars for partisan gain . ”
But if Republicans are feeling the heat from the unwanted attention , they are n’t showing it .
In fact , Republicans have used YouCut voting results to force House floor votes on a federal pay freeze and cuts to welfare .
“ We always said from the very beginning that we believe in civil discourse , ” chief deputy whip Kevin McCarthy ( R - Calif . ) , who is in charge of America Speaking Out , told POLITICO .
“ Just like with somebody in a town hall meeting , anything that ’s constructive , they can disagree with our ideas , we ’ll allow that . ”
Republican staffers are now keeping an eye on the posts on America Speaking Out , spokesman Brendan Buck said , “ to make sure it passes the nonsense test . ”
Visitors are still able to argue for policies the party does n’t usually agree with — and , indeed , some of the posts call for universal health care or abortion rights , but the wacky missives seemed to be subsiding in recent days .
“ We ’re very open , as you can see , to having everyone in there .
But we want to keep it focused on the debate , ” McCarthy said .
Political observers agree that Republicans have caught up on their social media outreach , and that there are electoral implications for the party in power .
“ Democrats did a great job on new technology in 2008 , but Republicans have really caught up this year , ” says Darrell West , vice president and director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution .
“ It reflects what ’s going on at a grass - roots level — in '08 it was progressive groups that were really upset , got organized and elected a president .
Now the anger is on the right , and those people are being very aggressive about making their voices heard .
The Republicans are the beneficiary of what ’s happening at the grass - roots level . ”
Of course , some of those grass - roots are still warning that “ sharks with laser beams ” attached to their heads are a grave threat to America .

Ms Harman 's home was one of five where the wifi network was tested Google 's popular Street View project may have collected personal information of members of Congress , including some involved in national security issues .
The claim was made by leading advocacy group , Consumer Watchdog which wants Congress to hold hearings into what data Google 's Street View possesses .
Google admitted it mistakenly collected information , transmitted over unsecured wireless networks , as its cars filmed locations for mapping purposes .
Google said the problem began in 2006 .
The issue came to light when German authorities asked to audit the data .
The search giant said the snippets could include parts of an email , text , photograph , or even the website someone might be viewing .
" We think the Google Wi-Spy effort is one of the biggest wire tapping scandals in US history , " John Simpson of Consumer Watchdog told BBC News .
Drive - by spying
The group conducted an experiment to highlight the vulnerability some users expose themselves to by retracing the same routes , used by Street View cars , to detect unencrypted or open networks .
The Street View car takes photos for the service
This practice is often described as " drive - by spying " and is favoured by criminals who trawl the streets to find houses or businesses using unencrypted wifi , so they can steal financial information .
Google has stressed all along that someone would need to be using the network as their cars passed by and that the in - car wifi equipment automatically changes channels roughly five times a second .
Consumer Watchdog focused on a number of high profile politicians whose homes appear on Google 's Street View maps .
It found that Congresswoman Jane Harman , who heads the intelligence sub committee for the House 's Homeland Security Committee , has an open home network that could have leaked out vital information that could have been picked up by Street View vehicles .
Ms Harman 's office has not responded to calls for comment on the issue .
Consumer Watch said it did not collect any information but did pinpoint where unsecure networks could be found .
" Our purpose was to show that members of Congress are targets just as much as every other citizen in the land " said Mr Simpson .
' Concerns '
The experiment found that a further four residences it checked had vulnerable networks in the vicinity that may belong to members of Congress .
This included the home of Congressman Henry Waxman , chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee , which has jurisdiction over internet issues .
The ability to tap into open networks is a major security issue
His office told BBC News that " Chairman Waxman has previously raised concerns about Google " which were contained in a letter sent to company chief executive Eric Schmidt in May .
At that time , Mr Waxman said the Committee was " interested in the nature of this data collection , the underlying technology your fleet of Street View cars employed , the use of the information collected , and the impact it could have on consumer privacy " .
The Computer & Communications Industry Association , CCIA , said the tactics used by Consumer Watchdog left a lot to be desired .
" What Consumer Watchdog did was not a useful contribution to what could and should be a broader online privacy debate , " said CCIA president Ed Black .
" They detected unsecured wifi networks that anyone , including neighbours , can pick up .
It proves nothing about what , if anything , a person or company like Google might have done to intercept and record data . "
' Major progress ' Consumer Watchdog wants Congress to hold hearings on the issue and ensure that Google boss Mr Schmidt be made to testify under oath .
In a statement , Google wrote " as we 've said before , it was a mistake for us to include code in our software that collected payload data , but we believe we did nothing illegal .
We 're continuing to work with the relevant authorities to answer their questions and concerns " .
That includes German authorities who said it was still waiting to receive a copy of data gathered by the Street View cars .
The office of Johannes Caspar , the head of the Hamburg Data Protection Authority , told the BBC that a deadline set for earlier this week was extended at Google 's request because of the recent 4th of July national holiday .
" We expect some - and hopefully major - progress early next week , " said spokesman Ulrich Kuhn .

We ’re delighted to this week bring you an exclusive FACT mix from Bristol dubstep trailblazer Pinch .
Pinch , real name Rob Ellis , has been a significant presence in our musical lives since his brutalist debut 12 ″ ‘ War Dub ’ , released via his own aptly named Tectonic label back in ’05 .
Ellis ’s more reflective 2006 Planet Mu single ‘ Qawwali ’ – among the best and most distinctive dubstep records ever made – paved the way for Underwater Dancehall , his debut album of 2007 .
Featuring a number of wisely chosen guest vocalists , including Juakali and house diva Yolanda , Underwater Dancehall stands up as one of the most coherent , sophisticated and satisfying dancefloor - derived albums of the noughties , and , as far as dubstep LPs go , it ’s perhaps second only to Burial ’s brace in terms of vision , ambition and virtuoso execution .
In the three years that have elapsed since then , Pinch has continued to work his fingers to the bone as a DJ and producer , releasing singles not only through Tectonic but also Punch Drunk , Soul Jazz and most recently Dancing Demons .
As a label - owner and A&R he ’s shown incredible commitment and integrity , rigorously maintaining Tectonic ’s dubstep core while being bold enough to signmore leftfield offerings such as Pursuit Groove ’s recent Foxtrot Mannerisms EP .
A roll - call of some of the producers who ’ve released 12 ″s and LPs on Tectonic , or contributed productions to its Tectonic Plates compilations , says it all : 2562 , Flying Lotus , Skream , Peverelist , Distance , Shed , Benga , RSD , Loefah …
Interestingly , Tectonic is but one arm of the musical empire over which Pinch presides .
Formed in 2004 , Multiverse is a creative studio and publishing company that acts as an umbrella to the Tectonic , Kapsize , Earwax , Caravan and Build labels , with a recording and production facility on Bristol ’s Whiteladies Road .
A new double - CD compilation , Dark Matter , celebrates five years of Multiverse , and ranges from the grotty industrial dubstep of Vex’d to the springy UKF - inflected house of Baobinga & ID , via the subtle techno variations of October and Emptyset and the super - saturated purple funk of Joker .
More than just a collection of tasty tracks , Dark Matter enshrines a hugely important spasm of creativity in Bristol , one which has seen it shed its early noughties reputation as a d ’n’b ghost - town to become , once again , the envy of the global underground .
Dark Matter is out now ; for more information and tracklist , click here , and buy your copy here .
To celebrate the release of Dark Matter , not to mention his new quarterly DJ residency at London ’s Fabric , Pinch has put together a 100 % vinyl and acetate mix for FACT that ’s absolutely stuffed with as - yet - unreleased material .
There are a bunch of new tracks from Skream ( ‘ Amitystep ’ , ‘ Phatty Druma ’ ) and Mala ( ‘ 2 Much Chat ’ ‘ Answer Me ’ ) , Peverelist & Appleblim ’s take on Bass Clef ’s ‘ Promises ’ , Pinch remixed by Pangaea and remixing WAX ( aka Shed ) as well as repping with three originals of his own ( ‘ The Boxer ’ , ‘ Elements ’ and ‘ Swish ’ ) .
There ’s further dubplate action from Jack Sparrow , Redlight , Distance and Goth Trad .

Attention wannabe supervillains : Putting your own , personal satellite into orbit is not such a far - fetched idea after all .
Interorbital Systems , which makes rockets and spacecraft , created a kit last year that lets almost anyone with a passion for electronics and space build a satellite .
The $ 8,000 kit includes the price of the launch .
The company is now ready to launch its first sub-orbital test flights in California next month .
" $ 8,000 ?
That 's just the price of a cool midlife crisis , " says Alex " Sandy " Antunes , who bought one of the kits for a project that will launch on one of earliest flights .
" You could buy a motorcycle or you could launch a satellite .
What would you rather do ? "
The hexadecagon - shaped personal satellite , called TubeSat , weighs about 1.65 pounds and is a little larger than a rectangular Kleenex box .
TubeSats will be placed in self - decaying orbits 192 miles above the earth 's surface .
Once deployed , they can put out enough power to be picked up on the ground by a hand - held amateur radio receiver .
After operating for a few months , TubeSat will re-enter the atmosphere and burn up .
" It is a pico satellite that can be a very low - cost space - based platform for experimentation or equipment testing , " says Randa Milliron , CEO and founder of Interorbital Systems .
About 20 kits have been sold and 14 more are in the process of being handed over to customers , says Milliron .
Once the bastion of NASA and commercial satellite services , space has now become the final frontier for the do - it - yourselfer next door .
Several companies are developing space products that range from orbiting payloads to lunar landers .
The burgeoning private space industry has even spawned companies planning space hotels .
And last month , SpaceX , a company founded by Tesla and PayPal 's Elon Musk , successfully launched its Falcon 9 rocket into orbit .
TubeSat is different because it lets and hobbyist engineers and astronomers build the satellite themselves .
Each TubeSat kit includes the satellite 's structural components , a printed circuit board , Gerber files ( essentially blueprints ) , electronic components , solar cells , batteries , transceiver , antennas , microcomputer and some programming tools .
" It 's not as easy as building a little car model from a hobby shop , but it is doable with a soldering iron and a little practice , " says Antunes .
" A single person in their basement can build this satellite . "
A fully built satellite must be returned to Interorbital Systems , which will launch it into space .
TubeSat could be used for applications such as biological experiments , testing of electronic components in space , or video imaging from space .
It does n't always have to be a scientific experiment .
Antunes ' project , called Project Calliope , will use magnetic , thermal and light sensors to detect information in the ionosphere and transmit the data back to earth in the form of sound .
That sound is almost like space music , he says .
" Just like people have taken ambient sound and used it in music , artists can take this and create something out of it . " says Antunes .
Antunes , who got his personal satellite kit a few months ago , says the equipment for Project Calliope is almost ready but he still has to put together the kit .
" I need a DIY person to make the boards , get the extra electronics , add the instruments and hook everything together , " he says .
" The project management takes much longer than the technology . "
Once the TubeSat satellite is ready , Antunes hopes to start testing the equipment for his Project Calliope to ensure the electronics can withstand the rigors of space , including the shaking during launch .
" A lot of off - the - shelf electronics does well in space because you do n't have to worry about about water or weather , " says Antunes .
" But it still has to be tested for vacuum , shielded from the sun and the cold . "
And after all , if the launch fails , Antunes is n't worried .
Interorbital Systems has promised him a free second attempt .

Please read English Transcript here Bibi :... The Arabs are currently focusing on a war of terror and they think it will break us .
The main thing , first of all , is to hit them .
Not just one blow , but blows that are so painful that the price will be too heavy to be borne .
The price is not too heavy to be borne , now .
A broad attack on the Palestinian Authority .
To bring them to the point of being afraid that everything is collapsing ... Woman :
Wait a moment , but then the world will say " how come you 're conquering again ?
" Netanyahu : the world wo n't say a thing .
The world will say we 're defending .
Woman :
Are n't you afraid of the world , Bibi ?
Netanyahu : Especially today , with America .
I know what America is .
America is something that can easily be moved .
Moved to the right direction .
Child :
They say they 're for us , but , it 's like ... Netanyahu :
They wo n't get in our way .
They wo n't get in our way .
Child :
On the other hand , if we do some something , then they ... Netanyahu :
So let 's say they say something .
So they said it !
They said it !
80 % of the Americans support us .
It 's absurd .
We have that kind of support and we say " what will we do with the ... "
Look .
That administration [ Clinton ] was extremely pro-Palestinian .
I was n't afraid to maneuver there .
I was not afraid to clash with Clinton .
I was not afraid to clash with the United Nations .
I was paying the price anyway , I preferred to receive the value .
Value for the price .
In the following segment , Bibi boasts about how he emptied the Oslo Accords of meaning by an interpretation that made a mockery of them :
Woman : The Oslo Accords are a disaster .
Netanyahu : Yes .
You know that and I knew that ... The people [ nation ] has to know ... What were the Oslo Accords ?
The Oslo Accords , which the Knesset signed , I was asked , before the elections : " Will you act according to them ? " and I answered : " yes , subject to mutuality and limiting the retreats . "
" But how do you intend to limit the retreats ? "
" I 'll give such interpretation to the Accords that will make it possible for me to stop this galloping to the ' 67 [ armistice ] lines .
How did we do it ?
Narrator : The Oslo Accords stated at the time that Israel would gradually hand over territories to the Palestinians in three different pulses , unless the territories in question had settlements or military sites .
This is where Netanyahu found a loophole .
Netanyahu :
No one said what defined military sites .
Defined military sites , I said , were security zones .
As far as I 'm concerned , the Jordan Valley is a defined military site .
Woman : Right [ laughs ] ... The Beit She 'an Valley .
Netanyahu : How can you tell .
How can you tell ?
But then the question came up of just who would define what Defined Military Sites were .
I received a letter -- to me and to Arafat , at the same time -- which said that Israel , and only Israel , would be the one to define what those are , the location of those military sites and their size .
Now , they did not want to give me that letter , so I did not give the Hebron Agreement .
I stopped the government meeting , I said : " I 'm not signing . "
Only when the letter came , in the course of the meeting , to me and to Arafat , only then did I sign the Hebron Agreement .
Or rather , ratify it , it had already been signed .
Why does this matter ?
Because at that moment I actually stopped the Oslo Accord .
Woman :
And despite that , one of our own people , excuse me , who knew it was a swindle , and that we were going to commit suicide with the Oslo Accord , gives them -- for example -- Hebron ... Netanyahu : Indeed , Hebron hurts .
It hurts .
It 's the thing that hurts .
One of the famous rabbis , whom I very much respect , a rabbi of Eretz Yisrael , he said to me : " What would your father say ? " I went to my father .
Do you know a little about my father 's position ?...
He's not exactly a lily - white dove , as they say .
So my father heard the question and said : " Tell the rabbi that your grandfather , Rabbi Natan Milikowski , was a smart Jew .
Tell him it would be better to give two percent than to give a hundred percent .
And that 's the choice here .
You gave two percent and in that way you stopped the withdrawal .
Instead of a hundred percent . "
The trick is not to be there and be broken .
The trick is to be there and pay a minimal price .
" At a point in the middle of the video Netanayhu asks the camera man to stop taping , but he continues ... Netanyahu says what he really thinks for the first time :
He brags about how easy is to manipulate the USA and he proudly explains how he sabotaged the Oslo processGordon Levy @ Haaretz has also written about this video : Source Video and translation from Youtube
A 47 - year - old man ’s friends set his prosthetic leg on fire after he lost a drinking bet , causing him to suffer severe burns to his buttocks and lower back .
Dona Ana County sheriff ’s deputies found the man naked on the side of U.S. Route 70 with his prosthetic leg in flames .
Deputies learned that the man and his friends were drinking Monday and bet that whoever drank the least would be set on fire .

The man told investigators that at six beers , he drank the least , and agreed to let his friends set him on fire .
He said his friends ignited his prosthetic leg , and the flames spread to his body .
The sheriff ’s office said the man took his clothes off because of the pain and his friends decided to take him to the hospital .
But they got nervous and instead dropped him off on the side of the highway .
The man was taken to a Texas burn treatment center .

Penn State knows how to look after its own .
Avoiding difficult questions and clearing Michael Mann of anything .
And this is just the latest in a string of so - called investigations into dodgy practices exposed by Climategate , all of which have , amazingly , found nothing wrong !
How ’s that for consistency ?
The ABC gleefully reports :
American climate change scientist Michael Mann has been cleared of manipulating his research findings .
The allegations arose in the ‘ climategate ’ scandal which erupted when emails between Dr Mann and other scientists were taken [ er , leaked , more likely ] from a computer at the University of East Anglia in Britain and posted on the internet .
The Pennsylvania State University findings follow two other investigations in Britain effectively exonerating climate scientists accused of misconduct .
[ Whitewash , whitewash , whitewash ]
Dr Mann ’s data adjustment procedures in particular were called into question when private email messages between him other scientists were posted on the internet .
The Pennsylvania university received a number of complaints about its professor ’s conduct and it launched two separate investigations in response .
They looked broadly at whether Dr Mann had falsified , suppressed or destroyed data , or deviated from accepted research practices .
In a surprising display of balance , however , the ABC also quotes a view critical of the investigation :
But John Roskam , executive director of the Melbourne - based free - market think tank the Institute of Public Affairs , says questions still remain over Dr Mann ’s research .
“ This was not an independent review – this was effectively the university examining itself and the result is entirely predictable , ” he said .
“ The university was highly unlikely to be critical of one of its most high - profile academics who has received hundreds of thousands of dollars in research grants . ”
Mr Roskam says the four separate ‘ climategate ’ inquiries – two in Britain and now two in the US – are all compromised .
“ The reviews did not answer the questions about why data was missing ; why data was not shared ; why there has n’t been a full and open , transparent process , ” he said .
“ Unfortunately many people still think that these reviews and processes are part of a general lack of transparency about the whole climate change debate . ” ( source )
And Marc Morano sums up the whole shabby affair :

The study says climate change may drive up to 6.7 m
Mexicans across the border into the US by 2080
A warming climate could see millions of adult Mexicans migrate to the US as rising temperatures cause a drop in crop yields , according to a study by researchers at Princeton University .
For every 10 % of lost crop yields in Mexico , another 2 % of Mexicans are likely to leave their country , the study says .
The research draws a clear connection between climate change and immigration - two heavily debated issues in the US .
It says warming may bring between 1.4 m and 6.7 m Mexicans to the US by 2080 .
Many climate experts say human activity is contributing to an increasingly warm planet .
And now a team of researchers led by Michael Oppenheimer says rising temperatures affecting crops through floods , droughts , and stronger storms will induce some workers to relocate .
Farmers migration
" Climate change is expected to cause mass human migration , including immigration across international borders , " says the study .
The research , published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , said a 10 % reduction in crop yields would lead an additional 2 % of the population to emigrate .
" It has been well established that farmers do tend to want to migrate when they are not doing so well , " Mr Oppenheimer told the Reuters news agency .
The study used census data from 1995 to 2005 as well as statistics on climate data and crop production , which allowed the group to calculate a projected rate of migration .
According to a variety of " warming scenarios " , the researchers estimated that by the year 2080 , between 1.4 million and 6.7 million adult Mexicans ( or 2 % to 10 % of the current population aged 15 - 65 ) would seek to emigrate to the US .
Mr Oppenheimer , a member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , said the findings drew attention to " the need to grapple with greenhouse gases " .
Experts say these findings are also relevant to other regions around the world , from Africa to Australia - where Mr Oppenheimer 's team predicts migration will become a " significant issue " .
The study on Mexican migration comes after last month was declared by scientists to be the hottest June on record .
Roughly 6.7 million of the 11 million undocumented immigrants believed to be in the US are from Mexico .
Meanwhile , a new immigration law is set to take effect on 29 July in the US state of Arizona , which will make it a crime to be in the state without immigration papers .
Image caption Klingon Assault Group lands in Vulcan - but did they come in peace ?
Fewer than 2,000 people live in the small prairie town of Vulcan in Alberta , Canada .
But the town sees its population swell every June as it trades on its name and its association with Vulcan , the home planet of Mr Spock in Star Trek .
Fans in costume , or wearing Spock 's signature pointy ears , come from around the world for Vulcan 's annual three - day Star Trek convention : the " VulCON Spock Days Galaxyfest " .
I thought it was about time Star Trek did something for the town of Vulcan Mr Spock actor Leonard Nimoy
Hard - core enthusiasts , or Trekkies , admire the town and its replica of the USS Enterprise .
Vulcan even has a tourism centre designed to look like a spacecraft coming in to land .
" The whole community gets involved , " says Cricket Courtney , who travelled from the US and dressed as a Klingon , the villains of the show , for last year 's Galaxyfest .
" We went to the bakery where the baker was wearing his Spock ears .
The mayor dresses up in a Star Trek uniform , people come and talk to you on the street , take your picture .
I feel like you come home to Vulcan . "
' Dream come true '
And in April , Mr Spock did just that : he " came home " to Vulcan .
The actor Leonard Nimoy visited the small prairie town where he was greeted by hundreds of fans .
" We have welcomed him and he has a key now , and he can come home whenever he wishes , " says Vulcan 's mayor , Tom Grant .
" It is just so great that he participated in this . "
" I think Leonard Nimoy coming home to Vulcan was probably the biggest event in Vulcan 's history , and it certainly is a dream come true , " says Dayna Dickens , Vulcan 's tourism co-ordinator .
" It has been something people have been dreaming of for years and years . "
Image caption Vulcan 's mayor takes his duties very seriously
Mr Nimoy has developed a relationship with the residents of Vulcan in the last year .
Thanks to his efforts , 300 residents were taken to Calgary to see a preview screening of Star Trek XI .
The town had bid to host a premiere screening , but was turned down - partly because it does not have a cinema .
When Mr Nimoy heard about the failed attempt , he called Paramount Studios and organised a private screening .
" I thought it was only appropriate , since the town of Vulcan has been so supportive of Star Trek and I thought it was about time Star Trek did something for the town of Vulcan , " he said .
Dayna Dickens believes the actor 's endorsement of Vulcan helped double visitor numbers to about 23,800 last year .
She thinks they will rise even further because of the international attention Mr Nimoy 's visit brought to the town .
Vulcan has been declared " Official Star Trek Capital of Canada " by CBS Consumer Products , which handles Star Trek series merchandise for CBS Entertainment .
Ancient history
The Star Trek connection has been a success for the community , but the town 's name has nothing to do with the show .
" No , we were n't named after Mr Spock 's home planet , " explains Dayna .
Image caption Townspeople used to suffer a lot of Vulcan ear jokes - but not any more
" We were actually named Vulcan back in 1910 by a Canadian Pacific Railway surveyor who had a fascination with Roman Mythology , and of course Vulcan is the Roman god of fire in the forge .
" And when he was laying rails in the area he thought that would be a fun name for this community . "
She added : " Fifty - six years later , when Star Trek hit the airwaves , our local sports team started to be teased about the size of their ears .
And from there on our coincidental association with Star Trek just grew and grew . "
That association with Spock 's home planet keeps attracting Trekkies each year .
It allows them to celebrate their fandom without ridicule .
" Star Trek has been something that 's been part of my life since I was a child , and it's about being able to express myself , because it really is about creativity , " explains Cricket Courtney .
" I do costuming , and I get to dress up and can be a warrior when I 'm not usually a warrior . "

Sony 's customers are still in the dark on whether the premium Playstation Plus service will be required to watch Hulu Plus on the Playstation 3 , even as more unverified information comes in .
Last week , I discovered that Hulu Plus on the PS3 may require a Playstation Plus subscription ( $ 50 per year or $ 18 quarterly ) , based on some code hidden in one of Hulu 's Web pages .
I e-mailed Sony and Hulu for a response , but heard nothing .
Sony later dismissed the report as " rumors and speculation , " which is an odd thing to say given that Hulu 's own Web site provided the evidence .
Now , Playstation Lifestyle reports that PS Plus will only be required during Hulu Plus ' preview period .
Invitations for that preview are going out in batches , but there 's no word on when the service will be available to all .
But Playstation Lifestyle 's story does n't come straight from Sony or Hulu , either .
The source may actually be a Reddit commenter who reached out to Hulu 's generic support line .
By Sony 's rules , we can dismiss the second - hand response as " rumors and speculation " as well .
This is n't the first time Sony has gone dark , letting unverified information fill the news vacuum .
At the end of February , owners of non-Slim Playstation 3s discovered that their consoles were n't working , and they risked losing data just by turning on their consoles .
Sony did n't warn people about the data loss until 16 hours after first acknowledging problems .
Meanwhile , PS3 owners were left to fend for themselves in Internet forums , attempting to answer many of the questions
Sony never did .
The Hulu Plus situation is n't as urgent , but with Playstation Plus up and running , subscribers should n't have to get their information from the rumor mill .
Sony should explain Hulu Plus pricing to its customers , either by confirming what we 've seen and heard or acknowledging that the details are still up in the air .
This story , " PlayStation Plus and Hulu Plus : We Need Real Answers " was originally published by Technologizer .
Nine stores in Manhattan and the Bronx have been hit with $ 200 fines for leaving their doors open on hot days in the hope that the escaping cool air would lure sweaty customers .
They are the first to be fined as part of a law enacted in 2008 .
Last year , only warnings were given out .
So far this year , the city ’s Department of Consumer Affairs has inspected 105 stores .
Seventy were in compliance , 26 were issued warnings and 9 that had been warned last year were fined , said Kay Sarlin , a department spokeswoman .
Fines start at $ 200 , and go to $ 400 for any further infractions in the following 18 months .
The legislation states that any business larger than 4,000 square feet or part of a chain with five or more stores in the city must keep its doors closed when using air - conditioning .
Ms. Sarlin said four of the stores were in the Bronx : Jeans Plus , 62 East 170th Street ; Bronx Kidstown , 4100 East 170th Street ; Jimmy Jazz , 101 East 170th Street ; and V.I.M. , 540 Bergen Avenue .
NEW YORK - Thousands of protestors descended on City Hall on Wednesday , in a crowd that stretched up Broadway , all of them out to demand that the city and state fix the budget crisis , which threatens thousands of jobs and necessary public services .
“ Is this New York ? ” United Federation of Teachers president Michael Mulgrew asked the crowd , which responded with cheers .
“ Are we going to save our city ?
Anyone trying to break our city ; what are we going to do ?
We ’re going to stand up .
We always stand up , because this is our city . ”
New York is a place of extremes : while hundreds of thousands live paycheck - to - paycheck .
The city is also home to the Wall Street firms that brought the U.S. economy to its knees and bankrupted municipal and state governments across the country .
The mayor of New York is one of the 20 richest people in the world .
“ We do n’t care about the 15 percent that they care about , ” Hazel Dukes , president of the New York State NAACP , said , referring to what many perceive as the Bloomberg administration ’s prioritizing of the needs of the superrich and Wall Street over working people .
“ We care about the working men and women of this city who have their children to rear , who have their households to pay . ”
Both the city and the state are short on their budgets .
The deadline for passage of the state budget was April 1 , but it has been held off as Albany has not been able to agree on how to fill a $ 9.2 billion deficit .
The city , whose budget is due next month , faces a $ 4.9 billion deficit .
Both Governor David Paterson and Mayor Michael Bloomberg have argued that there should be spending cuts with little done to raise revenue .
Barbara Bowen , president of the Professional Staff Congress , which represents professors at City University of New York colleges , accused Bloomberg of “ disaster capitalism , ” in which “ you wait for a disaster to come along and then you use that to sweep away public services , public workers . ”
The disaster , Bowen said , is being created by the mayor .
The “ Save our City ” rally was initiated first by AFSCME District Council 37 , which represents 125,000 public workers , and the United Federation of Teachers .
A number of other unions , including CWA locals , Teamsters , TWU Local 100 , the firefighters union and a host of others mobilized for it .
A number of community organizations , including NAACP and several religious coalitions also mobilized .
City Comptroller John Liu , who uses his elected position to advocate for working people , criticized Mayor Bloomberg ’s proposed budget , saying that billions of dollars were being wasted on private contractors performing tasks that unionized city workers could perform - at a lower cost .
“ There are places that we can cut , ” Liu said , “ without hurting people . ”
Organizers estimated the rally ’s attendance to be around 20,000 people .
The caption indicates the man being hoisted on the crowd ’s shoulders is an actor with his cast after their show won an award , not the subject of the article leaving town .
A tomato left to rot in the garden last summer resulted this spring in my eating ripe homegrown heirloom tomatoes by Memorial Day instead of the normal harvest time around the Fourth of July .
A fruit dropped in mulch sprouted in October rain , did nicely through winter storms and then , with some watering since May , the vines have been yielding what I 've decided must be Cherokee Purple tomatoes for going on a month .
In terms of flavor , they 're not Black Krims .
No other tomato is .
The word online is that Cherokee Purples rival Brandywines .
That is true .
In other words , they 're good enough that , with heirloom tomatoes of this quality costing $ 3 a pound in farmers markets , I thought I might be on to manna for readers .
So I rang UC Davis ' C.M. Rick Tomato Genetics Resource Center to ask why every gardener in Southern California does n't plant tomatoes with their poppies -- in the fall .
Director Roger Chetelat 's response boiled down to two words : disease and pestilence .
Evidently , allowing plants , including volunteers , to over - winter offers viruses and insect predators safe harbor and is not to be encouraged .
Instead of getting a head start , you could be ensuring the loss of your crop .
I took his point , but I was more chastened by the realization that I had been eating well out of dumb luck .
I had no idea what my plucky little vines were going to yield , and I watered them on a gamble .
Nursing volunteers from fallen fruit or the compost pile in years past has produced some real duds , mainly flavorless approximations of the plum tomatoes used by the canning industry .
It 's the genetics , Chetelat explained .

Is it possible to save a generation without breaking any eggs ?
That ’s the tricky question the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , FedEx and hundreds of volunteers are beginning to answer this week as they dig up more than 70,000 turtle eggs on the gulf shore and transport them to the oil - free beaches of Cape Canaveral , Fla. , where they ’ll be hatched in a warehouse and released into the ocean .
It ’s one of the most ambitious wildlife nest relocations ever attempted , biologists said , a risky experiment to prevent widespread mortality of five threatened and endangered turtle species .
“ This is the largest egg translocation ever done in the U.S. , and possibly in the world , ” said Michelle Pico , director of marine programs at the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation .
“ It ’s a grand experiment . ”
Plans call for digging up hundreds of turtle nests on the Florida Panhandle and 80 in Alabama , each containing about 100 ping - pong sized eggs .
Biologists layer the eggs and wet sand in Styrofoam coolers and load them onto customized , shock - absorbent wood pallets that are transported hundreds of miles in a giant FedEx truck .
Success is far from guaranteed .
Truck vibrations could damage the fragile eggs .
The embryos might detach from the eggs , or their shells could break .
The turtles may not react well to the warehouse in Cape Canaveral .
Hatchlings could be eaten as soon as they swim into the turquoise waters of the Atlantic .
“ The sheer logistical challenges associated with it add a lot of uncertainty , ” said Michael Ziccardi , a veterinarian at UC Davis who is coordinating sea turtle and marine mammal rescue efforts in the gulf .
But there is n’t much of a choice .
Leaving the eggs to hatch on oil - splattered Gulf of Mexico beaches , where baby turtles the size of limes would crawl into oil - tinged waters , will result in certain death , biologists concluded .
For nearly three months the busted BP oil well has been gushing up to 60,000 barrels a day , polluting vast stretches of shoreline during critical turtle nesting season .
Nests have been moved in the past to save eggs from hurricanes or high tides , but are rarely moved such a great distance , said David Godfrey , executive director of the Sea Turtle Conservancy , a nonprofit rescue group in Florida .
Moving a nest has been shown to decrease the number of turtles that survive by about 10 % , although that number comes from studies in which the eggs are moved right after they are laid .
Baby turtles typically swim into the sea and feast on sargassum , seaweed that in the gulf is now soaked with oil .
So far this year , biologists have found 463 dead sea turtles , although only 14 were visibly oiled .
Ziccardi said it is not yet known if the deaths are related to the spill .
Six turtle nests were lost in the high waters of tropical storm Alex .
Even in good conditions , only about 1 in 1,000 turtles survive to adulthood .
Some that hatch near developed coastal areas crawl toward the bright lights of civilization and become disoriented and never make it to sea .
Others get tangled in fishing nets .
An organization called Share the Beach recruits volunteers to find and protect turtle nests along 47 miles of beach in Alabama during egg - laying months , roughly May through October .
Dozens of the group ’s volunteers , clad in bright green shirts and caps , watched this week as their team leader , Sherry Parks , and wildlife biologist Bruce Porter extracted 127 turtle eggs from a nest on a windy Alabama beach dotted with pastel cottages .
Porter donned blue plastic gloves and used his hands to dig a basketball - size hole in the fine white sand , gingerly feeling for the eggs , which were packed 2 feet down .
He marked each white egg with a grease pen , indicating which side was the top .
Parks cautiously lifted the eggs into a cooler , where they were was packed with other eggs from the nest .
Another volunteer , who was wearing a turtle - shaped whistle around her neck , scooped sand from the beach and into the cooler to ensure that the eggs would be incubated in grains from their home turf .
The nest — like others found along this beach lined by seafood restaurants and homes on stilts — was cordoned off by green tape .
A yellow sign warned people to stay away from the nesting grounds .
Yet dozens of gaping tourists watched the excavation from behind a fence as children in bathing suits frolicked nearby in the ocean .
The coolers , akin to a convenience store ice chest , were packed on pallets in a temperature - controlled FedEx big rig and trucked to Florida .
Ron and Margaret - Mary Shellito , the husband - and - wife team driving the 1,000 - plus miles back and forth to Cape Canaveral , have driven NASA ’s Mars Rover and government missiles while working for the transport firm .
But they have never handled turtle eggs .
They take turns sleeping in the small bed in the back of the cab and eat meals from a microwave .
“ Maybe someday down the line our grandchildren can say we were part of saving a species , ” Margaret - Mary Shellito said .
The eggs are left in their coolers and incubated in a climate - controlled warehouse until they hatch and are released into the sea , said Dianne Ingram , a biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service .
There ’s no way to know whether the conditions in the eastern Atlantic will be too different from the gulf for the turtles to survive .
Instinctively , mature female turtles return to the shores where they hatched to lay their eggs .
Scientists do n’t know whether this generation of cooler - hatched turtles will know where to return in about 18 years .
Hatchlings have already emerged from a nest delivered earlier , said Jane A. Provancha , the contractor running the warehouse operation .
On Saturday and Monday evenings , she released 56 baby turtles into the dark waters of the Atlantic and watched them swim away .
Turtles from about 83 % of the eggs in the first nest have emerged and swum out to sea , she said .
“ They looked really great .
They were a little slow at first , but then they started moving around , ” she said .
Added Pat Behnke , a spokeswoman for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission , said the release included 22 endangered Kemp ’s Ridley hatchlings .
“ There ’s a fighting chance , ” Behnke said .
“ We know 22 Kemp ’s Ridleys have a good chance of surviving . ”

When Alfred Hitchcock ’s film Psycho was first released to movie theaters on June 16 , 1960 , it was n’t immediately embraced by critics .
For example , in a review published the next day by the New York Times , film critic Bosley Crowther sniffed that t he ending “ falls quite flat . ”
“ But , ” he added generously , “ the acting is fair . ”
Of course , in the decades since then , Psycho has been recognized as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made .
The performance of Anthony Perkins as the shy but homicidal schizophrenic Norman Bates has become legendary , as has the famed “ shower scene ” in which Janet Leigh ’s character is stabbed to death with a butcher knife .
Leigh ’s performance garnered her an Oscar nomination and a lifetime supply of interviews about the film .
Psycho also includes one of the most famous movie quotes of all time :
“ A boy ’s best friend is his mother . ”
In context , the line is a witty double - entendre , as are many others in the script .
The saying “ A boy ’s best friend is his mother ” is actually an old proverb of uncertain origin .
It was n’t coined by Psycho scriptwriter Joseph Stefano , or by Robert Bloch in his 1959 novel that inspired the film .
And , it had been used less memorably in previous movies , such as The Awful Truth ( 1937 ) , and later ones .
But in Psycho the creepy relationship between lead character Norman Bates and his mother gives the saying an especially dark , drily humorous significance that is apparent once the plot unfolds .
It ’s spoken by Perkins to Leigh early in the film .
Perkins added his own quirky verbal stamp on the scripted line , which is why you sometimes see it quoted as “ A boy ’s best friend is his mother ” ( as written ) and sometimes as “ Well , a boy ’s best friend is his mother . ”
To be precise , what Perkins actually stammers out is “ Well , uh – a boy ’s best friend is his mother . ”
The scene starts when Norman brings Marion a tray of food and invites her to eat it in his back room behind the office , where the walls are covered with dead birds he has stuffed .
Here ’s a transcript of the conversation leading up to the famous quote .
MARION : I ’ve caused you some trouble .
NORMAN : No .
Uh – Mother – m-my mother , uh – what is the phrase ?
– she is n’t quite herself today …
MARION : ( Indicating the tray )
You should n’t have bothered .
I really do n’t have that much of an appetite .
NORMAN : It ’s all for you .
I ’m not hungry .
Go ahead .
( Delightedly watching her eat )
You – you eat like a bird .
MARION : ( Nodding to the stuffed birds )
You ’d know , of course .
NORMAN : No , not really .
Anyway , I hear the expression ‘ eats like a bird ’– is really a fals - fals - falsity .
Because birds really eat a tremendous lot .
But I do n’t really know anything about birds .
My hobby is stuffing things – you know – taxidermy ...
MARION : A man should have a hobby .
NORMAN : ( Sitting back )
Well , it ’s – it ’s more than a hobby .
A hobby ’s supposed to pass the time – not fill it .
MARION : Is your time so empty ?
NORMAN : No , uh – well , I run the office , and uh , tend the cabins and grounds , and – and do little , uh , errands for my mother – the ones she allows I might be capable of doing .
MARION : Do you go out with friends ?
NORMAN : ( Pause )
Well , uh – a boy ’s best friend is his mother .
Once you ’ve seen Psycho and know how it ends , watching this scene makes it even more clear just how amazingly smart and subtly funny it actually is .

With spiky petals that narrow into needle - like tips , a wild artichoke is a scary thing to behold - much less eat .
Yet that 's exactly what more than 100 diners did last month in a dimly lit San Francisco warehouse , peeling off leafy daggers and sharing tips for extracting the tiny nubs of meat inside .
The occasion was an eight - course dinner extravaganza put on by Iso Rabins , the baby - faced , plaid - wearing founder of ForageSF .
The message ?
That there 's more to uncultivated plants than their rough - and - tumble reputation .
" It 's not just about green salads , " Rabins says .
" You can use them in gourmet and delicious ways and make really amazing dishes . "
Foraging , or the sourcing of wild , uncultivated plants for food , is gaining an even wider following in the Bay Area as local and sustainable movements solidify their hold on the dining - out public .
From finding sea beans in marshy Marin County spots to picking wild radishes in San Francisco lots , foragers snuggle up to the environment by incorporating nature 's offerings into their own sustenance .
While the practice does n't come without issues - whether legal , ethical or safety - it has n't stopped people like Rabins from turning foraging into a profession .
Or kept inquiring diners from paying big bucks to try the next eco-oriented dining experience .
Last month 's forage dinner , priced at $ 80 per person , drew more than 130 people over two nights .
Attendees included colleagues at a South Bay biotech company and a Palo Alto mother and two college - age daughters .
The ambitious menu featured dishes like miso - marinated black cod with blood red daikon and quick - fried wild radish greens , wild fennel pesto over handmade gnocchi , black trumpet risotto with braised wild cattails and wild lavender - grilled duck breast , and local albacore tuna tartare with tempura - fried sea beans .
Not that everything actually made it onto the plate .
A forage - based menu , after all , depends on what can actually be foraged in the days leading up to the dinners .
And as Rabins has learned , Mother Nature does n't always cooperate .
The wild fennel did n't look good , so that was out .
Same went for the cattails , which were already past their season .
There was no local tuna available for purchase either , so slabs of local halibut were used instead .
The last - minute changes did n't seem to bother the guests , many of whom had their first encounters with miner 's lettuce , nettle and oxalis flowers .
Between courses , Rabins briefed diners on the origins of the wild produce , sounding especially proud of the sea beans , or pickleweed , as they represented his first haul of the season .
" It changes your relationship with the environment , " Rabins says about his monthly dinners .
( The next ones are Friday and Saturday . )
" If you know that the plants around you have a real value rather than just aesthetic value , it makes you look at your city in a different way . "
Clearly , the curiosity and demand are there .
ForageSF offers educational forage walks , which sell out almost immediately after they are posted online ( go to foragesf.com ) .
Experienced foragers share their knowledge about the ins and outs of the practice , such as getting permission from property owners and making sure the harvest is safe .
Rabins also runs the Underground Market and has plans to reboot his CSF program - the foraged equivalent of the popular farmer - to - consumer CSA , or community - supported agriculture boxes .
Rabins has sold wild mushrooms to Chez Panisse in Berkeley , Pizzaiolo in Oakland and San Francisco 's Incanto and Front Porch .
Plenty of other wild food can be found on Bay Area menus .
In fact , some of the region 's leading chefs , including Daniel Patterson of Coi , Mourad Lahlou of Aziza and David Kinch of Manresa , forage for wild foods .
Patterson is set to launch a new website , Ingredient Lab , which will put a gastronomic spin on uncultivated produce .
It wo n't be a how - to guide to foraging .
" There 's a reason that people have cultivated plants , " Patterson says .

" You start adding these wild accents , some aromatic note that 's unique , and it'll transform the dish . "

Police Violence and Incompetence is no Exception : From Toronto to Abbotsford , Oakland , and beyond
Blog posts are the work of individual contributors , reflecting their thoughts , opinions and research .
A disturbing narrative has emerged in the wake of the resistance to the G20 summit in Toronto , one of police willingly leaving their cars to burn as a provocation , while " permitting " hundreds of demonstrators to reappropriate the city .
( If one were to believe the image of Canadians as portrayed by the press , it would seem for the most part that citizens of this country have an unyielding faith in law enforcement , moulded through a purposeful process of educational and nationalistic indoctrination , the " deferential society " - characterized by respectful submission .
This blind faith in the state , the criminal justice system , the monopoly of " legitimate " violence , and the thousands of armed men and women that enforce it , is of course just that , blind , and I could argue not as widespread as we are lead to believe . )
As has been shown time and again in video footage and articles on the VMC and elsewhere , the police had lost that battle .
With a billion dollars and tens of thousands of heavily armed squadrons of police , they failed to protect the corporate sector and the banks that have invaded and occupied downtown Toronto .
People are having less and less faith in the police as stories emerge every week in different parts of the country of police using unprovoked and unjustified violence against people in our communities .
In Vancouver alone , the tasering murder at the airport and the beating of Yao Wei Wu in East Vancouver are only two of many recent examples .
In the downtown eastside , residents of that neighbourhood are always more than willing to talk about the violence they have suffered at the hands of police , stories that often are n't covered by the mainstream press .
In light of the debate surrounding the G20 resistance , I think that it is important to acknowledge and point out police incompetence and violence , and to not exceptionalize the police reaction to their losing control in Toronto .
Within the past week , police violently attacked a home and detained a family in Abbotsford because they had smelled marijuana and suspected a grow - op .
Excerpts from the victims :
" It was absolutely horrifying .
None of us have any kind of record or history with the police .
My mother has n't even had a traffic violation .
I certainly did n't like seeing my family hauled off to different vehicles , and being handcuffed .
It was heartbreaking . "
" This was the most embarrassing and humiliating thing that has ever happened to any one of us . "
Police response after discovering no drugs :
" Yeah , we screwed up .
We 've been down in this neighbourhood and we noticed the smell of marijuana growing .
Every time we came to this corner it smelled like it came from your house . ' "
Also , this week in Oakland , a policeman was acquitted with involuntary manslaughter after murdering ( shooting in the back ) a subdued African - American man , Oscar Grant , sparking riots and the trashing of a police car .
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeDjJf02fac
The officer 's defense was that he thought he had grabbed his taser instead of his gun ....
These stories and many others all speak to police incompetence and the violent reaction as a result .
I would caution against putting such faith in the police and the positive spin facilitated by their allied press corps .
Let 's not forget about the many stories that constantly emerge , reinforcing the division between the police and the people , and raising light on their perpetual violence while countering efforts that obscure it .
Let 's continue to share these stories .

1. Best Overall - Delta Michelangelo
Specifications : Height : 84 inches
Width : 20 inches
Depth : 16 inches
Max Load : 80 lbs Key Features : Independent , movable support arms with Easy - Adjust
Premium - quality , silver powder - coated finish
Rubber bumpers to prevent scuff marks on the walls
Rubber arm sleeves to prevent damage to your bike ’s finish while holding it securely on arms Delta Cycle Michelangelo Review
We kick off this list with our choice of the best bike stand in the category of “ Best Overall ” .
After analyzing and evaluating multiple contenders , we found the free - standing Delta Cycle Michelangelo a solid pick in this category with its right mix of toughness , stability , functionality , style and affordability .
At the current price of $ 48.99 ( original price discounted by 39 % ) , this attractive bike stand wo n’t drain your savings while elevating your bike using gravity .
Besides using the rack to organize two or four bikes , you can leverage this versatile piece of equipment as a maintenance stand that helps keep your cycle wheels off the ground to enable convenient cleaning under the bikes .
Although lightweight , the frame is sturdy and boasts superior construction featuring durable powder - coated steel with custom molded arm covers .
This stand is available in two styles , which can hold up to two and four bikes each at a time .
So , it is ideal for both small families and an active household of four cyclists .
The 2 - bike style is 84 inches tall and can assume a load of up to 80 lbs or 35kg .
The Delta Cycle Michelangelo is designed as a space - saving storage solution for small spaces and leans against the wall to keep your garage or home clutter - free and that too without requiring any attachment or drilling .
And if you are eyeing added stability by way of anchoring hardware , you have the option of a wall screw to thwart the possibility of any accidental toppling of the rack .
This stand is designed to accommodate any bicycle and comes with infinitely adjustable support arms that provide a secure attachment of any bike to the ladder - like slender frame .
The arm sleeves feature thick rubber protectors to safeguard your bike ’s finish against accidental damage and provide the required grip to prevent your bicycles from sliding .
The rack ’s base is kept solidly in place with its rubber feet while rubber bumpers help keep the walls free from marks .
As for the design , it is practical yet elegant , and the premium silver powder coat finish easily blends with any contemporary interior décor scheme .
Assembly is quick and a matter of a few minutes – made possible with a user - friendly installation video and a fuss - free set - up process .
All essential hardware is included with the stand , and a screwdriver is possibly the only tool you would need to put the unit together .
And with independently movable arms in use , repositioning the arms means tool - free twisting and post - assembly adjustability is impressive .
Two bonus hooks are also included with the Delta Cycle Michelangelo .
We think the accessory hooks are a useful addition to the rack as they offer you handy storage space for bike accessories such as cycling helmets , locks and fenders .
Any drawback with this product ?
No deal - breakers but certain flaws exist .
The accessory hooks , while handy , are easily dislodged if one accidentally grazes against them , especially when they are lightly laden .
Also , while the stand can accommodate any bike , it may not feel as sturdy and stable against the wall when holding MTBs or bikes with rear shocks on the frame .
These two aspects notwithstanding , if you fancy a reasonably priced , well - made and functional floor bike rack with a small footprint and a fairly straightforward installation process , the versatile Delta Cycle Michelangelo could well be what you need to safely stash away more than one bike and a range of cycles at that .
Pros Compact bike storage solution for small spaces
No need for drilling as leans against the wall
Lightweight , attractive and durable design
Adjustable arms for easy repositioning
Suitable for securing any style of bike
Easy to assemble and comes with essential installation hardware Cons May not be a suitable choice for holding MTBs with aggressive geometry or bicycles with rear shocks on the frame
Accessory hooks could be prone to dislodgement and may not stay up well
2. Best Budget - Feedback Sports RAKK
Specifications : Base Footprint Width : 13.5 inches
Base Footprint Depth : 16 inches
Folded Height : 3.2 inches
Weight : 5.9lbs Key Features : Patented bike storage design that can connect and support two or more RAKK stands together
Innovative spring - loaded arm for hands - free usage
Versatile wheel slot can hold 20 mm road tires and up to 2.4 - inch wide mountain bike tires
12 , 13.5 and 15 inches of optional spacing between stands Feedback Sports RAKK Bicycle Stand Review :
If you are not particularly keen on hanging your bicycle up on the ceiling or wall and seeking a free - standing , secure storage solution for your road or mountain bike , the category - defining RAKK bicycle storage stand from Feedback Sports could be an apt choice for you .
This sleek - looking bicycle stand features a space - saving , folding design and boasts a height of 3.2 inches when it is folded .
The base footprint measures 13.5 by 16 inches and there is the provision of leveraging modular attachments to create optional spacing of 12 , 13.5 or 15 inches between stands .
This well - engineered , functional bike stand has diverse applications and makes for a smart storage system for your home , garage , basement or shed .
If you are into the retailing of bikes , you can even use this stylish stand for the purpose of display in your retail bike shop .
The patented design is innovative and versatile , despite its simplicity .
You can make out that enough thought has gone into the design to ensure critical aspects such as functionality and portability are not compromised .
The result is a minimalist yet efficient bike storage system that takes up minimal space and remains sturdy and flexible enough to fit a variety of bikes , including MTBs , road bikes , cyclocross bikes and electric bikes .
Whether you are looking to maximize your bike parking area or seeking an organizer that folds away nicely to keep your room tidy when not in use , the Feedback Sports RAKK works like a charm .
We also appreciate the flexibility that the RAKK brings with it in allowing bike parking with either the front wheel or rear wheel .
The RAKK bike storage stand comes equipped with a spring - loaded arm for hands - free rolling of your bike into the stand ’s wheel slot .
The ingenious design ensures the swing arm provides a secure hold to your cycle , without any risk of scratching rims or spokes .
Plus , there ’s padding on the rack ’s bottom .
So , you do n’t have to worry about the stand leaving marks on your room ’s flooring either .
And if yours is a household with more than one cycling enthusiast , the RAKK ’s convenient modular design will allow you to create a continuous , storage parking space with the aid of add - ons – perfect for storing bikes for the whole family .
With regards to what could improve , we think the clips holding two or more RAKK bike racks together could connect more securely so that they do not become loose and disengage when one tries to pop a bike out of the wheel slot .
We would also like to mention that this bike rack is primarily meant for indoor use .
So , it may not be able to hold up to wind as well as an outdoor storage rack .
Also , the stand could do with a broader base for added stability to hold bikes with fenders , panniers etc .
Considering that none of the above is a major compromise or weakness , the Feedback Sports RAKK , at its discounted price of $ 38.69 , remains a value pick for budget - conscious buyers looking for a well - designed , well - built bike storage solution at a surprisingly affordable price .
Pros Versatile bike storage solution for home , garage , basement or retail shop
Suitable for holding road and mountain bikes alike
Small footprint and ideal for closer areas with space limitations
Can hold either front or rear wheel
Can be folded into a compact unit when not in use
Backed up with a limited one - year manufacturer ’s warranty Cons Modular attachments connecting multiple racks could be more secure
Not the best option for outdoor bike storage

So , what did we find impressive about the Bikehand YC - 100BH ?
First and foremost , the design is smart and intuitive and incorporates flexibility into it by way of a rotatable head .
The head ’s 360 - degree rotation is facilitated by a quick release and a turning knob , and the patented rotating clamp can firmly hold a bike at any angle , thus making it convenient for you to execute repairs on different parts of your cycle .

With a maximum load capacity of 25kg or 55 lbs , this work stand can hold both road and mountain bikes and will work well with fixed gear bikes .
However , when it comes to heavier electric bikes , it may not hold up well .
The only other weakness worth pointing out is the durability of the stand ’s plastic components .
They are strong , but the use of plastic may not render them as hard - wearing as components made of other durable materials .

In separate interviews last weekend , Mr. Carell seemed to confirm reports that he would leave when his contract expires at the end of the 2010 - 11 season .

Polish photographer Lucas Ludziejewski captured the terrifying moments when a driver ploughed through people enjoying an 11th Night bonfire at Coolfin Street off the Donegall Road in the Village area of Belfast
These shocking pictures show the horrifying scene as a car ploughed into families celebrating an 11th Night bonfire , leaving men , women and children lying bloodied and bruised in the street .
The incident was captured by Polish photographer Lucas Ludziejewski as pensioners , mums and dads , young girls , friends and neighbours gathered to watch the lighting of the bonfire at Coolfin Street off the Donegall Road in the Village area of Belfast .
There was a carnival spirit on the streets ahead of the accident and no - one threw a second glance at the silver Rover car inching its way through the crowds on Coolfin Street shortly after 1am .
But within seconds , after being asked to reverse back down the street by revellers , the driver of the vehicle wreaked havoc and brought terror to what had been a party .
The young male driver put his foot on the accelerator and drove at up to 12 people , badly injuring , among others , two children , and crushing a baby ’s pushchair and knocking a woman from a wheelchair .
The pictures show how a |number of men tried to pursue the vehicle , but were unable to keep up with him .
Three generations of one family were taken to hospital for their injuries .
Men and women were pushed onto the driver 's bonnet and propelled flying into the air .
Sobbing teenagers were comforted on the street by firefighters .
Mr Ludziejewski said he was sickened by the scene .
“ It was a good party , people were having fun , ” he said .
“ There was a car on the road , just in the middle of the street , I thought there was something wrong or there must have been an accident because I knew there was n't supposed to be a car there .
“ A couple of people waved at him and told him to go back , to turn around or reverse because the road was closed .
“ But then he just went for them , he went for the whole street , he must have hit about 12 people .
“ It was horrific .
There was one man lying in the street not moving , he had a woman and kids with him and they were screaming and calling for help .
It was awful .
“ At that time people did not want me to be taking pictures of injured people on the ground , so I put my camera away . ”
DUP councillor Ruth Patterson had just left the scene when she got an urgent phone call to come and help .
“ It was surreal .
One minute there was a carnival atmosphere , the next there were 10 ambulances lined up on the streets .
“ I had been there earlier , just as the bonfire had been lit , and I had not been away long when I got a phone call telling me I better get back quick because something awful had happened .
“ When I came back it was like a scene of carnage .
I remember very clearly a fireman cradling a crying woman as she lay on the ground . ”
UUP councillor Bob Stoker was also present and saw what happened .
“ There was everyone out , from children to parents and grandparents , it was a great big crowd of hundreds of people , ” he said .
“ A grey car started to approach very slowly and no one thought anything of it .
“ All of a sudden it sped up .
It hit about 10 or 12 people , and I know about 10 had to be taken to hospital .
“ There was no warning , no nothing .
Nobody had acted aggressively or threatened this driver .
“ There were people knocked flying , there was blood all over the road , there were bodies lying everywhere .
“ At the start there was panic and pandemonium , but then people realised that they needed to be calm and collected with so many injured .
“ There were about nine or 10 ambulances and the Fire Service were there as well and dealt with the situation brilliantly . ”

Financial site Rate Rush spent two weeks coming up with a list of the domains that Digg and Reddit users most frequently vote onto the social news sites ' front pages .
Surprising : Digg 's list is more diverse than Reddit's , which is dominated by three sources – photo - sharing site Imgur , Reddit itself , and video - sharing site YouTube .

How do you know when a new programming language is ready to be released ?
You try porting a real software framework to it .
I recently completed a port of a Perl 5 framework to the Rakudo implementation of Perl 6 , and guess what ?
It just works !
This is my story ...
After only a short ten year wait , a Perl 6 implementation is scheduled for release this month .
Rakudo * ( aka Rakudo Star ) will be inaugurated on July 29th , 2010 .
Is it ready ?
That certainly depends on your expectations , but I am here to make the case that it is a usable programming language with at least one killer feature that will interest programming language addicts ( like me ) .
I am an Acmeist Hacker , which is to say that I only like to work on projects that serve many programming languages .
I have lots of these projects : YAML , TestML and JSYNC are three that I have been actively hacking on recently .
YAML , as you likely know , is a serialization language for all programming languages .
TestML is a unit test language for all languages .
It is useful for porting software ( like YAML ) and making sure it passes the exact same tests , everywhere .
JSYNC is new .
It 's an attempt to combine the simplicity and robustness of JSON with the completeness of YAML .
A month ago , I gave a talk about Acmeism at YAPC ::NA .
Afterwards , one of the attendees , Nick Patch , and I decided to work on a JSYNC port to Perl 6 .
Since all the tests for the Perl 5 version of JSYNC are written in TestML , we decided that we would first need to port the TestML framework from Perl 5 to Perl 6 .
A month later , I can happily say that TestML has been completely ( it passes all tests ! ) ported to Perl 6 / Rakudo .
The JSYNC port has not yet been started , but I did manage to write a fledgling Perl 6 YAML module along the way ( with all of its tests written in TestML !! ) .
What was it like to work in Perl 6 ?
Read on !
TestML is a small to medium sized framework .
It consists of a half dozen object oriented modules .
Prior I had written it in Perl 5 and in Python .
The Perl 5 version is over a 1000 lines of code , not including the tests .
Since TestML is a language , it needs to be compiled and executed .
This accounts for TestML : : Parser ( which is driven by TestML : : Parser : : Grammar ) , and TestML : : Runner .
The runner class needs a subclass to connect it to an actual existing test framework ; in Perl 's case TestML :: Runner :: TAP .
TestML :: Document is a collection of classes that define the compilation unit .
Then there is TestML : : Bridge to connect TestML to the application you are testing , and a standard library called TestML : : Standard .
All of this code is very very dynamic , ie introspection based .
TestML itself , started with a TestML Specification which consists mostly of a grammar written in a pseudo grammar language .
The grammar language is a top down set of productions and rules all of which eventually terminate into simple regular expressions ( regexps ) .
I turned this grammar into a YAML data structure and used the same YAML for the Python and Perl implementations .
The implementations also use a common test suite , which is , of course , written in TestML .
The Perl 6 / Rakudo port was done , when the implementation passed all these tests !
When Nick Patch and I started hacking at YAPC , he suggested that we use Perl 6 Regexes , the new parsing technology that Perl 6 uses , instead of my YAML grammar stuff .
I agreed , because I really wanted to learn this .
This decision turned out to be life changing !
We actually plopped the old YAML productions into a new Perl 6 module called TestML : : Parser : : Grammar , and spent just over an hour tweaking a few sigils to make it properly compiling Perl 6 .
But not only did it compile , it JUST FRICKIN WORKED !
We had a passing parse test .
The hard part was over .
Or so I thought .
It took me a few weeks ( and many a shaved yak ) to get the last test passing .
Rakudo is , um ... , an adventure .
I discovered and reported about a dozen bugs .
I spent countless hours looking into crazy problems .
It was a pretty even split between me learning a new language , a stupid programming mistake on my part , Rakudo not doing that part of Perl 6 , and Rakudo just sucking it .
The one part of Rakudo that never let me down was its amazing community .
People hanging out on # perl6 and holding my hand as I danced ( and danced and danced ) barefoot across the bed of flaming coals that is Rakudo .
Part of the reason it took me so long , is that Rakudo is sloooooooooooow .
No getting around that one for the time being .
If your expectation of Rakudo * includes blazing speed ... fuhgedabowdit !
But if you do n't mind taking a coffee break while your code runs far enough to produce a nice stack trace , give Rakudo a whirl .
Luckily , I cut my hacking teeth writing mainframe code , where I did just that for years .
That 's why , I 'm sure , I am forever addicted to coffee .
Rakudo has pretty good error reporting .
Once in a while .
Sometimes you get a full stack trace with a nice human touch error message ( obviously written by Larry Wall ) patting you on the back and saying " well , I know you tried really hard , and it would have been fine in Perl 5 , but now you need to put a space after that twigil about halfway across line 369 ... " .
Many times you just get " Unable to parse blockoid , could n't find final ' } ' at line 141 " .
Oh really ?
What the heck is a blockoid , and , um , WHICH FRICKIN FILE ??
I could go on and on about the fear and loathing but hey , trying to live in the future is never easy and I , for one , welcome our new Parrot - based Overlords .
So how about Perl 6 as a language ?
As an Acmeist , my goal is to learn new languages and to spread goodness to all of them equally .
My take so far on Perl 6 is that it 's better than Perl 5 .
It feels really nice to code in .
I also learned Python this year , and contributed a few modules to their CPAN .
In many ways , I find Python to be even nicer than Perl 6 , except for one important part ...
Perl 6 Regexes
Perl 6 Regexes is Perl 6's killer feature .
As somebody who has been searching for good parsing technology for over a decade , I really appreciate the thought put into this .
It makes writing parsers a fairly simple task .
As an Acmeist , I think it is vital that all languages have this technology .
Since it was so easy for me to turn my home - baked TestML parser grammar into Perl 6 Regexes ( P6R ) , I am already convinced that I can take a useful subset of P6R and make it work everywhere !
... * sigh * yet another project ...
Conclusion
Is Perl 6 Ready ?
It is ready enough for Rakudo !
Is Rakudo Ready ?
It is ready enough for TestML !
Is TestML Ready ?
It is ready enough for an Acmeist port of Perl 6 Regexes !
State - owned bank could take legal action against US firm fined $ 550 m by SEC for its role in sale of mortgage - backed security
Goldman Sachs faces the threat of legal action from Royal Bank of Scotland , which lost $ 800 m ( £ 523 m ) on the complex mortgage security at the heart of a record - breaking fine by the US regulators .
Even though Goldman has settled the case brought by the securities and exchange commission over the Abacus collateralised debt obligation ( CDO ) , the Wall Street firm may not yet be able to draw a line under the controversy caused by the way it sold the complex deal to clients .
Goldman is paying a $ 550 m fine in a settlement with the commission , after admitting that the marketing materials it issued to investors buying the Abacus transaction were " incomplete " and did got give a true picture of the product .
Abacus was one of thousands of CDOs created in the run-up to the sub - prime mortgage crisis where banks packaged up lots of home loans and then sold them to on to investors .
In this case , though , the SEC argued that Goldman did tell not the investors in Abacus that one of its powerful clients , the hedge fund Paulson , had helped to choose the loans included in the CDO , or that Paulson was also using Abacus to bet that house prices would collapse – and therefore profit at the expense of investors in the financial instrument .
Goldman reached the settlement with the commission as it prepared to publish its results for the second quarter , which are expected to show a slowdown in activity on the same period last year .
Analysts have downgraded their forecasts for the group after June proved to be a very slow trading month .
Even so , analysts at Wells Fargo expect the firm to report net revenue of $ 8.5 bn – down more than 35 % – and set aside as much as $ 4.3 bn to pay staff their monthly salaries and bonuses at the end of the year .
While the commission is continuing to investigate the Goldman employee Fabrice Tourre , who marketed Abacus , the firm may also face legal action from RBS .
The bank inherited an exposure to the transaction when it took over Dutch rival ABN Amro as the banking crisis began .
The City regulator , the Financial Services Authority , is also continuing its investigation into the transaction while Tourre , who had been registered with the FSA to work for Goldman , remains on leave .
About $ 250 m will be paid to clients who lost money in the deal .
German bank IKB , the main investor , is being handed all of the $ 150 m it put in , but RBS is receiving only $ 100 m of the $ 800 m that it lost .
RBS , which was bailed out by the taxpayer in October 2008 and is more than 80 % owned by the government , is now deciding whether to try to reclaim the rest of its losses .
The Edinburgh - based bank said : " RBS has been monitoring the complaint closely .
Following the SEC 's announcement , RBS will now carefully consider all of its options . "
IKB was also " carefully reviewing " the terms of the settlement between the commission and Goldman .
Unlike IKB , RBS was not a direct investor in Abacus but was exposed because ABN Amro had provided credit insurance to Goldman in the event that ACA , a specialist firm that also helped to select the loans included in the deal , went bust .
ACA did in fact collapse .
Goldman would not comment on any further cases that might arise after the recent settlement , but lawyers warned that the firm , and others on Wall Street , should be " vigilant " .
Ben Bruton , banking litigation partner at Eversheds law firm , said : " Goldman Sachs will no doubt view the settlement of the SEC investigation as drawing a line under the allegations surrounding the marketing of Abacus .
However , it and other investment banks should remain vigilant against future investigations by regulators , especially those concerning the way in which other CDOs and structured products were marketed .
By undertaking thorough internal investigations into issues of this kind , investment banks will be better prepared to respond effectively . "

Defense Minister Ehud Barak and head of the opposition and Kadima chairwoman Tzipi Livni met at the Defense Ministry on Sunday to discuss security and policy issues .
Livni's office sought to discourage speculation that discussion with Barak was a forerunner to Kadima 's joining the government .
" The conditions have not changed .
Widening the government [ coalition ] is not in our cards , " Livni said in a statement .
The meeting comes at a time of rumors surrounding the possibility of Kadima joining the government coalition as relations between Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Israel Beiteinu have reached a new low .
Netanyahu ties with Israel Beiteinu leader Avigdor Lieberman have frayed after the government 's new budget cut funding to ministry portfolios held by Israel Beiteinu politicians and the prime minister 's negative reaction to the conversion bill proposed by Israel Beiteinu MK David Rotem .
Netanyahu announced on Sunday that he opposed the conversion bill .
Lieberman and Netanyahu plan to meet on Monday to attempt to mend relations , while Livni and Barak announced that they expect to carry on their policy meeting on a regular basis into the future .

US appeals court rejects moratorium on deepwater drilling
By Patrick Martin
9 July 2010
A federal appeals panel ruled late Thursday against the Obama administration ’s request to maintain its temporary ban on deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico .
The 2 - 1 decision by a three - judge panel of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals leaves intact an injunction by District Judge Martin Feldman .
The Department of the Interior issued the order to suspend deepwater drilling for six months in the wake of the BP oil disaster .
The order stopped work on a relative handful of wells being drilled at water depths of greater than 500 feet , like BP ’s Macondo well , which exploded April 20 .
The vast majority of Gulf oil wells are unaffected because they are already in production or because the drilling is in shallow water .
Thirty - two offshore oil drilling companies filed suit and won the order from Judge Feldman , who has extensive stockholdings in both petroleum and oil services companies .
The drilling companies had the support of both Republican and Democratic politicians in the Gulf region , most notably the Republican governor of Louisiana , Bobby Jindal , and the state ’s senior U.S. senator , Democrat Mary Landrieu .
In the course of a lengthy oral argument in a New Orleans courtroom , Michael Gray , the attorney for the Department of the Interior , declared the moratorium is “ necessary to make sure we ’re not faced with a second oil spill while we ’re still struggling to contain and clean up the spill from the Deepwater Horizon incident .
I think it ’s beyond question that there ’s a threat of serious harm to the marine or coastal environment . ”
Judge W. Eugene Davis told attorneys for both sides , “ We expect to rule by early next week at the latest . ”
But only 90 minutes later , the 2 - 1 decision was issued .
The majority justices ruled that the administration had failed to show irreparable harm would occur if the stay of Judge Feldman ’s order was not granted , because there was no proof that any deepwater drilling would be resumed during the appeal of the lower court ’s order , which they set for a hearing August 30 .
No oil company has resumed deepwater drilling in the Gulf since Feldman ’s order , in part because of the enormous cost of another shutdown in the event that the Obama administration prevails on appeal .
Several companies have begun moving rigs and skilled workers overseas for other projects .
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said before the ruling that he would issue a new version of the moratorium order to block deepwater drilling , in a form more likely to withstand judicial review .
Whatever the technical and legal issues immediately involved , from a political standpoint the appeals court ruling demonstrates the virtually unlimited power of the oil companies over every branch of the government .
Even under conditions where the BP disaster is destroying the Gulf of Mexico and befouling more than 500 miles of coastline , the oil industry still reigns supreme in the federal courts .
Their direct personal involvement with the industry did not lead the Fifth Circuit judges to recuse themselves .
Judge Davis has investments in Edge Petroleum and Progress Energy .
Chief Judge Edith Jones has held stock in BP , ExxonMobil and Pennzoil , while her colleague Edith Clement has investments in BP , ExxonMobil , Conoco and Chevron .
In addition to this personal stake , and more decisively , the federal judiciary is bound by a thousand threads to the class interests of the ruling elite .
Every federal judge , in the district courts , appeals courts and the Supreme Court , is a tried and trusted defender of the capitalist system and the “ rights ” of property and wealth .
Meanwhile , the Washington Post supplied another reason for the Obama administration ’s kid -glove treatment of BP , reporting Monday that the Pentagon continues what it called “ immense purchases of aviation fuel and other petroleum , ” to the tune of nearly $ 1 billion in the current fiscal year .
“ In fiscal 2009 , BP was the Pentagon ’s largest single supplier of fuel , providing 11.7 percent of the total purchased , ” the newspaper reported , citing a spokeswoman for the Defense Logistics Agency .
A BP spokesman told the newspaper that at least one “ big contract ” has been signed since the Gulf oil disaster .
Citing statements by a former lawyer for the Environmental Protection Administration , the Post reported that an EPA proposal for possible debarment of BP from government contracting was blocked after the Pentagon told her that BP was supplying 80 percent of the fuel used for US military operations in the Middle East .
TimeMachineEditor
TimeMachineEditor is a software for macOS that lets you change the default one - hour backup interval of Time Machine .
You can change the interval or create other types of scheduling ( see the screenshots below ) .
This is useful if you do n’t need to backup every hour and do n’t want the performance penalty .
For example you might be frequently creating or modifying files which would cause long - running backup operations throughout the day .
Download
TimeMachineEditor 5.1.5 ( 2020 , August 25 ) - macOS 10.9 or newer
This version includes improvements to the local snapshots and logs viewers .
Note to Catalina and Big Sur users
In macOS Catalina and Big Sur , a security dialog might prevent you from installing the application claiming that Apple cannot check it for malicious software .
Apple ( the trillion dollar company ) is forcing developers to pay $ 99 / year to ship free software , this I do not agree with .
All developers contribute to the platform and buy a fair amount of Apple devices which should be plenty enough money back into Apple 's pockets to provide free signing certificates and notarization .
You can still install : control - click the installer package , then choose Open from the shortcut menu , then click Open .
Alternatively you can install version 5.0.8 and update from within the application ( main application menu > Check for Updates ) .
How does it work ?
TimeMachineEditor triggers
Time Machine backups when it is most appropriate , the whole backup process is still handled by Time Machine .
TimeMachineEditor is not a “ hack ” , it does not modify system files .
Command Line Tool
The tmectl ( 1 ) command line tool allows to print and modify settings , enable / disable the scheduler and uninstall the application .
Just fire up the command without any argument to see its usage .
FAQ
Should I disable automatic backups in System Preferences > Time Machine ?
Yes .
Doing this disables the default one - hour scheduler which is what you want since you will now be using TimeMachineEditor to schedule the backups .
Do I need to keep the application running or launch it at login time ?
No .
You just need to use the application when you want to change the settings .
Will it back up while the machine is sleeping ?
TimeMachineEditor supports Power Nap which you can enable in System Preferences > Energy Saver .
If you are using a laptop computer , make sure you are on the “ Power Adapter ” tab , as this feature only works when connected to AC power .
How does TimeMachineEditor preserve / discard backups ?
TimeMachineEditor does not change that , it is handled by Time Machine .
Time Machine will coalesce and discard backups as described in System Preferences >
Time Machine .
What are local snapshots ?
Local snapshots are APFS snapshots .
They are very fast to make , stored on the local disk and provide additional restoration points .
Since they are local they do not protect against a disk crash but can be useful if the machine goes away from the backup disk for awhile .
The lifetime of snapshots is not well defined but they usually live no longer than 24 hours .
You can't totally disable snapshots .
New snapshots are created every time a regular backup is made ( snapshots are used as the data sources for the backups ) .
That 's how Time Machine works .
How do I uninstall TimeMachineEditor ?
Just select the “ Uninstall ... ” command located under the application main menu .
Alternatively the tmectl ( 1 ) command line tool can be used with the “ uninstall ” argument .
Donations
TimeMachineEditor is totally free to use .

The release Sunday of thousands of classified documents about the war in Afghanistan by WikiLeaks dramatically underscores what many of us have been saying for a long time :
The U.S. is making a tragic mistake in Afghanistan .
OUR VIEW : War leaks confirm what you already know
The more documents that come forward , the more evidence we see of the strength of the insurgent groups , the brutal nature of the ongoing civil war and the corruption of the Afghan government .
The war in Afghanistan has morphed from a U.S. mission to destroy al - Qaeda into a much broader fight against the Taliban generally .
Each additional dollar we spend , each life we sacrifice , is a tragic waste .
This war fails to enhance U.S. security , which should be our central goal for being there .
We were attacked on Sept. 11 , 2001 , by al - Qaeda .
Al - Qaeda had bases in Afghanistan , and it made sense to go in to destroy those bases , and we did .
But the CIA tells us that there are now fewer than 100 al - Qaeda personnel left in all of Afghanistan .
An intelligent policy might be to attack the bases from which mayhem is being plotted against the United States , wherever they are .
An intelligent policy is not to try to remake a country that nobody since Genghis Khan has managed to conquer .
Not the Moguls , the British or the Soviets .
Why have we undertaken to invent a government that is not supported by the majority of the people , and to impose it on the country ?
Afghanistan is in the midst of a 35 - year civil war .
We have no business intervening in that civil war ; we have no ability to resolve it , nor any necessity to do so .
It would take tens of years , hundreds of billions of dollars , and tens of thousands of American lives to rebuild Afghanistan , if it could be done at all .
Aside from making sure that specific bases are not being used against us , we should not be spending a nickel in Afghanistan , and we should not be wasting a life there .
At this point , we must recognize that rebuilding Afghanistan is both beyond our capability and beyond our mandate to prevent terrorists from attacking the U.S.
To continue such a bad a policy at so high a cost is quite simply unconscionable .

West Ham United have rejected a bid from Premier League rivals Tottenham Hotspur for midfielder Scott Parker .
Hammers determined to keep England midfielder
Promise
West Ham United have rejected a bid from Premier League rivals Tottenham Hotspur for midfielder Scott Parker .
The England international was the Hammers ' standout performer last season , with a collection of commanding displays helping the club steer clear of relegation .
His efforts were rewarded with a place in England 's pre-World Cup squad , although he failed to make the cut for the South African showpiece .
He was expected to generate interest this summer , with numerous clubs reported to be keen to bring him on board .
Tottenham have made no secret of their desire to strengthen , as they prepare for life in the UEFA Champions League , and they are the first to have made an official approach .
They have , however , been knocked back by West Ham , with co-owner David Sullivan making it clear that Parker is not for sale at any price .
" I made a promise that I would not sell Scott and I will not , for any amount of money , break that promise to the West Ham supporters , " he told the club's .
" Scott is not for sale at any price , to anyone .
West Ham supporters , for too long , have had owners that sell their best players and promise one thing and do another .
" This is a new era .
We are building a bigger , better West Ham and when we make a promise , we honour it . "
Sullivan added : " The club informed Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy prior to him making the offer that we would not welcome any approach to unsettle the player .
" Scott Parker has three years left on his contract and the club has opened talks with his agent over a new five - year deal . "

Online puzzle fiends are struggling to crack a " secret " cryptogram included in the newly - formed US military cyber command 's official seal .
Most of the confusion arises from an extra hyphen in the Command official mission statement .
What 's a good way of symbolising codes ' n ' stuff , Larry ?
As can be seen in the image above , the Cyber Command seal 's inner golden ring has the legend 9ec4c12949a4f31474f299058ce2b22a inscribed on it .
This has been discussed online for some time , but Wired was the first media channel to notice it this week .
The mag 's online defence blog is offering a free T - shirt or a ticket to the International Spy Museum to the first person to crack the " code " .
In fact the string of characters is merely an MD5 hash of the Command 's mission statement :
USCYBERCOM plans , coordinates , integrates , synchronizes and conducts activities to : direct the operations and defense of specified Department of Defense information networks and ; prepare to , and when directed , conduct full spectrum military cyberspace operations in order to enable actions in all domains , ensure US / Allied freedom of action in cyberspace and deny the same to our adversaries .
Provided that this is entered correctly into a hash generator , the Cyber Command seal string is produced .
That appears to be all there is to it - a reasonably technically literate effort in the context of US military heraldry , but scarcely much of a puzzle .
Some confusion has been caused by the fact that US Strategic Command , in charge of USCYBERCOM , offers a slightly altered mission statement - with a superfluous hyphen in " full spectrum " .
We certainly are n't the first to notice this , and anyway we prefer our Vulture T - shirts here , so we 'll leave the Wired competition glory to someone else . ®
Stop the Vertical Tab Madness
In One Small Step Toward Reducing Programming Language Complexity I added " Who even knows what " \v " ( vertical tab ) does ? " as an off the cuff comment .
Re-reading that made me realize something that 's blatantly obvious in retrospect , so obvious that I 've gone all this time without noticing it :
No one is actually using the vertical tab escape sequence .
And I truly mean " no one . "
If I could stealthily patch the compiler for any language supporting the " \v " escape so I 'd receive mail whenever it occurred in source code , then I could trace actual uses of it .
I 'm willing to bet that all the mail would come from beginners trying to figure out what the heck " \v " actually does , and then giving up when they realize it does n't do anything .
That 's because it does n't do anything , except with some particular printers and terminal emulators , and in those cases you 're better off not relying on it anyway .
And yet this crazy old feature , one that no one understands or uses , one that does n't even do anything in most cases , not only gets special syntax in modern programming languages , it 's consistently given space in the documentation , even in tutorials .
It 's in the official Lua docs .
It 's in MIT web course notes about printf .
It 's in the books Programming in Python 3 and Python Essential Reference .
It 's in an introduction to Python strings .
It 's in the standard Erlang documentation , too .
[ Insert conspiracy theory involving Illuminati here . ]
Here 's my simple plea : stop it .
Stop mentioning vertical tabs in tutorials and language references .
Drop the " \v " sequence in all future programming languages .
Retroactively remove it from recent languages , like Python 3 .
Yes , ASCII character number 11 is n't going away , but there 's no reason to draw attention to a relic of computing past .
Surprisingly , the " \v " sequence was removed from one language during the last decade : Perl .
And even more surprisngly , there 's a 2010 proposal to add escaped character sequences , including vertical tab , to the famously minimal language , Forth .

A tense , six - hour standoff between armed police and Raoul Moat , Britain 's most wanted man , ended early this morning when the fugitive shot himself .
At 1.10 am a single gunshot was heard at the scene of the standoff and police were reported to have surrounded Moat and jumped on him .
In a statement , the police said " no shots were fired by police officers " and it " appears the suspect shot himself " .
An ambulance reportedly sped from the scene , taking the former nightclub bouncer , 37 , to a Newcastle hospital .
Sources said Moat was pronounced dead on arrival .
Having evaded capture for a week , Moat had been surrounded in the Northumberland village of Rothbury for six hours as armed snipers trained their guns on him while he pointed a shotgun at his neck .
Moat was wanted over the shooting of his ex-girlfriend Samantha Stobbart , and the fatal shooting of her partner , Chris Brown , last Saturday , and the shooting of PC David Rathband on Sunday .
Just after 7 pm yesterday
Moat made a break from his hiding place near Cragside , around 300 metres from Rothbury .
One witness said they saw him being chased by armed officers on the eastern edge of the village .
Another said they saw Moat being pursued across the front lawn of their home in the riverbank area of Rothbury at around 7.10 pm , while other accounts described him walking along the bank of the river Coquet when two police officers approached him .
Within moments
Moat was said to have gone down flat on his stomach and put a sawn - off shotgun to his neck , his finger apparently on the trigger .
In seconds he was surrounded by 10 marksmen .
Trained police negotiators tried to talk with Moat , who was in a highly agitated state , shouting at officers who ordered him to lie on the ground .
Marksmen trained their guns and taser guns on him , while snipers lay on the banks of the river and behind an armoured police vehicle .
An RAF Tornado plane with infra-red equipment roared overhead .
As daylight faded , police sent in food and water to try to help develop a rapport and trust .
It was reported that Moat 's friend Tony Laidler had arrived to try to assist with negotiations .
As torrential rain poured on the scene , the deadlock was broken at just after 1 am when a single shot was heard , followed by the sound of shouting .
A police spokesman said : " We can confirm that a shot has been fired .
It 's believed that the suspect has a gunshot wound .
No officers have been injured .
The circumstances have yet to be established . "
The temporary chief constable of Northumbria police , Sue Sim , said : " While the incident has been brought to a close we must be mindful of the impact it has had on many lives .
Our thoughts are with the family and friends of those affected .
" I 'd like to thank the public , particularly the community of Rothbury , for their continued help throughout the inquiry .
This has been a difficult time for them and their support has been invaluable . "
The force also confirmed that the incident had been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) because officers had had contact with Moat prior to his death .
The IPCC commissioner , Nicholas Long , said : " Early indications show that gunshots were not fired by police officers and this will of course form part of the IPCC independent investigation .
It is also understood that a police officer did discharge a Taser and our investigation will also look at this . "
Sim later confirmed that a taser had been fired , " however , this did not prevent his death " .
The independent police watchdog is already investigating whether Northumbria police took adequate action after they received a warning from Durham prison after Moat 's release that he might intend to cause serious harm to Stobbart .
Moat had remained at large for a week , allegedly aided by friends and associates .
Six people have been arrested in connection with the investigation so far and two have already appeared before magistrates charged with conspiracy to commit murder and possession of a firearm .
Hundreds of officers were involved in the search , with 14 additional forces brought in , including 40 officers from the Metropolitan police 's C019 sniper unit and 20 armoured police cars shipped in from Northern Ireland .
Throughout the inquiry , Northumbria police remained convinced Moat was in the area , despite cynicism as the search went on .
Local sources believe Moat may have been sleeping rough in a storm drain that runs beneath the town .
He was wearing a blue - grey hooded top , baseball cap , dark jeans and white trainers .
Earlier yesterday police were investigating claims that Moat had been spotted walking down the high street in Rothbury on Thursday at 11.45 pm .
The sighting came just three hours after Northumbria 's temporary chief constable , Sue Sim , told hundreds of worried villagers at a public meeting : " I 'm not saying he 's going to be walking down the road with a gun . "
Yesterday evening there was a sense of panic as marksmen flooded into the village , which was cordoned off .
Residents were told by officers to " go home and lock the door " .
Peter Abiston was watching Moat throughout : " There are about 20 armed officers lying down pointing weapons at him .
He looks very calm .
It looks as though the police clearly have it under control . "
Chris Robertson said he thought he had seen Moat holding a gun to his neck .
" There was a man down by the river with what appeared to be a sawn - off shotgun pointing to his own neck .
He was about 150 yards away .
I was n't sure it was Moat .
Then the police came and pointed their rifles at him . "
Retired taxi driver Dave Murray , 67 , said Moat appeared to have been chased through the village and was heading east before being cornered at the primary school tennis courts and bowling green .
Armed police have been carrying out search operations in the town since Tuesday , but it is extraordinary that Moat was able to remain at large for so long .
Earlier yesterday , there was a collision involving two police cars as they rushed to the area .
It is not clear if anyone was injured .
In a surreal development , the former England and Newcastle footballer Paul Gascoigne turned up at the police cordon in an intoxicated state claiming to be a friend of Moat , and offering to give the fugitive assistance .

Listen to the latest descriptions being offered of the oil washing ashore or hovering offshore and you'd think you 'd been invited to an enticing breakfast at the beach : orange mousse , rainbow sheen , large pancakes .
But those are just some of the words being used as everyone from journalists to scientists struggle to describe the different forms the oil is taking as it floats about in the Gulf of Mexico after rising to the surface from the Deepwater Horizon site .
Here are some of the top terms being used so far , as compiled by the mousse paddy - wading staffs of the Press - Register and the Mississippi Press :
Orange mousse :
As appetizing as this may sound , it generally refers to weathered batches of oil that have been whipped into a gooey froth .
No word yet what they actually might taste like .
Emulsified oil :
This is what a more formal person might call the mousse .
Also see : weathered oil .
Spill :
This is that nice , big umbrella term for the oil leak , as if a coffee cup tipped over ( reminiscent of the
. )
Of course , as everyone now knows , the oil is n't so much spilling as leaking or , by many accounts , " gushing . "
Orange streamers :
These are long strands or fingers of orange mousse floating in the water .
Windrows :
Sounds like Scooby - Doo trying to say " windows . "
These can be black , orange or reddish in color and look sort of like streamers , though you might see groups of them .
Sort of like fingers of oil out in the sea , rather than just one streak .
Streaking sheen , metallic sheen , light sheen , heavy sheen :
As multiple sniping commenters have noted , no you do n't need to follow a line of wrecked cars and high - dollar hookers to find this sheen .
It 's what you call the oil when it 's atop the water in a fairly glistening fashion .
Slick :
What 's the difference between sheen and a slick ?
Sometimes there 's no difference , though " slick " usually refers to greater areas of darker concentrations of oil .
More like what you 'd see near ground zero of the oil spill site .
Tarballs :
One staffer notes that this term is not only being used often , but almost always incorrectly .
Tarballs , he explains , look like rocks , while what most people are seeing are bits of oil that have broken apart from larger globs in the surf .
( See definition re : " glob " below . )
Glob :
A glob of oil is just that , a glob .
Nothing fancy here .
Move on .
Pancake - like tarballs
: If this sounds like something you 'd prefer not to step in , you 're right .
Picture a dairy farmer 's field here and you pretty much get the idea .
Orange pancakes
: Pancake - shaped tarballs , but orange in color .
Patties :
Pretty much interchangeable with pancakes , though you might hear someone refer to a " mousse patty , " whereas not so much a " mousse pancake . "
even put a size on patties , saying a patty is an oil deposit bigger than 3.9 inches but smaller than 39.3 inches .
In other words , it 's smaller than a patch , but bigger than a tarball .
That help you any ?
Light streams :
A stream is more or less like a windrow or finger or streak of oil .
It basically refers to a column of color of a relatively narrow width set against a wider expanse of a more healthy color .
Sorbent boom :
For something to be absorbent , it first needs to be sorbent .
That said , why this word ( not the two - letter - longer more common one ) is used for boom material that absorbs oil is beyond us .
Community responder :
This is a ten - cent term for any paid cleanup worker .
It sort of sounds volunteerish , but is n't really .
Hard boom :
This is either boom that is n't so sorbent or the sound a community responder makes when hitting the floor after consuming too much tequila .
VOO :
An acronym for the Vessels of Opportunity .
Note that " vessels " is plural , a point there had been some debate about .
Oiled :
One thing BP can be thanked for is the steady rise of the word " oil " being used as a verb .
Everything from booms to beaches to boats has been described as having been " oiled . "
Scat teams :
Think less about groups of jazz beboppers and more about " scatology " when defining these teams of people who scout the beaches looking for signs of oil .
Blotches of oil :
We 're not sure that " blotch " means anything other than " blotch , " though the same person using this term in an aerial survey also referred to " thick , heavy spots of oil , " so apparently there is some difference there .
Brown gelatinous material :
This was the somewhat generic reference made to a substance that floated up by a boom in Mississippi , but was later determined to be " a mass of decaying algae mixed with components of fish oil and diesel fuel . "
Now that oughta whet your appetite .
Melted chocolate brownies
: Apparently this is what happens when a nice - sized oil patty sits in the sun for a while .
Note that while we have n't really heard this term used much , we included it just because we applaud its descriptiveness .
Weathered oil :
This is a good catch - all term for something that looks different from Texas gold Jed Clampett saw bubbling up from the ground .
Note that everything from mousse to patties consists of weathered oil , which is what we call oil that has been subjected to exposure to sun , wind and time .
Glom :
We 've seen it written that this is what happens when wet waves of oil slap the shoreline .
The oil " gloms " ashore .
Junk shot :
Sounds like an airball in basketball , but actually refers to a wad of old golf balls and other , similar materials that might be fired into a drilled cavity to clog up an oil spill .
Top kill :
A term that came and went as a household word , this refers to the procedure in which heavy muds are injected into drill pipes in an effort to stop the flow of oil and enable a well to be capped with cement .
Top hat :
Fred Astaire would not wear this .
It 's a term given to a type of containment dome placed over a leaking wellhead to try to siphon off some of the leaking oil .
Esther Duflo , a thirty - seven - year - old professor of development economics — the economics of poor countries and poor people — runs field experiments that measure different ways to save the world .
In February , she went to Long Beach , California , to give a presentation at TED , an annual conference devoted to “ ideas worth spreading . ”
Her demeanor was brisk and unsmiling .
“ I ’m short , I ’m French , I have a pretty strong French accent , ” she began .
Then she showed a slide of a neighborhood in Port - au - Prince that had been knocked down in the recent earthquake .
“ There ’s something like a Haiti earthquake every eight days , ” she said .
That is , twenty - five thousand children around the world die of preventable causes every day .
How should the developed world respond ?
With more aid ?
She showed a graph that plotted the billions in development aid given to Africa in recent decades , along with the continent ’s G.D.P. per capita over the same period .
Aid had risen sharply ; G.D.P. had not .
But the statistics revealed nothing about cause and effect , Duflo said .
Without this money , Africa might have turned out better , or worse , or the same .
“ We have no idea , ” she said .
“ We ’re not any better than the medieval doctors and their leeches . ” A slide of a leech .
Eight days later , Duflo was back in her office at M.I.T. , in Cambridge .
There was a view of the Charles River , and the central heating made plaintive , human sounds .
She fiddled ceaselessly with a binder clip ; though she was sitting on a narrow office chair , she managed to pull her legs up under her .
Her manner mixed intellectual assurance with slight social impatience .
( A favorite English phrase : “ Give me a break . ” )
Pinned to the door was a poster , in Bengali , related to work she had done in India on local elections ; she translated the text as “ Together we can talk and solve our problems . ”
She wondered if her references to Haiti at TED had been “ a bit cheap . ”
But , she said , “ I ’m already understated , and not very funny .
I have to be a little in - your - face . ”
She added , “ I had two dinners with Bill Gates in two days .
It was efficient . ”
She laughed , to acknowledge her fondness for statistical discipline , and for reliable data in great bulk — a preference for the measurable that can approach self - parody .
Her response to almost any question about the future is a frown of bemusement and the words “ How would I know ? ”
But Duflo also shows hints of idealism .
She is a left - of - center French intellectual with faith in redistribution , and she subscribes to the optimistic notion ( which , perhaps , runs ahead of firm data ) that tomorrow might turn out better than today .
Along with a thing for rock climbing , and for music ( classical , with a pop- music exception made for Madness , the British group ) , this seems to be what fills Duflo ’s head : the thought of doing good science , and the thought of doing good .
And she is in large measure responsible for the emergence of a new , and fashionable , strand of academic study that combines these instincts .
She and her colleagues in the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab ( J - PAL ) , which she co-founded at M.I.T. , in 2003 , follow a line of pragmatic idealism , where you must first believe that there ’s something to be done about poverty — not all economists would agree — and then you try to do it .
Within economics , Duflo and her colleagues are sometimes referred to as the randomistas .
They have borrowed , from medicine , what Duflo calls a “ very robust and very simple tool ” : they subject social - policy ideas to randomized control trials , as one would use in testing a drug .
This approach filters out statistical noise ; it connects cause and effect .
The policy question might be : Does microfinance work ?
Or : Can you incentivize teachers to turn up to class ?
Or :
When trying to prevent very poor people from contracting malaria , is it more effective to give them protective bed nets , or to sell the nets at a low price , on the presumption that people are more likely to use something that they ’ve paid for ?
( A colleague of Duflo ’s did this study , in Kenya . )
As in medicine , a J - PAL trial , at its simplest , will randomly divide a population into two groups , and administer a “ treatment ” — a textbook , access to a microfinance loan — to one group but not to the other .
Because of the randomness , both groups , if large enough , will have the same complexion : the same mixture of old and young , happy and sad , and every other possible source of experimental confusion .
If , at the end of the study , one group turns out to have changed — become wealthier , say — then you can be certain that the change is a result of the treatment .
A researcher needs to ask the right question in the right way , and this is not easy , but then the trial takes over and a number drops into view .
There are other statistical ways to connect cause and effect , but none so transparent , in Duflo ’s view , or so adept at upsetting expectations .
Randomization “ takes the guesswork , the wizardry , the technical prowess , the intuition , out of finding out whether something makes a difference , ” she told me .
And so : in the Kenya trial , the best price for bed nets was free .
For work based on such experiments , Duflo won this year ’s John Bates Clark Medal , for the best economist in America under forty — a Nobel - in - waiting .
Last year , she received a MacArthur “ genius ” fellowship , addressed a committee of the General Assembly at the United Nations , and presented lectures at the Collège de France , in Paris , the youngest person to have done so .
( A British newspaper headline : “ STEP ASIDE , SARTRE : THIS IS THE NEW FACE OF FRENCH INTELLECTUALISM . ” )
In France , two books based on those lectures became best - sellers ; in America , Duflo was included in Foreign Policy ’s survey of the Top 100 Global Thinkers .
In large part thanks to J - PAL , randomized evaluations are becoming popular at aid agencies and at the World Bank .
And J - PAL itself has expanded to the point where it is generating counter - revolutionary grumbles from scholars :
Is this really economics ?
Duflo recalled one of her TED - conference dinners with Bill Gates : twenty people were present , among them Jeff Bezos , of Amazon ; Nathan Myhrvold , the former Microsoft executive ; Vinod Khosla , formerly of Sun Microsystems ; and “ the Facebook guy . ”
She spent some time that evening trying to calculate the per-capita income of the group but lost track .
“ I ’m not good with money , ” she said .
Duflo found the socializing at TED to be “ a bit high - pressure .
I ’m not very social , in the sense of cocktail - party social .
I do n’t like to talk to people I do n’t know . ”
But she is comfortable when discussing her work , and her scientific approach clearly resonates with the philanthropists of the Internet age .
Gates later pressed M.I.T. to make Duflo ’s undergraduate course on poverty available online , and told her , “ We need to fund you . ”
On a misty afternoon several weeks earlier , on a narrow dirt road running through a village in Rajasthan , in northwestern India , Duflo had been surrounded by dozens of schoolgirls trying to learn how to say hello in French .
“ One , two , three : bonjour ! ” Duflo said .
“ One , two , three : bonjour ! ” the girls said back , laughing .
None of them had heard of France .
Duflo was dressed in a shalwar kameez , with a pale - orange scarf over her shoulders .
The light was strange , giving every view — small single - story homes with corrugated - iron roofs , flat farmland behind , cows and carts — the texture of a nineteenth - century landscape painting .
Earlier , Duflo and a number of others , all holders of advanced degrees , had debated whether the spectral disk of light above our heads was the moon or the sun .
Duflo was midway through a fast - paced trip to India and Rwanda — a series of cramped car rides and short flights on budget airlines , during which she always took from her bag an English translation of “ 2666 , ” the sprawling novel by Roberto Bolaño , and opened it , with relish , but then found herself pulled into the activities of a professor in demand : judging a paper submitted to a scholarly journal that she edits ; responding to e-mail requests for a guest lecture .
She was also working on a book , as yet untitled , about the economic lives of the poor .
It will be pitched at an alert general reader , she said : “ We ’re not talking ‘ Freakonomics , ’ but there wo n’t be equations . ”
Her co-author is Abhijit Banerjee , a professor at M.I.T. , a co-founder of J - PAL , and now , like Duflo , one of its directors .
( A third founder , Sendhil Mullainathan , has moved to Harvard but remains affiliated with J - PAL . )
In January , Banerjee was one of a number of colleagues whose travels coincided with Duflo ’s for a few days .
A decade older than Duflo , Banerjee has a loping , liquid walk and an ironic manner ; he grew up in Calcutta , and he was Duflo ’s guide on her first trip to India , in 1997 .
“ She ’s very comfortable in India , ” he told me .
“ She does n’t get information overload . ”
Her affection for the country is evident : she returns at least once a year , and in Cambridge she is surrounded by Indian friends and colleagues .
In her apartment , in Beacon Hill , where she lives alone , she cooks Indian food in a kitchen remodelled in a spiky modern spirit by an Indian architect .
And it is largely in India that Duflo has done the work on which her reputation stands .
In 2003 , for example , she helped devise a randomized trial that addressed the problem of absentee teachers in schools run by an Indian nonprofit group .
The trial involved a hundred and twenty schools .
In sixty of them , teachers were asked to have a photograph taken of themselves , with their students , at the start and the end of each school day , using a tamper - proof camera that time - stamped each image .
Pay was then adjusted to attendance .
Compared with a control group of the same size , the photographed teachers were half as likely to be absent .
They did not resent the cameras , but it would n’t have troubled Duflo if they had : “ Who do you care about ?
Lazy teachers who show up sixty per cent of the time , or the kids ?
O.K. , I care about the kids . ”
Because the teachers turned up more , they taught more , and their students performed better on tests .
Banerjee has described watching Duflo work on a follow - up experiment , and thinking that he was witnessing “ a new economics being born . ”
In the village , Duflo and her colleagues were waiting for a play to begin .
We were an hour or so from the city of Bharatpur ; judging by Duflo ’s studies of other districts in Rajasthan , local families were probably living on no more than a few dollars a day , and had no cell phones , no TV , and limited literacy .
Across the road , a van with a loudspeaker tied to its roof was parked next to a raised patch of ground .
A red mat had been laid out , creating a stage , and three musicians — playing drum , cymbals , and hand - pumped harmonium — sat cross - legged on it .
A hundred or so villagers gathered in the road to watch , men on the left , women and children on the right .
Crows squawked .
In the van ’s passenger seat , a young man struggled , like Superman , to change into women ’s clothes .
The musicians began to play , and the loudspeaker let out a shocking jolt of sound .
Two actors walked onstage : the man dressed as a woman — rural Rajasthan shares with Elizabethan England an unease about females onstage — and a round , middle - aged man , a master of ceremonies , wearing a maroon jacket , a loose maroon turban , and white pants .
He puffed out his chest and , in a good - humored performance , sang and danced , directed a puppet show , mimed a motorbike crash , and delivered a good amount of talk — every line shouted into a microphone — about the wisdom of voting for a village leader who is not corrupt , and who might be a woman .
The audience was attentive , at least for the first hour .
At one point , we all stepped out of the way to allow a tractor to pass through the village .
It was odd to recall that the script had recently been assessed by a human - subjects ethics committee at M.I.T .
( A relevant form asks , “ Will radiation or radioactive materials be used ? ” )
The play was one small part of a labor - intensive J- PAL experiment that Duflo had helped design .
In conjunction with a local organization , J - PAL had set this morality play in motion , hiring ten troupes of actors , each one identically equipped : ten vans , ten maroon turbans .
A local election was imminent , and in recent weeks these performers had been visiting village after village ; among them , they performed the same show , or some close variant of it , four hundred and sixty times .
This is how Duflo asks a question about women ’s empowerment .
It is also one way that she responds to those who tell her that although they can appreciate experimental evaluations of bed nets or textbooks , they struggle to understand the idea in the messier context of human behavior and politics .
( Duflo recalled an emblematic exchange , during a meeting at the World Bank in New Delhi .
After Abhijit Banerjee made a passing comment — “ Randomized evaluation can be taught , it is not nuclear physics ” — a UNICEF official stood up and said , “ Studying human beings is much more complicated than nuclear physics . ” )
Are you ever going to make good on that deletion bit ?
Many , many of us hope you do n't , as it's one of the most unique interpretations of the song and still one of the better animations for it .
" The Ocean " is a song by English rock band Led Zeppelin , from their 1973 album Houses of the Holy .
The ocean is a metaphor for the " sea of heads " faced by lead singer Robert Plant " in the auditoriums " , according to the group 's biographer Dave Lewis . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ]
Overview [ edit ]
Eddie Kramer , who was present during the recording of Houses of the Holy , commented on extraneous noises in the recording : " It 's entirely possible .
[ The song was ] done in a house [ but ]
I do n't remember there being [ a phone ringing ] . " [ 5 ]
Jimmy
Page remarked :
I 'm thrilled the records are recorded in such a way that the hi- fi quality , even though it 's tough … you can hear detail on it because that 's what you 're supposed to do .
It was supposed to be something whereby you could hear everything that was going on . [ 6 ]
" The Ocean " features an unusual time signature , being partially in septuple meter , with a repeated two - measure phrase consisting of one bar of 4
4 and one bar of 7

In the last line , the " girl who won my heart " refers to Robert Plant 's daughter Carmen , ( born 21 November 1968 ) , who was three years old at the time of recording .
In concert , Plant always updated the lyric to reflect her current age , as captured on the Led Zeppelin DVD which features a performance of the song at Madison Square Garden in 1973 .
[ 8 ]
During this performance , Plant sang the third verse , which starts with " Sitting round singing songs ' til the night turns into day " as the second verse and sang the second verse at the end of the song .
The band first played the song live on their 1972 U.S. concert tour and it remained as part of their performances through their 1973 U.S. tour .
It was deleted from the set list thereafter . [ 2 ]
Reception [ edit ]
In a review for the reissue of Houses of the Holy , Kristofer Lenz of Consequence of Sound gave " The Ocean " a positive review , calling the song " clattering and demonstrative ... [ an ] underappreciated gem " . [ 9 ]
Lenz continues , " Page and co. get back to their swaggering rock roots with one of the nastiest guitar riff / drum fill combos in rock history . " and " The song and album end with a riotous crescendo as Plant screams out " Ohhhh , so gooood ! "
And he is soooo right . " [ 9 ]
However , not all the reception for the song was as positive .
In a contemporary review for Houses of the Holy , Gordon Fletcher of Rolling Stone gave " The Ocean " a negative review , calling the track " so diluted " and filled with " pointless humor " . [ 10 ]
Fletcher further wrote , " Jimmy Page 's guitar spits jagged fireballs with John Paul Jones and John Bonham riffing along behind him , but the effect is destroyed by ridiculous backup cooings and an overbearing " killer " coda that 's so blatant it can only be taken as a mock of straight rock & roll .

Mark Zeitlin manages Harmony House , a medical marijuana dispensary in North Hollywood , California .
His product is popular and his services Ã¢â‚¬â€ providing medicinal marijuana Ã¢â‚¬â€ are in demand .
But Mark has a problem .
L.A. County prosecutors want to put him out of business .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ I have AIDS patients , cancer patients , people with all sorts of illness to treat , but the government is trying to shut me down , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  he told Raw Story .
ADVERTISEMENT
One of 439 facilities ordered to be shuttered last week by the L.A. County prosecutors as part of a crackdown on medical marijuana , Zeitlin said the booming business of medicinal healing through cannabis is under siege .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Unofficially I think there are over 1,200 dispensaries in L.A. County , now I think they ’re saying they want it down to like 150 , Ã¢â‚ ¬
Â he said .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s politics , ” he averred .
“ I think someone is trying to get elected , but there are people that need us and weÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re being threatened with a $ 2500 - a- day fine and imprisonment .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s not constitutional .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
Zeitlin ’s constitutional argument may be uncertain , but he may be right about the politics of pot .
Current L.A. County Prosecutor Steve Cooley is the Republican nominee for the statewide office of attorney general .
Ã‚Â
The crackdown by his office on medicinal marijuana dispensaries came shortly after he won the Republican primary for the stateÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s attorney general job .
ADVERTISEMENT
On the eve of a potentially tough election race in a Democratic state , the highly publicized get - tough stance on dispensaries garnered the veteran prosecutor Ã‚Â local , state and even national headlines .
But just as California led the way in the battle to loosen restrictions on the use of medicinal marijuana in 1996 , workers in the medicinal marijuana business like Zeitlin are worried that the backlash in Los Angeles could be trend in a politically motivated government crackdown against the medical use of the natural herb .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Do I think itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s a trend ?
Yeah , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  he said .

A comprehensive review by Raw Story of recent steps taken by state and local governments to stall , limit or ban medical marijuana shows a pattern of tightening restrictions across the country in many of the states that have passed medical marijuana laws , a shift that comes after theÃ‚Â Obama administration pledgedÃ‚Â the Justice Department would no longer pursue medical marijuana growers .
And in some case , like Los Angeles and New Jersey , the crackdown either precedes or comes after a tight election in a politically divided state .

– In Los Angeles , prosecutors released a list last week of 439 medical marijuana dispensaries that must either shut down or face fines of up to $ 2500 day and criminal charges , part of a citywide effort to crack down on the proliferation of medical marijuana facilities .
Prosecutors estimate more than 2500 that have sprung up across the city since medical marijuana was legalized and said a loophole in city law that allowed over the counter purchases was being abused .
- Ã‚Â Colorado Governor Bill Ritter signed into law an ordinance that allows local communities to shutter or ban medical marijuana dispensaries altogether .
Ã‚Â
The ban allows municipalities to opt out of the state medical marijuana law by either referendum or statute .
Ritter , a Democrat , has exited the governorÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s race , but his party faces a stiff battle in the fall , with a recent Rassmussen poll showing Republican Scott McInnis continuing to hold a slight lead over Democratic candidate John Hickenlooper .
–
The election of Chris Christie , Republican governor in New Jersey has stalled the stateÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s recently - passed medical marijuana bill .
The newly elected Governor persuaded the legislature this month to push back the effective date of the new law nearly a year .
The governor says he needs more time to implement regulations for the bill signed by Democratic Governor Jim Corzine who was defeated last November by Christie in a tight race .
Critics said the newly - elected governor is simply stalling until he builds support for the repeal of the stateÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s medical marijuana law .
Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ
The New Jersey medical marijuana law and similar ordinance approved in Washington D.C are the first to preclude licensed patients from growing their own marijuana .
Ã‚Â
The provision leaves patients with few options if government officials close down or limit the number of legal dispensaries .
– Residents of New Mexico who approved a state constitutional amendment to allow medical use in 2007 say state officials are dragging their feet in approving the vendors where medical marijuana can be purchased .
Since 2007 only 5 dispensaries have been authorized to serve patients .
Also , it ’s taken up to seven months for a single application to be approved , leaving many people who are eligible to use medical marijuana unable to obtain it .
–
On the local level the Aurora , Colorado city council has approved a November ballot measure that would place a moratorium on medical marijuana dispensaries within city limits .
Aurora is one of the first Colorado cities to take advantage of the more restrictive recently enacted state law .
Marijuana advocates who have been at the forefront of the battle to legalize it concede that opportunism can still drive the politics of pot , even when it goes against voter - approved laws .
But they stop short of saying the tightening of laws is a trend .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ In some cases you have someone like Cooley who thinks it is politically expedient to crackdown on dispensaries , I do nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t know why , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â said Ethan Nadelmann , the Executive Director of the Drug Policy Institute , in an interview with Raw Story .
ADVERTISEMENT
A major player in drafting medical marijuana legislation in states like California and Colorado , Nadelmann thinks some of the backlash against medical pot is simply a reaction to poor planning .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ When you have responsible laws like in Northern California , you do nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t have a problem , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  he said .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s part of a cultural struggle too .
Some people think , if you bring it above ground you give it legitimacy , but the truth is if you push it underground you force the people who have legal access to use the black market .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
Aurora councilman says most registered pot use is recreational
ADVERTISEMENT
But in states like Colorado , there is also suspicion the medicinal value of pot may not be driving demand .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ I think 80 percent of the people who have registered for it want it for recreational use and 20 percent for legitimate purposes , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Aurora City Councilman Robert Broom explained in an interview withÃ‚Â Raw Story .
In Colorado , nearly 65,000 people signed up for medical marijuana cards in the past several years as the state began to grant more licenses for marijuana dispensaries .
The onslaught of applicants prompted the Colorado Department of Public Health to stop offering assistance to new applicants .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Due to high volume of applications , the office of vital records will no longer review applications , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â the health departmentÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s website says .
ADVERTISEMENT
Broom has been a supporter of AuroraÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s moratorium on dispensaries that will be up for a voter referendum this fall .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ I understand that marijuana does have health benefits .
But these dispensaries can be a magnet for crime , they have both money and drugs which makes them attractive targets for criminals , Ã¢â‚ ¬ Â  he said .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„ ¢s also the issue can the town allow something that on a Federal level is illegal ?
Ã¢â‚¬Â
Efforts to push back against the growing widespread use of medical marijuana doesnÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t shock addiction specialist Dr. Michael Hayes , who has spent his entire career in the middle of this country Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s love - hate relationship with psychotropic substances .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ IÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢m not surprised , ” Hayes said .
“ IÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢m actually more surprised at how much progress has been made towards decriminalization .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
ADVERTISEMENT
For over four decades , Hayes has been at the forefront of dealing with a myriad of addictions as director of the Center for Addiction Treatment at Maryland General Hospital in Baltimore , Maryland .
With a front - row seat on what he says is the destructive and often misguided emphasis on criminalizing drugs , Hayes has been a lifelong advocate of decriminalization for a variety of substances .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ It just delays the process of people starting treatment if they need it , Ã¢â‚ ¬ Â  he says .
And that is why he is worried about the current trends .
ADVERTISEMENT
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s the politics that messes everything up , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  he said .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ The easiest way to get elected is to criminalize a drug or crack down on peopleÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s use of a drug .
Ã¢â‚¬Â 
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ All the studies on the decriminalization show that the crime , higher uses , all the so - called bad things that were predicted to happen , just did not happen .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
In his own practice treating people with opiate addictions , marijuana has been a useful , albeit unofficial tool .
Ã‚Â But Hayes said the politics have made it difficult for him too look the other way .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ We have people at my methadone clinic whose only problem is they smoke a little weed , and we ignored it because they were doing well , Ã¢â‚ ¬ Â  he said .
ADVERTISEMENT
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ But a few years ago the state required us to test for it , and it breaks my heart that I canÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t give people the freedom from the clinic they deserve .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s really a shame , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  he said .
Part of the problem , Hayes and advocates say , is the slippery slope of criminalization that opens the door for more government intervention , which usually means putting addicts in jail .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ A great deal of the times itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s the Feds that drive this , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  he said .
“ And it does n’t help to imprison people for using drugs . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Growing , selling , and even smoking marijuana was legal in the U.S. until 1937 when Congress passed the Marijuana Tax Act .
The law placed strict regulations on personal use and growing of pot and hemp , guidelines that eventually became the basis for a national prohibition that prompted 750,000 arrests in 2008 for simple possession alone .
Since then , only fourteen states and the District of Columbia have mustered support to pass laws relaxing criminal penalties associated with the use of marijuana , all under the guise of medical use .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s the lesser of many evils ; if I had a choice between alcohol and marijuana , IÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢d take marijuana , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  Hayes said .
ThatÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s why Zeitlin says Harmony House is fighting back .
Bolstered by Ã‚Â a legal theory that the shuttering of his business is unconstitutional because some dispensaries are being allowed to stay open , Zeitlin says a LA circuit courtÃ‚Â judge has granted his business a temporary stay of closure while the owner appeals the order to shut down .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ We have people to take care of , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  he said .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ WeÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re going to fight .

About the Movie
Please Remove Your Shoes is a revealing documentary about broken government process .
It is also an empathetic story about a half dozen public servants who try to fix it .
And it is a familiar topic to all of us who have flown in the last fifteen years : the security routine at the airport - first the FAA and now the TSA .
Please Remove Your Shoes examines the period before 911 and the current situation eight years later and asks the questions that make Washington squirm : “ Are we really any better for all our money spent ?
Or is it safe to say that nothing has changed ?
The answers come in excoriating detail in places , and by unnerving implication in others .
Direct disobedience of agency charter , subversion of management practices , and terrifying abuse of power and secrecy become the film ’s markers for the superagency charged with protecting us on airplanes .
With testimony from some of the original congressional lawmakers who have created TSA to the federal air marshals , screeners , and testing agents who “ served ” it , you ’ll wonder if we were n’t actually safer before 911 , as they reveal their personal stories about a government agency run amok , which lies and covers up its oversights as frequently as it makes them .
Vivid HD visuals and undercover recordings add grit and realism to the personal horror stories of the “ cast . ”
The film leaves no doubt that we need a better system to watch over our transportation .
But the unsettling feeling that occurs to most is a sense of broader familiarity with the sins of this agency that look disconcertingly similar to the crimes of others .
Who will watch our watchdogs ?
Flying in an airplane will never be the same after you ’ve watched Please Remove Your Shoes .
History of the Project
As an aviation publisher frustrated with inconsistent regulation of competitors to his publishing constituency , Fred Gevalt sued the Federal Aviation Administration in 1998 .
He lost the suit , but managed to prevail politically , and the FAA was forced to write new regulation to accommodate the problem .
This was his personal education about the capriciousness and irresponsibility of executive branch agencies and the damage they can do to commerce and society at large .
Upon the sale of his business in 2006 and departure as publisher in 2007 , Gevalt began worrying about the unusual rise in influence and size of the Transportation Security Administration , the agency developed after 9/11 to provide airport security .
He wanted to write a book .
But realizing that documentary film has attained a significant following as entertainment and social commentary , he decided to film first , and write later .
In recognition of the familiar airport process , both the film and the book are entitled “ Please Remove Your Shoes . ”
As a two - person crew , Gevalt and his daughter Emelie ( and later Co- Producer Lorraine Pouliot ) Please Remove Your Shoes criss - crossed the US many times for interviews of people from media and security experts to former air marshals , FAA security agents , and others .
After a year of initial documentary research and interviewing , however , it became clear that the topic of security was too complex to cover completely in a ninety - minute movie .
Efforts to tell the TSA story bogged down with the “ back stories ” of the sociology of fear , economic impact , and media involvement .
Gevalt found himself essentially writing a book “ on camera . ”
He also realized that a stronger , simpler , and more dramatic story was necessary to retain the audience ’s interest .
So the beginning of 2009 saw the project reignited with an expanded crew , including a writer , director , editor , and full production crew .
Hiring Rob DelGaudio and BlackPearl Productions of Hopkinton , Massachusetts to take over the preproduction , production , and postproduction , the new organization decided to begin the filming all over with an emphasis on visuals , more dynamic interviews , and a story focus on the civil servants that FAA and TSA had employed through the period 1995 – 2005 .
A new period of discovery has accompanied the second effort , with a drive to get to the bottom of TSA ’s creation by Congress , and deep inside the heart of a bureaucracy that seems to care more about its public image than the mission it was charged to accomplish .
Please Remove Your Shoes looks at the way a key federal “ super agency ” was conceived , developed , and managed , as seen through the eyes of some very interesting and patriotic individuals who are in a position to know the truth .
The video discoveries of 2008 , while more obscure , and often more abstract have not been put aside .
They are often isolated ( but related ) discussions that fit concisely into a “ chapterized ” format .
They have found the place where they really belonged in the first place : between two covers , on paper , and with a title of the same name as the movie : “ Please Remove Your Shoes . ”
They will both be available in 2010 .

Other ?
In years 2002 - 2007 TSA conducted 20,000 covert tests .
Over 60 % breached security lines , but TSA has not recorded how .
In its first year TSA confiscated 4.8 million items , including 1.4 million knives , 1,101 firearms , and 39,842 box cutters .

As of January 2009 , TSA had approximately 20 % of its transportation security equipment stored in warehouses rather than in the field .
Troubled by the realization that the ballooning size and influence of the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) has failed to make air travel any safer than it was before 9/11 , pilot and aviation publisher Fred Gevalt teams with director Rob DelGaudio to expose the incompetence and corruption within the increasingly powerful federal agency .
Formed in late 2001 , the TSA is an organization dedicated to ensuring that the skies over the United States remain safe and secure .
Yet despite increasingly restrictive rules that make airplane travel a nightmare for the average American , the TSA has failed to become the effective force it was envisioned as thanks to power abuse , secrecy , overt failure to follow the agency charter , and deplorable mismanagement .
Candid conversations with federal air marshals , airport security agents , and various others who have worked in and around the TSA reveal why the agency is entirely deserving of its reputation for being completely superfluous .
Fred Finds Interest in Please Remove Your Shoes Published July 21 , 2010 Fred Topel / www.canmag.com/
This is an issue I ’m really into .
I go through all the motions and cooperate with airport security , but I do n’t buy it .
The only safety I feel is just that I make unstrategic trips .
I would like to see the U.S. wise up .
Even broader than just the issue of one type of security , we should stop humoring systems that pay lip service and demand actual solutions .
And this expose on airport security is sort of being buried .
They ’re only selling the DVD from their own site , here .
Review : Please Remove Your Shoes
As Please Remove Your Shoes shows , the real problems have been hidden behind the scenes .
Do n’t worry about travel size bottles and shoes .
It ’s worse than you know .
Air marshal testing is disturbingly lax .
Their misguided obsession with a dress code is maddening .
Did you know that basic security testing has been outright ignored ?
You quickly get a sense that keeping a job is more important to security agencies than the actual job they ’re supposed to be doing .
It ’s a typical perspective of big business .
“ We know what we ’re doing .
Just listen to us . ”
It ’s all theory but does n’t work in practice , and it ’s all for appearance .
My favorite airport security story was a guy who managed to hide box cutters in airports after security checkpoints , to prove that the new system would n’t even stop another 9/11 .
That guy was doing a national service .
I saw that story get swept under the rug .
It ’s not in this documentary and I can’t even remember the guy ’s name now .
The film does feature other expose ’s I had not known about before .
One smart traveler found himself being detained by aggressive security people , and decided to record the interrogation on his iPhone .
Now he knew what he had to say to get out of there and be on his way , but he let the security guards hassle him and hassle him so there would be a record of their inane waste of time .
God bless that man for enduring on principal .
The basic filmmaking is standard documentary with talking heads intercut with demonstrative footage .
They got a surprising amount of material at airports , at security where I did n’t think you could film .
They do some re-enactments , and visualize some metaphors like an overflowing bathtub .
It ’s not the most dynamic film , but it ’s not trying to entertain .
This is pure information and call to action .
There were a few questions I would have liked them to address .
Have they actually caught any shoe suspects in the last nine years ?
I mean , has one person taking off their shoes led to any kind of prevention or incident ?
Some more details on the basic aspects of security would be nice .
Unfortunately , the only suggestions the film offers are administrative .
It ’s how to make the system that runs security better , but how about some suggestions for actual superior security measures ?
Well , I guess this is the first step to making some change .
You can make a difference .
The Issue There is something Un - American about the Transportation Security Administration :
It is heavy handed , it violates at least three Amendments to the US Constitution .
It is rigid and inflexible .
It is managed by unmotivated career bureaucrats .
It is lazy and ineffective .
And we 're not getting what we paid for .
The Opportunity One third of the US Senate and the entire House of Representatives must be re-elected in November of 2010 .
The “ Christmas Bomber ” of 2009 revealed the absurd ineffectiveness and complacency of TSA .
Through distribution and promotion of Please Remove Your Shoes and its message , we will launch an active effort to lobby congress for realistic change and tighter control of a super agency run amok .
With intense criticism of this agency ’s operation and massive sensitivities about government spending in general , the political climate is ideal for curbing abuse and waste by TSA .
Distribution of the movie to Congress and the White House can be expected to at least put this topic on their agenda .
The Effort Certain congressional groups like The House Transportation Subcommittee will be canvassed as early as possible in an effort to get the subject of air security reform onto their agendas early in the re-election process .
A majority of the effort for the cause will be education of the public to bear pressure on their representatives .
In addition to movie screenings nationwide , presentations at organizations like Rotary Club will be held , with tailored edits of Please Remove Your Shoes in illustration of the problems of current TSA practices .
The Suggestions to Congress Reread the conclusions of the 9/11 Commission .
Give us a solution that works , is proportionate to the threat , and keep it that way - no more “ mission creep . ”
Clarify the roles of “ deterrence ” and “ interdiction ” in aviation security , and see that TSA and the intelligence agencies are properly involved and understand which role they have .
1 ) Establish and enforce tough proficiency standards .
2 ) Emphasize results , scrap the PR .
3 ) Recruit the right people , with intelligence and integrity - train and test them frequently .
4 ) Promote based on performance .
5 ) Decentralize decision making - encourage local problem solving .
6 ) Admit mistakes and shortcomings - then fix them .
7 ) Keep terrorists off balance with flexible , changing tactics .
8 ) Identify realistic threats and dangerous people .
9 ) Design practical and effective countermeasures .
10 ) Motivate TSA management to set and achieve meaningful goals .
11 ) Clear out bureaucratic survivors .
The Cast
The cast of Please Remove Your Shoes is composed of dedicated professionals from the trenches of US Government .
Current and former FAA and TSA managers , inspection team leaders , and Federal Air Marshals , the principal commentators for the film have seen the dark side of government laziness , corruption , and cronyism just as they have tried to change it for our benefit from within .
Thoroughly dedicated public servants , they offer a striking contrast to the nepotistic management within the Federal Aviation Administration and the Transportation Security Administration to whom they report .
They all come from a background of military and law enforcement , and they expect to be treated as professionals , and lash out when they are not .
Divided into three pre 911 and three post 911 federal participants , they are all frustrated with the inflexibility and bureaucratic inability of government to listen to “ the field , ” as they initially try to prevent 911 and later to prevent a repeat of 911 .
They are at times angry , at times sarcastic , though always instructional , and clear about their motives .
“ I do n’t work for the TSA , ” explains one participant .
“ I work for a farmer in Kansas , a waitress in LA I ’ve never met , and a money manager in Boston I ’ve never seen .
These are the people who pay my salary , and my oath of office is for them , not some bureaucrat in Washington ... not even the President of the United States . ”
Supplementing our six key figures are an officer from the US Justice Dept . two seasoned congressman , including the chairman of the House Transportation Committee , and a Washington reporter , who all add gravity and factual detail to the stories of our “ seasoned six ” and the accounts from two passengers of two harrowing incidents which will make you question whether the seven billion dollars we pay each year for TSA has bought us anything at all besides abuse and humiliation at the nation ’s airports .

Happened to watch this documentary while on vacation in Maui .
My wife had search for beachfront Lahaina vacation rentals about six months previous and we lucked out with an amazing place over looking the Pacific Ocean .
Maui is fabulous .
We were chilling one evening after an early morning 3 AM trip to watch the sunrise on Haleakala , the massive shield volcano that forms more than 75 % of the Hawaiian island .
Talk about an austere , barren , moonlike landscape .
It was so cool .
We then took a guided hiked down which was a nice respite from the crowds at the top .
The solitude and scenic vistas of the Mars - like red deserts and rock gardens were memorable .
Needless to say we were exhausted that evening so chilling out watching this documentary was perfect .
Ca n't say I am thrilled with all the FAA / TSA rules now .
Fortunately some of the more absurd ones have been eliminated .
Remember when the airport security would pull you aside and break off the filing tool that was part of your nail clippers .
It is interesting and sad that six months after I saw Please Remove Your Shoes we are having our own whistle blower story unfold in real time .
I now am watching the stunning revelations and momentous developments that have resulted from Trump ’s conversation with President Volodymyr Zelensky , including the beginning of an impeachment inquiry .
This is not a documentary , although perhaps one day there will be one made .
Right now it seems like we are all in the midst of a totally improbable fiction movie .
Unfortunately this is real .

This is probably the closest thing I 've ever seen to a true horror film .
When one considers what this documentary has to say , the fact that this information is n't highly public knowledge is downright shameful .

A pretty damning whistleblower - style expose of how 9/11 could have been prevented had the upper powers of the FAA had taken notice of pre-attack warnings and intelligence , and then how those same people went on to create and manage the TSA , in turn implementing useless procedures that amount to little more than security theatre .
All airline passengers should watch this and ask themselves why government employees value their own jobs more than the safety of the very people who are paying their salaries and how easy it is for terrorists to undermine the system when Washington bosses lazily - and publicly - discuss security measures and the procedurals of air marshalls .
Movie review : Please Remove Your Shoes JULY 6 , 2010 BY : Billie H. Vincent | www.securityinfowatch.com/
A new documentary on TSA and FAA failures opens up the bigger questions about aviation security challenges
July 1 , 2010 - It 's not a summer blockbuster with Hollywood starlets and hunks , but the new documentary Please Remove Your Shoes from executive producer Frederick Gevault takes a sobering look at persistent issues of safety and security in the U.S. aviation system .
The film is being released just as John Pistole takes over the position of TSA Administrator , and perhaps the movie 's exposing of failures can help galvanize Pistole and the new TSA into improving air security .
The documentary , which is now available for purchase at www.pleaseremoveyourshoesmovie.com, is designed to be a revelation of the mishaps and failings of both the pre-9/11 Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) and the subsequent creation of a behemoth organization with more than 50,000 employees - the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) .
The stories of these two U.S. Government organizations are told through the eyes and experiences of several whistle blowers , two U.S. Senators , one Washington Times reporter , and a key official of the U.S. government 's General Accountability Office ( GAO ) .
The trials and tribulations of the whistle blowers are the central theme designed to illustrate the failings of these organizations .
A number of well known failures are used in the documentary -- ranging from the PAA 103 disaster of December 21 , 1988 , to the 1994 hijacking of the Air France Airbus and its subsequent termination by a French Special assault team in Marseille , to the Bojinka plans by Ramzi Yousef and his terrorist team in Manila in late 1994 and early 1995 , the devastating 9/11 attacks in New York and Washington , down to the present day attempt to bomb NWA / Delta Flight 253 by the underwear bomber on December 25 , 2009 .
Much is made of the alleged NWA flight 327 probe by the Syrian band flying from Detroit to Los Angeles on June 29 , 2004 which was largely discredited by later reviews and by the TSA Air Marshals on board the flight .
The failures of the several government agencies in most of these incidents already have been thoroughly investigated by a variety of official and unofficial organizations and groups and made public in reports and Congressional hearings , and none of these reports will give any great comfort to any airline passenger or to the general public .
Nor will this documentary provide the flying public any comfort , but far from being redundant , Please Remove Your Shoes does provide additional information not available in these public reports .
The behind - the - scenes revelations by the whistle blowers give credibility to complaints of sloppy aviation security procedures and alleged willful negligence by FAA and TSA officials .
Of course , if one is to believe the allegations in the documentary , then one has to accept the revelations by the whistle blowers at face value - without any in - depth knowledge about the individual whistle blower , his motivations or intentions .
To their credit , all appear sincere in their assertions , and in at least one instance , an individual 's claim of warning the FAA of impending attacks is well documented .
The documentary alleges several times that FAA managers made gross errors or failed to act on known failures of the pre-9/11 aviation security screening of passengers and their personal articles .
In the film , whistle blowers cite statistics that the pre-9/11 screening system failed to detect guns , knives , explosives ( or simulated explosives ) as much as 90 percent of the time .
One individual stated in the film that some procedures were successful in detecting these test articles only 3 percent of the time .
These same individuals revealed that the tests were totally unrealistic because of the conditions imposed on them by their FAA supervisors , conditions affected by the whims and complaints made by the airlines which were responsible for the screening .
In other words , even with unrealistic testing protocols the failures to detect the test articles were enormous .
One U.S. Senator backhandedly confirmed the enormity of these detection failures of the pre-9/11 aviation security screening system that was being run by U.S. airlines .
The whistle blowers allege that their complaints to FAA supervisors and managers did not result in the adoption of their recommended changes to their testing regimen .
Screening failures are n't the only target of the Please Remove Your Shoes documentary ; it jumps quickly into whistle blower complaints about the Federal Air Marshal ( FAM ) program under the TSA .
It rehashes the revelations in the 2003 -2005 timeframe about the TSA FAM head requiring the air marshals to dress in business suits or sport jackets with ties .
The complaint was that this frequently exposed their identity because other passengers were in leisure clothes , e.g. going to Los Vegas , but TSA 's official response was that during a real incident , business suit clothes would signal to the passengers that they were indeed marshals .
In the movie , one whistle blower details trials and tribulations that followed allegations from the TSA that he was the individual who released data to the media .
He tells viewers that he was n't the leak , but subsequently became a whistle blower after being relieved of his air marshal duties and assigned the task of washing the unit 's vehicles .
Most of these allegations have been confirmed by Congressional hearings on the subject and they eventually resulted in the resignation of the former official that was running the TSA Federal Air Marshal program at that time .
What is not revealed in the documentary is that this former official was actually a former Secret Service official , and the result is that viewers are left with the carry - over impression from the earlier allegations of failures and alleged willful misconduct that it was an FAA official and that former FAA officials are at fault for the TSA failures .
The inescapable conclusion of Please Remove Your Shoes is that the documentary is simply a collection of misadventures by the FAA and the TSA .
Furthermore , I would argue that the documentary deals with symptoms but fails to address the systemic problem .
That systemic problem was the result of three or more elements .
The first of these is the U.S. political system where the heads of the FAA , DoT , FBI , the Congressmen / women , and the in - power presidential administration are all elements of the U.S. campaign funding system .
In the pre-9/11 aviation security system , the FAA issued the regulations , was supposed to enforce them , had to deal with any failures , and handled crisis management .
As directed by the FAA , the U.S. airlines were in charge of screening the passengers , their personal articles , their checked baggage and other articles .
The passengers paid for the system through taxes on their tickets as well as contributions from the U.S. general fund .
The airlines paid taxes as well that went into the general fund with the exception of taxes that went into an Aviation Trust Fund .
The U.S. airlines had the greatest operational involvement in the pre-9/11 aviation security system , and one has to consider that the airlines gave monies to the U.S. political system through their contributions to each major political party and to individual political campaign funds .
The post 9/11 aviation security system put the TSA in charge and does the security screening , and enforcement - all quite differently from the pre-9/11 system .
The second element is that the FAA and TSA bureaucracy are essentially " survivors " -- survivors in the sense that many of the key FAA managers , and now TSA managers , were comfortably seated into a key aviation or security position and did not want to jeopardize their position or remuneration by " rocking the boat " by implementing unwelcome security requirements .
To do so meant that the airlines Air Transport Association ( ATA ) would raise objections to the FAA , the DoT , the Administration , AND the individual Congressional Congressmen / women .
Since the airlines had all of the monies , they most often encouraged individuals from Congress to object to the administration and the FAA .
As a consequence , the airlines frequently " won " and the FAA would reverse its planned regulatory actions .
After one or two of these major setbacks the failure of individual FAA bureaucrats to act was predictable ; they became survivors .
The TSA is in the process of becoming similarly impacted .
In the private sector an organization would go bankrupt under similar circumstances - in government they become mature bureaucracies and continue their existence to the detriment of the public interest .
The third element is that the airlines were the predominant political entity in the pre-9/11 system .
They still play a substantial role in the post 9/11 system with the U.S. airports partially replacing their pre-9/11 role .
As noted earlier , in their pre-9/11 existence , the airlines frequently ruled supreme notwithstanding the FAA 's supposed dominant role .
Several FAA
Administrators promoted the FAA 's role as being " coach and counselor " , as opposed to a role of regulation and enforcement .
In other words , the FAA under these Administrators wanted to be " liked or loved " by the airlines .
Most failed miserably as the airlines were operated on a profit - or - loss basis and reacted according to rules of profit .
If a compliance issue detracted from their bottom line , they opposed it .
The post-9/11 U.S. airline industry is no different - one either makes a profit or they go out of business .
The U.S. airports now have a more dominant role and they are similarly motivated as they are most often part of a nearby community economic system that cannot afford any long - term losses .
Please Remove Your Shoes misses these basic facts .
After a D.C. - area premier at the E Street Cinema , one individual asked executive producer Gevault why he had made a statement in a Q&A session to the effect that the pre-9/11 organizational template was simply transferred to the post 9/11 era .
The questioner pointed out the diametric differences in the two templates before asking his question .
Gevault 's confused response indicated that his actual knowledge of the underpinnings of the two systems was very weak .
To this reviewer , it seemed that he was relying on knowledge passed along from whistle blowers , people who each saw only one or two parts of the FAA / TSA elephant .
After that response , it becomes understandable why the documentary is somewhat of a disjointed series of events recounted by whistle blowers , rather than an in - depth analysis of the underlying problems within the U.S. aviation security system .
The foregoing criticism notwithstanding , Please Remove Your Shoes does effectively add to the body of public knowledge about the need for improvements in the U.S. aviation security system .
At best , if a security system approaches a 90 percent success level , then each remaining 1 percent improvement will cost exponentially more than the earlier percentages - and one can never actually reach a 100 % effectiveness level regardless of the monies and effort expended .
Lastly , contrary to statements in the documentary , the current TSA aviation security system is substantially more effective than its pre-9/11 predecessor .
Nevertheless , the current TSA aviation security system is not what it should be nor what it could be and efforts must continue to improve its effectiveness .
Secrecy - A “ Balance of Power ”
The federal government spends billions each year on the classification ( and less frequently ) the de-classification of documents .
Many of these are questionable recipients of such care and fastidiousness .
In fact a chronic school of thought maintains that while classification is intended to keep information from the eyes of those who might hurt us , a more frequent unintended consequence is that other government entities do n’t share the benefit of useful information .
A classic example of this was the apprehension of the Unabomber only after parts of his file had been declassified and released to the public .
A less successful example of the hazards of unshared information was 911 itself .
With the degradation of “ classification ” into areas like “ Sensitive Security Information , ” a category currently in favor by DHS and TSA , troubling examples of overuse and abuse abound , and without adequate incentive to NOT categorize material as SSI , the government ensures that conservative managers throughout these agencies will continue with more of the same .
In the interim , SSI will continue to be used to hide things from the public , to enhance the mystique of routine , non critical oversight of transportation facilities , for instance , and to cover up items of departmental and individual malfeasance .
The original intent of SSI was to provide the government with a controlled instrument for sharing potentially sensitive facts and practices with relevant private contractors , like a private sector “ NDA . ”
However , with the continuation of governmental abuse of SSI , including the shielding of information from Congress , something has to be done .
GAO is the entity of record for the task .
Mindful that they have allowed the phenomenon of over ” classification ” to flourish , they should be ordered into the trenches of aviation security to productively audit the files of TSA .
All evidence suggests that this would reduce abuse , increase usefully shared information , and help enlighten Congress and the public as to what they ’re getting ( or not getting ) for their security dollar .

Nothing Eileen
Oldaker tried could calm her mother when she called from the nursing home , disoriented and distressed in what was likely the early stages of dementia .
So Ms. Oldaker hung up , dialed the nurses ’ station and begged them to get Paro .
Paro is a robot modeled after a baby harp seal .
It trills and paddles when petted , blinks when the lights go up , opens its eyes at loud noises and yelps when handled roughly or held upside down .
Two microprocessors under its artificial white fur adjust its behavior based on information from dozens of hidden sensors that monitor sound , light , temperature and touch .
It perks up at the sound of its name , praise and , over time , the words it hears frequently .
“ Oh , there ’s my baby , ” Ms. Oldaker ’s mother , Millie Lesek , exclaimed that night last winter when a staff member delivered the seal to her .
“ Here , Paro , come to me . ”
“ Meeaakk , ” it replied , blinking up at her through long lashes .
Janet Walters , the staff member at Vincentian Home in Pittsburgh who recalled the incident , said she asked Mrs. Lesek if she would watch Paro for a little while .
World 's First Molten Salt Concentrating Solar Power Plant Opens
July 26th , 2010 by Zachary Shahan
[ social_buttons ]
You are probably familiar with concentrating solar power ( CSP ) , but a new type of CSP plant , a molten salt CSP plant , has just gotten rolling and you may not yet know why that is important .
The “ Archimede ” ( as this new power plant is called ) was built by the Italian utility Enel and ENEA , the Italian National Agency for New Technologies , Energy and Sustainable Economic Development .
It is a 5 MW plant located in Priolo Gargallo ( Sicily ) , inside Europe ’s largest petrochemical district .
Older CSP plants , completely reliant on direct sunlight , can only operate in daytime .
Newer CSP plants , however , use molten salts storage so that they can operate for longer .
But Archimede is the first CSP plant that is using molten salts to collect heat from the sun , not only store it .
This is good because molten salts can work at higher temperatures than the synthetic oils used in traditional CSP plants ( up to 550 °C rather than 390 °C ) .
So , efficiency and power output of the plant is higher .
Such plants can also operate for much longer .
They can go 24 hours a day for several days without sunshine .
Additionally , no oil - to - salts heat exchangers are needed and safety and environmental concerns related to the use of oils are also eliminated .
As Carlo Ombello of Guardian News writes , “ molten salts are cheap , non -toxic common fertilizers and do not catch fire , as opposed to synthetic oils currently used in CSP plants around the World . ”
Additionally , here is a big one : “ the higher temperatures reached by the molten salts enable the use of steam turbines at the standard pressure / temperature parameters as used in most common gas - cycle fossil power plants .
This means that conventional power plants can be integrated – or , in perspective , replaced – with this technology without expensive retrofits to the existing assets . ”
The problem with molten salt CSP plants is that salts tend to solidify at around 220 °C , and in order to address that , some expensive technological developments were needed that currently drive the price of the plants up a bit .
Archimede was built for a whopping € 60 million ( $ 77.5 million ) !
Quite a lot for a 5 MW power plant .
But , Ombello writes , “ there is overwhelming scope for a massive roll - out of this new technology at utility scale in sunny regions like Northern Africa , the Middle East , Australia , the US . ”
We will see .

Somehow , at San Diego I hardly spent any time on the convention floor at all from Thursday through Saturday .
I was always running from one event to another , and spent maybe half an hour in the main hall at a time .
So on Sunday , I made a point of walking the entire hall until I could n’t stand it anymore .*
Among the things I ’d been meaning to do at the con was to get my copies of The Flash # 1 - 3 signed by Geoff Johns and Francis Manapul , and if possible to get a sketch by the artist .
I never managed to make it to a Geoff Johns signing this time around , but I did catch up with Francis Manapul at his Artists ’
Alley table .
There were five or six fans ahead of me in line who asked for sketches of various characters including Sinestro , Hal Jordan , Batman and the Flash .
After a while I was beginning to wonder whether I ’d make it to the front before he had to leave for a signing at the DC Comics booth , but I made it to the head of the line with plenty of time to spare .
In a revelation that I ’m sure will surprise no one , I asked him to draw the Flash .
While he sketched , I asked him about the TV series he was on , Beast Legends , in which a team traces the origins of various mythical creatures .
It ’s airing in Canada now on History Television , and will hit the US on SyFy in September .
It sounds like fun , and in some cases they actually traced legends to surprising sources — like tracking griffins to Mongolia !
Check out the finished sketch :

Lies and power go hand in hand .
But what is considered outrageous in a sovereign state is catastrophic for a society fighting for its freedom .
The Palestinians have two sets of leadership under occupation competing for the dubious title of " government " - and both are generating lies to perpetuate their status .
The Hamas government , which won the majority of the vote in democratic Palestinian legislative elections , is not recognized by most countries .
Yet these countries warmly accept the Palestinian Authority government , which was appointed by the president and leader of the party that lost the election , Fatah .

This is the government that has explained its decision to postpone the municipal and local elections , originally scheduled for July 17 this year , by its desire to prevent the political rift between the West Bank and Gaza from widening .
Parallel elections would not have been possible in the Gaza Strip because of the split between the parties and clashes over authority and legitimacy .
It is possible to argue over the logic of the initial stubbornness to hold elections that would have fortified the double - rule reality ( one political experience in Gaza , and a different one in the West Bank ) .
This is why , indeed , independent circles in Gaza welcomed the decision to postpone .
But everyone knows the real reason behind the postponement was internal disputes within Fatah , as well as a possible fear that competing slates would succeed - despite the fact that Hamas announced it would boycott the elections .
The same government that includes a call to end the blockade on Gaza in every one of its statements , in practice aids in imprisoning the Gazans by preventing many of them from holding valid Palestinian passports .
Not only does the Fatah government refuse to send blank passports to Gaza to be filled out , thus forcing Gazans to use the services of special go - between agencies which send the applications to Ramallah , but its general intelligence service even intervenes - as has been revealed lately - and in many cases vetoes passports for Gaza residents .
Now , with Egypt easing the restrictions on entry through its border with Gaza , this arbitrary cruelty has become even more pronounced .
The feeling of imprisonment , and the lies accompanying it , generates bitterness toward the government in Ramallah - even among those who are not Hamas supporters .
Security forces in the West Bank continue to arrest people identified with Hamas .
The fact that the vast majority of these people are imprisoned for extended periods without a trial or any charges brought against them , raises the suspicion that this practice is not meant to foil security risks , but to actually take revenge for Fatah 's defeat in Gaza and to repress its political opponents .
Take Murad Amira , for example , from the village of Na'alin .
As a volunteer paramedic in the Red Crescent he goes every Friday to the demonstrations held in his village against the separation wall .
He was arrested by the Palestinian general security service six weeks ago and only released yesterday - without any explanation provided to him , his family or friends .
The Ramallah government supports the popular struggle in its words , but at the same time its security services continuously harass activists in Na'alin who are close to Hamas :
They arrest them for two or three days , release them , and arrest them again .
That is why official support for the popular struggle is viewed as just another fabrication .
It 's no surprise the protests have remained the private domain of those directly affected by the lands expropriations and have n't drawn the masses , certainly not those who fill the coffee houses , restaurants and festivals in Ramallah .
These are the same security authorities that have won praise from the occupier for the quiet they 've achieved while the occupier acts : confiscating land , demolishing homes , expelling people , arresting children , preventing free movement and killing .
The lies that accompany these activities and their close affiliation with Fatah cast a shadow over the trustworthiness of the leadership in the eyes of its people .
She often took her younger brother Phillip - then aged four or five .
Phillip was about the same age as John Lennon 's son Julian and sometimes the pair would play together while Sue spoke with the legendary singer - songwriter

A NEWLYWED who stabbed her drunken husband before cleaning the knife and putting it back in the kitchen drawer has received a wholly suspended jail sentence .
Sabrina Ann
Thorpe , 27 , waited for her husband of three months to fall asleep before stabbing him in the leg after a drunken fight , the Supreme Court in Hobart heard .
Thorpe told the court her husband had been physically abusive in the past and she " just snapped " , grabbing the knife from the kitchen and thrusting it into his leg .
The drunken husband did n't wake , so Thorpe cleaned the knife with a sponge and put it back in the kitchen drawer before going to bed beside him and checking on the bleeding wound throughout the night .
When her husband woke the next morning , she told him he must have fallen when he was drunk .
The husband accused two friends who were staying at the couple 's house of stabbing him , prompting Thorpe to confess .
Thorpe told her husband she would never do something like that again , before going to the police station to report her offence .
The court heard the wound required stitches and the husband still suffered numbness in his toe .
Justice David Porter said it was a " very wicked thing to do " .
" It was not an impulsive act you waited until he was asleep in bed and later took steps to disguise the fact that it was you who had inflicted the wound , " he said during the sentencing on Thursday .
The court was told the couple 's relationship was " a volatile one on both sides " and Thorpe had anger - management issues arising from her difficult childhood .
Justice Porter noted that Thorpe was drunk during the incident and eventually admitted to the crime and reported it to police .
He convicted her of one count of wounding and sentenced her to eight months in prison , wholly suspended on the condition that she commits no violent offences for two years .
Thorpe is pregnant and currently living apart from her husband because of a family violence order imposed on him as a result of a more recent incident .
The court heard that Thorpe wished to maintain the relationship with her husband and had voluntarily undertaken counselling to address her anger issues .

Martin Rees , giving the first of his Reith Lectures ( Radio 4 ) , spoke to Sue Lawley about the daily reality of being Astronomer Royal .
He must get letters , she suggested , from people who claim to have discovered dark secrets about the universe .
" You do best to tell them to write to each other , " Rees replied , setting off the first of many chuckles in the audience .
It was striking that a Wordle of the lecture , produced as it ended , featured the word " laughter " quite large .
The tone and style were amiable , but the content was serious , tussling with issues about science and public policy , the lack of scientists in government , the relationship between science and the media .
Rees argued that we should worry less about low consequence phenomena , and more about " low probability , high consequence " ones , and decried the tendency – say , in the MMR debate – for people to listen " to celebrities , to newspaper people " .
This year 's presentation urged listeners to debate as the lecture unfolded , and there was lively comment on Twitter .
Mostly the response was positive for Rees , and it sparked up when David Nutt asked a question .
Lawley referred to him as having resigned .
" No , no , " he countered , " I was sacked . "
Rees , going for another gag , declined to comment on what has " come to be called the Nutt Case " .
Should marijuana be used to treat psychological pain ?
Some Coloradan military veterans and the medical marijuana advocacy group Sensible Colorado say the answer is yes when it comes to conditions such as post - traumatic stress disorder .
Earlier this week , they submitted a petition to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment to add PTSD , a potentially debilitating condition characterized by fear and flashbacks , to the list of conditions eligible for medical marijuana use in the state .

I was recently eating dinner at a restaurant with a friend near Times Square when it became time for me to pray .
Muslims pray five times a day and this particular prayer , called Maghrib , is performed at sunset .
Having lived in New York City for decades , I ’ve become comfortable praying pretty much anywhere .
It also does n’t hurt that there are stranger things happening on the streets here than a young guy bowing and kneeling for a few minutes .
After I started to pray , a tour bus parked in front of me and a large group of people proceeded to spill out .
While I continued , a woman from the group came closer to where I was praying .
She removed a scarf from her neck , placed it on the ground so that I would be praying on something clean , then walked away before I finished .
A truly amazing woman whose name I do n’t even know .
But if I had not felt comfortable being myself and praying on the street , I would never have had the opportunity to learn from her .
It ’s not easy fitting in .
Whether you ’re 15 years old or 55 , most of us have to compartmentalize our identity in order to feel accepted .
We let go of things that we hold dear in hopes that we can just belong and in doing so we assume the worst of the people around us .
We think that they would n’t be able to understand and accept us for who we are .
A year ago this week , more than 80 faith - based , civil rights , community and labor organizations came together under the title Coalition for Muslim School Holidays .
Our purpose was to encourage New York City to give permanent recognition to its Muslim community by adding two holidays observed by Muslims to the public school calendar : Eid ul - Fitr , which celebrates the end of Ramadan , the sacred month of fasting and Eid Ul - Adha , which celebrates the end of the Hajj , the yearly pilgrimage to Mecca .
New York ’s City Council convened to vote on the issue and almost unanimously passed resolution 1281 , calling for the Department of Education to recognize the holidays .
But Mayor Michael Bloomberg has decided that the holidays wo n’t be added to the public school calendar
Yesterday , the Coalition for Muslim School Holidays held a late morning rally on the steps of New York ’s City Hall .
Hundreds of people attended and even more stood at the gates waiting to get in — a 300 person limit had been placed on the gathering — as politicians , city officials , interfaith leaders and activists spoke from the steps telling Mayor Bloomberg why he should change his mind .
The expectation that people have of Muslims these days is pretty confusing .
On one hand , Muslims are explicitly told they need to integrate Islam more effectively into mainstream society .
On the other hand , Muslims are implicitly shown that ca n’t really happen .
The construction of our mosques is protested , our communities are profiled , and our children have to go to school on their holidays .
“ One in every eight school kids in the City of New York observes the Muslim faith , ” New York City Comptroller John Liu said in a statement issued yesterday by the Coalition for Muslim School Holidays .
“ Yet these students are forced to choose between their education and their faith , and it ’s a situation that needs to be rectified . ”
In addition all the presidents of New York ’s five boroughs have sent letters of support to our coalition , while Public Advocate Bill de Blasio support the City Council resolution recognizing Muslim holidays .
“ About 12 percent of New York City students are Muslim , ” says de Blasio , “ and consequently thousands of students miss exams and important activities because they are scheduled on Muslim holidays .
The Department of Education should treat these students equally and include the two main Islamic holidays in the school calendar , just as it does with other major religions . ”
It was a beautiful thing to stand amongst a diverse group of people yesterday in support of a cause that really goes beyond a holiday .
I ’m looking forward to the day that it ’s celebration — not contention — that brings us together .
Who knows ?
Maybe it ’ll even be on Eid .

Officials said shortly after the spill that about 1,500 tonnes of oil were spilled into the Yellow Sea off Liaoning province .
A government estimate on Monday said the slick had affected 435 square kilometres ( around 170 square miles ) of the Yellow Sea .
However , a report late on Wednesday said the slick had spread to 946 square kilometres , and stretched as far as 90 kilometres along the coast .
The report appeared in the Shenyang Evening News , based in the provincial capital

After 76 days , 190 million gallons of oil , and a $ 22.5 bn ( £ 15 bn ) clean - up and compensation bill so far , BP is poised to plug its leaking well in the Gulf of Mexico .
Drilling engineers have only one chance to get it right .
One wrong move as engineers break through the cement and steel pipe of the Macondo well could increase the torrent of oil into the Gulf .
In the worst case scenario , it could even trigger a blow - out in the relief well .
" They pretty much have one shot , " said Wayne Pennington , the chair of geophysical engineering at Michigan Tech University .
" Once they hit it and they try to kill it they really just have that one chance . "
Pennington and other experts agree the chances of such a disaster are remote .
But it can not be ruled out entirely as BP moves into the most delicate phase of its relief well operation .
Nor can the prospect of unexpected delays , due to technical glitches or forecasts for a very active hurricane season .
For now though , the operation is about a week ahead of schedule .
The first of two relief wells is within striking distance of the Macondo , about 15 ft ( 4.5 m ) away from the pipe and 600 ft or so ( 200 m ) above the reservoir , after weeks of drilling .
The second , ordered by the Obama administration as a safety back - up , is some weeks behind .
But BP and the administration were wary of predicting that the well would be finished sooner than expected .
" There is a chance – a slight chance – they could nick the wellbore , " Thad Allen , the coast guard commander , said .
" We should n't come off that mid-August date until we know they 've actually gone through " the leaking well , he told a White House briefing .
The most important thing is establishing a clear connection with the Macondo so they can begin pumping in the heavy drilling mud according to Mark Proegler , a BP spokesman .
A nick risks starting a new small leak or possibly even a collapse of a section of the pipe given that it was damaged in the explosion in ways still not fully understood .
Those challenges are still some days away as BP continues to find the optimal point to break into the well , a process known as ranging .
" We have many days ahead of us of ranging runs , " said Proegler .
The process involves lowering a device down the relief well that bounces electromagnetic waves through the rock to try to measure the distance to the metal pipe of the Macondo , a target barely seven inches ( 18 cm ) in diameter .
" They are homing in on that metal or iron signal from the first well , " said Julius Langlinais , a former petroleum engineer and professor at Louisiana State University .
The search for the Macondo would go faster if BP were using measurement while drilling tools , whereby sensors installed in the drill string send the appropriate readings back to the surface , said Langlinais .
However , that equipment is hugely expensive .
Instead , BP is relying on a process that involves swapping the drill bit for the line carrying the sensor .
" They have to pull the drill string out of the well and lower down this sensitive device that looks for magnetic field variations and from that they can tell where the casing of the well is , " Pennington said .
Then engineers remove the device , replace the drill string and begin all over again .
Each shift can take up to two days .
At some point though the engineers will arrive at the right spot on the pipe somewhere between the reservoir and the leak .
They will then stop and install metal casing in the relief well , using cement to secure it in the rock .
The intercept could be complicated if it turns out that the oil is flowing around the pipe , between the pipe and the cement of the well bore .
Engineers also have to be spot - on in their calculations as to how much drilling mud – or pressure – to exert on the well to choke it off .
A vessel containing 44,000 gallons of mud is on standby .
The mud must be viscous enough to flow down the pipe but also dense enough to slow down the oil bubbling up from below .
That balance will be crucial to gaining control over the well , so that the flow of oil is checked without having to continuously pump in more mud .
" You get a dense enough mud and a tall enough column in that flow path , and the reservoir can't flow any more .
It ca n't buck the pressure , " said Darryl Bourgoyne , a petroleum engineer at Louisiana State University .
Then , if all has gone according to plan , operators will install a cement plug , sealing off the well for good .

Editor ’s Note :
This post contains spoilers for the June 27 episode of HBO ’s “ True Blood . ”
“ True Blood ” fans typically can withstand copious amounts of blood , gore and sex – the three chief ingredients that mesh so wonderfully in Alan Ball ’s HBO series .
But last night ’s sex scene between Bill Compton and Lorena – his obsessive vampire “ maker ” - seems to have shocked some of the most immovable .
Bill , enraged after agreeing to stay away from his beloved Sookie in order to keep her safe , grabs Lorena ’s head during a bout of angry intercourse and then gives it a grotesque spin before continuing to do the deed as she smiles eerily .
Some fans were n’t expecting Sookie ’s vampire beau to have such a truly dark side .
Stephen Moyer ’s
Bill has always struggled to cling to his humanity , even as some of his fellow vamps embrace every twisted aspect of their undead nature .
Even Lorena actress Mariana Klaveno said she was flabbergasted when she read the episode ’s script .
The scene “ was actually the most shocking thing that I 've ever read in a television script , " Klaveno told E !.
“ My jaw dropped on the floor when I read it and thought , ' Oh my god , I actually have to do that ? ’ "
The producers instructed the actress to “ ‘ pray that your parents will be okay when they watch this episode .
They may not want to , ’ ” the actress said .
“ It was a little uncomfortable , but we got through it . "
The L.A. Times called the episode - ending image one of the most disturbing scenes they ’ve ever seen on TV , and it ’s left other reviewers wondering if Bill can bounce back as a sympathetic character .
“ It 's no wonder that Bill hates Lorena so much , but even with all the terrible things she 's done , it 's hard to justify his ... er... actions towards her in the bedroom , ” MTV noted .
So has that scene left you scarred for life , or are you hoping that " True Blood " will find a way to top it ?
The quest to derive energy from wind may soon be getting some help from California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) fluid - dynamics expert John Dabiri -- and a school of fish .
As head of Caltech 's Biological Propulsion Laboratory , Dabiri studies water - and wind - energy concepts that share the theme of bioinspiration : that is , identifying energy - related processes in biological systems that may provide insight into new approaches to -- in this case -- wind energy .
" I became inspired by observations of schooling fish , and the suggestion that there is constructive hydrodynamic interference between the wakes of neighboring fish , " says Dabiri , associate professor of aeronautics and bioengineering at Caltech .
" It turns out that many of the same physical principles can be applied to the interaction of vertical - axis wind turbines . "
The biggest challenge with current wind farms is lack of space .
The horizontal - axis wind turbines most commonly seen -- those with large propellers -- require a substantial amount of land to perform properly .
" Propeller - style wind turbines suffer in performance as they come in proximity to one another , " says Dabiri .
In the Los Angeles basin , the challenge of finding suitable space for such large wind farms has prevented further progress in the use of wind energy .
But with help from the principles supplied by schooling fish , and the use of vertical - axis turbines , that may change .
Vertical turbines -- which are relatively new additions to the wind - energy landscape -- have no propellers ; instead , they use a vertical rotor .
Because of this , the devices can be placed on smaller plots of land in a denser pattern .
Caltech graduate students Robert Whittlesey and Sebastian Liska researched the use of vertical - axis turbines on small plots during a class research project supervised by Dabiri .
Their results suggest that there may be substantial benefits to placing vertical - axis turbines in a strategic array , and that some configurations may allow the turbines to work more efficiently as a result of their relationship to others around them -- a concept first triggered by examining schools of fish .
advertisement
In current wind farms , all of the turbines rotate in the same direction .
But while studying the vortices left behind by fish swimming in a school , Dabiri noticed that some vortices rotated clockwise , while others rotated counter - clockwise .
Dabiri therefore wants to examine whether alternating the rotation of vertical - axis turbines in close proximity will help improve efficiency .
The second observation he made studying fish -- and seen in Whittlesey and Liska 's simulation -- was that the vortices formed a " staircase " pattern , which contrasts with current wind farms that place turbines neatly in rows .
Whittlesey and Liska 's computer models predicted that the wind energy extracted from a parcel of land using this staggered placement approach would be several times that of conventional wind farms using horizontal - axis turbines .
Once they 've identified the optimal placement , Dabiri believes it may be possible to produce more than 10 times the amount of energy currently provided by a farm of horizontal turbines .
The results are sufficiently compelling that the Caltech group is pursuing a field demonstration of the idea .
Dabiri has purchased two acres of land north of Los Angeles , where he is establishing the Caltech Field Laboratory for Optimized Wind Energy ( FLOWE ) .
The pilot program at the site will feature six vertical turbines on mobile platforms .
Dabiri and his team will systematically move the turbines around , testing various configurations to find the most efficient patterns .
" Our goal is to demonstrate a new technology that enables us to extract significantly more wind energy from a given parcel of land than is currently possible using existing methods , " says Dabiri .
" We want to take advantage of constructive aerodynamic interference between closely spaced vertical - axis wind turbines .
Our results can potentially make better use of existing wind farms , allow for wind farms to be located closer to urban centers -- reducing power transmission costs -- and reduce the size of offshore installations . "
Three of Dabiri 's turbines are being provided in partnership with Windspire Energy .
In exchange for the use of the turbines , Dabiri will share his research results with the company .
Each Windspire turbine stands approximately 30 feet tall and 4 feet wide , and can generate up to 1.2 kW of power .
advertisement
" This leading - edge project is a great example of how thinking differently can drive meaningful innovation , " says Windspire Energy President and CEO Walt Borland .
" We are very excited to be able to work with Dr. Dabiri and Caltech to better leverage the unique attributes of vertical - axis technology in harvesting wind energy . "
Three turbines from another manufacturer have been purchased ; the six turbines give the pilot facility a total power capacity of 15 kW , enough to power several homes .
" This project is unique in that we are conducting these experiments in real - world conditions , as opposed to on the computer or in a laboratory wind tunnel , " says Dabiri .
" We have intentionally focused on a field demonstration because this can more easily facilitate a future expansion of the project from basic science research into a power - generating facility .
Our ability to make that transition will depend on the results of the pilot program . "
The initial phase of the study will attempt to demonstrate which configuration of units will improve power output and performance relative to a horizontal - axis wind turbine farm with a similar sized plot of land .
" In the future , we hope to transition to power - generation experiments in which the generated power can be put to use either locally or via a grid connection , " Dabiri says .
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act provided partial funding for this project .

Changes coming on Caps beat
As you have probably heard by now , my run as Caps beat writer is coming to an end after five years .
I 'm terrible with goodbyes , so I 'll keep this brief .
It 's been an honor and privilege to cover the hockey team I grew up watching for the newspaper I grew up reading .
But the time has come for me to seek out new challenges and , equally as important , spend more time at home after living out of a suitcase every fall , winter and spring since Oct. 2005 .
I 'm not leaving The Post .
I 'm simply changing gears and will report on other sports I 'm just as passionate about : college hoops ( Georgetown basketball specifically ) and auto racing ( NASCAR and the Indy 500 ) .
I 'll also take on boxing , action sports , MMA and will help out on hockey in the playoffs and whenever else I 'm needed .
Do n't worry , Capitals Insider is n't going anywhere .
In the coming weeks , Katie Carrera will transition into her new role as lead reporter on the blog and in the paper .
Please join me in welcoming her .
Also , if you 're not already , you can follow Katie on Twitter at @WPKatieCarrera .
Again , thanks for five great years and helping this blog become more popular than anyone fathomed when I pitched the idea in 2006 .
I 'm excited about my new role -- and the fact that the hockey team I 'll follow this winter will be my six - year - old son 's mite squad .
In an important Second Amendment decision that charts a course for evaluating the validity of gun laws after the U.S. Supreme Court declared the right to be an individual one , the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has refused to strike down a federal law that bans possession of guns with obliterated serial numbers , reports the Legal Intelligencer .
Judge Anthony Scirica ’s opinion in U.S. v. Marzzarella says that courts faced with unanswered questions in the Second Amendment arena should consider looking to the extensive jurisprudence on First Amendment claims for guidance .
“ Serial number tracing serves a governmental interest in enabling law enforcement to gather vital information from recovered firearms , ” Scirica wrote , “ Because it assists law enforcement in this manner , we find its preservation is not only a substantial but a compelling interest . ”
A couple of weeks ago , we saw the sorry saga of the Food and Drug Administration stomping on the effort by the direct - to - consumer ( DTC ) genotype screening company , Pathway Genomics , to offer its tests through drugstores .
Pathway had reached an agreement with Walgreens to sell its test kits over - the - counter in its 6,000 or so stores .
The FDA sent a threatening letter asking Pathway to justify the unregulated sale of a " medical device " to the public , and Walgreens backed away from its deal with the company .
Now the Congressional nanny - in - chief and head of the House Energy and Commerce Committee , Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - Calif. ) is demanding information by June 4 from three DTC companies , Pathway Genomics , Navigenics , and 23andMe .
As Bloomberg reports :
The lawmakers gave the companies until June 4 to submit documents on the ability of the tests to identify consumers ' risks for illnesses .
The legislators also requested information on the proficiency of the companies ' lab testing , policies on consumer privacy and whether the kits comply with FDA rules .
Some purchasers of the screening tests may be dissatisfied with their experiences , but I would suggest that most are first - adopter types who recognize the current limitations of genetic screening science .
The way that consumers learn about the upsides and downsides of new products is to try them out ; just as the way companies learn how to improve their products is through customer feedback .
As often occurs , the " I 'm - from - the - government - and - I 'm - here - to - help " types are eager interfere with this kind of speedy social learning .
If you 've been thinking about buying a gene screening test , you might want to go ahead now before Congress and the FDA make it illegal for you to get this kind of information .
Just saying .
Disclosure : I am a happy customer of 23andMe ( though I really wish their test had screened for the APOE4 allele associated with a much higher risk of Alzheimer 's disease ) .
Given this news , I am going to order a new test from another company today .
I own no stocks in any gene screening companies .
Finally , my article on the joys of DTC gene screening and the exaggerated concerns over genetic privacy has at last been submitted to my editors at Reason who are now busy making improvements to it .

Ricky Ponting expects his reign as Australian captain to end if he is not holding the Ashes at the SCG in January .
Ponting was in charge during the 2005 and 2009 defeats in England , and led his side to a 5 - 0 whitewash at home three years ago .
Despite being one of the game 's all - time greats with the bat , Ponting knows his future depends on the result of the 2010 - 11 series .
" I 'd probably be looking for a new job if we lose again , " Ponting told the Daily Mail .
" It 's as simple as that .
I 've got the biggest eight months of my career coming up . "
Australia face Pakistan and India in two - Test series before the Ashes begin at the Gabba in November and the series is followed by the World Cup .
" It does n't get any bigger than that and everything I do between now and April will be geared at getting the most out of myself and , most importantly , the group , " he said .
" If I 'm able to do that I think there are some pretty special things on the horizon for this team . "
While the Ashes series is likely to determine what Ponting does next , he said he was not weighed down by the significance of the contest .
" I have n't thought about any added pressure on me , " he said .
" I 'm just thinking about being the best player I can be and having a significant impact on the Ashes series as a batsman and as a leader .
That 's all I can control .
I know what it takes to be a good player in a big series and I know what it will take for the rest of the guys . "
England have beaten Australia in their most important encounters over the past year .
The run began with their Ashes victory at The Oval and continued with a win in the World Twenty20 final and the current one - day series success .
Ponting said England deserved the latest triumph but does not think they have earned bragging rights in all forms of the game .
" We 're still ranked the best side in one - day cricket and No. 2 in Test cricket , " Ponting said .
" Until England get their heads above us in all of the tables then superiority will be with us . "
The secretary of the National Council for Civil Liberties , Cameron Murphy , said : '' It 's outrageous that they 've used the weapon this way , and it 's even more outrageous that they have n't told us about it .
The repeated stunning of a compliant man who presented no threat and was surrounded by members of the riot squad .
This is being investigated by the Ombudsman and police .
The Taser was introduced in NSW in 2001 but was used only about 50 times by two specialist units until the start of the trial when sergeants and inspectors at each of the 80 police commands were given access .
Today 8000 police officers are trained to use the weapon .
Since its introduction , 26 officers have been disciplined for not following police operating procedures , and the NSW Ombudsman has had 14 complaints .
Police promised stringent oversight during the trial , including the use of a video camera attached to the weapon and a review of each use by the Deputy Commissioner , Dave Owens .
Even before the trial had ended the then premier , Nathan Rees , said it had been successful and all general duties police would be trained to use the weapon .
In fact , the trial highlighted problems that critics had been warning of for years .
There were cases of people being hit by a Taser as many as six times , and others where police appeared to use the weapon to make argumentative but non-threatening people comply with directions .
In one case a sergeant drew his Taser when he encountered two young men spray painting .
He drew the weapon , he later said , because one of the vandals was carrying an extendable paint roller and he was '' unsure what their reaction would be to his presence ' ' .
He did not fire the weapon .
Data released from the US ’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) and the National Climatic Data Center shows that June 2010 was a record breaker .
It was the warmest month of June globally since record - taking began in 1880 and it is the 304th month in a row that has been above the 20th Century average .
The last month to fall below the average was February 1985 : the month Nelson Mandela , who recently celebrated his 92nd birthday , rejected an offer of freedom from the then apartheid government .
June averaged globally at 61.1 degrees Fahrenheit ( 16.2 degrees Celsius ) .
The temperature was 1.22 degrees Fahrenheit ( 0.68 degrees Celsius ) above the 20th century average for June .
The uncharacteristically warm June is apart of a continuing trend this year that researchers say will likely push 2010 to be among the warmest since data - taking began .
The hottest year recorded so far was 2005 , while 2000 - 2009 was the hottest decade on record .
The warm temperatures last month also caused Arctic sea ice to hit its lowest average extent for that month , according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center ( NSIDC ) .
Sea ice has been monitored by satellite since 1979 .
Climate experts overwhelmingly say that the world is warming due to extensive greenhouse gas emissions from human activities .

In June the average sea ice extent in the Arctic was the lowest on record for that month , according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center ( NSIDC ) .
Measured by satellites , the seasonal movements of Arctic ice have been tracked since 1979 with a dramatic decline seen over the last 30 years .
This decline is linked by climatologists to climate change .

Freak floods in US predicted by 2009 climate change report
( 06/16/2010 ) A rash of flash floods has struck the US during this spring : Rhode Island , Tennessee , Arkansas , and most recently Oklahoma have all faced devastating floods that have resulted in the loss of property and in some cases tragic deaths .
While flash floods have occurred throughout US history , the number of big floods this year appears abnormal at best , but not unexpected by researchers .
Climatologists warned last year that an increase in floods and severe storms is very probable as the world warms .
IN THE waters of Kongsfjord , an inlet on the coast of Spitsbergen , sit nine contraptions that bring nothing to mind as much as monster condoms .
Each is a transparent sheath of plastic 17 - metres long , mostly underwater , held in place by a floating collar .
The seawater sealed within them is being mixed with different levels of carbon dioxide to see what will happen to the ecology of the Arctic waters .
As carbon dioxide levels go up , pH levels come down .
Acidity depends on the presence of hydrogen ions ( the H in pH ) and more hydrogen ions mean , counterintuitively , a lower pH .
Expose the surface of the ocean to an atmosphere with ever more carbon dioxide , and the gas and waters will produce carbonic acid , lowering pH on a planetary scale .
The declining pH does not actually make the waters acidic ( they started off mildly alkaline ) .
But it makes them more acidic , just as turning up the light makes a dark room brighter .
Ocean acidification has further chemical implications : more hydrogen ions mean more bicarbonate ions , and fewer carbonate ions .
Carbonate is what corals , the shells of shellfish and the outer layers of many photosynthesising plankton and other microbes are made of .
If the level of carbonate ions falls too low the shells can dissolve or might never be made at all .
There is evidence that the amount of carbonate in the shells of foraminifera , micro-plankton that are crucial to ocean ecology , has recently dropped by as much as a third .
Since becoming a topic of widespread worry about five years ago , the changing pH of the oceans has been added to the litany of environmental woes .
Richard Feely , a researcher at the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory in Seattle , provided a gift to headline writers when he dubbed acidification “ global warming 's evil twin ” .
Nowadays Dr Feely prefers to call it “ the other carbon - dioxide problem ” .
But for all this concern , how bad the change in pH will be for oceans is not yet clear .
Indeed , such are the complexities of studying ocean life that the true risk may become apparent only in retrospect .
There is no doubt that a pH drop is under way .
For example , as the atmospheric carbon - dioxide level in Hawaii goes up , the pH at a mid-ocean mooring about 450 km to the north - west goes down ( see chart ) .
But the decline is a lot bumpier than the rise : the pH difference from one year to the next is frequently greater than the change in average pH levels over 20 years .
This is because the atmosphere does not have an iron grip on the carbon - dioxide level in surface waters .
Increased photosynthesis will use up carbon dioxide ; increased respiration produces more of it .
Water coming up from below will often have a lower pH than the surface water , because at depth there is no photosynthesis but plenty of respiration .
In many places , natural variations in pH will be larger than long - term changes in its mean .
This is not to say that such changes have no effect .
If peak acidities rather than long - term averages are what matters most , natural variability could make things worse .
But it does suggest that the effects will be far from uniform .
So , too , does research on how organisms respond to lower pH .
Iris Hendriks of the Mediterranean Institute for Advanced Studies recently analysed data from a wide sample of research into how individual organisms respond to increased carbon dioxide in their seawater .
She found that the range of responses was wide , with some seeming to prefer the lowered pH .
She also found that the effects to be expected in the 21st century were on average comparatively modest .
Some researchers feel the way her study lumps things together plays down the more damaging effects .
Even if that is so , there is a fair chance that the literature surveyed was biased the other way .
Data showing a deleterious effect might well be more likely to be written up and published than data showing nothing much .
If some creatures can tolerate lower pHs and others cannot , you might expect things to average out : the tolerant and adaptable prosper , the more pernickety perish .
For the “ primary producers ” in the ocean — the mostly single - celled creatures that photosynthesise — this will probably be the case .
But changes in the relative prevalence of different photosynthesisers could still matter .
The ecology of the oceans is all about who eats what , and small changes in the population of certain creatures near the bottom of the web could have large effects on larger ones that eat them .
Some creatures may be double - whammied by having less of what they like to eat and by the pH itself , amplifying the disruption .
And adaptation is not without costs : dealing with lower pH may divert a creature 's resources from other ends .
This is where the condoms — or mesocosms , as their scientific caretakers would prefer it — come in .
They are part of the European Project on Ocean Acidification ( EPOCA ) , an initiative employing over 100 researchers , more than 30 currently in the Arctic .
EPOCA is the most thorough investigation so far attempted of the effect of pH changes at the level of a whole ecology .
By looking at which creatures flourish in their mesocosms , Ulf Riebesell of the Leibniz Institute for Marine Studies in Kiel and his colleagues hope to see changes as they take place by keeping an eye on the water chemistry and nutrient levels .
Dr Riebesell is particularly interested in the ecosystem role of pteropods , also called sea butterflies .
These elegant micro-molluscs are a vital food for some fish .
In the first year of their life , pink salmon eat more pteropods than anything else .
If reshaping food webs marginalises the pteropods , the salmon will have to adapt or die .
But though the mesocosms may shed light on the fate of the pteropods , the outlook for the salmon will remain conjectural .
Though EPOCA is ambitious , and expensive , the mesocosms are too small to contain fish , and the experiments far too short to show what sort of adaptation might be possible over many years , and what its costs might be .
This is one of the reasons why the fate of coral reefs may be more easily assessed than open - water ecosystems .
The thing that provides structure in open - water ecosystems is the food - web , which is hard to observe and malleable .
In reefs , the structure is big lumps of calcium carbonate on which things grow and around which they graze and hunt .
Studies of Australia 's Great Barrier
Reef show that levels of calcification are down , though it is not yet possible to say changes in chemistry are a reason for this .
Current research comparing chemical data taken in the 1960s and 1970s with the situation today may clarify things .
But singling out the role of acidification will be hard .
Ocean ecosystems are beset by changes in nutrient levels due to run off near the coasts and by overfishing , which plays havoc with food webs nearly everywhere .
And the effects of global warming need to be included , too .
Surface waters are expected to form more stable layers as the oceans warm , which will affect the availability of nutrients and , it is increasingly feared , of oxygen .
Some , including Dr Riebesell , suspect that these physical and chemical effects of warming may prove a greater driver of productivity change in the ocean than altered pH .
Wherever you look , there is always another other problem .

This third containment effort , which includes a free - standing riser pipe that can be quickly detached in the event of a hurricane , had been delayed by rough seas at the well site , 40 miles off the Louisiana coast .
But the pipes are now being connected and tested , and the system is expected to start working by Sunday , collecting a few thousand barrels a day at first but eventually increasing its capacity , the admiral said .
“ Somewhere between Sunday into Monday , maybe early Tuesday at the latest , we ’ll probably be able to replace the amount that was being recovered by the Discoverer Enterprise and maybe exceed that , ” he said .
Unlike the current cap , which is still leaking some oil and gas , the new one is designed to fit tightly and capture all of the flow from the well , estimated at 35,000 to 60,000 barrels a day .
In addition to the Helix Producer , another ship will eventually be brought in to handle the oil , making four collection vessels in all .
Replacing the existing cap has been in the planning stages for weeks , and the new cap is already on the seabed , said a technician with knowledge of the effort .
Removing the existing cap should be relatively straightforward , as only its weight keeps it in place on the stub of the riser , the large pipe that collapsed after the blowout and explosion April 20 .
The cap is connected by a pipe to the Discoverer Enterprise , which can lift it up and maneuver it out of the way fairly quickly .
Installing the new cap , by contrast , is far more complicated .
Submersibles will first have to cut six bolts connecting the riser to a flange at the top of the blowout preventer .
Once the last of the riser is removed , the new cap can then be placed on the flange and connected , said the technician , who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment on the work .
Much like the failed blowout preventer , the new cap contains three devices that will allow technicians to completely shut off the flow of oil .
Admiral Allen said this might prove useful in planning for permanently stopping the gusher and sealing the well through relief wells .
Once the cap is installed , he said , technicians will shut the valves to gauge the pressure .
This will help determine whether there is any damage in the well bore , and how much heavy drilling mud will have to be pumped into the bottom of the well to permanently stop the oil .
All the discussion of Title II of the 1964 Civil Rights
Act has obscured the fact that public accommodations laws , especially at the state and local level , have expanded way , way , beyond their original purpose of ensuring that previously excluded minorities are served in restaurants , hotels , and the like .
This has happened more via aggressive judicial interpretation of the language of these laws than from the laws themselves , which were phrased to not infringe unduly on private behavior .
For example , the Boy Scouts of America v. Dale case involved the courts of New Jersey declaring that the membership policies of the Boy Scouts violated the state ’s ban on discrimination in places of public accommodation .
This even though the membership policies of the Boy Scouts are clearly not a “ place , ” the Boy Scouts of America is not an “ accommodation ” in the the usual sense of the word , and the membership policies of private organizations are not “ public . ”
( Chapters 7 & 8 of my You Ca n’t Say That !
book deal with the use and abuse of public accommodations laws .
Since the book is now available used on Amazon for literally a penny , interested readers have little excuse not to buy it . )
Besides that , the decline of the principle that a business owner has at least some right to exclude what he deems undesireables has led to some very bizarre cases , none more so than the one described below , which a VC commenter alerted me to .
Here ’s the story , from a VC post from 2006 :
There is a German restaurant called the Alpine Village Inn , in Torrance California .
A group of four neo - Nazis went there to eat , each wearing a lapel pin with a swastika on it .
The management asked them to take off the lapel pins .
They refused .
The management asked them to leave .
They refused .
The management called the police , who arrested them .
Then , remarkably , the Southern California ACLU gets involved , and sues the restaurant for calling the police on the Nazis !
This much I ’ve confirmed from media accounts .
According to the commenter who first alerted me to this story , “ the defendants ’ insurer eventually settled following unsuccessful pretrial challenges to the complaint , believing they could not prevail under California law ! ”
I ’m informed that the restaurant actually lost at trial , and the insurer refused to foot the bill for an appeal .
The lawsuit was brought under California ’s Unruh Act , which provides that “ all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal , and no matter what their sex , race , color , religion , ancestry , national origin , disability , or medical condition are entitled to the full and equal accommodations , advantages facilities , privileges , or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever . ”
The California courts have held that the protected classes delineated by the Act are not exclusive ; the Act also protects arbitrary discrimination by a business establishment based on similar characteristics to the above .
Apparently , the insurer thought that “ political views ” was sufficiently similar to “ religion ” that the courts would likely rule against the insured .
( This was , after all , the Rose Bird Court , which issued a series of absurdly broad and illogical rulings under the Unruh Act ; in one of those opinions ( Isbister ) Bird personally gratuitously insulted a little old lady who donated money to a Boys ’ Club as one of the “ select few ” who wish to be “ insulated from the 20th century ” because the Boys ’ Club did n’t admit girls . )
There are several remarkable things about this story , which occurred in 1986 .
First , the ACLU of Southern California represented the Nazis , yet , at least by the late 1980s , this local ACLU branch was known as a vigorous proponent of hate speech regulations .
How to square that circle , I do n’t know .
Perhaps the organization had a sudden and dramatic leadership shift .
Perhaps the local ACLU leaders saw this as “ discrimination based on ideology in public accommodations ” and somehow did n’t notice it was also the suppression of hate speech .
Perhaps they just had their heads up their behinds .
Second , why was the ACLU concerned about the rights of the Nazi patrons , but not the owners ?
Why did n’t the owners have a right to send a message that they disapprove of Naziism ?
Third , even accepting the absurd premises apparently underlying this lawsuit , that the Unruh Act somehow protects Nazis from discrimination in public accommodation , where was the discrimination here ?
The restaurant did n’t refuse to serve the Nazis , it simply refused to serve them so long as they were turning the restaurant into a forum for promoting their Nazi views by wearing swastikas .
A restaurant could n’t discriminate against Satanists , does that mean they are required to let the Satanists wear T - shirts showing Jesus being tortured by a gleeful Lucifer ?
Fourth , under current hostile environment law , the restaurant could get in serious trouble for not ordering the Nazis to stop wearing the swastikas .
Tolerating swastika - wearing patrons would be considering by some to be the creation of an “ illegal hostile public environment ” for Jews , Gypsies , and others .
If you ’re familiar with my views on such issues , you know that I do n’t think the restaurant owners can or should be forced to censor the Nazis ’ expression of their views ( unless the owners censor all points of view except Naziism , which could then be seen as their way of getting around the law and excluding Jews ) , but I also do n’t think that the Nazis can or should have the right to impose their speech on the unwilling owners of the restaurant , who are acting not only on their own behalf , but as agents for their patrons .
Anyway , my jaw just dropped open when I read about this case , and it has n’t closed yet .
How did a civil rights principle meant to aid African Americans and others who suffered grievous discrimination for generations come to protect the “ right ” of Neo - Nazis to parade their Nazi wardrobes in a privately owned restaurant against the wishes of management ?
The short answer is that legislation and its interpretation does n’t develop from a coherent set of moral principles , but instead based on who is able to persuade the legislatures and the courts to adopt the principles they prefer .
The principle involved in Alpine Village case appears to be hostility to the rights of private property owners , not “ civil rights . ”

Will the New Perl Development Kit Bring Developers to the New Perl ?
The open source Perl development language is finally getting a needed boost in the form of the Perl Development Kit ( PDK ) .
While language itself was updated to version 5.12 in April , developers often need additional tools to enable deployment , something the PDK provides .
Software developer ActiveState this week released PDK 9 , an update to its toolkit for building and deploying Perl applications .
ActiveState 's toolkit bundles the Perl language for deployment on multiple platforms , including Windows and Linux .
Among the key improvements in PDK 9 is support for Perl 5.12 .
While Perl 5.12 has been available for over two months , it 's still very early in the adoption phase with most developers still using earlier versions of Perl , according to ActiveState .
There are a few reasons as to why most Perl developers have not updated to Perl 5.12 .
Jeff Hobbs , ActiveState 's director of engineering , told InternetNews.com that a lot of it has to do with maturity .
ActiveState itself lists the previous Perl 5.10 release as the default download for new users on its Web site .
Developers may choose to download Perl 5.12 , but that 's not a choice that many are making , yet .
Hobbs explained that many developers wait until the subsequent point release , in this case 5.12.1 to make sure that bugs have been worked out .
" It 's your typical chicken and egg dilemma .
Most people wo n't even test anything until the 5.12.1 is released , " Hobbs said .
" 5.12.1 has now been released and we will make that the default download soon . "
Even with Perl 5.12 not yet widely adopted , Hobbs sees value for developers in PDK 9.0 .
Among the tools in the PDK are ones that enable Perl developers to package Perl code into a Windows executable file .
There are also new features that will help users of Perl 5.10 and older versions of Perl as well .
Among the new features that will help Perl 5.10 users as well is the ability to build applications for the HP - UX Unix operating system .
PDK 9.0 also includes new support enabling Perl application deployment on 64 - bit versions of Microsoft 's .NET framework .
" With PDK 9.0 we 're preparing for the next wave of updates that Perl developers are making , " Hobbs said .
" While lots of people are n't yet moving to Perl 5.12 , they will in the future and the tools are now available and ready for them to do that . "

Since we first prowled the savannahs of Africa , human beings have displayed a few overpowering and ineradicable impulses — for food , for sex , and for drugs .
Every human society has hunted for its short cuts to an altered state :
The hunger for a chemical high , low , or pleasingly new shuffle sideways is universal .
Peer back through history , and it 's everywhere .
Ovid said drug - induced ecstasy was a divine gift .
The Chinese were brewing alcohol in prehistory and cultivating opium by 700 A.D. Cocaine was found in clay - pipe fragments from William Shakespeare 's house .
George Washington insisted American soldiers be given whiskey every day as part of their rations .
Human history is filled with chemicals , come - downs , and hangovers .
Yet in every generation , there are moralists why try to douse this natural impulse in moral condemnation and burn it away .
They believe that humans , stripped of their intoxicants , will become more rational or ethical or good .
They point to the addicts and the overdoses and believe they reveal the true face - and the logical endpoint - of your order at the bar or your roll - up .
And they believe it can be ended , if only we choose to do it .
Their vision holds an intoxicating promise of its own .
Their most famous achievement - the criminalisation of alcohol in the United States between 1921 and 1933 - is one of the great parables of modern history .
Daniel Okrent 's superb new history , ' Last Call : The Rise and Fall of Prohibition ' , shows how a coalition of mostly well - meaning , big - hearted people came together and changed the Constitution to ban booze .
On the day it began , one of the movement 's leaders , the former baseball hero turned evangelical preacher Billy Sunday , told his ecstatic congregation what the Dry New World would look like : " The reign of tears is over .
The slums will soon be only a memory .
We will turn our prisons into factories and our jails into storehouses .
Men will walk upright now , women will smile , and the children will laugh .
Hell will be forever rent . "
The story of the War on Alcohol has never needed to be told more urgently - because its grandchild , the War on Drugs , shares the same DNA .
Okrent only alludes to the parallel briefly , on his final page , but it hangs over the book like old booze - fumes - and proves yet again Mark Twain 's dictum : " History does n't repeat itself , but it does rhyme . "
There was never an America without chemical highs .
The Native Americans used hallucinogens , and the ship that brought John Winthrop and the first Puritans to the continent carried three times more beer than water , along with ten thousand gallons of wine .
It was immediately a society so soaked in alcohol that it makes your liver ache to read the raw statistics : by 1830 , the average citizen drank seven gallons of pure alcohol a year .
In 1839 , an English traveller called Frederick Marryat wrote : " I am sure that Americans can fix nothing without a drink .
If you meet , you drink ; if you make acquaintance , you drink ; they quarrel in their drink , and they make up with a drink .
They drink because it is hot ; they drink because it is cold ...
They commence it early in life , and the continue it until they soon drop into the grave . "
America was so hungry for highs that when there was a backlash against all this boozing , the temperance movement 's initial proposal was that people should water down their alcohol with opium .
It 's not hard to see how this fug of liquor caused problems , as well as pleasure - and the backlash was launched by a furious housewife with eight children from a small town in Cincinnati .
One Sunday in 1874 , Eliza Thompson - a woman who had never spoken out on any public issue before - stood before the crowds at her church and announced that America would never be free or godly until the last whisky bottle was emptied onto the dry earth .
A huge crowd of women cheered : they believed their husbands were squandering their wages at the saloon .
They marched as one to the nearest bar , where they all sank to their knees and prayed for the soul of its owner .
They refused to leave until he repented .
They worked in six hour prayer shifts on the streets , until the saloonkeeper finally appeared , head bowed , and agreed to shut it down .
This prayerathon then moved around every alcohol - seller in the town .
Within ten days , only four of the original thirteen remained , and the rebellion was spreading across the country .
It was women who led the first cry for Temperance , and it was women who made Prohibition happen .
A woman called Carry Nation became a symbol of the movement when she travelled from bar to bar with an oversized hatchet and smashed them to pieces .
Indeed , Prohibition was one of the first and most direct effects of expanding the vote .
This is one of the first strange flecks of gray in this story : the proponents of prohibition were primarily progressives - and some of the most admirable people in American history .
The pioneering suffragist Susan B Anthony gave her first public speech demanding a booze ban .
The ex-slave and abolitionist Frederick Douglas said : " If we could make the world sober , we would have no slavery . "
America 's greatest Socialist , Eugene V. Debs , said liquor was a capitalist tool to render the workers supine .
The pioneers of American feminism believed alcohol was at the root of men's brutality towards women .
The anti-slavery movement saw alcohol addiction as a new form of slavery , replacing leg irons with whisky bottles .
You can see the same left - wing prohibitionism today , when people like Al Sharpton says drugs must be criminalized because addiction does real harm in ghettoes .
Of course , there were more obviously sinister proponents of Prohibition too , pressing progressives into weird alliances .
The Ku Klux Klan said that " nigger gin " was the main reason why oppressed black people were prone to rebellion , and if you banned alcohol , they would become quiescent .
The dry newspaper the Nashville Tenessean wrote : " The Negro , fairly docile and industrious , becomes , when filled with liquor , turbulent and dangerous and a menace to life , proporty , and the repose of the community . "
And of course there were hints that white women were in greater danger : one Congressman said alcohol " increases the menace of the black man 's presence . "
This , too , is still there in America 's current strain of prohibition .
Powder cocaine and crack cocaine are equally harmful , but crack - which is disproportionately used by black people - carries much heavier jail sentences than powder cocaine , which is disproportionately used by white people .
It was in this context that the Anti-Saloon League rose to become the most powerful pressure group in American history , and the only one to ever change the constitution through peaceful political campaigning .
They announced their movement " was begun by Almighty God . "
In fact , it was begun by a little man called Wayne Wheeler , who was as dry as the Sahara and twice as overheated .
One of Wheeler 's friends said of him : " Like most humourless men , he had to make life into a crusade to make sense of it . "
Okrent compares him to Ned Flanders , but he was a political genius , maneuvering politicians of all parties into backing a ban .
He made them change the school curriculum so children were taught that " the majority of beer drinkers die of dropsy " because it is " a narcotic poison [ that will ] deaden or paralyze the brain . "
Wheeler and the Prohibitionists had a structural advantage over his enemies .
As the writer George Ade pointed out : " The Non-Drinkers were organising for fifty years but the Drinkers had no organization whatsoever .
They had been too busy drinking . "
The League succeeded in 1921 , when the Eighteenth Amendment came into effect , and it became a crime to drink alcohol anywhere in the United States .
They celebrated the arrival of Utopia - and the inevitable dysfunctions of prohibition began .
When you ban a popular drug that millions of people want , it does n't disappear .
Instead , it is transferred from the legal economy into the hand of armed criminal gangs .
Across America , gangsters rejoiced that they had just been handed one of the biggest markets in the country , and unleashed an Armada of freighters , steamers , and even submarines to bring booze back .
Nobody who wanted a drink went without .
As the journalist Malcolm Bingay wrote : " It was absolutely impossible to get a drink , unless you walked at least ten feet and told the busy bartender in a voice loud enough for him to hear you above the uproar . "
So if it did n't stop alcoholism , what did it achieve ?
The same as prohibition does today - a massive unleashing of criminality and violence .
Before prohibition , the saloon - keepers could defend their property and their markets by going to the police if they were threatened .
After prohibition , the bootleggers could only defend theirs with guns - and they did .
As the legendary lawyer Clarence Darrow explained : " The business pays very well , but it is outside the law and they can't go to court , like shoe dealers or real estate men or grocers when they think an injustice has been done them , or unfair competition has arisen in their territory .
So , they naturally shoot . "
Massive gang wars broke out , with the members torturing and murdering each other first to gain control of and then to retain their patches .
Thousands of ordinary citizens were caught in the crossfire .
The icon of the new criminal class was Al Capone , a figure so fixed in our minds as the scar - faced King of Charismatic Crime , pursued by the rugged federal agent Eliot Ness , that Okrent 's biographical details seem oddly puncturing .
Capone was only 25 when he tortured his way to running Chicago 's underworld .
He was gone from the city by the age of 30 , and a syphillitic corpse by 40 .
But he was an eloquent exponent of his own case , saying simply : " I give to the public what the public wants .
I never had to send out high pressure salesmen .
Why , I could never meet the demand . "
By 1926 , he and his fellow gangsters were making $ 3.6bn ( in 1926 money ! ) .
To give some perspective , that was more than the entire expenditure of the US government .
The criminals could outbid and outgun the state .
So they crippled the institutions of a democratic state and ruled , just as drug gangs do today in Mexico , Afghanistan , and ghettoes from South Central Los Angeles to the banlieues of Paris .
They have been handed a market so massive that they can tool up to intimidate everyone in their area , bribe many police and judges into submission , and achieve such a vast size the honest police could n't even begin to get them all .
The late Nobel Prize winning economist Milton Friedman said : " Al Capone epitomizes our earlier attempts at Prohibition ; the Crips and Bloods epitomize this one . "
Occasionally , the alcohol gangs would have " Peace Conferences " in Atlantic City where they would divide up the country , fix prices , and agree to stay out of the other 's territory - and violence would go down .
But then the police would try to take out one of the many gangs , and war would break out again to seize control of the newly - available territory .
This dynamic explains something that might appear , at first , to be a paradox : the more the police try to enforce prohibition , the worse the drug violence becomes .
Since Mexican President Felipe Calderon tried to knock out the heads of the drug gangs , 40,000 people have been killed .
Each killing triggers a new war for the dead dealer 's patch .
Of course excessive alcohol and drug use can cause terrible harm : I have friends whose lives have been ruined by it .
But the harm caused by prohibition soon outweighs the harm caused by the drug itself - whether it 's alcohol or cannabis or cocaine .
An appalled President Hoover soon said in private that prohibition had caused " a complete breakdown in Government " in Detroit with " indiscrimiate shooting on the river . "
Sound familiar ?
One insight , more than any other , ripples down from Okrent 's history to our own bout of prohibition .
Armed criminal gangs do n't fear prohibition : they love it .
He has uncovered fascinating evidence that the criminal gangs sometimes financially supported dry politicians , precisely to keep it in place .
They knew if it ended , most of organised crime in America would be bankrupted .
When Michael Levine , one of America 's top narcotics agents , went undercover in the 1980s and 1990s with la Mafia Cruenza , the Bolivian cocaine cartel , he discovered that , as he puts it , " not only did they not fear our war on drugs , they actually counted on it . "
The cartel 's boss , Jorge Roman , told him the drug war was " a sham on the American tax payer " and bragged it was " actually good for business . "
When Levine told his boss , the officer in charge of the US drug war in South America , about this , he replied : " Yeah , we know it does n't work , but we sold [ the War on Drugs ] up and down the Potomac . "
So it 's a nasty irony that Prohibitionists try to present legalizers - then , and now - as " the bootlegger 's friend " or " the drug - dealer 's ally . "
Precisely the opposite is the truth .
Legalizers are the only people who can bankrupt and destroy the drug - gangs , just as they destroyed Capone .
Only the prohibitionists can keep them alive .
Once a product is controlled only by criminals , all safety controls vanish - and the drug becomes far more deadly .
After 1921 , it became common to dilute and relabel poisonous industrial alcohol , which could still legally be bought , and sell it by the pint - glass .
This " rotgut " caused epidemics of paralysis and poisoning .
For example , one single batch of bad booze permenantly crippled 500 people in Wichita in early 1927 - a usual event .
That year , 760 people were poisoned to death by bad booze in New York City alone .
So many people became partially paralysed by an industrial alcohol known as ' Jake ' that a shuffling , stumbling inability to walk was known ' Jake leg . '
Wayne
Wheeler persuaded the government not to remove fatal toxins from industrial alcohol , saying it was good to keep this ' disincentive ' in place .
Prohibition 's flaws were so obvious that the politicians in charge privately admitted the law was self - defeating .
Warren Harding brought $ 1800 of booze with him to the White House , while Andrew Mellon - in charge of enforcing the law - called it " unworkable . "
Similarly , the last three Presidents of the US have been recreational drug users in their youth .
If the law was enforced in full , they would all have been ineligible to vote , never mind enter the Oval Office .
Once he ceased to be President , Bill Clinton called for the decriminalisation of cannabis , and Obama probably will too .
Yet in office , they continue to mouth prohibitionist platitudes about " eradicating drugs " , and insist the rest of the world 's leaders resist the calls for greater liberalisation from their populations and instead " crack down " on the drug gangs - no matter how much violence it unleashes .
The need to mouth this script can lead even the sharpest brains into unwitting absurdities .
Obama recently praised Calderon for his " crackdown " on drugs by - with no apparent irony - calling him " Mexico's Eliot Ness . "
Yes : he praised an enforcer of drug prohibition by comparing him to an enforcer of alcohol prohibition .
Obama should know that Ness came to regard his War on Alcohol as a disastrous failure , and he died a drunk himself - but drug prohibition addles politicians ' brains just as drugs addle a chronic addict's .
By 1928 , the failure of alcohol prohibition was plain - yet its opponents were demoralised and despairing .
It looked like a fixed and immovable part of the American political landscape , since it would require big majorities in every state to amend the Constitution again .
Clarence Darrow wrote that " thirteen dry states with a population of less than New York State alone can prevent repeal until Haley 's Comet returns , " so " one might as well talk about taking a summer vacation of Mars . "
Yet it happened .
It happened suddenly and completely .
Why ?
The prohibitionists made a serious miscalculations : they reacted to their failure by demanding the laws be tightened even more .
Misdemeanours were turned into felonies - and it threw up a series of judgements shocked America .
For example , one 48 year old mother called Etta Mae Miller with ten children was given a life sentence - for selling two pints of liquor to an undercover cop .
But the biggest answer is found in your wallet , with the hard cash .
After the Great Crash , the government 's revenues from income taxes collapsed by 60 percent in just three years , while the need for spending to stimulate the economy was sky - rocketing .
The US government needed a new source of income , fast .
The giant untaxed , unchecked alcohol industry suddenly looked like a giant pot of cash at the end of the prohibitionist rainbow .
They needed it .
Could the same thing happen today , after our own Great Crash ?
The bankrupt state of California is about to hold a referendum to legalize and tax cannabis , and Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has pointed out that it could raise massive sums .
Yes , history does rhyme .
Many people understandably worry that legalization would cause a huge rise in drug use - but the facts suggest this is n't the case .
Portugal decriminalized the personal possession of all drugs in 2001 , and - as a study by Glenn Greenwald for the American Enterprise Institute found - it had almost no effect at all .
Indeed , drug use fell a little among the young .
Similarly , Okrent says the end of alcohol prohibition " made it harder , not easier , to get a drink ...
Now there were closing hours and age limits and Sunday blue laws , as well as a collection of geographic prosecriptions that kept bars or package stories distant from schools , churches and hospitals . "
People did n't drink much more .
The only change was that they did n't have to turn to armed criminal gangs for it , and they did n't end up swigging poison .
Who now defends alcohol prohibition ?
Is there a single person left ?
This echoing silence is suggestive .
Ending drug prohibition seems like a huge heave , just as ending alcohol prohibition did .
But when it is gone , when the drug gangs are a bankrupted memory , when drug addicts are treated not as immoral criminals but as ill people needing healthcare , who will grieve ?
American history is pocked by utopian movements that prefer glib wish - thinking over a hard scrutiny of reality , but they always crest and crash in the end .
For the first time , scientists have linked a brain compound called kynurenic acid to cognition , possibly opening doors for new ways to enhance memory function and treat catastrophic brain diseases , according to a new study from the University of Maryland School of Medicine .
When researchers decreased the levels of kynurenic acid in the brains of mice , their cognition was shown to improve markedly , according to the study , which was published in the July issue of the journal Neuropsychopharmacology .
The study is the result of decades of pioneering research in the lab of Robert Schwarcz , Ph.D. , a professor of psychiatry , pediatrics and pharmacology and experimental therapeutics at the University of Maryland School of Medicine .
" We believe that interventions aimed specifically at reducing the level of kynurenic acid in the brain are a promising strategy for cognitive improvement in both healthy patients and in those suffering from a variety of brain diseases ranging from schizophrenia to Alzheimer 's disease , " says Dr. Schwarcz .
Kynurenic acid is a substance with unique biological properties and is produced when the brain metabolizes the amino acid L - tryptophan .
The compound is related to another breakdown product of tryptophan known as quinolinic acid .
In 1983 , Dr. Schwarz published a paper in the journal Science identifying the critical role excessive quinolinic acid plays in the neurodegenerative disorder Huntington 's disease .
He has since designed a therapeutic strategy targeting quinolinic acid for the treatment of Huntington 's disease .
Dr. Schwarcz also is involved in a company called VistaGen , which pursues the development of neuroprotective drugs based on this concept .
In the study published this month , Dr. Schwarcz and his colleagues at the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center -- a clinical and basic science research center at the University of Maryland School of Medicine -- examined mice that had been genetically engineered to have more than 70 percent lower kynurenic acid levels than ordinary mice .
These mice were found to perform significantly better than their normal peers on several widely used tests that specifically measure function in the hippocampus .
The hippocampus is a critical area of the brain for memory and spatial navigation .
The mice were clearly superior in their ability to explore and recognize objects , to remember unpleasant experiences and to navigate a maze .
The engineered animals also showed increased hippocampal plasticity , meaning they had a greatly improved ability to convert electrical stimuli into long - lasting memories .
" These results are very exciting , because they open up an entirely new way of thinking about the formation and retrieval of memories , " says Dr. Schwarcz .
" Kynurenic acid has been known for more than 150 years , but only now do we recognize it as a major player in one of the fundamental functions of the brain .
Our most recent work , still unpublished , shows that new chemicals that specifically influence the production of kynurenic acid in the brain predictably affect cognition .
We are now in the process of developing such compounds for cognitive enhancement in humans . "
" I feel confident Dr. Schwarcz 's determined pursuit of answers for the desperate patients suffering from devastating neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer 's disease and Huntington 's disease , and psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia , will pay off , " says E. Albert Reece , M.D. , Ph.D. , M.B.A. , vice president for medical affairs , University of Maryland , and John Z. and Akiko K. Bowers Distinguished Professor and dean , University of Maryland School of Medicine .
" His work creates hope for these patients and their families , and his findings are making a significant impact on the field of neuroscience and psychiatric medicine . "
Under reconstruction
AFTER more than a year of furious but rarely public debate , this week Hong Kong was about to adopt a minimum - wage law .
The legislature 's decision was due after The Economist went to press , but all sides expected a bill to be passed .
The pay floor will be low , probably between HK $ 23 ( $ 3 ) and HK$ 33 an hour ; the higher figure is trade unionists ' target ( see picture ) .
More important than the level is what the law signifies about the territory 's economy .
Once famous — or notorious — for its swashbuckling , free - market ways , Hong Kong is becoming a more regulated place .
Will it become less prosperous too ?
The minimum - wage law follows other employment legislation , as well as government forays into business , expanded public services and industrial policy .
Such things have long been normal in other countries , but were novelties in Hong Kong .
You might suppose them to be a product of the handover of sovereignty to China 13 years ago , yet they have as much to do with steps taken in the final colonial years , when government spending as a share of GDP increased notably ( see chart 1 ) and with the ( limited ) post - colonial expansion of political rights .
Indeed Chinese officials , fearing the consequences of costly economic populism , have often been vocal advocates of restraint .
Because changes have come incrementally , direct taxation remains low and Hong Kong has been spared the costs of armed forces , the shift is easy to overlook .
But their collective impact reflects a dramatic turn in what Milton Friedman once described as the world 's greatest experiment in laissez - faire capitalism .
Impure freedom
Of course , Hong Kong was never entirely free of state interference .
Immediately after receiving a semblance of legal title in 1841 under the Convention of Chuenpi , the British began their first municipal building project , a cemetery for the legions of colonisers taken by dysentery and malaria .
The colonial government kept control of a critical resource : land .
It granted only limited leases , with the sole exception of the local headquarters of the Anglican church .
The property market that has since developed , an almost impenetrable blend of government and tycoons , could satisfy no free - market purist .
The property market 's distortions feed through to other sectors , such as retailing .
Another exception to the free - market rule is the currency 's peg at around $ 7.80 to the American dollar .
And the state has also had a habit of granting or tolerating monopolies , for example in gambling .
Hong Kong 's way has by no means been synonymous with perfect competition .
Yet as state intervention grew elsewhere , especially after the second world war , Hong Kong remained free of controls on prices , wages and imports , of regulation of business and employment and , in Friedman 's words , of officials ' instinct “ to spend other people 's money and meddle in other people 's affairs ” .
As The Economist put it in 1977 : “ A businessman setting up shop in Hong Kong finds low taxes , no foolish government interferences … a government leaning over to encourage him to make as much money as he can .
He finds , blessed discovery , no politics . ”
Often , this was the result of resistance to the British government .
No fewer than three times , starting in 1947 , instructions came from London to raise tax rates “ as high as possible ” to lay the foundation of a modern welfare state , says Michael Littlewood of the University of Auckland .
But each time the peculiar men sent to govern Hong Kong balked , with the support of locals , notably Chinese businessmen who perhaps learned too much about socialism from the devastation unfolding on the mainland to encourage importing it .
Free -market faith reached its apogee in 1961 - 71 , when Sir John Cowperthwaite was the colony 's financial secretary .
Defending his first budget , Cowperthwaite rejected subsidies for start - ups ( “ an infant industry , if coddled , tends to remain an infant industry ” ) ; cheap land for strategic businesses ( anything but an auction “ leads to an inefficient use of our resources ” ) and most of all , industrial policy ( “ better …to rely on the …hidden hand than trust the clumsy bureaucratic fingers ” ) .
His belief in Adam Smith withstood tests that would have shrivelled fainter souls .
Two banks went bust in 1965 , leading to calls for depositors to be made good by the government ( which would then recover what it could from the liquidation of bank assets ) , for the introduction of deposit insurance and the creation of a government - backed industrial bank .
Cowperthwaite dismissed all out of hand , saying the core of the financial system was sound .
Depositors ' losses served as a lesson in moral hazard .
The government was not entirely inactive .
Liquidity was provided to maintain credit lines that might otherwise have evaporated .
Another troubled bank was folded into HSBC , with a guarantee , according to some .
But any state pledge was granted in secret , out of shame at the appearance of intervention .
Cowperthwaite was similarly opposed to five - year development plans , noting that revenues to offset expenses were not predictable .
The publication of official statistics was curtailed , for fear that it would encourage civil servants to meddle .
When the tourism industry asked for help , Cowperthwaite responded by taxing hotels to recover costs — and to discourage other petitioners .
Even public services were privately run .
The government built piers for cross - harbour ferries , but the ferries , as well as the buses and the tunnels under the harbour , were put into private hands .
Austerity was maintained despite pressing social needs and a torrent of immigrants .
Penniless refugees from China poured over the border ; the territory 's population doubled between 1948 and 1965 .
They found public order and freedom but not much else from the government until a belated housebuilding spree in the 1970s — carried out , naturally , within rigid financial constraints .
A miserly government , a lack of natural resources and a hostile northern neighbour became a backdrop for what people can achieve when left to their own devices .
Economic growth was staggering ( see chart 2 ) .
Over a few short decades Hong Kong was transformed from one of the world 's poorest places into one of its richest , as it remains ( see chart 3 ) .
The struggle over the minimum wage reflects a gradual shift , not a sudden one .
Legislation giving the colony 's governor the right ( but not the obligation ) to impose a minimum wage was enacted in 1932 , augmented in 1940 and considered again in 1999 .
A voluntary plan for a minimum wage was proposed in 2006 .
Only now is a pay floor becoming law .
Lee Cheuk - yan , a union leader and member of the legislature , says this has occurred despite the private opposition of Donald Tsang , Hong Kong 's chief executive , and many business groups .
But with the notable exception of the Lion Rock Institute , a free - market think - tank , public comment has been minimal .
The few groups to raise objections , such as caterers and restaurateurs , have been criticised in the press and have retreated .
In August the government will set the level of the minimum wage .
Even at the low end of expectations , it will be about HK $ 1 more than leading fast - food outlets often pay — a good guide to market conditions — so many poorly paid people will get a boost .
Legislation will then be introduced to limit working hours .
Following that a push is expected for collective bargaining , a right granted by the colonial government just before the handover but reversed immediately after it .
Mr Lee thinks there is popular support for both .
Secondary consequences are inevitable .
Miriam Lau , a Liberal member of the legislature , says that even at HK $ 24 an hour , the minimum wage would cost 30,000 jobs , or 1 % of the workforce .
At HK $ 32 , 170,000 jobs would go , doubling unemployment .
Young people and immigrants from China , who are scooped by the territory 's abundant restaurants , building sites and cleaning and delivery businesses , would be the likeliest to be out of work .
Such industries also employ disabled and older workers on low pay .
Subsidies to support such people may have to be expanded if they lose their jobs .
The minimum wage will also expand the rules involved in doing business in Hong Kong .
Especially at the entrepreneurial end of the spectrum , business people long enjoyed a lack of red tape .
Until 1999 companies were required to tell the government when an employee arrived or departed , and to provide information on their incomes once a year so that taxes could be calculated .
But because income tax was paid only above HK$ 90,000 and then HK $ 100,000 , perhaps 60 % of the population paid nothing .
Tiny businesses often did not bother to file and their non-compliance was largely ignored .
Even sophisticated multinationals could set up a representative office in hours without concern for continuous paperwork .
This changed in 2000 with a compulsory pension scheme , one of many social - policy efforts championed by the last colonial administration .
Companies were required to file monthly data to one of a few selected intermediaries and to remit 5 % of pay for any employee on more than HK$ 5,000 a month .
The minimum wage will increase the demand for paperwork again , and by a lot .
Hours and wages will be filed for all workers , right down to people in the knick - knack shops and markets that have been a vibrant component of Hong Kong 's economy .
The government will have to spend more money on collecting data and inspecting firms .
Rules for all
Other labour - market rules have come along .
You may say some were overdue : in 1996 discrimination on grounds of sex , disability and family status became explicitly illegal ; in 2009 the ordinance was expanded to include race .
Professions began imposing local standards .
Hong Kong had , for example , been an appealing destination for doctors from around the world .
During Cowperthwaite 's tenure , more than half of physicians born in Hong Kong had been educated overseas .
But in 1997 new licences were restricted to those who were locally certified .
Foreign - trained specialists have become increasingly scarce .
A provision in the minimum - wage law bans unpaid student internships for all but those attending Hong Kong schools .
Product markets have more rules too .
Hong Kong 's enthusiastic embrace of free trade made its food shops a collection of the world 's favourite goodies .
But on July 1st a food - labelling law came into effect with the usual laudable motivations — better information and concern about tainted products from China — and the usual unintended consequences .
The Hong Kong Food Council , a trade association , released a survey shortly before the law 's introduction concluding that 10 % of all the prepackaged products sold in the territory would not comply and would have to be withdrawn .
A large grocery chain has already pulled more than 1,000 items , including commonly available breakfast cereals , from its shelves .
Small shops selling ethnic and health food say the rules may wipe out their entire stocks .
In finance also , intervention has been on the rise .
The Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation was created just before the handover with the overt aim of encouraging home ownership , rather like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the American behemoths that were at the core of the recent global crisis .
Hong Kong banks have conventionally been conservative lenders , extending mortgages that cover less than 70 % , and sometimes even less than 50 % , of property values .
An insurance scheme provided by the Mortgage Corporation enables local banks to advance loans of up to 95 % of values .
Like Fannie and Freddie it has become a huge force in the wholesale market by buying , packaging and reselling mortgages .
It has ventured abroad too : in 2008 it created a joint venture in Malaysia to provide mortgage guarantees ; in 2009 it created another in Shenzhen and it bought South Korean mortgage - backed securities .
In response to the Asian financial crisis of 1997 - 98 , the government directly intervened in the Hong Kong stockmarket , buying up local shares .
Though its stake was largely liquidated by 2002 , HK$ 50 billion - worth was retained by a fund controlled by the central bank .
This portfolio has since swollen and contracted more than the local market , suggesting that it is being actively managed .
And in 2008 , in the midst of the global financial crisis , Hong Kong introduced universal deposit insurance , which it had explicitly rejected in the 1960s .
The law is set to expire at the end of the year , but regulators and bankers say unofficially that it would be unthinkable for the territory to allow a bank to collapse .
Perhaps the most intriguing change , although little noticed so far , is a new monopoly law , a draft of which was entered into the government records on July 2nd .
In principle , such a law should foster competition .
In practice , it is likely to extend the purview of the state into private business , not least mergers — while leaving established monopolies , often associated with the government , entrenched .
Behind the scenes some of these have been busily seeking exemptions .
One such monopoly is the Jockey Club , which owns the gambling franchise .
It is simultaneously the largest direct taxpayer , responsible for 7 % of total receipts , and through its contributions to schools , hospitals and other charities , drawn from profits , accounts for perhaps another 0.7 % of spending on public services .
Lots of companies would love to bust this monopoly — for evidence , look at their enthusiastic entry into neighbouring Macau — but because of its philanthropic role the Jockey Club is likely to be protected .
Under reconstruction
Other monopolists can expect to get similar treatment .
In 1986 four stock and derivative exchanges were merged into a regulated monopoly .
Shares in the exchange were publicly listed but in 2007 the government disclosed that it had 6 % of the openly traded shares , making it the largest owner .
Consequently it has a direct financial interest in the exchange 's success .
Attempts since to set up alternative markets in Hong Kong have been stymied by protective regulations .
The government is also increasing its role in transport .
State involvement is common in many countries , but in Hong Kong this is at odds with the free - market past .
The entrance to the Cross - Harbour Tunnel , which was built in the 1970s under a private tender but reverted to government control in 1999 , is permanently gridlocked , partly thanks to tolls that are too low , especially at peak hours .
The new airport was structured as an independent entity that could be listed , but any talk of privatisation has disappeared .
Two vast new projects , a bridge to Macau and a high - speed railway to Guangzhou , are being handled directly by the government , with no tendering and no discussion of privatisation .
Only a few years ago it appeared that the government 's steps into the economy would be curtailed by experience .
Heavy subsidies to create a Disney amusement park and a place called Cyberport , to encourage the development of internet - related companies , both drew strong criticism .
The park has not been a success and Cyberport is best known as an investment coup for the tycoon who was able to obtain cheap land under an industrial scheme that could be resold as luxury flats .
But similar schemes abound .
Disney recently received more land .
New areas are being reserved for “ science parks ” and , turning the infant - industry argument upside down , money is being allocated to rejuvenate Hong Kong 's faded film industry .
These are not disconnected episodes .
Underlying them is a shift in officialdom 's view of the economy .
In 2008 Mr Tsang announced that he had succeeded in having Hong Kong included within China 's five - year plans .
Last year he said that in light of the global financial crisis , “ we have to revisit the government 's role in promoting economic development ” and special efforts would be made to encourage the growth of six industries .
Hong Kong , in other words , now has an industrial policy .
Milton 's paradise lost
Cowperthwaite gave two plausible reasons for such efforts .
First , a country might need to develop natural resources .
But that did not apply to Hong Kong .
Second , countries might be less interested in maximising wealth than distributing it .
He also thought that a false step .
Mr Tsang and his colleagues are all for wealth maximisation too , but it may be that Hong Kong , no longer being a poor outpost , has lost the stomach to work like one .
The huge growth in government spending during the last colonial administration was required , according to Lord Patten , the final governor , because “ Hong Kong 's economic vitality and strength were not matched by adequate social - welfare . ”
Many recent shifts in the law have elements of social policy , and many of the most vocal advocates of the shift reflect the opening of the political system , creating pressure for real problems to be addressed .
Hong Kong remains , by and large , a vibrant , entrepreneurial place , with government spending far below Western standards .
The costs of rising intervention will take a while to appear — and may always be hard to measure , especially with mainland China growing so fast .
Yet a remarkable economic experiment is at an end .
If the RIAA ( Recording Industry Association of America ) gets its way , the file - sharing company LimeWire will get blasted out of existence with a billion dollar fine .
Meanwhile , British Petroleum , with its oil spill , that 's on its way to the ecology disaster level of a Chernobyl , is liable for up to $ 75 - million under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 .
What 's wrong with this picture ?
That 's a best case estimate .
The RIAA actually thinks LimeWire owes them $ 1.5 trillion ..
They came up with that number on a fine of $ 750 dollars per copyright infringement multiplied by 200 million estimated occurrences of copyright infringement .
Are n't you sorry now that you did n't just buy Barnes & Barnes ' Fish Heads from the iTunes Store for 99 cents ?
Of course , BP may yet end up getting sued to death as well , but I think we can all agree that BP's ' mis - steps ' were just a wee bit bigger than LimeWire 's enabling users to share music files .
So , why is LimeWire the one getting knocked about ?
The court system is a train - wreck .
But , anyone who follows the madness that is the U.S. patent system in the courts already knows that .
All we can do is shake our heads in disgust .
LimeWire 's executives are hoping for some kind of deal that will let them survive .
I can't see that happening .
The RIAA has asked for a permanent injunction on LimeWire 's services .
Let 's face it , the RIAA has LimeWire where it wants them :
On the way to bankruptcy court .
There 's no question that LimeWire was used to trade music tracks and other proprietary files .
Yes , that 's not good .
I 'd feel a lot better about this though if whatever money the RIAA squeezes out of the LimeWire stone went to musicians and other content creators .
It wo n't .
It will go to the corporations that have totally failed to realize that the digital revolution was wrecking their old physical media -CD , DVD , and tape - based business .
The RIAA companies could have figured this out .
Instead , like buggy whip vendors trying to outlaw horseless carriages , they keep suing both companies , like Napster and individuals like Joel Tenenbaum , who was hit by a $ 675,000 fine in a RIAA lawsuit for distributing thirty ( yes , 30 ) songs over a peer - to - peer network .
And , what has all this done ?
In 2000 , when Napster was the RIAA 's bogeyman , the RIAA claimed that 1.08 - billion units ( read albums ) were sold .
In 2009 , while physical units continued their decline , 309.5 - million , the RIAA 's numbers showed , that legal digital music downloads were up to 1,236.8 - billion .
Of course , in 2000 , the RIAA was n't even measuring digital downloads .
What was the cause of this improvement in business during a truly awful time in the economy ?
It was n't lawsuits , or half - baked DRM ( digital rights management ) that only gets in the way of legal users .
It was companies like Apple , which embraced digital downloads .
Showing just how dumb they are , the RIAA has feuded with Apple over how it delivers music .
Listen , get into the 21st century already RIAA .
So what if you beat LimeWire into the ground ?
Another file sharing service will just arise to take its place .
Slam more individuals with ridiculous fines ?
Watch your customers get even more annoyed with you .
The 20th century and many of its business models are done .
Get over it .
Start working with the Internet and its users .
In the long run , it 's the only way you 'll survive .
What 's to stop an Apple or some other forward - thinking companies to start signing recording artists ?
If you do n't change with the times ... well , seen many buggy whips on sale lately ?

Peu de gens connaissaient l’existence d’un abri nucléaire à Québec .
Un bâtiment conçu pour protéger 400 personnes lors d’une éventuelle attaque nucléaire .
Cet abri et 5 autres ont été construits pour abriter le gouvernement intérimaire de leur province respective .
Nous avons visité celui de Valcartier pour vous .
L’abri de Valcartier a été construit en octobre 1963 au coût de 223 625 $ .
Ce montant peut paraître peu , mais si on l’indexe à 2010 , cela nous fait un montant de 1,6 M$ .
Le bâtiment est sur 2 étages de 80 mètres ( 262 ′ ) par 40 mètres ( 131′ ) .
Le rez - de - chaussée est recouvert de terre et de gazon .
Un escalier permet d’accéder à l’autre étage au sous - sol .
Un plus grand « bunkers » ( 4 étages ) avait été construit à Carp en banlieue d’Ottawa ( localisation sur Google Map ) pour le gouvernement fédéral .
L’opposition fédérale à l’époque se moquait de ces installations et les surnommait les « Diefenbunkers ».
Un surnom inspiré de John Diefenbaker , le premier ministre canadien à l’époque .
Le bâtiment de Carp appartient au Musée de la Guerre froide et peut être visité par le public .
Le rez - de - chaussée
On accède au rez - de - chaussée par un court tunnel .
Au bout de ce dernier , plusieurs portes doubles renforcées doivent être franchies pour accéder à l’intérieur .
Une porte simple sur la droite permet d’accéder aux douches de décontamination .
À gauche , l ’entrée du bunker .
Au centre , le tunnel vu de l’intérieur .
Puis à droite , la première porte blindée .
Une des portes renforçée , avec une vue rapproché des barrures
Douches de décontamination
Lors d’une contamination de radiation à l’extérieur , celui ou celle qui aurait voulu pénétrer dans le « bunker » , aurait dû jeter ses vêtements et se doucher .
Les douches ressemblent à des postes douaniers .
On y entre d’un côté et on en sort décontaminé de l’autre .
Chaque douche a sa porte pour créer un sas fermé .
Ce sont des douches normales avec un plancher de béton .
C’est l’une des pièces les plus originales du bâtiment .
De nos jours , elle est fermée à clé en tout temps et n’a subi aucune modification au fil des années .
Lors de la visite , il n’y avait même pas d’ampoule électrique dans le plafonnier .
La photo de gauche montre la porte d’entrée du bunker , vue de l’intérieur .
Le rond blanc en haut était un système de ventilation .
La porte blanche à gauche est l’entrée des douches de décontamination , que l’on peut ( presque ) voir sur la photo de droite .
Salle à manger
La salle à manger est la plus grande pièce de l’abri .
Elle est située au fond à droite .
La cuisine était dans la même pièce et elle occupait le mur du fond .
Elle comportait plusieurs exemplaires d’électroménagers .
Aujourd ’hui , l’équipement de cuisine a été retiré , mais on voit toujours la céramique turquoise sur le dosseret .
Fait intéressant , on peut accéder à une cage d’escalier à l’aide d’une lourde porte renforcée .
C’est un escalier en colimaçon très étroit en métal qui se rend au toit .
La cage d’escalier a des murs en béton et on remarque de nombreuses traces d’écoulement d’eau de pluie depuis longtemps .
Elle se descend aussi au sous - sol dans une pièce d’entreposage .
Il est impossible d’ouvrir les portes de l’intérieur de la cage d’escalier .
Un occupant du bâtiment doit le faire .
Cet escalier aurait pu servir de sortie de secours pour accéder à un hélicoptère sur le toit .
À gauche , l ’entrée de l’escalier de secours .
Au centre , l’intérieur du minuscule endroit .
L’escalier débouche sur la photo de droite , prise du bâtiment en ciment à droite sur la toute première photo de cet article
Dortoirs
L’essentiel des chambres à coucher est au rez - de - chaussée .
Ce sont des petites pièces avec un ameublement rudimentaire .
Il existe des chambres seules , pour officiers , et des chambres à 2 , 4 et 6 .
Le mobilier original est toujours là sauf les matelas qui ont été renouvelés .
Il y a des petites tables de nuit et des commodes 3 tiroirs arborant la robe et le turquoise pâle qui témoignent bien de leur âge vénérable .
Dans certaines chambres plus grandes , il y a des casiers de rangement fermés vissés au mur .
Certaines chambres ont des lavabos .
Cette section est un peu un labyrinthe .
Plusieurs corridors étroits ont été faits pour accéder aux petites chambres .
L’orientation est difficile .
Le labyrinthe des dortoirs , suivant d’une chambre simple , puis double , et une chambre à 6 .
Enfin , deux commodes d’un autre temps , toujours utilisées
Les salles de bains communes
Il y a des salles de bains séparées pour les hommes et pour les femmes .
Dans celle des hommes , il y a une petite tablette en métal devant chaque miroir pour déposer ses effets personnels ( rasoir , brosse à dents , etc. ) .
Les urinoirs du côté des hommes sont défectueux et ils étaient condamnés lors de notre visite .
Sans avoir visité le côté des femmes , j’ai remarqué à distance qu’on avait eu la délicate attention de peindre les murs d’une couleur rose pâle ou d’un lilas .
Autre signe de l’époque , les machines de lavage du linge y étaient installées aussi .
Les salles de bains , toujours décorées à la mode « école primaire 1970 »
Le sous-sol
Le sous - sol comporte plusieurs pièces communes .
Certaines sections n’ont pas pu être visitées puisqu’elles servent actuellement pour des activités confidentielles .
Cela nous a tout de même permis de visiter plusieurs locaux intéressants .
Grands locaux
Les forces utilisent de grandes pièces comme salles de formation .
D’ailleurs , lors de notre passage plusieurs soldats étaient présents pour des formations dans le cadre de leur montée en puissance pour se rendre en Afghanistan .
Pour les technophiles , il y avait aussi une salle d’entraînement avec des simulateurs informatiques de combat .
Fait inexpliquée , certaines grandes salles étaient adjacentes à une petite pièce ayant de grandes fenêtres .
Un genre de poste de garde .
Chambres des dignitaires
Une des plus grandes curiosités lors de notre visite était des quartiers des dignitaires .
On peut lire les inscriptions originales sur les portes « GROUPE MINISTÉRIEL » , « L - T GOUVERNEUR » et « AVOCAT / JUGE ».
Dans chacun des appartements , il avait 2 très petites pièces pouvant accueillir un lit et parfois un bureau .
Les chambres sont humbles , elles ne sont pas décorées et pas luxueuses .
Tout le mobilier original a été retiré .
Il n’est pas possible de savoir pour l’instant quand et où il a été transféré .
Nous avons tenté de savoir sans succès si la chambre du premier ministre avait un lit à deux places comme le « bunker » de Carp .
En se rendant au fond , une porte nous permet d’accéder à une salle de bains commune réservée aux dignitaires .
La salle de bains inutilisée est comparable à celles des autres .
Toute cette section est fermée et est inutilisée par les Forces canadiennes .
Nous avons vu quelques articles militaires entreposés , mais ces pièces sont fermées à clé en tout temps .
Remarquez le haut - parleur à l’intérieur de la chambre du juge - avocat
Salle des machines
Il y a deux salles des machines sur chacun des étages , mais celle du sous - sol semble la plus grande .
Nous n’avons pas pu la visiter pour des raisons logistiques .
Mais , selon le responsable de l’immeuble , une grande partie servait à la ventilation .
Jusqu’aux années 2000 , le bâtiment n’échangeait pas son air avec l’extérieur .
Le système de ventilation recyclait l’air ambiant tout l’assainissant à l’aide d’énormes filtres .
Selon des témoignages de personnes ayant séjourné dans l’immeuble dans les années 90 , l ’air était sec et un peu étouffant .
Bâtiment pour la Garnison depuis les années 90
La guerre froide s’est terminée autour de 1991 .
On nous dit que l’abri a perdu sa vocation première à la même époque .
Il est dorénavant utilisé pour les besoins courants des Forces armées canadiennes .
Comme stipulé plus haut , ses grandes salles servent pour la formation de groupes et ses dortoirs servent en cas de débordement lorsque beaucoup de soldats séjournent à la base .
Quelques mises à jour techniques
De l’équipement moderne de ventilation a été installé et l’air est échangé comme tout bâtiment moderne .
Des gicleurs ont été installés dans toutes les pièces pour se conformer au code du bâtiment .
Observations et faits intéressants
Aucun ascenseur n’avait été prévu .
Toutefois , un treuil électrique a été installé au plafond de la cage d’escalier centrale .
Elle permet de hisser une cage de métal servant à monter et descendre de lourdes pièces de matériel au sous - sol .
Le treuil est original et on dit qu’il date de 1964 .
Il sert toujours .
Le responsable de l’immeuble nous a indiqué que la plupart ( ou peut - être la totalité ) des murs intérieurs sont en béton et recouverts de gypse .
D’ailleurs , nous avons remarqué que de grandes portes dans les corridors permettent de fermer et d’isoler des sections du bâtiment .
Sa position n’est plus secrète , il est situé sur la rue de la Grande Hermine sur le base de Valcartier .
Visite de l’abri en 1975
Une équipe de tournage de Radio - Canada avait visité le « bunker » en 1975 .
On a pu reconnaître plusieurs pièces qu’on a visitées .
Peu de choses ont changé .
On y voit un corridor et une chambre avec des lits superposés ( on n’a pas vu ça lors de notre visite ) .
Aussi , on voit les toilettes des hommes qui n’ont pas changé du tout .
On voit à la fin la salle à manger et la cuisine au fond de la pièce .

Stop procrastinating .
That is always good advice , and always hard to heed .
But in some situations procrastination is more damaging than others .
One of those involves getting the country ’s fiscal health in order .
The latest advice to stop procrastinating — or , perhaps more important , the latest explanation of why procrastinating will only make matters worse and the fix that much more painful — comes courtesy of the Congressional Budget Office , and its new report on the long - term budget outlook .
The CBO , like other sensible economic analysts , is not calling for an immediate retrenchment to deal with record deficits — far from it .
As the report explains , “ With economic activity and employment currently well below the levels that could be achieved by fully utilizing the nation ’s labor force and capital stock , raising revenues or curbing spending immediately would probably slow the economic recovery . ”
Translation :
It ’s too soon to hit the brakes .
“ However , ” the report adds , “ the sooner that long - term changes to spending and revenues are agreed on , and the sooner they are implemented after the period of economic weakness , the smaller will be the damage to the economy from rising federal debt . ”
Translation :
The longer we dawdle , the harder this is going to be .
That might be obvious — although , then again , perhaps not to those who make the case that faster - than - expected economic growth could make the problem evaporate , or slowing the rise of health care spending could make it much less daunting .
Perhaps , but that is a dangerous hope on which to rely .
I might win the lottery tomorrow , but it ’s not a very smart retirement plan .
The CBO report shows why .
It looks at the “ fiscal gap ” — the extent to which government would need to immediately and permanently cut spending , raise taxes or both — in order to stabilize the national debt at its level as a share of the economy at the start of this year .
Not that this is anything to be happy about : 53 percent of gross domestic product , a level not seen since shortly after World War II .
Imagine that policymakers want to keep the debt stable through 2035 .
Assume a realistic policy scenario — most of the Bush tax cuts continue , the alternative minimum tax is adjusted to keep pace with inflation , scheduled cuts in Medicare reimbursements to doctors are canceled .
If the new austerity begins in 2011 , it would require an annual increase in revenue or cut in spending equivalent to 4.8 percent of GDP .
This would amount to about $ 715 billion ( in 2010 dollars ) the first year — more than the entire defense budget .
But waiting until 2015 boosts that number to 5.7 percent of GDP , meaning finding $ 1 trillion of savings that first year .
Waiting until 2020 boosts the necessary trims to 7.9 percent of GDP , or a daunting $ 1.5 trillion the first year alone .
And this calculation does not reflect the true cost of waiting , as the overhang of debt crowds out investment and drives up interest rates .
“ Incorporating such effects would make the impact of delaying policy changes even more severe , ” the report warns .
Once this ugly recession is past , the country is in for an ugly period of belt - tightening .
How ugly will depend on how quickly policymakers manage to act .

Written by Troma Entertainment
A few months ago , I wrote up some quick observations about Facebook ’s then just - launched “ Like ” button , pitching “ Newsfeed Spam ” as a problem exacerbated by the new Like Buttons .
The post went “ viral ” , so to speak , bouncing off Techmeme , ReadWriteWeb / NYTimes , even German news websites .
Obviously this is nothing compared to “ real ” traffic on the Internet , but it was fun to watch the link spread .
This is meant to be a follow - up to that post , based on thoughts I ’ve had since .
In this post , I 'll be writing about five " issues " with the Like button , followed by four " solutions " to these issues .
Since this is a slightly long post , here 's an outline :
Big Deal !
The Facebook Like Button has been huge success .
With over 3 billion buttons served , and major players such as IMDB and CNN signing up to integrate the button ( and other social plugins ) into their websites , the chance of encountering a Facebook Like button while browsing on the web is quite high ; if not certain .
Many folks have questioned whether this is a big deal -- IFRAME and javascript based widgets have been around for a long time ( shameless self - plug : Blogsnob used a javascript - based widget to cross polinate blogs across the internet as early as 8 years ago ) .
Using the social concept of showing familiar faces to readers is n't new either ; MyBlogLog has been doing it for a while .
Then why is this silly little button such an issue ?
The answer is persistent user engagement .
With 500 million users , out of which 50 % of them log into Facebook at any given day , you 're looking at an audience of 250 million users .
If you 're logged into Facebook while browsing any website with a social plugin , the logged in session is used .
Now if you 're like me , you 'll probably have " remember me " checked at login , which means you 're always logged into Facebook .
What this means is that on any given day , Facebook has the opportunity to reach 250 million people throughout their web browsing experience ; not just when they 're on Facebook.com [ 1 ] .
So clearly , from a company 's perspective , this is important .
It is a pretty big deal !
But why is this something Facebook users need to be educated about ?
Onwards to the next section !
Issues with the Like Button
Readers should note the use of the word " Issues " , as opposed to " Security vulnerability " , " Privacy Leak " , " Design Flaw " , " Cruel Price of Technology " , or " Horrible Transgression Against Humankind " .
Each issue has its own kind of impact on the user , you 're welcome to decide which is which !
To better understand the issues with the Like button , let 's understand what the Like button provides :
1 ) It provides a count of the number of people who currently " Like " something .
2 ) It provides a list of people you know who have liked said object , with profile pictures .
3 ) It provides the ability to click the button and instantaneously " Like " something , triggering an update on your newsfeed .
All of this is done using an embedded IFRAME -- a little Facebook page within the main page that displays the button .
In the next few paragraphs , we 'll see some implications of this button on the web .
Reputation Misrepresentation
The concept of reputation misrepresentation is quite simple :
a not - so - popular website can use another website 's reputation to make the site seem more reputed or established to the user .
Here 's a quick diagram to explain it :
Simply put , as of now , any website ( e.g. a web store ) can claim they are popular ( especially with your friends ) to gain your trust .
Since Facebook does n't check referrer information , Facebook really does n't have the power to do anything about this either .
A possible solution is to include verifying information inside the like button , which ruins the simplicity of it all .
Browse Trail Inference
This one is a more paranoid concept , but I 've noticed that people do n't realize it until I spell it out for them :
Facebook is indirectly collecting your entire browsing history for all websites that have Facebook widgets .
You do n’t have to click any like buttons , just visiting sites like IMDB.com or CNN.com or BritneySpears.com will enable this .
Here 's how it works :
Here , our favorite user Jane is logged into Facebook , and visits 2 pages on IMDB.com , checks the news on CNN , and then heads to Yelp to figure out where to eat .
Interestingly enough , Facebook records all this information , and can tie it to her Facebook profile , and can thus come up with inferences like " Jane likes Romantic Movies , International News and Thai Food -- let 's show her some ads for romantic getaways to Bali ! "
( Even worse , if Jane unwittingly visits a nefarious website which coincidentally happens to have the Like button , Facebook gets to know about that too ! )
Most modern browsers send the parent document 's URL as HTTP_REFERER information to Facebook via the Like IFRAME , which allows Facebook to implicitly record a fraction of your browsing history .
Since this information is much more voluminous than your explicit " Likes " ; a lot more information can be data - mined from it ; which can then be used for " Good " ( i.e. adding value to Facebook ) or " Evil " ( i.e. Ads !
Market data ! )
What I like about this is that this is an ingenious system to track user 's browsing behavior .
Currently , companies like Google , Yahoo and Microsoft ( Bing / Live / MSN ) have to convince you to install a browser toolbar which has this minuscule clause in its agreement that you share back ALL your browsing history , which can be used to better understand the Web ( and make more money , etc. etc. ) .
Since Facebook is getting all websites to install this ; it gets the job done without getting you to install a toolbar !
I 'll be discussing how I deal with this in the last section , " My solution " .
Newsfeed Spam
In a previous post , I demonstrated how users could be tricked into " Liking " things they did n't intend to , leading to spam in their friends ' newsfeeds .
A month later , security firm Sophos reported an example of this , where users were virally tricked into spreading a trojan virus through Facebook Likes , something that could easily be initiated by Like buttons across the web , where you can easily be tricked into liking arbitrary things .
Again , this issue has the same root cause as Reputation Misrepresentation : since all the Like button shows you is a usercount , pictures and the button itself , there really is no way to know what you 're liking .
A solution to this is to use a bookmarklet in your browser , which is under your control .
" Likejacking "
This interesting demo by Eric Kerr demonstrates how to force unwitting users into clicking arbitrary like buttons .
The way this works is by making a transparent like button , and make it move along with the users mouse cursor .
Since the user is bound to click on the page at some point of time , they 're bound to click the Like button instead .
Like Switching
Like switching is an alternative take on Like Jacking -- the difference is that the user is explicitly shown a like button with a prestigious like count and familiar friends first .
When a user reaches out to click on it , the like button is swapped out for a different one , triggered by an onmouseover event from the rectangle around the button .
" Solutions "
Given these issues , let 's discuss some solutions , responses and fixes .
Note the use of quotes -- for many people can argue that nothing is broken , so we do n't need solutions !
Regardless , one piece of good news is that the W3C is aware of the extensive use of IFRAMES on the web , and has introduced a new " sandbox " attribute for IFRAMES .
This will lead to more fine - grained control of social widgets .
For example , if we can then set our browsers to force " sandbox " settings for all Facebook IFRAMES , we can avoid handing over our browsing history to Facebook .
Facebook 's approach
While I do n't expect companies to rationalize every design decision with their users , I am glad that some Facebook engineers are reaching out via online discussions .
Clearly this is not representative of the whole company , but here 's a snippet :
Also , in case it was n't clear , as soon as we identify a domain or url to be bad , it 's impossible to reach it via any click on facebook , so even if something becomes bad after people have liked it , we still retroactively protect users .
I like this approach because it fits in well with the rest of the security infrastructure that large companies have : the moment a URL is deemed insecure anywhere on the site , all future users are protected from that website .
However , this approach does n't solve problems with user trust -- it 's relying on the fact that Facebook has flagged every evil website in the world before you chanced upon it -- something I would n't bet my peace of mind on .
It 's as if the police told you " We will pursue serial killers only after the first murder !
" Would you sleep better knowing that ?
In essence , this approach is great when you 're looking at it from the side of protecting 500 million users .
But as one of the 500 million , it kinda leaves you out in the dark !
Secure Likes
As we mentioned in the Reputation Misrepresentation section , another interesting improvement would be to include some indication of the URL that is being " Liked " inside the button itself .
An option is to display the URL as a tooltip when the user hovers his / her cursor over the button , especially if it disagrees with the parent frame 's URL .
Obviously placing the whole URL would make the button large and ugly .
A possible compromise is to include the favicon ( the icon that shows up for each site in your browser ) right inside the Like button .
The user can simply check if the browser icon is the same as the one on the like button to make sure it 's safe .
This way , if a website wants to ( mis) use BritneySpears.com 's Like Button , it will be forced to use BritneySpears.com 's favicon too !
Here 's a mockup of what " Secure Like " would look like for IMDB :
A browser - based approach
This approach , best exemplified by " Social Web " browser Flock and recently acknowledged by folks at Mozilla , makes you log into the browser , not a web site .
All user - sensitive actions ( such as " Liking " a page ) have to go through the browser , making it inherently more secure .
My Current Solution
At this point , I guess it 's best to conclude with what my solution to dealing with all these issues is .
My solution is simple : I run Google and Facebook services in their own browsers , separate from my general web surfing .
As you can see from the picture of my dock , my GMail and Facebook are separate from my Chrome browser .
That way , I appear logged out [ 2 ] .
Google Search and Facebook Likes when I surf the web or search for things .
On a Mac , you can do this using Fluid.app ; on Windows you can do this using Mozilla Prism .
And that brings us to the end of this rather long and winded discussion about such a simple " Like " button !
Comments are welcome .
Until the next post -- Surf safe , and Surf Smart !
Footnotes :
[ 1 ]
To my knowledge , there is only one other company that has this level of persistent engagement : Google 's GMail remembers logins more aggressively than Facebook .
When you 're logged into Gmail , you 're also logged into Google Search , which means they log your search history as a recognized user .
This is usually a good thing for the user , since Google then has a chance to personalize your search .
Google actually takes it a step further and personalizes even for non-logged in users .

Yes , they can still get me by my IP , but that 's unlikely when I 'm usually behind firewalls .

Let us praise pigs .
And not just any old pig , but the Gloucester Old Spot pig in particular .
The breed has just been awarded protected status , specifically Traditional Speciality Guarantee designation , by the mandarins of the EU .
Pork from this splendid beast joins West Country farmhouse cheddar cheese , Melton Mowbray pork pies and Cornish sardines ( aka pilchards , for a pilchard is nothing more than a grown up sardine ) in the roll call of honour of British foods .
When all around is change and decay , of rather change at the speed of light , there is something immensely comforting about the shape and size and purpose of the pig .
The Gloucester Old Spot is the antithesis of the principles of modern industrial farming .
The British Pig Association website describes it as " a large meaty animal with a broad and deep body and large hams " .
Such poetry .
That 's why it was once the bacon pig of choice .
The GOS tends to carry a greater depth of fat than your modern industrial meat machines , and where there is fat , there is flavour to savour .
Of course , such fat is an anathema in terms of the contemporary diet .
Although the Italians , whose diet we are supposed to emulate in the interests of living for ever , like to cure the back fat and sell it in smart delis as lardo , to be sliced as thin as lace and loaded onto slices of warm toast .
In southern Italy and Sicily ( and Spain , I believe ) , they render down pork fat for use as shortening ( strutto or sugno ) in making those divine pastries that become so addictive .
Mind you , the Gloucester Old Spot has been a bit of a food fashion item all over the country for some time .
There 's hardly a gastropub worthy of the name or restaurant that does n't list some portion of GOS , as aficionados affectionately know it , on their menus , usually in the cheaper forms such as sausages and / or belly .
The patrons at St John just love their GOS , The Harwood Arms in Fulham , too , trumpets its GOS credentials , as does Sally Clark from time to time .
Only the Tamworth can really challenge the supremacy of the Gloucester Old Spot as the delight of gourmets .
The Tamworth , incidentally , the pig of the russet hair and narrow frame , was the only breed of British pig that was n't cross - bred with plumper continental breeds ( especially the Black Pig of Naples ) and Chinese pigs in the 18th and 19th centuries .
That 's why it looks closer to the wild boar than other porky personalities .
But the GOS should n't just be treasured for its admirable eating qualities .
A GOS sow is the most devoted or mothers .
It 's a hardy , cheery , even - tempered , thrifty animal , and therefore suited to outdoor rearing .
It was once known as the ' orchard pig ' , although I prefer the description ' the pig with the built in apple sauce ' , because it grazed on the windfall apples in the orchards that once grew in abundance along the banks of the River Severn in Gloucestershire .
Indeed , another legend has it that the distinctive round black marks are bruises caused by apples falling from the trees under which the pigs used to rootle .
The only drawback to the contemporary love affair with the Gloucester Old Spot is that it distracts our attention from other fabulous native breeds of pig such as the Large Black , Middle White , Berkshire and Welsh pigs , which are all listed as vulnerable or at risk on the Rare Breeds Survival Trust website .
My own favourite and producer of the finest piece of pork that I 've ever eaten , the British Lop ( aka the cottage pig because it was the amiable porker that every smallholder once kept at the bottom of the garden to hoover up the household scraps ) , is actually classified as endangered , which means there are less than 200 of them left .
It 's high time to get the British Lop cared for by the warm bosom of protected name status .
What foods or breeds would you get listed ?
Economics and similar , for the sleep - deprived A subtle change has been made to the comments links , so they no longer pop up .
Does this in any way help with the problem about comments not appearing on permalinked posts , readers ?
Update : seemingly not

As expected , the word " choice " features heavily in the government 's response
... is the throat - clearing equivalent of " you could n't make it up ! " from this prize piece of woo- bashing in the Guardian , via Henry .
I do n't think it 's particularly bacai ( although I suspect that I might think otherwise if I had been the civil servant who wrote the rather clever and well - thought - out response it 's having a go at ) , but it 's pretty typical of what I consider to be the wrong approach to dealing with homeopathy .
That approach being , of course , roughly that of Monty Python 's Bruces sketch - " you 're allowed to teach Marx , as long as you make it clear that he was wrong " .
Actually the select committee report was a bit more aggressive than that - they appear at several points to be saying that it is unethical to prescribe placebos for patients per se , and the practice should possibly be banned and certainly not allowed under the NHS [ 1 ] .
The phrase I 've excerpted for my title is the one that set my bells off - it exactly summarises what I do n't like about this approach , in dismissing the fundamental right of a patient to decide on his treatment as being some weirdo hippy shit that should be ignored by Real Men Of Science ( he has a few paragraphs ridiculing the idea , which are roughly as hilarious as every other stand up comedy act on the theme of " I do n't want all this choice ... " ) .
Brass tacks .
People want woo [ 2 ] .
Actually , they want thoughtful , respectful and sympathetic treatment from general practitioners , but that 's a ) expensive and b ) difficult to achieve given the social realities of the medical profession [ 4 ] .
So woo is where we are now .
It would be difficult and expensive to persuade the population of the UK to not believe in homeopathy , and the main consequence would be an additional burden on GPs .
Since there is no special off - budget source of funds for skepticism and its consequences , this would also take money away from our household god , which we do n't want to do .
So we 're left with :
1 ) on the one hand , some people who want thing X , which does n't do them much harm compared to the comfort and enjoyment they get out of it ,
2 ) and on the other hand , some other people who do n't indulge in X themselves and are not affected materially by it , but who have a belief system and world view which makes them think that nobody should consume thing X .
We 've pretty much decided on a schema for this sort of problem as a society , and the Enlightenment Values crowd can hardly object to the solution we decided on as it pretty much kept them from being burned at the stake [ 6 ] for two hundred years .
That 's what the government response is doing ; threading the needle between endorsing woo and banning it ( or putting unreasonable restrictions on people 's realistic ability to get placebo treatments they want [ 7 ] ) , and as far as I can see the DoH response is doing so pretty sensibly .
Tidying up with some answers to questions in the Guardian piece :
You get a sense of this confusion very early on , with lines like : " given the geographical , socioeconomic and cultural diversity in England , [ policy on homeopathy ] involves a whole range of considerations including , but not limited to , efficacy . "
I actually have no idea what this means – do medicines work differently in Norfolk from the way they work in Hampshire ?
The report does n't elaborate
Well , as discussed in a few comments threads here , the demand for homeopathy , and the kind of cases in which it is a good idea to practice placebo medicine , is built up in a particular set of common conditions ( canonically , back pain and allergy medicine ) .
And I would very much imagine that these conditions had geographical , socioeconomic and cultural variance .
One of the phrases Orwell that stuck with me from The Road to Wigan Pier , seems apropos here :
" The underlying motive of many Socialists , I believe , is simply a hypertrophied sense of order .
The present state of affairs offends them not because it causes misery , still less because it makes freedom impossible , but because it is untidy ; what they desire , basically , is to reduce the world to something resembling a chess - board "
There is certainly an equivalent motivation for people entering the medical profession and its adjuncts .
[ 1 ]
This would be such a crazy thing to do , and so far out of line with normal medical practice that I suspect that either the government response has taken the select committee out of context , or that I 've just got the wrong end of the stick .
[ 2 ] A fact !
Of actual science !
Provable by sociological and economic [ 3 ] research !
[ 3 ] Sociology and economics !
Both actual sciences !
In which it is often possible to support hypotheses with evidence to a much greater degree than many areas of medicine !
[ 4 ]
Also a fact ! [ 5 ]
[ 5 ]
Actually an unsupported hypothesis , but the sort of statement that could certainly be supported by evidence and achieve the same degree of certainty as the fact referenced above in footnote 2 .
[ 6 ]
Historians who are aware of the very limited extent to which atheists were ever persecuted ( heretics , not unbelievers , were largely the ones getting burned ) , please forgive me for that one .
[ 7 ]
I could even say " need " here , because plenty consumers of placebo remedies do need them in any sense similar to which most people you 'll meet in a GP waiting room [ 8 ] need whatever medicine they get prescribed .
But actually " want " is all that 's necessary for my argument .
Giving the people what they want is n't a ' weird fetish ' - it 's the whole point of the exercise .
[ 8 ]
Or at least , a GP waiting room in my neck of the woods ; see point about social variation above .

The plant will run on biofuels such as used cooking oil
The Duke of Edinburgh has opened what is thought to be the first water desalination plant on the UK mainland .
The facility in Beckton , east London , is part of Thames Water 's plan to tackle water shortages in the capital .
It said the £ 270 m centre would deliver up to 140 million litres of water to 400,000 homes in a drought .
The plant will be run by using renewable biofuels such as cooking oil and waste fat in an effort to reduce its impact on the environment .
Drinking water will be produced by treating a mixture of sea and river water from the River Thames .
Thames
Water said it built the facility to avoid a repeat of water shortages which hit the South East in 2005 and 2006 .
' Energy Guzzling '
However the plant 's opponents , which include former London Mayor Ken Livingstone , have accused the company of wasting money .
Mr Livingstone filed a legal challenge in 2005 to reverse planning permission for the plant , claiming it would increase carbon emissions and fail to address the real problem of leakages across London 's Victorian waterpipe network .
His successor Boris Johnson withdrew the challenge when he was elected mayor in 2008 and agreed a series of measures with the company to reduce its impact on the environment .
Mr Livingstone said he now acknowledged efforts to save energy had been made but said he was opposed to any carbon - intensive solution to London 's water problems .
He added that supplying extra water rather than introducing water meters in every home to change attitudes to water consumption would " feed a wasteful habit " .
London Assembly Green Party member Darren Johnson also criticised the plant , branding it " energy guzzling " .
He said : " The desalination plant is a sticking plaster solution to London 's water shortage problem , which will take the pressure off Thames Water to reduce the capital 's appalling leakage rates . "
Martin Baggs , Thames
Water 's chief executive , said : " Our existing resources - from non-tidal rivers and groundwater - simply are n't enough to match predicted demand in London .
" That 's why we 're tapping into the new and limitless resource of the tidal Thames , fed by the rolling oceans beyond , so we can ensure our 8.5 million customers have enough water in future in the event of a drought . "
Pilots attend a medical examination , flight briefing , obtain an outbound clearance and do many other things at the airport .
See what they usually do in detail .
Pilots enter a service building through a separate entrance in the airport terminal .
The airport is divided into two areas – “ normally occupied ” and “ nonoccupied ” ones .
“ Normally occupied ” area is an area inside the airport , in order to get there it ’s necessary to pass checking .
All other part of the building is called “ Nonoccupied ” area .
Right after the checking all the crew should attend a medical examination .
Here pilots receive a flight assignment where all other information about the flight is noted .
Medical examination must be attended not sooner than 2 hours before departure and not later than 1 hour .
A doctor measures pressure and takes a pulse rate .
He assesses a pilot ’s condition and in case he has any suspicion additional tests may be taken .
In the next room chief stewards receive first - aid sets .
After the flight they bring them back .
The contents of the set is being constantly renewed and a special doctor checks expire dates of medicines .
After medical examination the pilots go to the briefing room on a lower floor .
At the end of the room , in a window , a co-pilot receives documentation for a plane in a large suitcase .
It is always carried by a co-pilot – some kind of hazing .
The pilots are studying routing documents , approach patterns , checking airway weather report , choosing the best route , estimating the needed amount of fuel etc .
Here the pilots receive information about the weather on all parts of the route , wind direction and speed , possible turbulence .
An aircraft commander may see extra information concerning the flight at a separate table in the briefing room .
If he has any doubts regarding the weather he may consult a meteorologist on duty .
At a centering dispatcher window a co-pilot fills in a form with information about the flight .
Based on this information a center of the plane ’s mass is defined .
Chief steward guidance .
Philosophy of AIRBUS company is that the crew should be renewed .
That is why an aircraft commander and co-pilots are different each time .
The same situation is with cabin crew .
They become acquainted before the flight in the lounge .
Chief steward conducts instruction of the crew .
Upon the preparation the pilot comes to the dispatcher and informs if he decided to carry out the flight .
The pilots go to the plane by a special minibus .
By the way , each trip of this kind costs 1000 rubles for the airline .
On the apron ’s territory everyone should wear green vests and the pilots are not an exception .
Initial check of the system operation .
Walk - around inspection of the plane .
Sensors should n’t be icy in no circumstances .
Vanes of the engine should n’t be icy as well .
If they are , a technician is sent for to warm them .
A filler hatch must be tightly closed .
Static electricity dischargers are to be inspected too .
And the engine ’s exit too .
The tail group should be set to zero .
Brake lining and wheel stop condition is to be checked too .
The airplane system inspection .
The pilots use a “ pony ” .
If everything is OK , no light should be on .
They check safety devices .
Orange curtains if the sun is too bright .
The jury has given its verdict : the rupee will retain its Indian character with an international flavour .
The five - member panel has chosen IIT post - graduate D Udaya Kumar 's design from among five shortlisted symbols and recommended it for Cabinet approval .
Kumar 's symbol ( on the left ) is an amalgam of the Devanagari ' Ra ' and the Roman capital ' R ' without the stem , very much in line with what Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee had envisioned .
" We intend to formalise a symbol for the Indian rupee which reflects and captures Indian ethos and culture , " Mukherjee said in his Budget speech this year .
The chosen symbol has the Finance Minister 's approval , said a Ministry official .
The Ministry had organised a symbol design competition with a prize money of Rs 2.5 lakh with the condition that it should be applicable to the standard keyboard , be in the national language script or a visual representation and should represent the historical and cultural ethos of the country .
While the basic aim of the new symbol is to provide the Indian rupee international recognition as the country 's economy exerts more influence in the global space , the unique sign will also help isolate the currency from the current abbreviation ' Rs ' which is used by neighbouring Pakistan , Nepal and Sri Lanka .
Kumar 's concept , an official said , is based on the Tricolour and " arithmetic equivalence " .
While the white space between the two horizontal lines gives the impression of the national flag with the Ashok Chakra , the two bold parallel lines stand for ' equals to ' , representing balance in the economy , both within and with other economies of the world .
When contacted , Kumar said he was unaware of his design having been ranked first by the jury .
" I hope your news is real , " he told The Indian Express from IIT Bombay .
He joins IIT Guwahati as a faculty member in the Department of Design tomorrow .

Three Spanish activists who were aboard a humanitarian aid convoy raided en route to the Gaza Strip will file a law suit against Israel on Friday for alleged crimes against humanity .
The 83 - page document takes aim at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , his forum of top six cabinet ministers and the Israel Navy , whose commandos stormed the Turkish - flagged Mavi Marmara on May 31 and killed nine activists .
The three Spanish activists told the Republica newspaper that Israel had arrested them illegally and deported them by force , after subjecting them to hardships during the raid .

At least nine lawsuits will likely be filed against Israel from within nine European countries over the raid , which yielded significant international outcry and forced Israel to rethink its blockade on the Gaza Strip .
Former president of the International Criminal Court , Canadian Philippe Kirsch , will head the committee investigating the events of the raid on behalf of the United Nations Human Rights Council .
The Israel Defense Forces earlier this month released the findings of its own probe , which concluded that it was carried out with poor intelligence and coordination , but ultimately defended the Israel Navy 's decision for a commando operation to intercept the ships .
Turkey has demanded that Israel apologize for the raid and compensate the families of the nine victims - a request that Jerusalem has denied .
Currently Australia seems consumed by concerns about population size , boat people and the role of immigration , and while both sides of politics have expressed enthusiasm for the general idea of a population policy for Australia so far absolutely nothing has happened .
As one commentator recently remarked , so far discussion has been full of populist platitudes , and there is no ' policy ' just loose statements about ' a big Australia ' , ' sustainability ' and illegal immigrants .
There seems little doubt that the current debate about such things has become trapped in fruitless disputes about whether a population of 36 million will be good or bad , and whether or not we should send illegal migrants home .
Despite endless references to a Population Policy we seem no closer to defining what we need and how we will actually get it .
In fact most comments seem to show a total ignorance of what such a policy should include .
But first some basics .
It is true that Australia 's population is increasing at a rate which is faster than nearly every other developed nation .
It is also true that migration is playing a major role in this increase .
It is equally true that fertility has been low for the past few decades and that the Australian population is ageing rapidly .
Population policies are deliberately constructed so that governments can influence , directly and indirectly , demographic , social and economic change .
They are not just about broad wishy - washy statements about having a smaller population , sustainability issues or stopping the boat people .
They are about the nitty gritty of population dynamics - fertility , mortality and migration , and how such things determine population growth and sculpt the Australian society of today and tomorrow .
They are also about the compositional factors of a population , things like , age structure , family structure , health status , ethnicity , race , employment and housing to name just a few .
But what role does the modern state have in such things ?
Well the answer is clear with respect to immigration .
The regulation of the movement of people into Australia is clearly defined as a public good .
The latest figures suggest about two - thirds of all arrivals in Australia are people on temporary visas of which students make up the majority .
Permanent migrants by contrast were less than half of this number .
Such migration is the driving force of population growth in Australia and there is little doubt that it has increased markedly in recent years .
Perhaps it is time to have a Population Policy which looks at such things and decides what is best for Australia and not simply for the income of a handful of tertiary institutions .
Such a policy should not simply be framed in economic terms but must also take into account the social and cultural dimensions of migration as well as Australia 's international obligations .
The role of the state in fertility is perhaps more contentious .
Establishing a family is often the result of a number of individual and personal decisions concerning childbearing .
These decisions reflect such things as personal circumstances , stage in the life cycle , and the costs and benefits of having children .
In many ways governments influence the social and economic environment in which such decisions are made .
There is much that the state can do to provide a conducive environment for childbearing .
Things like birth and child allowances , maternity leave , assistance with the cost of schooling , reduced medical and dental costs for children still at school .
Health and health care are also critical issues to be considered .
Hopefully a population policy would spell out the fact that all Australians have a right to health care without let or hindrance as a basic human right .
And what about mortality ?
Surely the state has a responsibility for delaying the onset of death in its citizens and for ensuring the quality of death ?
There seems little doubt that with a rapidly ageing population and increasing longevity , demand for end - of - life care and assistance will rise sharply .
All this goes to the very heart of palliative care , drug availability , institutional care , and yes , euthanasia and physician - assisted death .
If it is part of the state 's responsibility to provide good health to all its citizens , then it is also a responsibility to stave off death and to manage the end of life in a civilised , supportive and empathetic manner .
And without doubt any such policy should include discussion of the fact that within 20 or so years , one in every four Australians will be aged over 65 .
The implications of a rapidly ageing population are profound particularly in the context of declining workforce numbers and the implications for pension and health care costs .
All these things , as well as issues relating to family structure , ethnicity and race , housing , and employment , need to be part of an integrated Population Policy that reaches beyond mere statements about closing the door on immigration or controlling population growth to save us from urban congestion .
Such a Policy needs to be all inclusive and provide a blueprint for the sort of Australia we want in the next 20 - 50 years .
Population goes to the very heart of Australia and people are the real wealth of our country .
It is not only the number of people which matters , but also their skills , abilities , compositional factors and health status .
They are the critical human capital which Australia has a responsibility to preserve , protect and bolster .
Hopefully our politicians will come to realise such things and finally produce the Population Policy that we deserve to have .

« In Vermont , the people have spoken | Main | African AIDS , the Pope , and liberalism » A Real Islam Policy for a Real America
Here is the speech , edited and polished , that I gave at the the speech , edited and polished , that I gave at the Preserving Western Civilization conference in February .
A REAL ISLAM POLICY FOR A REAL AMERICA by Lawrence Auster
Preserving Western Civilization Conference
Baltimore , Maryland
February 8 , 2009
To deal with the crisis facing our civilization , we must be both realistic and imaginative .
The realism part consists in recognizing how bad our situation is .
The entire Western world is at present under the grip of the modern liberal ideology that targets every normal and familiar aspect of human life , and our entire historical way of being as a society .
The key to this liberal ideology is the belief in tolerance or non-discrimination as the ruling principle of society , the principle to which all other principles must yield .
We see this belief at work in every area of modern life .
The principle of non-discrimination must , if followed consistently , destroy every human society and institution .
A society that cannot discriminate between itself and other societies will go out of existence , just as an elm tree that cannot discriminate between itself and a linden tree must go out of existence .
To be , we must be able to say that we are us , which means that we are different from others .
If we are not allowed to distinguish between ourselves and Muslims , if we must open ourselves to everyone and everything in the world that is different from us , and if the more different and threatening the Other is , the more we must open ourselves to it , then we go out of existence .
This liberal principle of destruction is utterly simple and radically extreme .
Yet very , very few people , even self - described hard - line conservatives , are aware of this principle and the hold it has over our society .
Instead of opposing non-discrimination , they oppose multiculturalism and political correctness .
But let ’s say that we got rid of multiculturalism and political correctness .
Would that end Muslim immigration ?
No. Multiculturalism is not the source of Muslim immigration .
The source of it is our belief that we must not discriminate against other people on the basis of their culture , their ethnicity , their nationality , their religion .
This is the idea of the 1965 Immigration Act , which was the idea of the 1964 Civil Rights
Act applied to all of humanity : all discrimination is wrong , period .
No one in today ’s society , including conservatives , feels comfortable identifying this utterly simple idea , because that would mean opposing it .
To see how powerful the belief in non-discrimination is , consider this : Prior to World War II , would any Western country have considered admitting significant numbers of Muslim immigrants ?
Of course not ; it would have been out of the question .
The West had a concrete identity .
It saw itself as white and in large part as Christian , and there was still active in the Western mind the knowledge that Islam was our historic adversary , as it has been for a thousand years , and radically alien .
But today , the very notion of stopping Muslim immigration is out of the question , it ca n’t even be thought .
What would have been inconceivable 70 or 80 years ago is unquestionable today .
A society that 70 years ago would n’t have dreamed of admitting large numbers of Muslims , today does n’t dream of reducing , let alone stopping , the immigration of Muslims .
Even the most impassioned anti-Islamic Cassandras never question — indeed they never even mention — the immigration of Muslims , or say it should be reduced or stopped .
You do n’t need to know any more than what I ’ve just said .
The rule of non-discrimination , in all its destructive potentialities , is shown in this amazing fact , that the writers and activists who constantly cry that Islam is a mortal danger to our society will not say that we ought to stop or even reduce Muslim immigration .
Such is the liberal belief which says that the most morally wrong thing is for people to have a critical view of a foreign group , to want to exclude that group or keep it out .
The dilemma suggests the solution .
What is now unthinkable , must become thinkable ; what is now unsayable , must become sayable ; and ultimately it must replace non-discrimination as the ruling belief in society .
I know that this sounds crazy , utterly impossible .
But fifty or a hundred years ago it would have seemed crazy , utterly impossible , that today ’s liberalism with its suicidal ideology would have replaced the traditional attitudes that were then prevalent .
If society could change that radically in one direction , toward suicidal liberalism , it can change back again .
It ’s not impossible .
To understand how this unnatural and anti-human liberal belief came into existence and gained such power over us , we need to understand the natural and human order that the liberal belief is attacking .
I would like to quote the Book of Ecclesiasticus :
In much knowledge the Lord hath divided [ men ] , and made their ways diverse .
Some of them hath he blessed and exalted , and some of them hath he sanctified , and set near himself : but some of them hath he cursed and brought low , and turned out of their places .
( Ecclesiasticus , 33 ) Every beast loveth his like and every man loveth his neighbor .
All flesh consorteth according to kind , and a man will cleave to his like .
( Ecclesiasticus , 13.15 . )
This passage beautifully expresses the true order of the world in which we live , the world in which men have always lived , but which modern liberalism denies and demonizes .
That world can be explained in terms of two dimensions , which I call the vertical axis and the horizontal axis .
The vertical axis is the relationship between ourselves and that which is above us and below us , that which is better and worse , that which is more true and less true , the relation between God and man .
The horizontal axis is the relationship between entities on the same level , between different people in the same society , or between different societies or different cultures .
On the horizontal axis , the question is : how similar are things to each other ?
How different are they from each other ?
How well do they get along ?
On the vertical axis , the question is , what are the standards by which we live ?
What is good behavior , what is bad behavior ?
To what extent are we following the good , to what extent are we falling short of it or turning away from it ?
I would add that one does n’t need to be a Christian or a religious believer to know that this hierarchical order of the world exists .
There are many aspects of the order of being that can be grasped through natural reason alone .
What I ’m saying here is nothing fancy or metaphysical , it ’s something that all people know by common sense .
We live within these two dimensions — the better and the worse , the more like and the less like — in everything we do .
That is , we did live within them , until modern liberalism came along and said that it ’s wrong to discriminate between higher and lower , it ’s wrong to discriminate between better and worse , it ’s wrong to discriminate between like and unlike .
Modern liberalism says that there cannot be a truth or a standard higher than ourselves by which our actions are judged , because that would make some people better in relation to that standard than other people .
In the same way , modern liberalism says that it is evil to believe that some people are more unlike us than others , because that would also be a violation of the liberal principle that all people are equally like us .
The equality principle of modern liberalism says that unassimilable immigrants must be permitted to flood our society , changing its very nature .
It prohibits normal authority such as the authority of parents and teachers over children .
It banished the very idea of a morality that men ought to follow .
And even God is banished if he ’s a God who has any claims on us .
This is the ubiquitous yet unacknowledged horror of modern liberalism , that it takes the ordinary , differentiated nature of the world , which all human beings have always recognized , and makes it impossible for people to discuss it , because under liberalism anyone who notes these distinctions and says that they matter has done an evil thing and must be banished from society , or at least be barred from a mainstream career .
This liberalism is the most radical and destructive ideology that has ever been , and yet it is not questioned .
Communism and big government liberalism were challenged and fought in the past .
But the ideology of non-discrimination , which came about after World War II , has never been resisted — it has never even been identified , even though it is everywhere .
What is needed , if the West is to survive , is a pro-Western civilization movement that criticizes , resists , and reverses this totalistic liberal belief system that controls our world .
I said at the beginning that we had to be realistic about the Islam problem .
That meant understanding the forces that at present make it impossible for us as a society to discuss Islam honestly , let alone to do anything about it .
Realistically , from where we are now , a solution to the Islam problem is so far away it ’s as though it were on another planet , another world , where liberalism has lost its stranglehold , allowing non-liberal things to be said and done .
Now it ’s not only by conservative resistance that liberalism might be stopped .
Liberalism may collapse of its own contradictions and irrationality .
Liberals may slowly move to more realistic understandings .
A recent example was a column by Ralph Peters in which he said that the entire nation of Afghanistan , all Afghans , are radically incompatible with ourselves .
Given that Peters in his basic outlook is a vehement liberal , constantly waging war against bigotry and condemning the whole continent of Europe as incipient Nazis , that was a amazing thing for him to say .
If that kind of understanding of the real differences between Muslims and ourselves expands , then even without liberals explicitly renouncing liberalism , they may perhaps move far enough away from liberalism to allow America to begin to adopt sensible policies with regard to Islam .
And other things may happen , acts of God , disasters , economic depressions , or unprecedented terrorist attacks , that may shock society out of its liberal attitudes .
But we do n’t know that any of those things will happen , and we cannot count on their happening or on their having the effects we may hope for .
Our task as Western patriots is to argue against modern liberalism , showing its falsity and destructiveness , showing that modern liberalism is wrong not just in its excesses , but in its fundamentals , because it is incompatible with our continued existence as a society .
And in that process , all of the attitudes which modern liberalism enforces — the suppression of discussion about Islam , the suppression of discussion about immigration , the suppression of discussion about race differences and their significance — will be weakened , because each of those prohibitions is based on the idea that discrimination is the greatest sin .
Now that we have acknowledged the currently existing reality , and the tremendous change of thought that would be required to change it , let us take the imaginative and hopeful leap to a different reality , a reality in which society might actually do something about Islam rather than surrender to slow extinction at its hands .
What would be a real Islam policy for a real America ?
If there were a non-liberal president of the United States , and if he had enough support in the media and the Congress to get his program through , what would he do , and how would he propose it ?
So now , as I begin to speak as that imaginary president might speak , let us imagine that we have leaped from our present planet of liberalism , where a solution is impossible , to the planet of reality .
It may seem infinitely remote , but it is no farther away than a change in thought .
* * * My fellow Americans : I come before you this evening to discuss an unprecedented challenge in the history of our Republic , which will require unprecedented measures to meet it .
We must think anew and act anew .
But , in reality , what we must do is not new at all .
It is the way things used to be , before we went so badly astray .
In my speech last week I spoke to you about the nature and doctrines of the Islamic religion ; of the permanent state of war that it establishes between itself and all non-Muslim societies ; of its ultimate aim of subjugating all of humanity to the law of Islam , known as the sharia ; and of the fact that all believing Muslims , whether they are fanatics or moderates , whether they are jihad warriors or people who only believe in spreading sharia peacefully , are all part of one Islamic community , all strengthening in their respective ways the Islamic political agenda of bringing all non-Muslims under the rule of Islam .
I spoke of how , since the spread and imposition of sharia is a central function and goal of Islam , any increase in the number and influence of Muslims in a non-Muslim society helps advance sharia .
It is important to understand that what makes Islam dangerous to non-Muslims is not that Muslims are morally bad people .
The problem is not that Muslims are bad people , the problem is that they are good Muslims .
Our concern is with the religion and the political ideology of Islam , which makes all Muslims dangerous to us , since all Muslims , even if they personally have no aggressive intentions , even if they are personally fine and lovely people , are part of the Islamic community and owe their highest loyalty to Islam .
Therefore any increase in the number of Muslims among us means an increase in the power of Islam and the further spread of the Islamic law .
My purpose is not to promote hostility against Muslim persons or to spark civilizational warfare between the West and Islam , but to reduce and end the current increasing civilizational warfare , by separating Islam from the West .
We respect the right of Muslims to follow in peace their religion in their lands .
But in order for us Americans to follow in peace our religions and flourish in our way of life , the followers of sharia need to leave our country and return to the historic lands of Islam .
I therefore will propose to the Congress tomorrow the following measures , which shall be called the American Freedom from Islam Act .
With the exception of immediate family members of U.S. citizens , diplomatic personnel , and temporary visitors for business and other legitimate purposes , all entry into the United States of foreign persons known or determined to be followers of the religion of Islam , whatever their nationality or country of residence , shall cease .
Any Muslim person with a temporary visa for business or diplomacy who advocates or promotes jihad shall lose his visa .
Any resident alien who openly espouses jihad or who participates in any pro-jihad activities or organizations will lose his residency status and be deported .
No resident alien who adheres to , or who on investigation is reasonably suspected of adhering to , the doctrine of jihad , will be naturalized as a U.S. citizen .
In order to be naturalized , Muslims will be required to state under oath that they totally reject the doctrine of jihad and have no association with pro-jihad activities and pro-jihad persons .
Naturalized citizens , whether they were naturalized before or after the passage of this law , who associate with jihad supporters or participate in pro-jihad activities , have shown that their oath of loyalty to the United States was fraudulent .
Their citizenship shall be revoked and they shall be deported .
All mosques , Islamic centers and schools that promote jihad or sharia in any form will be closed .
The United States shall encourage the voluntary departure of Muslim naturalized citizens and their native - born descendants by offering all Muslim persons over the age of eighteen $ 50,000 each in a one - time fee to give up any claim of U.S. residency or citizenship , to return to their native land , and never to seek to return .
The federal government will assure that departing Muslims will receive a fair market price for their real property , investments , and other property that they must sell prior to leaving the United States .
My fellow citizens , that is the first part of the bill that I will propose to the Congress .
The measures I ’ve enumerated so far would retard the growth of Islam .
But they would still leave in place the existing U.S. Muslim population with their belief in sharia .
Over time , our will to contain and police them might weaken , while their will to expand their religion and their political power will continue .
Also , these measures imply that America would have to become a kind of police state , forever overseeing its Muslim citizens , examining their statements and activities , turning America into something we , and certainly I , do not want it to become .
For these reasons further steps are needed , aimed not just at stopping and reversing the growth of jihad support in America , but at stopping and reversing the growth of sharia in America .
And to reverse the growth of sharia in America means to reverse the growth of Islam in America , through the forcible or voluntary departure of sharia - believing Muslims .
Therefore I shall propose these additional measures :
Any legal resident alien who advocates or adheres to , or who on investigation is reasonably suspected of adhering to , the sharia law shall be deprived of his resident status and removed from the United States ;
No resident alien who advocates or adheres to , or who on investigation is reasonably suspected of adhering to , the sharia law , will be naturalized as a U.S. citizen .
In order to be naturalized , Muslims will be required to state under oath that they totally reject the Islamic doctrine of sharia and have no association with pro-sharia activities .
Any naturalized citizen who violates this oath shall lose his citizenship and be removed from the United States .
Any mosque or Islamic center in the United States that promotes or seeks to spread the sharia law shall be closed .
This second part of the bill , which deals with sharia , is more far reaching than the first part , which deals with jihad .
Removing jihad believers from the United States means removing only the extreme wing of the Muslim community .
But since belief in the sharia law , and the obligation to institute and live under the sharia law wherever one lives , and to impose the sharia law on non-Muslims , is the very essence of Islam , removing sharia believers from the United States means removing a large part of the Muslim community from the United States .
But now we need to consider a further problem .
The measures enumerated so far will inevitably be attacked as in violation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution , which states that Congress shall make no law prohibiting the free exercise of religion .
Therefore , in order for the measures that I ’ve proposed to stand and not be overturned , we must have a further law stating that the First Amendment does not apply to Islam , does not protect the free exercise of the religion of Islam , because Islam is not only a religion , it is a political movement aimed at establishing tyrannical power over non-Muslims , and specifically aimed at overturning our Constitution , laws , and liberties .
However , even such a radical law would not get us out of the woods , because it also could be overturned as in violation of the First Amendment .
Therefore , in order for the measures I have proposed to be truly secure and not threatened by constitutional challenge , we must go to the highest level of our political system .
We must pass a Constitutional amendment that prohibits the practice of Islam in the United States .
Through such an amendment we will be saying that Islam is incompatible with our existence as a society .
We will be making a fundamental statement about the kind of society America is .
And that , my fellow Americans , is precisely what the Constitution is supposed to be about .
After the Civil War , slavery was prohibited , not by statute or presidential proclamation , but by an amendment to the Constitution declaring that slavery has no place in the United States .
The same needs to be done with regard to the slavery that is Islam .
Such an amendment will be immune to any constitutional challenges , because it will be part of the Constitution itself .
It will encourage many Muslims , at least those who care about their religion , and those are the ones we are most concerned about , to leave the United States on their own , without our having to do anything to make them leave , such as constructing a vast bureaucracy to investigate them and deport them .
Simply as a result of our saying to them , “ We have nothing against you as human beings , but your religion is a mortal danger to our entire way of life , and we cannot permit it to remain here , ” the Muslims among us will begin to depart in a steady stream to the Islamic world , or perhaps to other Western countries where Islam is still welcome .
It is my hope , however , that all Western countries will adopt laws similar to what I am urging here , resulting in the voluntary return of the great majority of believing Muslims in the West to the Muslim lands .
Here then is the constitutional amendment that I shall propose to the Congress : Section 1 .
The religion of Islam , as propagated in the Koran and in the Islamic Traditions or Hadiths , and formalized in the Sharia Law , shall not be practiced , disseminated , or advocated within the United States , or any place subject to their jurisdiction .
Section 2 .
This article supersedes any contrary provision of this Constitution and of the laws of the United States .
Now that I have spoken to the American people about the steps we must take to preserve our freedoms and our very nationhood , I would like to speak to the Muslims of the world who are listening to me tonight .
I repeat that I have no ill will against you as people .
I act with no animosity .
I act in recognition of reality .
And the reality is — and you know it , and now you know that we know it — that your religion commands you to make all peoples and societies submit to the Islamic law , wherever and whenever you have the power and opportunity to do so .
And one of the opportunities that have been presented to you is immigration .
A half century ago , when we of the West began to admit large numbers of Muslim immigrants , we were , though we did not realize it , replicating what the city of Medina did in the year 622 when it invited Muhammad and his followers to emigrate there from Mecca .
The most famous event in the history of Islam , the event with which the Islamic calendar begins , was an act of immigration .
Muhammad and his followers moved to Medina , and within two years he had become the dictator of Medina , and Islamic law ruled in that city .
That is a paradigm of Islamic expansion .
When we invited you Muslims into the West , we were , without knowing it , imitating what the Medinans did 1,400 years ago .
You saw the significance of what we were doing , and you could n’t believe the opportunity that we had handed to you .
You had never imagined that we would do this .
But we did it , we gave you the opportunity .
And now we have to close off that opportunity by reversing the policies that brought you here .
I repeat , these proposals do not threaten you .
We respect the religion of Islam when practiced by Muslims in their own countries .
We have no designs on Islam .
You have nothing to fear from us .
We do not threaten you and your way of life .
But you , as a religion and as a political movement commanded by your god to subjugate the entire world , most certainly threaten us .
But you can only threaten us if you are in our lands .
When you are in your own lands you pose no direct danger to us .
So , Muslims of the world , let us go on sharing in peace this beautiful earth that God created .
But in order for there to be peace between us , there must also be fences between us .
Good night .
God bless America , God bless Western civilization , and God bless the peoples of the world .

Your PWC speech contains the singularly powerful sentence : “ What would have been inconceivable 70 or 80 years ago is unquestionable today . ”
The same is true of gay marriage , but on a vastly more compressed scale .
Ten years ago , it was virtually unheard of .
Until as recently as about six months ago , it was generally considered sensitive and controversial subject matter .
Today , however , anybody who opposes it — or even expresses any discomfort with it — is outside the bounds of humanity , according to Prevailing Opinion .
Go no further than the lead sentence in the editorial in Today ’s Washington Post : “ Common decency and the protections guaranteed to all citizens by the rule of law demand that the relationships of gay men and lesbians be respected and recognized . ”
Any opposition is outside the bounds of common decency .
Note also the pugnacious word demand , which rules out any subjectivism and any willingness to differ on a your opinion , my opinion basis .
And how about the “ rule of law , ” as if human beings with differing opinions have never had any say in the creation or formulation of its specific content ( the rule of what kind of law ? ) .
Kidist Paulos Asrat writes : Kidist Paulos Asrat writes : I think I had a moment of epiphany on reading your truly great speech ( to second Laura W. ) , which allowed me to see how ordinary people and most commentators understand the encroachment of Islam into the West .
This clear and well - put phrase helped , or maybe it was the overall clarity of your article : [ F ] urther steps are needed … not just at stopping and reversing the growth of jihad support in America , but at stopping and reversing the growth of sharia in America .
I know that jihad has been interpreted as the struggle of the soul as well as armed conflict .
But when we talk about jihad in the West ( or against the West ) , the latter is often assumed .
I think this is why so many people are having a hard time associating Islam with conquest , since they see its violent manifestation sporadically ( only three major ones in the West so far after 9/11 — the London bombings , the Madrid train bombing , and the cell that was intercepted in Toronto in 2006 ) .
Yet , what people do n’t realize is that there is a constant and unopposed conquest going on with SHARIA in the West .
It is not violent ; in fact , it appears extremely peaceful .
It parasitically latches onto existing institutions and systems , making it seem part of society for the untrained eye .
So , the problem in America ( and Canada ) and even in Europe is not Stealth Jihad — as Robert Spencer has titled his latest book ( I actually think he has used the wrong terminology , and what he is describing in his book is mostly the advancement of sharia ) — but Creeping Sharia , as this astute anonymous blogger , who I think has coined the phrase , regularly updates us .
Telling people right now to focus only on jihad , stealth or otherwise , ( or even to use the word jihad exclusively ) is to distract them from the big picture .
1 . Islam will be advanced in any way possible .
Right now , peaceful creeping sharia is the most effective .
2 . Jihad really IS the violent subset of Muslim activity , one which trains for battle a limited number of fighters to advance Islam .
So it perfectly fits the descriptions : “ extremism ” , “ terrorism ” or “ radical ” .
3 . Generally , what we see is Muslims apparently behaving well , building their mosques and wearing their multi-culti garb ( Sikhs get to wear their turbans , after all ) , without disrupting society too much .
This is sharia .
We do n’t associate this peaceful nature of Islam with its violent counterpart .
4 . But , before we realize it , this sharia has crept along , and is openly challenging societal norms .
And people are shocked by the demands Muslims make — foot washing facilities , honor killing advocacy , demands of halal foods in ordinary restaurants , etc … The take - over starts to show its true face .
So , by almost exclusively focusing on the very real POTENTIAL jihad ( a.k.a. “ extremism ” , “ terrorism ” , “ radicalism ” ) , we have neglected to document the very real ACTIVE sharia ( interpreted as peaceful ) .
Both have the same goal in mind , to take over a society and render it Muslim .
Perhaps that is why Islam commentators like Robert Spencer are having such difficulty with the terms “ moderate ” and “ extremist / radical ” .
I think they are basing their whole premise of Islamic take - over on violent jihad , which as I ’ve noted is actually carried out by the few ( “ extreme ” ) fighters .
Whereas the peaceful spread of Islam via sharia , practiced by all Muslims , moderate or not , “ extreme ” or not , is actually doing as much , if not more , harm .
Spencer could borrow Creeping Sharia ’s blog name for the title of his book , because that is actually the method Muslims are using in the West at the moment .
If I can humbly say so , I think I realized this phenomenon a little while ago .
Just by looking around and documenting changes , it was clear to me that this creeping sharia aspect of Islam is just as worrisome as its jihadi aspect , and in fact is currently much more prevalent and successful in advancing Islam because no - one is understanding its conquest - like qualities .
LA replies : LA replies :
Thank you , and also thank you for noticing how I progress in the speech from talking about jihad to talking about sharia .
When we first became aware of the Islam problem , the focus of course was on terrorism .
Then after a while we realized that even if there were no terrorism , there would still be jihad , covering all kinds of aggressive Islamic actions short of terrorism .
But three or more years ago , I and others began saying that even if there were no jihad , Islam could still take over via the peaceful spread of sharia .
As I remember , Diana West was in the forefront of focusing attention on sharia .
And now from looking at it , I remember that in her notable August 2006 article ( discussed and quoted here ) , she used the device of a presidential speech .
Then in September 2006 I wrote : A couple of years ago [ it was August 2004 ]
I wrote an article about “ the centrality of jihad in Islam . ”
The other week Diana West spoke of the “ the centrality of sharia in Islam . ”
West ’s formulation gets closer to the truth than mine , since jihad , while it has a central and sacred place in Islam , is not the object of Islam .
The object of Islam is the imposition of Islamic sharia law over the whole earth .
For years critics including myself have been saying that the phrase “ war on terror ” is silly , since you do n’t wage war against a technique .
But now I realize that the same criticism applies to the description of our enemy as jihadism , since jihad is also a technique .
Jihad is not the enemy .
Jihad is the method by which the enemy seeks to subjugate us .
It was while I was researching my 2004 article , “ The Centrality of Jihad in Islam , ” that I had the epiphany that is conveyed by the title .
But , ironically , as I just realized this moment , the facts that triggered that epiphany were not about jihad , but about sharia .
Specifically , they had to do with the 1990 Declaration of Human Rights in Islam , by the Organization of the Islamic Conference , and how that document , while going through the motions of speaking about human rights , in fact made sharia the guiding authority in all matters .
So what I was realizing was the centrality of sharia in Islam , but I was so accustomed to thinking about jihad , that I did n’t see what was in front of my face , so I called sharia jihad .
In any case , the recognition that sharia , not jihad , is the main problem was expressed in my February 2007 draft manifesto ,
What is to be done about Islam , some of the ideas of which I used in my recent PWC speech , though the draft manifesto goes into more detail .
It breaks down Muslims into various categories depending on their relation to sharia and their legal status in the U.S. , and says what ought to be done about them on that basis .
By the way , while some mainstream conservative critics of Islam now speak of sharia , Daniel Pipes to my knowledge has never identified sharia as the problem .
The closest he came was an article ( discussed by me here ) where he said that “ Islamists ultimately seek hegemonic control via a worldwide caliphate that applies the Islamic law in full . ”
Yet he called belief in Islamic law — which is , after all , what standard , orthodox Islam is all about — “ Islamism . ”
That ’s the closest he ’s come to talking about sharia .
In other words , a dishonest euphemism , “ Islamism , ” originally invented to avoid saying “ militant Islam ” or “ extremist Islam ” or “ jihadist Islam , ” Pipes now uses to describe mainstream Islam which believes in the Islamic law .
Because Islam itself is the problem , Pipes now calls Islam itself “ Islamism , ” to avoid putting negative connotations on the word “ Islam . ”
Also see this from December 2006 , in which Pipes says that if Islam spreads not by violent means but by peaceful means ( he ’s talking about the peaceful spread of sharia but he does n’t use the word ) , then he can see no way how we can stop it .
Of course there is a way we can stop it , by stopping and reversing Muslim immigration , but Pipes can no more conceive of doing that than he can conceive of reinstituting slavery .
Kidist writes : Kidist writes : I would like to add just one more thing about sharia .
The frightening thing about Islam is that it has a strategy already in place for societal take over .
Other immigrants can come , but they behave in a haphazard manner .
They do n’t have the formidably organized structure like sharia to establish themselves and settle their families and culture ( and religion ) .
Sharia is as potent as jihad .
LA replies : LA replies : Muslim immigrant communities have a set program by which they step by step establish themselves , gain power , start spreading sharia .
It ’s formidable and terrifying .
April 16 Peter W. writes from Argentina : Excellent , and , as usual , right on target .
I learned long ago that the ability to differentiate between and among various values , realities , and choices was a mark of a civilization that was farther along the path of being developed and sophisticated ( in the truest sense ) , and that an inability or lack of interest in differentiation was a mark of a more primitive , “ back to the primordial ooze ” kind of society .
This point was made clear long ago in a commentary on a rather silly fad of the time called “ unisex , ” where men and women ( especially in the Nordic countries , as I recall ) tried to look exactly alike in their haircuts , clothing , and style .
I ca n’t remember exactly who wrote it , but it was a William Safire - type piece in the New York Times magazine , I think .
At any rate , rising to the intellectual and emotional challenge of learning to differentiate among and between things and ideas , etc. , is hard work , and a job many Americans and others seem unwilling to accept .
It seems far simpler and easier not to bother with it and just assume that everyone and everything has equal and eternal value .
And of course , many people feel this way right at the same time that they ’re differentiating like crazy in the supermarket , the clothing store , and the dating personals .
Calling people to a higher level of thinking and behaving is indeed a frustrating thing .
LA replies : LA replies :
Very interesting point .
Yes , that is precisely what liberalism is about .
It ’s so much easier to have a simple phrase or formula ( “ Everyone ’s equal , ” “ All people want the same things , ” “ All people long for freedom , ” “ Discrimination is always wrong ” ) , than to try to understand and articulate the nature of things , people , cultures .
According to Eric Voegelin in The New Science of Politics , it is the very complexity of the world , specifically the complexity of the world as articulated by Christianity , that drives people to simplistic ideologies that basically reduce the world to a single idea and its evil opposite .
Liberalism is one such ideology .
Islam is another .
April 17 Richard H. writes : Good Show !
Going after the Jihadis is swatting hornets .
Going after Sharia is killing the nest .
LA writes : LA writes : I sent the speech to a foreign politician with this introductory note : … I understand that my kind of thinking lies beyond what is practically possible in the immediately foreseeable future .
Yet , what is practically possible is just more of the same paralysis .
Something different is needed .
Therefore I am taking the liberty of sending you this speech of mine …
It offers a radically different way of thinking that challenges modern liberal assumptions and offers an overall approach that is relevant to any non-Muslim country dealing with an internal Muslim population .
Again , I understand that my approach is so out of step with contemporary , liberal ways of thinking that it may seem insane to you .
My answer is that contemporary liberal ways of thinking are themselves insane , and are leading the countries of the West to destruction .
Therefore something radically different is needed .

Suppose you want to write a program in Perl .
( Suppose you have written a program in Perl . )
If the thesis behind what I call Modern Perl is correct , you can write that program well or you can write that program poorly .
( For supporting arguments for that thesis , see Piers Cawley 's A tale of two languages . )
Likely you 've seen examples of Poorly Written Perl on the Internet .
They serve as the YouTube comments to Nabokov of English language .
In other words , the proper response to a reluctant admission that :
Yes , I know that Perl can be written in an object - oriented and readable way .
— Tim Bray , D.P.H .
... or that :
There 's also been a push in some applications to rewrite Perl utilities in Bash to enhance portability between platforms .
While Perl exists on just about every platform out there , there are vagaries that can cause issues with differing Perl versions , which then leads to portability problems .
— Paul Venezia ,
Is it still libelous if you end your titles with question marks ?
... the proper response is " Why did n't you write your code with maintainability in mind ? "
I know , I know .
That 's not helpful .
Here 's a quick checklist to help those of you writing Perl ( or those of you trying to hire people to write Perl ( or those of you trying to hire people to learn to write Perl ) ) to determine if you 're capable of writing Perl well :
You do n't have to answer all of those questions in the correct way to write good and maintainable Perl , but if you answer most of those questions in the wrong way , of course you 'll write bad code .
Perl allows people to accomplish their tasks without having to learn much , without having to participate in strange and unfamiliar ceremonies , and without even being much good at programming at all .
That 's by design , and that 's a good thing for very specific circumstances .
Yet if you approach programming as if it were merely typing and retyping until something barely working fell out of your typewriter , you 're going to make lots of messes , and no language can save you from an unprofessional lack of discipline .
Writing good code requires discipline in any language .
“ He [ President Obama ] is going to destroy this country , and we ’re either going to stop him or the United States of America is going to cease to exist . ”
- Alan Keyes
By the way , over a decade ago , Keyes had a nightly program on MSNBC .
Are you ready for the punchline ?
It was called , “ Alan Keyes Is Making Sense . ”
I ’m not kidding you .
Just in case you happened to miss Hardball last week on MSNBC , Chris Matthews ’ special report , The Rise of the New Right , was one of those rare ( these days ) moments of essential viewing that we would be wise not to ignore .
It will probably be repeated several times in the next few weeks and I urge you to keep your eye out for it .
Seriously , if Matthews does n’t get an Emmy for this program there is no justice in this world .
The program is the most comprehensive look yet ( at least on non-public television ) at the crack - up the Conservative movement in this country is now going through .
Let ’s face some serious facts here , boys and girls :
The right wing in this country has always been ( since the days of the Confederacy and before ) a tad crazy — not to mention dumber than doggy doo doo .
What is happening to them now is beyond anything in their long and entertainingly weird history .
In effect they ’ve totally lost it .
Here ’s a quaint little soundbite from last night ’s program that illustrates perfectly what I ’m talking about .
The words were uttered by some pathetic , bat shit - crazy woman at last year ’s “ March on Washington ” :
“ We are losing our country .
We think the Muslims are moving in and taking over .
We do not believe our president is a Christian – and he let us believe that .
The president is a liar .
God bless Joe Wilson . ”
Is n’t that sweet ?
We can only assume she was not referring to the same “ Joe Wilson ” who is married to Valerie Plame , but that ’s just a hunch on my part .
Once upon a time people this – “ ill informed ” shall we say ?
– were to be found mostly on the fringes of the American political scene .
Not even in the days of old Joe McCarthy did it get this strange – not on such a national level anyway .
Back in the good ol ’ days , the type of behavior we are witnessing today was pretty much restricted to KKK rallies in the deep south and the editorial offices of the Wall Street Journal .
A half a century ago political extremism had n’t yet gone mainstream .
It has now .
In fact it ’s ready for prime time !
For this we can all thank the nice people at FOX Noise .
It was Rupert Murdoch ’s “ News Group ” that promoted this movement from their inception .
Murdoch himself has denied this accusation over and over again , but the videotapes are there – and video does n’t lie – unless , of course , it ’s a taped replay of a typical Sean Hannity program .
The Plutocracy , with FOX as its propaganda arm , has brilliantly managed to convince a huge segment of the American public – a lot of whom could barely be qualified as middle class – that the problem with this country is all those damned , bleeding heart Liberals .
The question needs to be put to them : “ Where were you assholes when George W. Bush was driving this nation into the economic ditch ? ”
“ We need to defeat these bastards .
Wee need to wipe them out . ” - Rush Limbaugh
Ah , yes !
The language of inferred violence !
It ’s out there , folks .
They ’re not reporting it on FOX but it ’s out there .
One person , a Tea Party candidate named Sharron Angle who is running for Harry Reid ’s seat , actually said that the Nevada senator should be “ taken out ” .
This hideous personage then went on to say that what is direly needed was a “ Second Amendment solution ” .
You know what she ’s talkin’ about , don’cha ?
Sure ya do !
It ’s the same type of solution implemented by John Wilkes Booth and Lee Harvey Oswald when they took on the policies of two noted politicians with which they disagreed .
It ’s the same “ solution ” Sirhan Sirhan used when he murdered Robert Francis Kennedy 42 years ago this month .
It is the exact “ solution ” carried out by ( let ’s be fair to the ultra- Conservatives ) Arthur Bremer in 1972 when he attempted to assassinate right - wing icon and uber - racist George Wallace .
This is the new political atmosphere of the United States .
I fear that it is only a matter of time before the ultimate act of violence is carried out .
I pray to God that I am wrong , but I do n’t think I am ; in fact I am certain of it .
“ I have a message – a message from the Tea Party that is loud and clear and does not mince words :
We have come to take our government back . ” – Rand Paul
“ Take our government back ” ?
From whom ???
Is he referring to the same people who were duly elected via legal democratic processes ?
Is he implying that the administration of Barack Obama is somehow not legitimate ?
Of course he is !
Most of these jackasses refuse to believe that the president is an American citizen in spite of overwhelming evidence to the contrary .
What we are dealing with here is a political movement made up of people whose senses have decided to take a permanent vacation .
Reality Check :
Anyone who denies that the core of the Tea Party ’s rage is the fact that our president is an African American is kidding themselves .
The evidence is too stark to ignore :
This is a white supremest movement , kiddies .
To be sure , at any Tea Party gathering there can always be seen on the peripherals of the crowd a pathetic , token Uncle Tom or two , chomping the hell out of some unfortunate watermelon .
And while it would be unfair to categorically state that every member of the Tea Party is a racist , this is essentially a White Nationalist movement we ’re dealing with here .
Let ’s stop kidding ourselves .
By the way , Malcolm X had the perfect description of the Alan Keyeses of this world : “ House Niggers ” .
The man really had a way with words , did n’t he ?
You gotta love him !
Here ’s the good news :
When the Republicans stupidly embraced the Tea Party last year , they effectively kissed a viper smack dab on the lips .
It is my belief that this nutty movement of freaks and malcontents will end up doing that party more harm than good .
Last January on this site , I predicted that Harry Reid was a goner on Election Day next .
That was before the Nevada GOP cheerfully nominated the Tea Party ’s newest sweetheart Sharon Angle to run against him – she of the “ Second Amendment solution ” fame .
This extremism run-amok is starting to frighten the hell out of the segment of the electorate who identify themselves as “ moderate ” .
Without the support of the moderates , the “ party of Abraham Lincoln ” is screwed .
Remember you read it here .
You know , I was just thinking :
We sure do live in interesting times .
We really do !

What ’s The Matter with Kansas , by Thomas Frank
Intellectual Property Eats Itself
Back in the days of slavery , advocates for that institution pretended to regard it as a normal form of property .
But far from simply desiring that whites should be free to own black slaves or not as they saw fit , or to dispose of this “ property ” as they saw fit , they made it clear by their actions that their real goal for was slavery to predominate and spread as an institution .
This meant restricting the individual slave - owner ’s right of disposition of his own “ property ” through even voluntary manumission of his own slaves — because it would undermine a social order based on slavery as its dominant institution .
Likewise , the Copyright Nazis have made it clear their real goal is to defend “ intellectual property ” as the institutional basis of the corporate economic order — even if it means undermining , by the terms of their own law , the right of individuals to dispose of their own “ intellectual property ” in ways that undermine IP as an institution .
The ASCAP ( The American Society of Composers , Artists and Publishers ) recently sent out a fundraising letter announcing its campaign against Creative Commons and the Electronic Frontier Foundation :
“ Many forces including Creative Commons , Public Knowledge , Electronic Frontier Foundation and technology companies with deep pockets are mobilizing to promote ‘ Copyleft ’ in order to undermine our ‘ Copyright . ’
They say they are advocates of consumer rights , but the truth in these groups simply do not want to pay for the use of our music .
Their mission is to spread the word that our music should be free . ”
Umm , Creative Commons is a set of options for a copyright holder to license his own work .
No one may license anything under Creative Commons except what he holds the copyright on .
So apparently , ASCAP does n’t believe in the right of copyright holders to license their own “ property ” as they see fit if it undermines the predominance of proprietary business models .
This follows a recent campaign by the International Intellectual Property Alliance for the U.S Trade Representative to put several countries on a “ special 301 watch list ” because their governments have adopted open - source software systems like Linux in preference to purchasing proprietary software .
Such action supposedly undermines “ intellectual property . ”
So even though open source - software is , by the Copyright Nazis ’ own laws , a legitimate form of private property licensed under the terms of copyright law , governments are obligated to purchase more expensive proprietary software in order to avoid undermining the proprietary business model .
Cough cough Davis - Bacon cough .
The Copyright Nazis , despite all their rhetoric , do n’t simply regard “ intellectual property ” as a normal form of property which the owner may dispose of as he sees fit , or own or not own as he sees fit — any more than the slaveocracy of 150 years ago saw slavery as a normal form of property among many .
The Copyright Nazis , like the slaveocrats , see copyright as the institutional basis of a social order , to be defended even at the expense of restricting the individual copyright holder ’s right of free disposition over his own “ property . ”
The slaveocracy opposed the right of slave - owners to voluntarily manumit their own slaves , even though this would follow as a matter of course if it were a normal form of property , because it undermined slavery as the institutional basis of social order .
And the Copyright Nazis oppose the free licensing of one ’s own copyrights , under the terms of open source licenses , because it undermines proprietary culture as the institutional basis of the corporate economic system .
As for their agenda of publicly challenging the EFF , I say bring it on !
As it is , the mainstream press simply reports the position of groups like the MPAA and RIAA , along with some quip from Joe Biden , with no indication that there ’s even a debate — the “ other side ” is just a bunch of freeloading teenagers who want to get free stuff .
If ASCAP publicizes this as a fight , it will require the press to report — for the first time — that there IS a fight , with at least a boilerplace paragraph stating what it ’s about .
Even reporting that there ARE such organizations as EFF , that challenge the maximalist copyright position on a principled basis , will be a first for many mainstream news organizations .
Just goes to show , once again , that we ’ll eventually display their bleeding heads on our battlements .

Blizzard Entertainment , makers of the wildly popular World of Warcraft online game recently started an online forum tempest when they decided to start showing users ' online account names when they posted messages to their game forums .
Blizzard explained they were making this change to their online forums because their " forums have also earned a reputation as a place where flame wars , trolling , and other unpleasantness run wild . "
No ?
Really ?
It 's not just Blizzard 's forums though .
Almost every forum I know that allows anonymous comments is filled to overflowing with abusive nonsense .
Whether it's GoComics ( http://www.gocomics.com/); local newspaper online forums ; social bookmarking sites like Digg and Reddit ; developer mailing lists , or , alas , my own blogs and Web sites , all too often instead of intelligent conversation about the subject du jour I find non -stop ranting , sweating , and insults .
Oh , and the occasional bit of spam .

I 'm an Internet veteran ; I was using it for over a decade before the Web came along .
And , as bad as things can get on all these forums , it 's nothing I have n't seen before on Usenet forums .
I also used to run numerous online forum sites for ZDNet and other independent Internet mailing lists .
I do n't think you could pay me enough money to try to manage most social sites these days .
Even if you do require users to login or jump through a CAPTCHA ( Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart ) hoop before posting , the spammers and people with an ax to grind make their way through on a regular basis .
What I did n't use to see was what we have now : a close to total breakdown in online civility .
It seems to me that more and more online conversations are dominated not merely by rude people , but by people suffering from OCD ( obsessive - compulsive disorder ) and Asperger syndrome .

And , on the other side of the political aisle , most of you do know that Bush has n't been president for over two - years now right ?
It 's not just big issues though .
I see it all the time in the flame wars that can spring up and burn out entire online communities over such questions as whether Windows or Linux is better .
More recently , I 've been amazed at just hostile some of the conversations between Android and iPhone fans can get recently .
People , come on , it 's just a phone !
It 's not just online forums though .
The one online game I play a lot is Guild Wars .
In game , there are public areas where characters can talk to each other .
I now turn it off the second I enter such areas .
Instead of talking about anything remotely related to the game , what I always find now are people insulting each other with sexual and racial names , moronic anti-religion and / or US rants , and written fights that usually boil down to " You 're a jerk ! "
" No , you 're a jerk ! "
Oh yeah , that really makes me want to listen to any of you .
It 's not just that game though ; I see that kind of stuff everywhere now .
I used to be a big believer in the value of online communities .
And , there are still a few , where people actually treat each other with civility .
By and large though I 'm sick of what passes for online conversations these days .
I 'm not perfect .
I 've been rude online myself from time to time .
I try not to be though .
Another reason I turn off ' listening ' to online chat in game is that all that vitriol is infectious , and I find myself wanting to flame back .
I know that arguing with an idiot only brings me right down to their level and will end up annoying both of us , but the temptation is still there .
So , instead , I just switch all of it off .
I 'd like to think that things could get better but as more and more people who seem to me to be honestly mildly mentally ill dominate the common space of online communications I 've lost almost all my interest in participating in them .
If you 'd like to help make things get better , I 'd like to suggest that the next time you 're tempted to flame someone on an online forum , keep in mind that you 're not talking to a machine ; your words will be read by other people , not all that different from you .
We could all stand a little kindness .
If we all work at taking responsibility for our words and realizing that our words can hurt others so we should choose them carefully maybe , just maybe , we can take back some of the Internet 's social forums .
I hope so anyway .

Collectible bricks become collectible cards next year , when NetDevil 's LEGO Universe expands with a virtual and physical trading card game , courtesy of the experts at Dire Wolf Digital .
Who is Dire Wolf Digital ?

Integrating a digital and physical collectible card game into an MMO seems like a very Sony Online Entertainment thing to do , which makes complete sense when you realize that Dire Wolf Digital is a company made up of former SOE Denver team members .
Company president Scott Martins was the studio head of SOE Denver , after his previous company , Worlds Apart Productions , was acquired by them in 2006 .
So Dire Wolf Digital has a lot of experience making collectible card game tie-ins for online games , including Legends of Norrath , the Star Wars Galaxies TCG , and the Free Realms TCG .
It 's what they do , and now they 're doing it with LEGO Universe .

" Creating a game with the LEGO Group and NetDevil is an exciting opportunity , allowing us to work with a beloved brand and great business partners , " said Scott Martins , president of Dire Wolf Digital .
" The creativity and ‘ build anything ' spirit of the brand and LEGO Universe fit perfectly with trading card games , where players are limited only by their imaginations . "
My imagination says to expect a game where colored bricks equal mana used to build creatures and weapons to battle your opponent .
We 'll see if I am right next year .

ROHR
FIFA World Cup
Before Gernot Rohr was appointed head coach of Nigeria , the team were at a low ebb , having failed to qualify for either the 2015 or 2017 CAF Africa Cup of Nations .
Indeed , many were questioning their ability to make it to the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia™ , especially after they were drawn in an extremely tough group alongside Algeria , Zambia and Cameroon .
Despite these difficulties , Rohr rejuvenated the squad by calling up top European - based players such as Kelechi Iheanacho , Wilfred Ndidi and Alex Iwobi .
These talented youngsters helped the Super Eagles reach the World Cup unbeaten and to impress at Russia 2018 , where they only missed out on the knockout phase after narrowly losing their final group game to Argentina .
In conversation with FIFA.com , Rohr spoke about his coaching career in Africa , his ambitions to reach Qatar 2022 with Nigeria , and his desire to lead the Super Eagles to the quarter - finals for the first time .
Figures in billions except for World War II and post - 9/11 totals ; all are in fiscal year 2011 dollars .

In an under - the - radar release of new test results for its Gulf of Mexico oil spill workers , BP PLC is reporting potentially hazardous exposures to a now - discontinued dispersant chemical -- a substance blamed for contributing to chronic health problems after the Exxon Valdez cleanup -- among more than 20 percent of offshore responders .
BP 's new summary of chemical testing , posted to its website this week after a nearly monthlong absence of new data , also makes notable revisions to the company 's public characterization of the health risks facing Gulf workers .
The oil giant now describes the government as a partner in developing the program for monitoring cleanup crews .
In a June 9 report on worker test results , BP confidently asserted that the health hazards of exposure to both dispersant chemicals and the components of leaking crude " are very low . "
In its latest summary , BP replaced those three words with an assurance that health risks " have been carefully considered in the selection of the various methods employed in addressing its spill . "
The new BP summary , including results up to June 29 , show a broad majority of workers testing below exposure limits set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) .
But the Valdez - linked chemical 2 - butoxyethanol was detected at levels up to 10 parts per million ( ppm ) in more than 20 percent of offshore responders and 15 percent of those near shore .
The NIOSH standard for 2 - butoxyethanol , which lacks the force of law but is considered more health - protective than the higher OSHA limit , is 5 ppm .
Some public - health advocates pointed out that BP references the NIOSH ceiling of each chemical it tested for except 2 - butoxyethanol , an ingredient in the Corexit 9527 dispersant that BP phased out after spraying it in the Gulf during the early days of the spill .
" They 're playing with these numbers , " said Mark Catlin , a veteran industrial hygienist who has studied the worker - health fallout from the 1989 Valdez spill .
Natural Resources Defense Council Senior Scientist Gina Solomon described BP 's continued offshore 2 - butoxyethanol detection during the month of June as " worrisome . "
" It suggests to me that there is still , clearly , a serious air - quality concern .
... [ Gulf ] air quality , if anything , seems to be deteriorating , " Solomon said .
Hunter College toxicology professor Frank Mirer said it would be " implausible " that the ongoing detection of 2 - butoxyethanol among workers could be attributable to only BP 's early use of Corexit 9527 .
On June 9 , BP 's testing summary stated : " BP has , for the very start , worked hard to ensure that the people involved in all the activities associated with the incident are protected . "
That sentence also appeared in this week 's report , with " BP " replaced by " the Unified Area Command , " the government 's joint oil spill response effort .
More questions than answers
BP 's latest report on worker exposures adds test results for three components of crude oil not mentioned in previous monitoring summaries : toluene , xylene and ethylbenzene .
Solomon praised the company for releasing more of its data amid pressure for increased transparency from members of Congress ( E&E Daily , June 15 ) .
" I was very happy to see they have presented results for many more chemicals than they were previously , " she said .
However , the company 's continued use of bar graphs that encompass ranges of exposures -- without including where and under what conditions the Gulf tests are performed -- left several occupational safety experts with more questions than answers .
New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health industrial hygienist David Newman , who served on a U.S. EPA expert panel that evaluated lingering public health risks after the Sept. 11 attacks , cautioned against focusing on worker testing data without considering broader details of particular on - the - job chemical exposures .
" We had a humongous amount of data after 9/11 , " Newman said .
" Most if not all of the data were reassuring .
And yet harm was done . "
Catlin echoed Newman 's warning .
" There are certainly some folks saying , ' Look at all this data , everything looks good , ' " he said , " but we saw that same thing on the Exxon Valdez .
...
The summary data BP provides is too sketchy to be able to give a clean bill of health . "

BP ’s partners in the blown - out Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico distanced themselves from the oil giant in a Senate subcommittee hearing on Thursday , though their arguments encountered a skeptical audience .
“ Our view is that this accident was preventable , ” said James T. Hackett , chief executive of the Anadarko Petroleum Corporation , a part owner in the well .
The well is owned jointly by BP and its investment partners , Anadarko and a subsidiary of the Mitsui Oil Exploration Corporation known as MOEX Offshore 2007 .
BP , listed in the contracts as the operator of the well , owns 65 percent ; Anadarko owns 25 percent ; MOEX , 10 percent .
By the terms of the companies ’ joint operating agreement , their legal liability for the well corresponds to their share of ownership .

And yes , apparently it 's small enough to fit in a young girl 's hands .
This non-interchangeable lens is backed by an all - touch interface ( say sayonara to your knobs and dials ) , an extremely high - resolution sensor , and image stabilization so advanced as to make shooting at that unspeakably high zoom range a viable option .

The Vancouver Canucks re-signed forward Mason Raymond on Monday , avoiding arbitration with the winger by giving him a hefty pay raise in a two - year deal worth $ 5.1 million US .
Raymond was scheduled to head to arbitration Monday .
The 24 - year - old scored 25 goals and had 28 assists last season , both career - highs .
He added three goals and an assist in the playoffs .
The Cochrane , Alta. , native was a bargain for the Canucks last season , given his production .
Raymond only earned $ 760,000 in 2009 - 10 .
He 'll get $ 2.5 million in 2010 - 11 and $ 2.6 million in 2011 - 12 .
Selected by Vancouver in the second round of the 2005 draft , Raymond has 45 goals and 52 assists over the last three seasons for the Canucks .
From the iPod to the iPhone to the iPad , Apple has a nearly perfect track record of re-energizing lackluster product spaces .
FaceTime , the company 's take on the video phone , is no different .
From the iPod to the iPhone to the iPad , Apple has a nearly perfect track record of re-energizing lackluster product spaces .
FaceTime , the company 's take on the video phone , is no different .
Apple will become the greatest sales organization in the history of business when it manages to convince the public that it really wants a video phone .
It was Apple , after all , that proved that there is indeed a market for MP3 players .
Before the iPod came along , the market was unfocused .
By all rights , Sony should have owned the space , but it was Apple 's vision of a closed system that was the clincher .
In the process of opening up the MP3 player market , Apple also opened up the idea of selling music online , eventually winning over the music industry .
It 's a remarkable feat that has been overlooked , in light of more recent developments .
The iPod became ridiculously successful , paving the way for the company 's next challenge , the iPhone .
No one in their right mind ( save for those who saw the device in advance ) would have predicted a similar level of success for Apple 's first smartphone .
After all , these types of phones have been around for over a decade , and even moneybags Microsoft could n't figure out the market .
It was moribund .
Once again , Apple changed the model .
This time the company turned the smartphone into an app phone and did away with the stylus that everyone was losing all the time .
Apple also developed the App Store , another closed system that it could control .
It only took a few key strokes that no one else thought of , and then bingo mega success !
There was only one more space that Microsoft had attempted and failed .
More than a decade ago , Bill Gates bragged about how the tablet was going to take over the world in the following three or four years .
There was a mini- boom in development , as laptop makers went crazy developing for the space .
And then they realized that no one was interested .
Within that predicted three year period , the market actually died , except for a couple of niche manufacturers .
And then , boom !
Here comes the iPad .
Apple 's tablet was an immediate , runaway success , even after all of the bad market that preceded it .
Apple is doing nothing more than addressing exactly what is wrong with all of the previous initiatives .
Microsoft was an obvious target because the company had executed very few of its own original ideas .
The company prefers to " embrace and extend " the work of others , but it did have the right ideas .
Apple has run out of stagnant Microsoft ideas , unless it decides to challenge Word or some other boring enterprise stuff .
So , how about a bigger challenge ?
How about a video phone ?
I first saw a video phone as a little kid .
AT&T had some sort of futuristic pavilion at Disneyland , showing off the " Picture Phone . "
The company claimed it was the phone of the future .
It was a clunker .
The product was introduced at the 1964 World 's Fair .
The company expected to sell millions .
Ultimately , very few were sold and the product died .
Over the years , various companies have resurrected the idea .
Again , no traction .
In recent years , video was added as an optional feature on Yahoo and MSN chat , utilizing cheap cameras from companies like Logitech .
Skype soon followed suit .
After nearly 50 years , the public had warmed up to having some video intrusion in their lives .
But no one had the marketing muscle or gumption to re-promote the " Picture Phone " concept .
No one until Apple .
It 's the same fractal : find a languishing idea , rethink it , and then push it with the aid of compelling advertising .
Boom .
Now everyone 's talking about FaceTime .
The irony is that FaceTime is probably the most clunky of Apple 's juggernaut ideas , since it requires a Wi -Fi connection to work .
Even so , the company is selling a lot of phones , thanks to ads for the feature .
Before I wrap up , I should mention that a key component to the company 's success is well orchestrated ad campaigns .
It 's hard to believe that Microsoft spends three times more money on marketing than Apple .
I was stunned when I saw those numbers in Advertising Age .
There is generally nothing memorable about the company 's ads .
Recently , the company tried to confuse people by showing various nudniks who claim to have invented Windows 7 .
What kind of message is that ?
So , what 's next for Apple ?
No one has ever gotten traction for genuine interactive TV .
Apple has to be looking at that sometime soon .
Just you watch .
The great thing about Karl Urban as Dr. McCoy is that the New Zealand actor so transformed himself to play the lanky , southerndoctor that he ’s almost unrecognizable as Karl Urban .
So should he show up as say , Judge Dredd , you wo n’t look at the screen and wonder “ hey why is Bones shooting people ? ”
That ’s an obstacle DeForest Kelly was never really able to overcome as McCoy .
His portrayal was brilliant and utterly iconic , but ultimately there was a lot of him in Bones .
Seeing him on screen as anyone else seemed almost impossible .
So now it looks like Karl Urban really might be playing the previously mentioned , potentially iconic Judge Dredd and that ’s fine by me .
He confirmed that he ’s not only in contention to star in a reboot of the futuristic , lawgiving comic book character , but that he actually has the part .
Because Urban is the kind of actor who so transforms himself to take on the part , he 's also ok with not showing his face in the film .
In the comics , Judge Dredd keeps his helmet on and in a recent interview with Movline , before finalizing his deal , he told them he'd be keeping Dredd 's mask on .
He explains , " Dredd is enigmatic , the faceless representative of justice .
His prevailing attitudes , his strength of moral character , and the strength of his actions are what speak volumes for that character .
"
The last time we saw Judge Dredd on screen it was 1995 and he was played by Sylvester Stallone .
The movie was a flop , a failure , and the punchline of far too many jokes .
The next time you hear someone grunt “ I am the law ! ” , Judge Dredd ’s trademark catchphrase , odds are it ’ll be said with sarcastic derision and not affection .
This new version , set to start filming this fall , was written bywriter Alex Garland and promises to take the material more seriously .
Casting Urban , a talented actor with a gift for physical , demanding action is definitely a step in the right direction .

That 's what Las Vegas Sands spent constructing Marina Bay Sands , the world 's most expensive standalone resort that looks more like a cruise boat perched atop a 55 - floor skyscraper than any fully earthbound structure .

ON TUESDAY July 27th BP announced its chief executive , Tony Hayward , was stepping down after just three years in the job .
He leaves with a year 's salary , £ 1 m ( $ 1.6 m ) , and a pension reported to be worth £ 11 m , accrued over 28 years of service .
On the same day the company revealed a quarterly loss of £ 17 billion , reflecting the cost of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
Mr Hayward has received criticism over his handling of the Deepwater Horizon spill .
For all the opprobrium heaped on him over the last few months , Mr Hayward 's payout is modest compared with those enjoyed by many similarly high - profile bosses .

Top Gear co-presenter James May has been awarded an honorary degree by Lancaster University .
The award - winning journalist was a student on the campus in the 1980s when he studied music .
Known as Captain Slow for his cautious driving style on the BBC
Two show , he has become an honorary doctor of letters .
He said he was " flattered " to receive such an accolade , and felt emotional returning to his former university .
" It 's very nostalgic , what with work commitments I have n't been back for 10 years .
" I walked round the campus and it was very emotional , it does n't really come flooding back but , more like a wall covered in posters , it hit me instantly .
" It smells the same , feels the same but altered so I got slightly lost . "
May graduated in 1985 and remembers a time " bathed in benign sunshine " .
" But it must have rained really , it is Lancaster after all , " he added .
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Shahram Amiri says he was subjected to " the harshest mental and physical torture "
An Iranian scientist who claims he was kidnapped by the CIA in Saudi Arabia a year ago and taken to the United States has arrived back in Iran .
After greeting members of his family at Tehran airport , Shahram Amiri told reporters he had been subjected to " the harshest mental and physical torture " .
He also denied that he had been heavily involved in Iran 's nuclear programme .
On Monday , Mr Amiri went to the Iranian interests section of Pakistan 's embassy in the US and asked to be repatriated .
The US state department insisted he was in the country " of his own free will " and raised no objections about his return to Iran .
' Israeli agents '
Wearing a beige suit , a smiling Mr Amiri was greeted at Tehran 's international airport early on Thursday by his tearful son and wife , along with other family members and Deputy Foreign Minister , Hassan Qashqavi .
I have some documents proving that I 've not been free in the United States and have always been under the control of armed agents of US intelligence services Shahram Amiri
Speaking at a news conference afterwards , he repeated his earlier claims that he had been abducted by US agents while undertaking the Hajj pilgrimage in the Saudi Arabian city of Medina .
Mr Amiri said he was placed under intense pressure by his interrogators to co-operate in the first months following his alleged kidnapping .
" I was under the harshest mental and physical torture , " he said , adding that Israeli agents had been present during the interrogations and that the CIA had offered him $ 50 m to remain in the US .
" The Americans wanted me to say that I defected to America of my own will to use me for revealing some false information about Iran 's nuclear work . "
Mr Amiri offered no evidence , but said he would eventually .
" I have some documents proving that I 've not been free in the United States and have always been under the control of armed agents of US intelligence services . "
He also denied he had been heavily involved in Iran 's nuclear programme , saying he was a " simple researcher who was working at a university " .
" I 'm not involved in any confidential jobs .
I had no classified information . "
Some unconfirmed reports said he worked for Iran 's atomic energy organisation .
Mr Qashqavi thanked the scientist for his " resistance to pressure " .
He rejected suggestions that Mr Amiri 's release was linked to a possible deal to release three US hikers who have been detained in Iran since 2009 .
' Breakdown '
In the US , unnamed officials and security sources are claiming that Mr Amiri defected and was put into a programme similar to a witness - protection scheme .
Later , he apparently became concerned for family members he had left behind , had a breakdown and decided to return to Iran , US reports claim .
Image caption Shahram Amiri was greeted at Tehran 's airport by his tearful son and wife
A US official told the BBC : " He provided useful information to the United States .
The Iranians now have him .
In terms of win-loss , it 's not even a close call . "
In its online edition , The Washington Post newspaper quoted unnamed officials saying Mr Amiri had been working for the CIA for more than a year and was paid $ 5 m .
In June , the Iranian government announced that it had handed evidence to the US that the scientist had been abducted .
It came shortly after Mr Amiri appeared in two videos posted on the internet giving conflicting stories about how he had arrived in the US .
He said in the first that he had been kidnapped by CIA and Saudi agents while on a pilgrimage .
In the second message , he said he had gone to the US to improve his education and was living freely in Arizona .
In a third message posted on the internet later that month , Mr Amiri said he had escaped from US custody and was on the run in Virginia .
In an interview with Iranian state Press TV before he left the US , Mr Amiri said he was in Medina when three men in a van posing as fellow pilgrims offered him a ride .
" As I sat down , the man in back held a gun toward me and told me to keep quiet , " he said .
" They took me to a secret place and injected me , and when I woke up I saw myself in a huge airplane " and was taken to the US .
The US state department repeatedly denied it had kidnapped him , but never said that he was not in the country .
However on Tuesday , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton acknowledged publicly for the first time that the scientist was indeed in the US .

In its early years , Nokia was an innovator -- the company that became an intimate part of hundreds of millions of peoples ' lives through their mobile phones .
But the company has recently slacked off , and most of the innovation in the mobile industry is coming from the likes of Apple and Google in Silicon Valley .
So Nokia 's board is now reportedly looking at replacing Nokia CEO Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo with an outsider , and has already interviewed two Americans .
Whoever becomes Nokia 's next CEO is going to have to lead the company forward -- and quickly !
-- especially in the fields of mobile software , platforms , and smartphones .
Otherwise , Nokia could wind up stuck only at the low margin , low end of the industry -- not where it wants to be .
The decision may ultimately include giving up on some of Nokia 's home - baked OSes and joining up with Google 's Android platform , like Motorola is doing , or Microsoft 's Windows Phone 7 platform .
But first things first -- Nokia first has to hire someone .
Meanwhile , we 've put together a quick history lesson featuring some of Nokia 's greatest hits and biggest flops .
These are the memorable old Nokia phones over the years than its new CEO is going to have to do better than .
Probably the most exciting thing we saw at Comic - Con today was a surprise chunk of footage from Jon Favreau 's scifi western , Cowboys and Aliens .
It was gritty and action - packed , plus there was a showdown between Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig .
Advertisement
Favreau , whose previous films were Iron Man and Iron Man 2 , said they 've only been shooting for a month , but he wanted to prep some great footage for Comic - Con .
Holy crap did he deliver .
He called the movie a " by the book Western , " in the vein of John Ford , which will definitely be in 2D .
( Why no 3D ?
He just does n't think you can shoot a Western in digital . )
And he said his scifi influences include Close Encounters of the Third Kind , Alien , and Predator .
" We wanted it to look like practical effects , with minimal CGI , " he added .
And it really worked .
We saw several interlinked scenes that introduce our main characters .
The first clip opens with Zeke Johnson ( Daniel Craig ) riding his horse into a tiny old west town , accompanied by a scruffy dog .
He looks wary , and his face is covered in grime .
Seeing nobody around , he slips into a house and begins to clean up .
Immediately , we notice that he has a bulky , steampunk - looking wristband on one arm ; then he pulls aside his shirt to reveal a deep , bloody bullet wound .
As he 's cleaning that , the house 's owner pokes a shotgun into his ear and he 's forced to put his hands up .

The man says to Zeke , " Only two kinds of people get shot : Criminals and victims .
Which one are you ? "
" I do n't know , " Zeke replies .
Next time we see him , Zeke is in jail and a scruffy teenager in the next cell is spitting on him , saying , " I want to see you suffer for a long time . "
Finally , after a few more seconds of torment , Zeke gets up , grabs the kid by the scruff of the neck , and smashes him unconscious against the bars dividing their two cells .
So Zeke is a tough character .
And when the lawmen arrive , they tell him he 's been charged with murder and he 's being taken for a trial - chained to the snotty kid he knocked out .
The two of them have been bundled into an armored carriage when a large group of armed men ride out of the night and into town carrying torches .
Their leader is Col. Woodrow Dolarhyde ( Harrison Ford ) , and he 's a venomous bad guy who refuses to hear the pleas of his son , who turns out to be the snot - nosed kid who spat on Zeke .
Pointing at Zeke , Woodrow says , " That 's the son of a bitch who stole my gold . "
He wants to snatch Zeke out of the carriage right that minute to find out where his gold is , but he 's interrupted when the horizon begins to glimmer with lights .
It 's a very Close Encounters - esque looking UFO , which zooms toward the town , fragments into several ships which disappear , then reappear directly overhead , shooting blue lasers and blowing up the town house by house .
Fires erupt from windows , people run screaming ( including Sam Rockwell ) , and the jail carriage is knocked over .
Zeke and the kid scramble out and we see Zeke 's wristband has grown to cover his lower arm .
It 's also glowing blue .
He aims it at the ships , and shoots out a beam of light that brings one down in a haze of dust and fire .

A hush falls over the town as everybody stares at the fallen ship , looking a little like a TIE fighter surrounded by mounds of displaced dirt .
Woodrow is standing next to Zeke , who is still in a fighting stance , his arm outstretched .
His wristband suddenly closes back up , becoming the small band we saw earlier .
The two men exchange a significant glance , their faces lit by UFO fire , and the clip ended .
It was an amazing series of establishing scenes , and gave us a real taste of the film 's pacing and style .
And it was simply amazing - one of the most intriguing things I 've seen all week at Con .
I like the fact that it 's Old West science fiction but not steampunk at all ( except for the style of Zeke 's wristband ) .
It actually reminded me of what The Adventures of Briscoe County would have been if it were a drama : a perfect blend of cowboy justice and UFO weirdness .

Along with the rest of the crowd , I was left breathless and wondering how this would all play out .
Will this be hard science fiction , or more fantastical like the Indiana Jones series ?
What will the aliens look like ?
Is Harrison Ford actually playing a bad guy ?
And Daniel Craig as a cowboy ?
Sign me the fuck up .
Seriously - I predict that this film , based on a comic book by Scott Rosenberg , is going to be mindblowingly awesome when it comes out this time next year .
ATHENS 
In 2009 , bankers for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley pitched the Greek government on a plan to overhaul its money - losing railway system .
Among the ideas was to lay off half of the system ’s 7,000 workers and have the government take on roughly half of the company ’s 8 billion euros in debt .
The suggestion did not fly .
It was an election year in Greece , after all , and the country was already struggling to keep up the payments on its debt , which is higher in proportion to economic output than in any other nation in the European Union .
The plan was shelved , soon to be overshadowed by the country ’s close brush with bankruptcy .
Losses at Hellenic Railways , however , continue to mount  at the rate of 3 million euros ( $ 3.8 million ) a day .
Its total debt has increased to $ 13 billion , or about 5 percent of Greece ’s gross domestic product .
Now , as a condition of Greece ’s financial rescue , the International Monetary Fund is demanding that a solution be found .
The fund and the European Union , which also chipped in to provide the bailout , are requiring that the debt of Hellenic Railways , as well as the off - balance - sheet obligations of other state - owned enterprises , be counted toward Greece ’s official debt  which Greece has agreed to do .
After Shepard died in the beginning of Mass Effect 2 , his blue - skinned friend Liara T'Soni fought a desperate battle to recover his body from the mysterious Shadow Broker .
Now it 's time to settle the score .

ARCHAEOLOGICAL finds from across Wales can now be explored at the touch of a button , thanks to a new online database being launched tomorrow .
The website , Archwilio – which means “ to explore ” – catalogues the historic environment records of Wales , allowing users to freely explore details of thousands of different archaeological sites dating back more than 100,000 years .
Created using information from the four archaeological trusts of Wales , the new service is being launched by Welsh heritage minister Alun Ffred Jones .
Emily La Trobe - Bateman , of Gwynedd Archaeological
Trust , said the website is an exciting step forward in recording data .
“ Archwilio is the online access system to the Historic Environment Records ( HER ) of Wales , ” she said .
“ The idea is to disseminate information leading to a wider understanding of our cultural heritage and historic environment . ”
Currently around 100,000 individual entries are held by the four regions , which are continually updated and expanded as new information becomes available .
“ As well as big well - known sites like castles , churches and hillforts , you ’ve also got little records of deserted long houses and small deserted medieval settlements , which could be just a ruined cottage site in the uplands , ” said Marion Page , HER manager with Dyfed Archaeological Trust .
As well as being able to view artefacts such as an Iron Age bronze plaque found at the Moel Hiraddug hillfort on the Clwydian hills in North Wales , web users can find details of any excavation work or archaeological discoveries local to them .
Among the sites are a Roman discovery beneath a school car park in Neath .
The Glamorgan - Gwent Archaeological
Trust is working with Wales and West Utilities , Dwr-y - felin Comprehensive School and Cadw to investigate the remains of a Roman fort called Nidum .
“ These are the kinds of projects that can be discovered and shared by using the site , ” said Mrs Page .
“ It is a very exciting prospect to be able to share such a wealth of information on a database that will hopefully just grow and grow . ”
It 'd only get you 20 points , mind .
Mattel , the Willy Wonka - esque makers of most board games , has relented under the pressure of unimaginative word sleuths by allowing pronouns onto the checkered boards .

The rules have been changed after 62 years , to " enable young players " an easier ride .
Presumably Mattel wants to scrape back some dewy - soft hands from Wii controllers , though undoubtedly there 's bound to be issues when the young 'uns are playing against gramps , who can remember the good ol ' days when words such as " Beyonce " and " Beckham " would n't award their players points .
No word whether the various Facebook , iPhone and iPad Scrabble rip - offs will allow the new change in rules .

" He 's not a quitter , " Wade said .
" He did n't quit . "
In an interview with the AP on July 8 , Gilbert not only levied the quitting charge , but said James got " a free pass " for too long .
The NBA fined Gilbert $ 100,000 earlier this week for some of his comments , with commissioner David Stern saying they were too extreme for the league 's liking .
Wade said he watched every game in Cleveland 's second - round series against Boston , the team that eliminated the Heat in the opening round of the postseason .
The Celtics used a similar defensive scheme against James as they did against Wade to open the playoffs , throwing a slew of challenges in the way of both .
" LeBron James , Dwyane Wade , Kobe Bryant , guys like that understand what Boston 's defense was about , " Wade said .
" Their defense was built on not letting one player beat them .
You either settle for the outside shot or you pass to your teammates .
LeBron had one bad game in the playoffs .
Other than that , he did what he could do with the defense all watching him . "
The Cavs lost to the Celtics in six games , but Wade pointed out that in the series finale , James finished with 27 points , 19 rebounds and 10 assists .
Nonetheless , Gilbert told the AP , " Watch the tape .
The Boston series was unlike anything in the history of sports for a superstar . "
The Cavaliers were beaten by 32 points in Game 5 , a stunning loss at home .
During the game , James appeared distracted and disinterested , often glaring at Cleveland 's coaches as the Cavs tried to foul to get back into the game in the second half .
James also made some puzzling postgame comments , saying he had " spoiled " people with his play over seven seasons .
In that Game 5 loss to Boston , James scored 15 points on 3 - of - 14 shooting .
In Game 6 against Boston , even as now - former Cavs coach Mike Brown tried to get his players to foul as time was winding down , James appeared to wave him off , seeming almost resigned that the season was ending and there was nothing Cleveland could do at that point .
Gilbert also said he believes James quit on the Cavs in Game 6 of their series in 2009 against Orlando .
" I do n't see where you can get where he quit , " Wade said .
" He just had one bad game .
It happens .
Kobe had a bad game in the Finals .
They won .
It did n't matter .
LeBron 's teammates did n't help him out that game and it made the way he played even worse .
But he 's not a quitter .
He did n't quit . "
As James pointed out in his welcome - to - Miami event on July 9 , Bryant made only 6 of his 24 shots in Game 7 of the NBA Finals against Boston , which his Los Angeles Lakers won anyway for their second straight NBA title .
" He knew he had help and guys came through for him , " James said last week of Bryant 's Game 7 showing in the Finals .
James was the subject of countless jokes during Wednesday 's ESPY Awards , and Wade saw the humor in some of them .
Others , however , had him bristling .
" You get defensive with things like that , " Wade said .
" He 's a good friend .
You understand people say it because it 's a hot topic .
They wanted people to react in a positive way or a negative way , just because it 's a hot topic to talk about .
It 's a punch line .
They just wanted to have something to do with it .
They wanted to feel involved in some way . "
With a historic vote this month allowing gay couples to marry and adopt children , Argentina joined a vanguard of nations — nine , to be precise — granting gays and lesbians these rights .
It ’s a stunning development on a continent where not long ago such a bold measure would have been unthinkable .
Only the legalization of abortion anywhere in Latin America would be more momentous .
Incredibly , in this day and age , abortion is legal in only one nation in Latin America , Cuba .
Five countries — Chile , El Salvador , Honduras , Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic — ban it under all circumstances , even when the mother ’s life is in danger .
A law making abortion legal in Mexico City is under attack by the Roman Catholic Church .
But abortion is not the only women ’s rights issue in Latin America .
Although many governments in the region describe themselves as progressive , the daily lives of millions of women in Latin America remain mired in poverty , male dominance and discrimination because of lax enforcement of social reforms and legal measures .
Still , Argentina ’s vote to allow same - sex weddings is nothing short of a social revolution , a possible sign that perhaps the campaign for women ’s rights cannot be too far behind .
Argentina ’s recent turbulent past and brutal oppression and persecution of gays and lesbians hardly foreshadowed the Patagonian nation ’s new global status as a champion for them .
Decades ago during the “ dirty war , ” a state - sponsored campaign of terror against leftists after the coup of March 1976 , gay bars in Buenos Aires were closed , and more than a thousand gay men were persecuted , arrested , kidnapped , tortured and killed .
The stories of the hundreds of thousands of “ disappeared ” — gays and straights — haunt the country even today .
I 'll skip the gory details , but I started dieting and exercising July 1st ( this year ) .

Dear , sweet , gentle reader .
It is taking all of my mental and most of my physical capacity to endure life until tomorrow night when Germany plays Spain in the semi-finals of the World Cup .
If you 've been following along , and I sure hope you have ( the drama !
the intrigue ! the exhilaration ! ) , you might have caught drift of the way the German team is playing and though I 've been a devoted fan since the age of five , when a sticker of Rudi Völler in all his permed and mustachioed glory found a permanent home glued to the underside of a shelf positioned right above my bed so that I could see him before I went to sleep at night and first thing when I woke up , I have to say it 's never been this much fun to watch them play .
And how they have played !
Anyway , since you come here for food and chat and not sports commentary , I will do my very best to keep my nerves to myself , but I 'll just say it 's hard , okay ?
It 's hard !
You should see my cuticles .
My new gray hair .
Me muttering to myself before I go to sleep at night .
" They 'll be okay without Müller , right ? " " Maybe David Villa will get the stomach flu . "
" Four goals against Australia !
Four goals against England !
Four goals against Argentina ! "
" Please , psychic octopus , please be wrong just this one time . "
It 's exhausting .
Food and chat , woman !
Focus .
Okay .
So , the other day I was thinking about spaghetti .
I think about spaghetti a lot , you know .
Maybe because I 'm half - Italian .
Maybe because we eat it multiple times a week .
Maybe just because it 's good .
Who knows .
I was thinking about spaghetti and how I go through phases with spaghetti sauce .
Like , there were a good two years where my favorite tomato sauce involved canned cherry tomatoes , a small can of tuna and a garlic clove .
I made it over and over and over again until I could no longer look at tuna the same way again ( good thing , too ) .
Then I had a thing with Marcella Hazan 's tomato - butter - and - onion sauce .
Over and over and over again , until it started tasting like tomato soup to me and I had to take a break .
Then there was the sauce made with sliced zucchini simmered in diced tomatoes ( Muir Glen , I miss you ! ) , particularly delicious with grated Parmigiano - I do believe that one lasted the longest .
But my first love , the tomato sauce that started the obsessive sauce - making , well , I had managed to banish it from my memory so entirely that when it popped back into my head the other day , I almost jumped .
That tomato sauce , made of little cherry tomatoes halved and baked in the oven with a cheese - breadcrumb topping , was one of the four pillars of my diet during my first years in New York .
I made it All .
The .
Time .
I found it in the Best American Recipes cookbook from the year 2000 and I committed it to memory .
My roommates were obsessed , my faraway boyfriend smitten .
It was fast , it was cheap , it did n't dirty many pots , and it was delicious .
Best recipe , indeed .
But as these things go , I overdid it .
I made it one too many times , relied on it too much for weekly nourishment .
I started getting tired of halving those little tomatoes , making sure their perky little faces faced the right side up in the baking pan , getting the sprinkle of breadcrumbs and cheese just right .
One day , I moved on .
( What came next ?
Olives and capers with peeled plum tomatoes , I believe .
Oh ... that was a good run .
Do n't forget the parsley . )
So on that I forgot all about my beloved baked tomato sauce , until I was lying around thinking about spaghetti sauce the other day , probably in an attempt to distract myself from the terrifying prospect that was the Argentina game , because why on earth else would I have needed distraction ?
[ FOUR - NIL , SUCKERS ! ]
Focus , woman .
Fo-cus .
I went through my old recipe binder and sure enough , there was the recipe , lying sweetly in wait to be welcomed back into the fold again .
And really , it is so good .
The tomatoes , roasting under their garlicky - cheesy cap , collapse and go all sweet and sticky .
The breadcrumbs get toasty , the cheese melts and browns , the garlic infuses everything with this savory , mouthwatering scent .
You mash everything together loosely , adding some olive oil for moisture and aroma , and torn basil leaves for flavor .
Then in go the cooked pasta ( penne are nicest , I find , but spaghetti works wonderfully , too ) .
You can dish it up into plates , then , or , if you 're eating alone just fork it up out of the serving dish ( the little crusty bits in the corners are especially good ) .
And that 's it .
Obsession - worthy , no ?
Almost enough to distract me from the game taking place just a short 27 hours and 8 minutes from now .
Almost .
So now if you 'll excuse me , I have some incantations to do .
DEUTSCHLAND !!!!!!

Scientists predicted today that the BP oil spill has a 61 - 80 percent chance of reaching South Florida .
Unlike the west coast , which is likely to not be affected at all , the Florida Keys , Ft. Lauderdale and Miami have " a greater probability
due to the potential influence of the Loop Current , " according to a new report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
The NOAA came to its conclusion by considering 500 different prediction models , assuming a 90 - day oil flow rate of 33,000 barrels
per day .
" If oil were to reach South Florida , it could arrive in the form of pancakes of brown oil , streamers of pudding - like emulsified oil , or very thin sheen , " according to the report .
This is apparently supposed to be a good thing , but , it still sounds really foul .
The oil spill has been our scariest boogeyman this summer , other than those Wade - hungry Knicks of course , threatening every other week to spoil our summer vacation .
In May , everyone freaked out when tar balls washed up on the Keys .
Except they turned out to be totally passe tar balls not from the Gulf .
But this time it looks for real .
Take a look at this graphic .
The red represents those areas most likely to get hit .
That 's a 61 - 80 percent chance for South Florida .
On the other hand , the scientists write that the oil will have spent a good amount of time degrading and dispersing in the ocean so the most we should get are gross tar balls or scattered patches of " weathered oil . "
Yes , that is reassuring .
Have a good weekend !
[ via The Awl ]
Update :
The NOAA has released a clarifying statement : do n't panic yet !
" NOAA 's long - term projection model released yesterday focused on the possible
long - term shoreline threats , " the statement reads .
" Current conditions , especially given the absence of a significant amount of
Deepwater Horizon / BP oil from the loop current , indicate that immediate threats
to the Florida Keys , Miami and Ft. Lauderdale areas remain low . "
I still own two film cameras .
One is a Mamiya medium format camera .
The other is a 1950 Stereo Realist 35 mm 3 - D camera .
I ’ve been creating and consuming 3 - D content since I was young , using every technique I could learn about , including some that most people have never seen .
I ’m a proponent of 3 - D movies in theory , but am disappointed with most of the movies I ’ve seen in the format ’s current resurgence .
I have so many thoughts on the matter — including why I ’m fascinated by 3 - D , where I ’d like to see it go from here , and what I think of Roger Ebert ’s ( and others ’ ) anti-3 - D stance — that I ’ve considered purging them all in one giant post .
This is not that post .
This post is just about the single best 3 - D entertainment experience I ever had .
I enjoyed it in the comfort of my own home , and it did n’t cost very much money .
After watching the home video game console companies show off their 3 - D games at last week ’s Electronic Entertainment Expo , I thought I ’d write about it , because my best 3 - D experience was with 3 - D gaming .
Ten years ago , I purchased a pair of Elsa Revelator 3 - D Glasses for the PC .
It cost me $ 34 .
The glasses connected to the computer with a thin wire that ran to a pass - through plug between the graphics card and the monitor .
Combined with special software , it could turn any existing hardware - accelerated game into a true 3D experience using active shutter technology .
A quick definition of active shutter technology : an liquid crystal lens over each eye flickers between clear and opaque in sync with images onscreen that are rendered slightly offset for each eye .
As long as the monitor refreshes quickly enough , the flicker is not noticeable , although the screen appears a bit dim .
Since each eye only sees images rendered for one perspective , the brain perceives the image as 3 - D .
The first game I played in 3 - D was Tomb Raider ( natch ) .
The border of my monitor suddenly became a window , and I was looking into Lara Croft ’s world .
She became a fully rounded Barbie - sized figure running around a tiny landscape , firing at enemies .
It was amazing .
There were some glitches with the technology — occasional flashes of light when the glasses would lose sync with the monitor , and odd 3 - D artifacts where ripples in a pond were supposed to refract light — but I could see the potential in 3 - D gaming already .
The glasses came packaged with a demo version of a game I ’d never heard of called “ Thief 2 . ”
This was the game that blew me away .
Unlike Tomb Raider , where you see your character on screen , Thief 2 is played in first person perspective .
Your character is a thief and , unlike most other games , you do n’t just run around shooting enemies as quickly as you can .
The idea is to be sneaky .
You hide in the shadows , avoid being seen , and creep around villages and castles to complete each level .
I sat in front of the computer with 3 - D glasses on and room lights off .
I wore headphones for total immersion , and the game used sound to great effect .
My character ’s footsteps were often the only sounds I heard as I snuck around the virtual landscape .
But if I listened carefully , I could hear when a guard was coming so I could make sure I would n’t be caught .
In 3 - D , the hallways and streets had depth .
Buildings had form .
It really felt like I was there , sneaking around .
It felt almost real .
Here ’s a sample of gameplay :
I purchased the full version of the game and played it from start to finish over the next couple weeks .
I ’m not that much of a gamer , but I ’d never had a gaming experience that made my heart race so much , that really transported me into the game world .
I ’ve played virtual reality games with headgear - mounted goggles and motion tracking , but this was so much better .
I still remember clearly a level late in the game where I had to walk across a rafter high above the ground .
When I looked down , I could actually see the distance I would fall to the floor below if I slipped .
In 2 - D , the thin beam of wood I was standing on would have been on the same plane as everything else on the screen .
But this felt like a real beam of wood high above a real floor .
I ’d never been so nervous playing a game as I was in that moment .
I wanted to tell everyone to get these glasses .
Why on Earth would anyone play games the old flat way ?
This is how games should be played !
This should be mainstream !
Why were n’t the video game consoles of the time making games that would work with the same technology ?
The answer , in part , is that standard televisions did n’t have a high enough refresh rate to make the experience worthwhile .
A slower refresh rate makes the flickering of active shutter glasses noticeable , which is very unpleasant .
So 3 - D games in home consoles would have to wait .
And now they ’re coming .
New TVs have high refresh rates , and console makers are taking advantage of that .
The 3 - D glasses no longer need to be tethered by a thin wire .
They stay in sync wirelessly .
But now that the technology has caught up , I ’m not so sure everyone else will have the same amazing experience I had .
When I played Thief 2 , I was a bachelor living by myself .
I could turn out the lights , sit a couple feet from the screen , and totally immerse myself in the game without anyone caring .
I think that ’s a big reason why I was so sucked in .
With a game console , the TV often sits on the other side of the living room , rather than right in front of your face .
At that distance , the depth is a cool effect , but not an all - encompassing experience ( unless it ’s a very large TV ) .
I predict that people will respond to 3 - D games in a segmented way depending on their circumstances .
People who play alone without worrying about being antisocial will become immersed in first person shooters ; they will be transported into the world of the game .
People who play more socially or further from the screen will benefit from 3 - D in a more subtle way ; their experience will be similar to getting a new game console that can render graphics more realistically .
It will be a cool special effect , but not a whole new way of experiencing a game .
With the high cost of today ’s wireless 3 - D glasses , and the reluctance people may have to sit around wearing dark glasses indoors , I ’m not optimistic that 3 - D games will be huge any time soon outside the “ bachelor ” demographic .
Ten years after my experience with Thief 2 , I still think of it as a benchmark for what 3 - D gaming can be .
But perhaps someone will come up with some new and unexpected use of 3 - D in video games that will make me realize that Thief 2 was just a beginning , and that my experience ten years ago was the tip of the iceberg .
( I ’m excited to see what ’s offered for Nintendo ’s upcoming 3 - D glasses - free handheld console .
I suspect that the 3 - D screen is too small to really immerse you like I was with Thief 2 , but is small enough that it could be used as an effective window into another world .
The device is only experienced by one person at a time by design , and I think all these factors could inspire some very creative game experiences . )
Incidentally , while the Elsa Revelator glasses are no longer available , nVidia does sell a similar product ( although it ’s unfortunately more expensive ) .
But if you ’re a PC gamer , I highly recommend you give them a try .
Playing Head - To - Head Texas hold ’em
Texas hold ’em all in strategy and related problems
Andrew Beal is a billionaire who made his fortune in banking and related ventures .
While he is not a mathematician he has a conjecture named after him , the Beal Conjecture .
Today I want to talk not about his conjecture , but his adventures playing Texas hold ’em against some of the best players in the world .
I believe there is an interesting property of this poker game that should be studied more carefully .
Okay , I guess I should at least state his conjecture .
Beal ’s conjecture is a generalization of Fermat ’s Last Theorem .
If
where , , , , and are positive integers and the exponents , and are all greater than , then , and must have a non-trivial common factor .
The classic Fermat ’s Last Theorem is the special case when .
I believe it is still open , and Beal is offering a $ 100,000 prize for its resolution .
I say , “ I believe , ” since there are many claims and counter - claims on this conjecture .
So before you start to work hard to get the prize please check and be sure the problem is still open .
This problem is definitely one an amateur could solve — I can imagine two approaches .
You might find an elementary argument that proves if there is a solution where have no non-trivial common factor , then .
This would yield a proof that there are no solutions — in a sense Andrew Wiles would have done all the hard work .
Another possible approach is to find a counter - example .
I suspect a naive brute force search is unlikely to succeed , but a small insight and enough computer time could find a counter - example .
An example of this is Leonhard Euler in 1732 showed that
This proved that not all Fermat numbers were primes .
Euler did not do this by brute search : he proved a simple lemma about the possible divisors of such Fermat Numbers .
In particular , he proved every factor of is of the form .
This greatly helped his search , since all the calculations were done by hand .
Let ’s move from number theory to probability theory and poker .
Texas hold ’em
One of the most popular poker games these days is Texas hold ’em .
It is played in dorm rooms , on - line , and there are many big money tournaments on ESPN .
I believe the interest in the game is driven by its simple rules , by the amount of money available to winners of the major tournaments , and by the feeling that somehow : the game is not that “ hard ” to play well .
I will not give the complete rules of Texas hold ’em here , since there are so many good descriptions on - line .
See here for one .
Here is a quote explaining the game at a high level :
Texas hold ’em is a variation of the standard card game of poker .
The game consists of two cards being dealt face down to each player and then five community cards being placed by the dealer — a series of three ( “ the flop ” ) then two additional single cards ( “ the turn ” and “ the river ” ) , with players having the option to check , bet or fold after each deal , i.e. betting may occur prior to the flop , “ on the flop , ” “ on the turn , ” and “ on the river . ”
I have played poker over the years for tiny stakes , really tiny .
I started a standing game at Yale , then one at Berkeley , and finally one at Princeton .
We played “ dealer ’s choice , ” and allowed lots of strange and crazy games : from hi-low games to games with names like anaconda , 727 , and others with names I no longer even remember .
Let me recall one fun hand that happened at Yale .
Stan Eisenstat was sitting to my right and he was the only player in a large pot against another player — I will call X .
The game was a crazy form of stud with individual face - down and face - up cards , and with the following property : we each passed cards at the beginning to our neighbors .
In this case I had received three cards from Stan .
He was showing a very strong hand — it looked like he could have four kings .
Player X was showing a possible straight flush :
While I was out of this game , I knew that Stan knew that X could not have the straight flush .
I knew this since the key card the was one that Stan had passed to me at the beginning of the game .
The card was in the discard pile — it could not be in X ’s hand .
Theorem .
Stan finally called a large raise of X and they both showed their hands .
Of course X had a flush , but not a straight flush .
And Stan did have his four kings .
Stan was happy as he raked in the pot , and said something about how he thought X was bluffing .
I looked at Stan and said , “ you passed me the key card , do n’t you remember ? ”
Stan said no , he had forgotten .
Oh well .
That ’s why we are not professional card players .
Beal Plays The Pros
Beal likes to play Texas hold ’em and wanted to see how well he could do against the world ’s best players .
Eventually , he worked out a plan : the best players in Las Vegas formed a “ team ” and Beal played one of the team members in head - to - head hold ’em .
After a while another team member would take over , but Beal played on alone .
These matches happened over a period of time ; often Beal would fly into Vegas , play for a day or two and then go back to Dallas .
There were two reasons for the team setup .
Beal wanted to play very high stakes — recall he is a billionaire — and he felt that the large stakes would favor him .
The pros played serious poker , but never for the type of stakes Beal wanted .
So Beal hoped the large stakes might take them out of their comfort - zone .
For another , Beal wanted to play head - to - head .
He was afraid if he played several of them at once , they might be able to gang up on him .
They could even cheat him — it would only take a very small amount of information moving from one player to another to make the game unfair .
Beal turned out to be a very strong player , but the pros were some of the best in the world .
He won some money , lost some money , and again won some money .
But finally the team prevailed and won a ton of money , and he gave up poker — although not forever .
There is a fun book on Beal and the pros written by Michael Craig — it is called “ The Professor , the Banker , and the Suicide King : Inside the Richest Poker Game of All Time . ”
Alice Plays Bob
Since we do not have real money to play the pros we will consider what happens when Alice and Bob play Texas hold ’em .
Imagine that Bob is invited to play a head - to - head match of Texas hold ’em with Alice .
She is a professional poker player , and worse she is a world champion at hold ’em .
Does Bob have any chance at all in winning ?
Let ’s be precise and state the rules they will be using for betting .
Each hand the ante for each player will be one chip , and they will each start with chips .
The betting is no -limit : the player ’s bets are limited only by the amount of money they have in front of them .
The match is over when one player gets all the chips .
Note , I have stipulated a simple ante rather than the “ blind bets ” actually used in hold ’em .
This simplifies the discussion without greatly changing the results .
The surprise , I think , is that Bob can follow a strategy which will make sure that Alice will win less much than of the time — even though Bob is a weak player .
At the world championship level to have a reasonable chance of winning is cool — I think .
There is nothing like this for other games : in chess Bob would be killed , in Backgammon he would very likely lose , the same holds for Bridge or Scrabble , or almost any reasonable game .
But not for Texas hold ’em .
Ken Regan pointed out that a book on poker by James McManus has a chapter on this very issue .
A Strategy
Theorem :
For a match of head - to - head Texas hold ’em there is a simple strategy that wins with probability against any player , where is independent of .
Here is a sketch of the proof .
Bob plays the following simple strategy .
Every hand he bets all his chips — in poker terms he “ goes all in . ”
He may for our analysis even tell her that is his strategy — and does n’t mind always betting first even though that is a major disadvantage in non-extreme poker betting strategies .
Clearly each hand Alice has a simple choice : she can either call Bob ’s bet or fold her hand .
Consider the first hand .
Alice is dealt some hand .
She can calculate the probability will win and decide whether or not to go all in .
If she does , then the match is over — either Bob or Alice wins .
Actually , there always is a small chance of a tie in Texas hold ’em , so there is a chance they will essentially start the match over .
Alice could also look at the hand and decide to fold .
In this case Bob now has chips and Alice .
Then , they go on to the next hand and Alice has the same decision to make .
The key insight is that no matter what hand Alice finally decides to call Bob with there is a positive probability that Bob will win .
An interesting open problem is , what is the exact probability that Bob wins with best play by Alice ?
The task of computing is compounded by the fact that once Alice folds and Bob has more chips than Alice , an all - in bet that Bob loses will no longer end the match .
Bob need only bet as much as Alice ’s stack to put Alice all - in , and he will still have the chips by which he was leading .
Thus even if Alice wins the first played hand , Bob could still get back in the match and win with a series of doubling wins with his remaining chips .
This is more of a complication than enumerating the possible hands and their win probabilities ( even taking ties into account ) , for which published computer analyses are available .
Another point is that , Bob is not revealing any information by his strategy .
His play is the same all the time .
He might as well choose to do this blind , without looking at his cards , and the probability would still be the same .
So whatever Alice ’s mind reading skills maybe , they are futile with Bob ’s strategy .
Even more , Bob is probably best if he avoids looking at his cards .
Since he is a weak player he may have a “ tell ” that gives Alice information , so he best not even knowing his actual cards .
Alice ’s Problem Generalized and Simplified
Here is a simplified problem that is related to Alice ’s dilemma .
Imagine there are possible hands she can be dealt .
The hands have the probability of occurring
Of course
Each hand also has a probability of winning .
Note , the values do not sum to one .
Also we assume that each : that is there is no hand that is always a winner .
Finally we stipulate now that a single win by Alice wins the match , even if Bob has chips left over .
The problem Alice faces is this .
She gets hands with the given probability distribution and must decide when to bet .
Given she will only see hands at most what is her optimal strategy ?
Note , this generalizes Texas hold ’em , but it ignores the issue of chip stack sizes .
Open Problems
Find the exact value of from the theorem .
Also solve the problem outlined in the last section .
What is the best strategy for Alice ?
It reminds me of other on - line decision problems such as the Online Secretary Problem , but seems to be different .
Frameworks
OK , so I 'm a little biased here as I currently make extensive use of Django and organise the Django User Group in London so bear that in mind when reading the following .
Start with Django because it 's a great gateway drug .
Lots of documentation and literature , a very active community of people to talk to and lots of example code around the web .
That 's a completely non-technical reason .
Pylons is probably purer in terms of Python philosophy ( being much more a collection of discrete bits and pieces ) but lots of the technical stuff is personal preference , at least until you get into Python more .
Compare the very active Django tag on Stack Overflow with that of pylons or turbogears though and I 'd argue getting started is simply easier with Django irrespective of anything to do with code .
Personally I default to Django , but find that an increasing amount of time I actually opt for writing using simpler micro frameworks ( think Sinatra rather than Rails ) .
Lots of things to choose from ( good list here , http://fewagainstmany.com/blog/python-micro-frameworks-are-all-the-rage).
I tend to use MNML ( because I wrote parts of it and it 's tiny ) but others are actively developed .
I tend to do this for small , stupid web services which are then strung together with a Django project in the middle serving people .
Worth noting here is appengine .
You have to work within it 's limitations and it's not designed for everything but it's a great way to just play with Python and get something up and working quickly .
It makes a great testbed for learning and experimentation .
Mongo / ORM
On the MongoDB front you 'll likely want to look at the basic python mongo library ( http://api.mongodb.org/python/ ) first to see if it has everything you need .
If you really do want something a little more ORM like then mongoengine ( http://hmarr.com/mongoengine/) might be what you 're looking for .
A bunch of folks are also working on making Django specifically integrate more seamlessly with nosql backends .
Some of that is for future Django releases , but django - norel ( http://www.allbuttonspressed.com/projects/django-nonrel) has code now .
For relational data SQLAlchemy ( http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is good if you want something standalone .
Django's ORM is also excellent if you 're using Django .
API
The most official Oauth library is python - oauth2 ( http://github.com/simplegeo/python-oauth2), which handily has a Django example as part of it's docs .
Piston ( http://bitbucket.org/jespern/django-piston/wiki/Home) is a Django app which provides lots of tools for building APIs .
It has the advantage of being pretty active and well maintained and in production all over the place .
Other projects exist too , including Dagny ( http://zacharyvoase.github.com/dagny/)
which is an early attempt to create something akin to RESTful resources in Rails .
In reality any Python framework ( or even just raw WSGI code ) should be reasonably good for this sort of task .
Testing
Python has unittest as part of it's standard library , and unittest2 is in python 2.7 ( but backported to previous versions too http://pypi.python.org/pypi/unittest2/0.1.4).
Some people also like Nose ( http://code.google.com/p/python-nose/), which is an alternative test runner with some additional features .
Twill ( http://twill.idyll.org/) is also nice , it 's a " a simple scripting language for Web browsing " , so handy for some functional testing .
Freshen ( http://github.com/rlisagor/freshen) is a port of cucumber to Python .
I have n't yet gotten round to using this in anger , but a quick look now suggests it 's much better than when I last looked .
I actually also use Ruby for high level testing of Python apps and apis because I love the combination of celerity and cucumber .
But I 'm weird and get funny looks from other Python people for this .
Message Queues
For a message queue , whatever language I 'm using , I now always use RabbitMQ .
I 've had some success with stompserver in the past but Rabbit is awesome .
Do n't worry that it's not itself written in Python , neither is PostgresSQL , Nginx or MongoDB - all for good reason .
What you care about are the libraries available .
What you 're looking for here is py- amqplib ( http://barryp.org/software/py-amqplib/)
which is a low level library for talking amqp ( the protocol for talking to rabbit as well as other message queues ) .
I 've also used Carrot ( http://github.com/ask/carrot/), which is easier to get started with and provides a nicer API .
Think bunny in Ruby if you 're familiar with that .
Environment
Whatever bits and pieces you decide to use from the Python ecosystem I 'd recommend getting to who pip and virtualenv ( http://clemesha.org/blog/2009/jul/05/modern-python-hacker-tools-virtualenv-fabric-pip/
- note that fabric is also cool , but not essential and these docs are out of date on that tool ) .
Think about using Ruby without gem , bundler or rvm and you 'll be in the right direction .
ANALYSIS / OPINION :
The Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) is seeking ways to “ reinvent ” journalism , and that ’s a cause for concern .
According to a May 24 draft proposal , the agency thinks government should be at the center of a media overhaul .
The bureaucracy sees it as a problem that the Internet has introduced a wealth of information options to consumers , forcing media companies to adapt and experiment to meet changing market needs .
FTC ’s policy staff fears this new reality .
“ There are reasons for concern that experimentation may not produce a robust and sustainable business model for commercial journalism , ” the report states .
With no faith that the market will work things out for the better , government thinks it must come to the rescue .
The ideas being batted around to save the industry share a common theme :
They are designed to empower bureaucrats , not consumers .
For instance , one proposal would , “ Allow news organizations to agree jointly on a mechanism to require news aggregators and others to pay for the use of online content , perhaps through the use of copyright licenses . ”
In other words , government policy would encourage a tax on websites like the Drudge Report , a must - read source for the news links of the day , so that the agency can redistribute the funds collected to various newspapers .
Such a tax would hit other news aggregators , such as Digg , Fark and Reddit , which not only gather links , but provide a forum for a lively and entertaining discussion of the issues raised by the stories .
Fostering a robust public - policy debate , not saving a particular business model , should be the goal of journalism in the first place .
The report also discusses the possibility of offering tax exemptions to news organizations , establishing an AmeriCorps for reporters and creating a national fund for local news organizations .
The money for those benefits would come from a suite of new taxes .
A 5 percent tax on consumer electronic devices such as iPads , Kindles and laptops that let consumers read the news could be used to encourage people to keep reading the dead - tree version of the news .
Other taxes might be levied on the radio and television spectrum , advertising and cell phones .
The conflict of interest in having the government pay or contribute to a newsman ’s salary could not be more obvious .
Reporters and columnists would have little incentive to offer critical analyses of tax increases that might mean a boost in the pocketbook .
Once Congress has the power to fund the news , it can at any time attach “ strings ” designed to promote certain viewpoints - in the name of fairness , of course .
Each year at budget time , the Fourth Estate would scramble to be worthy in the eyes of Capitol Hill for increased support .
It is hardly a surprise that the heavily subsidized National Public Radio frequently presents issues in a way favorable to Washington ’s tax - and - spend agenda .
Self - respecting journalists must reject this tempting government bribe as the FTC brings its proposals to a round - table discussion scheduled for June 15 .
When it comes to the media , consumers lose most when government suppresses innovation in the name of “ saving ” old business models .

( CNN ) --
Do n't panic , but we 're running out of internet addresses .
Not domain names -- those website names that you see at the top of this page and which always start with some semblance of " http : / / " and " www . "
We 've got plenty of those .
But , according to statements from prominent internet thinkers this week , we may run out of internet protocol -- or IP -- addresses in less than a year .
IP addresses are numbers assigned to all of the devices -- computers , phones , cars , wireless sensors , etc. -- that log on to the internet .
According to the blog ReadWriteWeb , the internet is changing and evolving so quickly -- with so many new types of devices connecting -- that we 're running out of numbers to assign to all of these Web - enabled electronics .
" The main reason for the concern ?
There 's an explosion of data about to happen to the Web thanks largely to sensor data , smart grids , RFID and other Internet of Things data , " Richard MacManus writes on that site .
" Other reasons include the increase in mobile devices connecting to the Internet and the annual growth in user - generated content on the Web . "
Only 4 billion internet addresses are possible under the current system , and those will all be exhausted in less than a year , John Curran , president and CEO of the American Registry for Internet Numbers , told ReadWriteWeb .
In a recent statement on YouTube , internet luminary and Google exec Vinton Cerf makes a similar prediction .
" We are at a cusp , I think , in the IP address space for internet , " he said , noting that , if nothing changes , a " black market " for these internet addresses may develop .
So what should we do about this numbers shortage ?
Well , make more numbers for starters .
Our current system for assigning IP addresses , which look like a series of four numbers with periods between them , can only handle 32 bits of data .
But , to accommodate the sprawling nature of the Web , internet researchers are working on a new version of the system -- called IP v6 , for " version six " -- which would allow many more IP addresses , with each holding 128 bits of info .
On The Atlantic 's website , Alexis Madrigal writes that the situation is somewhat similar to what phone companies faced in the 1980s and 1990s :
We ran out of new phone numbers , so we had to add digits .
" The problem is essentially the same : you only have so many unique slots , and those slots eventually run out as phone numbers proliferate , " he writes .
But the current situation has proven more technically complicated than that .
Researchers have been working on IP v6 for more than a decade , but according to reports on the matter , adoption has been slow .
Now , some writers are comparing the situation to Y2 K .
They say we need to act now to shift to the new system or the internet might stop working .
Madrigal , for one , says he 's optimistic the internet wo n't break because of a lack of IP address numbers .
" There are undoubtedly a swarm of issues leading to IPv6 underdeployed , " he writes .
" But that 's actually good news because it means there will be plenty of ways to fix the problem when everyone swings into action . "
The ACTA negotiators from the Commission came to the European Parliament today , to inform the Parliament about what happened in the last round of negotiations in Luzern .
However , the meeting where the information was to be given was declared ” in camera ” , i.e. : closed to the public .
At the meeting , I asked if this meant that there were restrictions on how the information given could be used and spread .
At first the Commission seemed unwilling to answer this question with a straight yes or no , but after I had repeated the question a number of times , they finally came out and said that I would not be allowed to spread the information given .
I then left the meeting , since I am not prepared to accept information given under such conditions in this particular case .
There is no sensible reason why the ACTA negotiations should be carried out in secret , or why Members of the European Parliament should not be allowed to discuss information about ACTA with their constituents .
The ACTA agreement is about introducing stricter legislation to enforce intellectual property rights such as copyright and patents .
I find the lack of transparency surrounding these negotiations completely unacceptable .
In a democracy , new laws should be made by the elected representatives after an open public debate .
They should not be negotiated behind closed doors by unelected officials at the Commission , in an attempt to keep the citizens out of the process until it is too late .
According Article 218( 10 ) of the Lisbon Treaty , the Commission has a duty to keep the European Parliament ” immediately and fully informed at all stages of the procedure ” .
To give oral information in a closed meeting , with no documents at all handed out , hardly qualifies as keeping the Parliament ” fully informed ” .
It is obvious that the Commission has no intention of living up to its obligations under the Treaty when it comes to informing the Parliament .
That is disgraceful .

Il nostro Premier non ama la Rete e questo non è né un mistero né una notizia .
Perché mai , d’altra parte , il Signore dell ’ oligopolio dell ’ informazione italiana ed il Re del TELE - COMANDO dovrebbe guardare anche solo con interesse ad uno strumento come la Rete che consente a chiunque di dire la sua a pochi click di distanza dal sito internet di RAI UNO che pubblica i video promo del prode Minzolini ?
In un mondo che guarda al web – eccezion fatta per qualche regime totalitario – come ad una straordinaria risorsa democratica ed ad un diritto fondamentale dell ’ uomo e del cittadino , la radicale assenza , da parte di questo Governo , di qualsivoglia politica dell ’ innovazione è di per sé un fatto preoccupante .
Difficile sentirsi sereni e cittadini di un Paese moderno quando il Sottosegretario alla Presidenza del Consiglio , Gianni Letta – mentre il resto d’Europa investe milioni di euro per promuovere la diffusione della banda larga per uscire dalla crisi – ti dice che noi investiremo in banda larga solo dopo che – non è dato sapere come – saremo usciti dalla crisi o , piuttosto , quando il Ministro dell ’
Innovazione nel promuovere un progetto vecchio di cinque anni e anti-innovativo come la PEC , destinata a far la gioia solo di Poste Italiane aggiudicataria – non certo a sorpresa – di una concessione da 50 milioni di euro l’anno , lo battezza “ la più grande rivoluzione culturale mai prodotta in questo Paese ” nonché “ la migliore riforma italiana dal dopoguerra ad oggi ” .
Negli ultimi mesi , tuttavia , sta accadendo qualcosa di più .
C’è un disegno nel Palazzo che ha per obiettivo quello di imbavagliare anche l’informazione libera online e consegnare la Rete nelle mani dei Signori dell ’ informazione di un tempo perché la utilizzino come una grande TV .
Nessuna teoria complottista ma solo l’analisi dei fatti .
L’ormai celebre – nel senso dello strangolatore di Boston e non certo di un premio nobel per la pace – DDL intercettazioni , tra le tante disposizioni liberticida , contiene un art .
29 che estende a tutti i gestori di siti informatici – e dunque all ’intera blogosfera italiana – l’obbligo di rettifica previsto dalla vecchia legge sulla Stampa datata 1948 e scritta dai padri costituenti quando Internet non esisteva neppure nell ’immaginario degli scrittori di fantascienza .
All ’indomani dell ’approvazione del DDL , se un blogger ricevuta una richiesta di rettifica non provvederà entro 48 ore sarà passibile di una sanzione pecuniaria fino a 12 mila e 500 euro : una pena accettabile per un editore tradizionale ma di gran lunga superiore agli utili di un lustro di uno dei tanti blog che popolano la blogosfera italiana , garantendo quell ’ informazione libera che solo pochi giornali e poche TV hanno potuto e saputo sin qui assicurare .
Il malcelato obiettivo perseguito dal Palazzo con questa disposizione , ancora una volta , non ha niente a che vedere con la tutela della privacy dei cittadini e risponde , piuttosto , alla finalità di disincentivare i non professionisti dell ’informazione ad occuparsi di informazione in modo tale che , anche nell ’era di internet , l ’informazione , in Italia , possa essere controllata esercitando pressioni politiche ed economiche su un numero quanto più limitato possibile di persone .
Nei giorni scorsi due emendamenti al comma 29 dell ’art .
1 del DDL intercettazioni presentati , in Commissione Giustizia alla Camera , al fine di “ ammorbidire ” l’impatto della disposizione sull ’ecosistema Internet , sono stati , addirittura , dichiarati – del tutto inspiegabilmente – inammissibili dal Presidente , Giulia Bongiorno .
La Rete ha reagito con una lettera aperta indirizzata al Presidente Fini ed a tutti i deputati italiani , ma , naturalmente , le chance che il testo del comma 29 venga modificato nella discussione in aula appaiono prossime allo zero .
Frattanto – ed è proprio questa coincidenza e sovrapposizione di eventi a non consentire più di giustificare quanto sta accadendo sulla base del fatto che il Palazzo sia abitato da dinosauri che non conoscono la Rete – l ’Autorità per le Garanzie nelle comunicazioni ha pubblicato , nell ’ambito di una consultazione pubblica , gli schemi di due Regolamenti volti a disciplinare la diffusione di contenuti audiovisivi a mezzo internet in ossequio all ’ormai famoso Decreto Romani .
Tutte le web tv ed i video blogger italiani , in forza degli emanandi regolamenti , dovranno chiedere all ’Agcom un’autorizzazione – o almeno indirizzarle una dichiarazione di inizio attività - , versare 3000 euro per il rimborso delle spese di istruttoria ( quali ? ) e , soprattutto , finiranno assoggettati , tra gli altri al solito obbligo di rettifica , sempre entro 48 ore e sempre sotto la minaccia di una sanzione fino a 12 mila e 500 euro .
L’obiettivo dell ’ultimo scellerato progetto di Palazzo sembra evidente : ora che il Cavaliere si accinge a sbarcare in Rete avendone forse , almeno , subodorato le enormi potenzialità , la vuole tutta per lui , per i suoi amici e per i soli suoi nemici che ha , comunque , la garanzia di poter controllare almeno in termini economici .

I do think that Matt Hertenstein and colleagues came up with an eye catching title here :
Hertenstein , M. , C. Hansel , et al. ( 2009 ) .
" Smile intensity in photographs predicts divorce later in life . "
Motivation and Emotion 33 ( 2 ) : 99-105 . [ Abstract / Full Text ] [ Free Full Text ]
Abstract : Based on social - functional accounts of emotion , we conducted two studies examining whether the degree to which people smiled in photographs predicts the likelihood of divorce .
Along with other theorists , we posited that smiling behavior in photographs is potentially indicative of underlying emotional dispositions that have direct and indirect life consequences .
In the first study , we examined participants ' positive expressive behavior in college yearbook photos and in Study 2 we examined a variety of participants ' photos from childhood through early adulthood .
In both studies , divorce was predicted by the degree to which subjects smiled in their photos .
Obviously there are many other factors also involved in whether someone will get divorced or not !
However the effects were pretty strong with the 10 % with most intense smiles only having a fifth the chance of getting divorced compared with the least smiling 10 % .
Other research has pointed in the same sort of direction , so Sonja Lyubomirsky and colleagues have argued convincingly that greater happiness is not only caused partly by doing well in different areas of one 's life , it is also a cause of doing well in different life areas - including relationships .
There 's also the " associative mating " argument - happy people tend to marry other happy people .
There 's the finding that , when interpersonal difficulties do arise , optimists seem more able to sort things out constructively - seeing things positively can often make them more likely to be so .
And even research showing that emotions are " infectious " .
Actually Hertenstein's main research work is more on touch than on smiling .
See his " Touch and emotion lab " with its useful series of fascinating freely downloadable full text research studies including one I particularly like entitled " The communicative functions of touch in humans , non-human primates and rats : A review and synthesis of the empirical research " .
Since first writing this blog post a further fascinating research study has emerged :
Defense Minister Ehud Barak met with the US secretary of defense , Robert gates , at the Pentagon and discussed with him kidnapped soldier Gilad Shalit .
" A million and a half people are living in Gaza , but only one of them is really in need of humanitarian aid , " Barak said .
He also told Gates there was immediate importance to the blockade on the Strip .
" The US understands and supports the steps Israel is taking in Gaza , " Barak said after leaving the meeting .

Want to generate innovation ?
Build a hub to make it happen .
The U.S. Department of Energy is embarking on an ambitious plan to speed up energy innovation with a $ 122 million cash injection for an Energy Innovation Hub in California .
Dubbed the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis , the research center will do exactly as its name suggests –develop a solar energy fuel conversion system through artificial photosynthesis and bring it to commercialization .
The DOE has selected an all - star team of researchers to get the hub going .
Participants include researchers from Cal Tech , Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory , and the University of California , Irvine .
The project will probably take a long time to get going –solar fuels have lagged in research and development for years , and bringing them into widespread use will take a concerted effort .
The DOE hints at the magnitude of the scientists ’ undertaking :
JCAP research will be directed at the discovery of the functional
components necessary to assemble a complete artificial photosynthetic
system : light absorbers , catalysts , molecular linkers , and separation
membranes .
The Hub will then integrate those components into an
operational solar fuel system and develop scale - up strategies to move
from the laboratory toward commercial viability .
The ultimate objective
is to drive the field of solar fuels from fundamental research , where
it has resided for decades , into applied research and technology
development , thereby setting the stage for the creation of a direct
solar fuels industry .
Ambitious , yes , but the DOE is confident that the Innovation Hub model could work for a variety of projects .
Oak Ridge National Laboratory is already working on a nuclear reactor hub , and a third hub will focus on radically improving energy efficiency .

SCHENECTADY --
To hear an ailing 82 - year - old Thomas Edison speak , with the great inventor 's voice , wheezy and high - pitched , growing husky and choked as he praised his good friend Henry Ford who stood alongside President Herbert Hoover on a stage on Oct. 21 , 1929 is catching lightning in a bottle .
Earlier that night , the crowd heard Albert Einstein offering words of praise for Edison in German from Berlin .
It is contained in one of the world 's oldest surviving radio broadcasts , recorded on an obscure machine that General Electric developed in 1922 and called a pallophotophone -- which means " shaking light sound " in Greek .
Listening to the elderly Edison lose his place , become confused and nearly weep over the depth of his admiration for Ford more than 80 years after he spoke those heartfelt words to a live audience has the power to cause a lump to rise in one 's throat .
This aural treasure might have remained lost in history 's silent dustbin were it not for a curious archivist , a dogged engineer and a fixer .
The unlikely resurrection story began when archivist Chris Hunter grew curious about 13 undocumented film canisters tucked away on a bottom shelf among 5 million items in the basement archives of the Schenectady Museum & Suits - Bueche Planetarium .
Hunter had no idea what they contained , aside from a few vague jottings that indicated they involved radio programs from the 1920s .
There was an even bigger obstacle to solving the mystery .
He had no machine that could play them .
He might as well have been looking at ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics .
The canisters were not going to give up easily their mute secrets .
Enter John Schneiter , a former GE engineer and holder of 16 patents , who was taking a tour of the museum and its archives while being wooed as a trustee .
Hunter shared with Schneiter his interest in the long - forgotten film canisters and dilemma in trying to crack the code .
It had already stumped sound engineers and technology experts Hunter had contacted .
Schneiter knew who to draft for the assignment , his old co-worker , Russ DeMuth , an engineer at the GE Global Research Center in Niskayuna and a technology expert some have likened to a latter - day " wizard of Menlo Park . "
DeMuth is no slouch in the patent department himself , with seven patents and four pending .
The two worked together in the control systems lab at GE for many years and had their hands in everything from research on jet engine and wind turbine blades to charging stations for electric hybrid vehicles .
DeMuth accepted the challenge to try to unlock the film canister mystery .
Using modern digital equipment and tinkering for hundreds of hours spread out across two years of nights and weekends , he created what is believed to be the only functional pallophotophone in the world .
With that , the trio magically loosed Edison 's voice , which had essentially been frozen in time for more than 80 years .
They lost their way plenty of times during the project , but never their faith .
DeMuth is not only brilliant , he also happens to be very stubborn .
What he eventually fashioned was so original they did n't know quite what to call it .
They settled on " the Gizmotron . "
The pallophotophone was a technology developed by GE engineer Charles Hoxie in the early 1920s and it bridged the gap between cinema 's silent era and " talkies . "
The big , boxy recorder used 35 mm sprocketless film , with each strip containing a series of eight to10 parallel soundtracks etched on acetate and nitrate film .
It used light bouncing off a tiny mirror to expose each strip of film and to capture the sound .
DeMuth had very little to work with , aside from a few archival photographs of the original machine .
He had to scour eBay for old film reels and other long - out - of - production parts to build his device .
He was not at all confident of its functionality .
Using modern motors and computer controls , DeMuth cobbled together a machine that used a photo transistor in place of a photoelectric cell that read the recordings originally .
" We did n't know whether this thing was going to work at all , " DeMuth recalled .
" We were prepared not to hear anything . "
When Edison 's newly digitized voice rose , Lazarus - like , from a computer speaker , it was a Eureka moment for the three collaborators .
" I got goose bumps when I heard it , " Schneiter said .
" Our jaws just dropped , " DeMuth said .
The canisters 's 20 hours of radio broadcasts were first heard on WGY radio station in Schenectady between 1929 and 1931 .
Several feature Edison , the GE founder and holder of 1,093 patents , widely regarded as the greatest inventor of all - time and arguably called " the most influential figure of our millennium . "
There are other nuggets among the recordings , such as a portion of a high school basketball game believed to be the second oldest surviving sports broadcast and the earliest known recording of the famous NBC chimes .
In one of the recordings , Edison spoke about the creation of the incandescent light bulb on its 50th anniversary .
In his remarks for " Edison Light 's Golden Jubilee " program on Oct. 21 , 1929 in which he shared the stage with Hoover and Ford , Edison offered a stirring , emotional oratory even though he was nearly completely deaf and in declining health .
He died two years later , nearly to the day , at 84 .
" I am told that tonight my voice will reach out to the four corners of the world , " Edison said , his voice squeaky and thin , as he occasionally stumbled and lost his place .
" It is an unusual opportunity for me to express my deep appreciation and thanks to you for the countless evidences of your good will .
I thank you from the bottom of my heart .
" I would be embarrassed by the honors heaped upon me on this unforgettable night were it not for the fact in honoring me you are also honoring that vast army of thinkers and workers of the past and those who will carry on , without whom my work would have gone for nothing , " he said .
Edison might have added these names to that honor roll : Hunter , Schneiter , DeMuth .

Meerkats have " traditions " that are passed down through generations , according to scientists .
A research team from the University of Cambridge in the UK has studied the charismatic creatures in the southern Kalahari Desert .
Scientists studying the animals have noticed that " some meerkat groups consistently get up really early or really late " , explained Alex Thornton , a zoology researcher from the university 's Pembroke College , who led this study .
" When you 're out in the field , " said Dr Thornton , " if you 're studying certain groups , you always set your alarm a bit later because they 're consistently lazy . "
The new study revealed that this laziness or liveliness has a " cultural basis " .
The team studied populations with overlapping territories .
" Male meerkats leave their groups to breed , so there 's ' gene flow ' between groups , " Dr Thornton said .
This showed that the behaviour was unlikely to have a genetic basis .
" People have commonly assumed that human behaviour is culturally driven , whereas other species are much more genetically controlled , " said Dr Thornton .
" But this makes us rethink that picture . "
Choice of sleeping burrow did not affect what time the meerkats emerged .
" We tend to think of behaviour as adapted to local conditions , but there 's no way to predict , in terms of local ecology , what time they 'll get up , " said Dr Thornton .
The meerkats that emerged later in the morning seemed to mitigate the effects of their " laziness " by spending less time sunning , grooming and playing in the burrow before leaving to forage for food , said the researchers .

Urge Senate to Pass Firearms Excise Tax Reform Now
On June 29 , the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Firearms Excise Tax Improvement Act of 2010 ( HR 5552 ) by a vote of 412 to 6 .
The bill is now pending in the Senate .
This legislation corrects a longstanding inequity in the Internal Revenue Code by permitting firearm and ammunition manufacturers to pay the federal excise tax payment on a quarterly basis , like other industries that support conservation through a federal excise tax .
Currently , manufacturers pay this tax on a bi-weekly schedule , forcing many manufacturers to borrow money to ensure on - time payment .
Industry members spend thousands of man-hours administering the necessary paperwork to successfully complete the bi-weekly tax payments — monies that are due to the federal government long before manufacturers are paid by their customers .
This excise tax is the major revenue source of wildlife conservation in the United States .
This legislation will not increase the federal deficit , nor does it reduce the excise tax rate — it simply changes the payment schedule .
Call your senators today at 202-224-3121 and ask them to support Senate passage of H.R. 5552 before Congress adjourns for the summer .

Al - Shabaab Claim Responsibility for Uganda Blasts
Two blasts during the World Cup left 64 people , including one American , dead .
LONDON , July 12 , 2010 -- Among the at least 64 people killed in the two devastating blasts that tore through outdoor gatherings in Uganda where hundreds of soccer fans were in the midst of watching the World Cup final was 25 - year - old American Nate Henn .
Henn worked for a California - based children 's charity , Invisible Children , which helps former child soldiers in Uganda .
The selection of targets in the Ugandan capital of Kampala -- a restaurant and a sports field where people were watching the game on large - screen TVs -- ensured the bombs struck a broad mix of Ugandans and foreigners , including Americans .
The wounded were rushed to local hospitals , which were soon overwhelmed .
Fred Opolot , a Uganda Media Center spokesman , said , " The government of Uganda ladies and gentlemen does convey its condolences to the bereaved families and requests the public to remain calm under this situation , thank you very much . "
Police said initial signs indicated bombs had been placed under tables , though investigators had not yet ruled out suicide bombers .
" Right now it is too early to say we have suspects because it could be a suicide bomber or a time bomb , so it is too early to speculate and conclude that they were suicide bombers .
Let 's give time to our investigators .
They will be able to give us a full report of their findings , " Capt .
Judith Nabakooba , a police spokeswoman , said .
Al Shabaab , a fundemental Islamist group based in Somalia , today claimed responsibility for the attacks .
" We will carry out attacks against our enemy wherever they are , " Sheik Ali Mohamud Rage speaking from Mogadishu told The Associated Press .
" No one will deter us from performing our Islamic duty . "
Intelligence officials had previously told ABC News there 's evidence the attack was carried out by the Al Shabaab terror group .
During a recent trip inside Somalia for ABC News , we came face - to - face with Al Shabaab terrorists .
At a prison in the northern Somali capital of Bosasso , captured militants threw rocks and shouted angrily at us when they found out we were Americans .
When I asked one of them why people join Al Shabaab , accused terrorist Mohammad Amin Omar told me , " We 're fighting to bring Islamic law to their country , because we are Muslims and it is according to the Koran . "
Attack as Proof
Somali officials had long warned the group had both the ambition and ability to stage attacks outside Somalia .
This appears to be the proof .
Intelligence officials had been tracking a cell of suicide bombers targeting Uganda , as well as Kenya and Burundi , in retaliation for a new offensive launched against Al Shabaab led by the Somali government and supported by African peacekeepers .
All three of those countries are now on high alert .
What it sounds like to me is Bacterial Vaginosis ( BV ) .
Bacterial vaginosis ( BV ) is the name of a condition in women where the normal balance of bacteria in the vagina is disrupted and replaced by an overgrowth of bacteria .
It is sometimes accompanied by discharge , odor , pain , itching , or burning , and it can be painful during intercourse .
If you have seen doctors and they keep misdiagnosing her and none of them have mentioned ( BV ) I wouls ask to have a test done .
There are also a few other vaginal infections she could get tested very easily for to rule them out but her symptoms sounnd very much like ( BV ) .
The European Parliament has approved a deal placing new limits on bankers ' bonuses from next year .
Under the deal agreed by the EU members in June , bankers will receive no more than 30 % of their bonus immediately and in cash , a limit that falls to 20 % for larger bonuses .
Remaining payments will be deferred and linked to long - term performance .
Hedge funds will also be covered by the new rules .
But there will be no cap on what bankers can be paid .
In the wake of the bailout of banks across Europe , MEPs have taken aim at the huge bonuses paid to top performers , the BBC's Dominic Hughes in Strasbourg reports .
Some blamed the bonus culture for encouraging risky behaviour which in turn led to the financial crisis , our correspondent adds .
Under the new scheme , 40 % of a bonus must be deferred for between three and five years .
Half of the total bonus will be paid in the form of what is called " contingent capital " .
This is a kind of IOU from the bank that can then be turned into shares if it runs into trouble , our correspondent says .
As a result , bankers ' bonuses become much more closely tied to the health and actual performance of banks , he adds .
' End to risk - taking '
The new rules have been agreed by EU member states and the European Parliament , though MEPs now need to hold a formal vote .
The agreement includes proposals to link bonuses more closely to salaries and the long - term performance of the bank .
Large severance packages for departing executives will also be limited .
" These tough new rules on bonuses will transform the bonus culture and end incentives for excessive risk - taking , " says Arlene McCarthy , one MEP involved in negotiating the deal .
The limits will apply to all 27 EU members , although similar rules are already in place in countries including the UK .
Image caption London is home to 80 % of Europe 's hedge funds
However , the rules do not limit the size of bonuses that can be paid to bankers , only the proportions that must be paid in cash and shares , and the timing of those payments .
That reflects the agreement reached by the G20 countries last year , which fell short of imposing caps on the amounts bankers could be paid in bonuses .
The inclusion of hedge funds in the new European rules is likely to alarm many in the City of London , where 80 % of European funds are based .
Last month EU finance ministers agreed tougher regulation for the industry , despite objections from the UK government .
The EU 's plans are the latest sign of a tightening of global regulation of the financial industry since the catastrophic financial crisis in the autumn of 2008 .
Accident - Prone Wonder Weapons Afghanistan War Logs Reveal Shortcomings of US Drones
Remote - controlled drones are supposed to be the miracle weapon of the Afghanistan conflict , taking out Taliban fighters with precision missiles and protecting Western forces .
But the war logs files obtained by WikiLeaks show that system failures , computer glitches and human errors are plaguing drone missions .
The Los Angeles case “ shows why it can be tremendously useful in cases that seem pretty dead and hard to crack , ” said Jennifer Mnookin , a law professor and evidence expert at the University of California , Los Angeles .
“ So therefore we will very likely see an increasing use of these techniques , and at a minimum one hopes it is done in a sensitive way that is thoughtful and attentive to the concerns ” of its critics , she said .
At least some of those critics remain skeptical .
“ Familial searching is a tool , and at this point it is a very imprecise tool , ” said Michael Risher , a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California , who added there was the possibility of innocent people being harassed in the pursuit of a crime .
“ It has the potential to invade the privacy of a lot of people , ” he said .
Many law enforcement agencies collect DNA samples of convicted felons in hopes that DNA from other crime scenes can be matched to those individuals .
In the case of a close but imperfect match between crime scene DNA and that of someone locked up , forensic scientists say , the person responsible in that crime may well be a relative of the person locked up .
Through a software tool , scientists are then able to painstakingly parse the DNA to determine sibling or parent - child relationships , information the police use to pursue possible suspects .
While the practice is common in England , it has been limited largely to Colorado in the United States .
But in 2008 , the California Department of Justice began using familial searches  in the face of significant protests  to solve hard crimes .
The state restricted the practice to major , violent crimes in which all other investigative techniques had proved fruitless .
Those who oppose the technique argue that there are inherent privacy concerns , and that it serves , in essence , as a form of racial profiling because a higher proportion of inmates are members of minorities .
After 6 months of development work , following 2 years worth of design and preparation , CPAN Testers 2.0 is finally live .
With the rapid growth in CPAN Testers environments and testers over the past few years , the previous method of posting reports to a mailing list had reached a point where the scalability was no longer viable .
This was recognised several years ago and discussions for a new system had already begun , with the view that reports should be submitted via HTTP .
At the Oslo QA Hackathon in 2008 , David Golden and Ricardo Signes devised the Metabase , with the design work continuing at the Birmingham QA Hackathon in 2009 , where David and Ricardo were able to bring others into the thought process to work through potential issues and begin initial coding .
A number of releases to CPAN and Github followed , with more people taking an interest in the project .
The Metabase itself is a database framework and web API to store and search opinions from anyone about anything .
In the terminology of Metabase , Users store Facts about Resources .
In the Metabase world , each CPAN tester is a User .
The Resource is a CPAN distribution .
The Fact is the test report .
Today that 's just the text of the email message , but in the future it will be structured data .
The Metabase specifies data storage capabilities , but the actual database storage is pluggable , from flat files to relational databases to cloud services , which gives CPAN Testers more flexibility to evolve or scale over time .
Meanwhile the CPAN Testers community was also attracting more and more interest from people wanting to be testers themselves .
As a consequence the volume of reports submitted increased each month , to the point that the perl.org mail server was struggling to deal with all the mailing lists it hosted .
The cpan-testers mailing list was submitting more posts in one day than any other list submitted in a month ( in a year in some cases ) .
Robert and Ask , very reasonably , asked if the testers could throttle their submissions down to 5 k report posts a day , and set a deadline of 1st March 2010 to switch off the mailing list .
David Golden quickly took on the task to envisage a project plan , and work began in earnest in December 2009 .
With less than 3 months to the cut - off date , there was a lot of work to do .
David concentrated on the Metabase , with Barbie working on ensuring that the current cpanstats database and related websites could move to the Metabase style of reports .
Despite a lot of hard work from a lot of people , we unfortunately missed the 1st March deadline .
Having throttled report submissions to a more manageable level , and although not complete , the target for HTTP submissions was in sight , Robert and Ask were very understanding and agreed to keep us going a little while longer .
Throughout March and April a small group of beta testers were asked to fire their submissions at the new system .
It ironed out many wrinkles and resulted in a better understanding of what we wanted to achieve .
The first attempts at retrieving the reports from the Metabase into the cpanstats database began in April , and again highlighted further wrinkles that needed to be addressed .
After a month of hard testing and refinement , we finally had working code that went from report submission by a tester , storage into the Metabase , retrieval into the cpanstats database and finally presentation on the CPAN Testers family of websites .
During
June the process was silently switched from testing to live , allowing reports to be fed through into the live websites .
Due to the ease with which the new style reporting fit into the existing system , the switch largely went unnoticed by the CPAN testers community as well as the Perl community .
A considerable success .
The CPAN Testers eco-system is now considerably larger than those early days of simply submitting handwritten reports by email to a mailing list , and the work to get here has featured a cast of thousands .
Specifically for CPAN Testers 2.0 , the following people have contributed code , ideas and effort to the project over the past six months :

Barbie and David would like to thank everyone for their involvement .
Without these guys CPAN Testers 2.0 would not have been possible .
Thanks to everyone , we can now look forward to another 10 years and more of CPAN Testers .
CPAN Testers now holds over 7.5 million test reports covering nearly 11 years worth of testing Perl distributions .
There have been over 1,000 testers in that time , and every single one has helped the CPAN Testers project to be the largest single community supported testing system of any programming language .
For a full list of everyone who has contributed , visit the CPAN Testers Leaderboard .
A huge thank you to everyone .
With the Metabase now online and live , we can now announce an absolute deadline to close the mailing list .
This is currently set as 31st August 2010 .
After this date all submissions via email will be rejected , and testers will be encouraged to upgrade their testing tools to take advantage of the new HTTP submission system .
Many of the high volume testers have already moved to the new system , and we expect nearly everyone else to move in the next month .
We will be tailing the SMTP submissions to catch those who have n't switched , such as some of the more infrequent testers , and warn them of the deadline .
More work is planned for CPAN Testers , from further validation and administration of reports , to providing more functionality for alternative analysis and search capabilities .

At 4:13 on the afternoon of Sat. , June 26 , a burly man , clad in black , his face hidden by a kerchief , used an abandoned two - by - four — it had been part of a temporary traffic sign — to batter the window of Ken Li ’s souvenir shop .
The attacker was one of dozens of rioters who swaggered north on Yonge St. after breaking away from the large G20 demonstration .
He could not have known the people who stood well behind the shattered glass of the Yonge St. stores .
“ This is n’t violence , ” one of the black clad mob told the Star during the rampage .
“ This is vandalism against violent corporations .
We did not hurt anybody . ”
More than 40 businesses were damaged .
Many of them are independently owned small stores .
Their owners have come from countries including Afghanistan , China and Cuba .
They were astounded at what they saw that afternoon .
In the aftermath , the Star checked in on several small shops that were attacked on the few blocks between Dundas and College / Carlton Sts .
What emerged is a portrait of uncomprehending fear — and defiance .
When the rioters arrived at First Choice Gifts at 356 Yonge St. , owner Li was away from his store having a late lunch .
The place was staffed by two female university students working for the summer .
Yun Zhu , 22 , who ’s taking engineering at McMaster , had been on the job for two months .
Xiao Lin , 23 , who has finished her first year of chemistry at Queen ’s , had been working one month .
They both immigrated to Canada from China four years ago with their families .
Both were terrified but showed presence of mind .
They ’d heard the commotion and saw the black - clad vandals approach .
“ You could n’t see them — just their eyes , ” recalls Zhu .
She turned off the lights while Lin locked the glass doors .
“ We were so scared , ” continues Zhu .
“ Oh my God , you have no idea .
They tried to get into the store .
Four customers were here .
Two were girls like us .
Another was a couple in their 30s .
They were so great .
They told us , ‘ Be calm , take deep breaths . ’ ”
They all fled to the basement and heard the sound of breaking glass .
When they emerged , they saw that a large crystal ball , which weighed about 10 kilograms and cost $ 299 , had been taken , along with a crystal airplane from the hole in the front window .
The ball , Li explained is supposed to bring good luck , something that eluded him that day .
“ There were hundreds of police staying at the Delta Chelsea Hotel , ” Li says of the hotel behind his store .
“ On that day there were no police here . ”
While his store was under siege , a different tale was unfolding across the street at 361 Yonge St. where Alejandro Alonso is a co-owner of Wanda ’s Belgian Waffles Café , which opened three months ago .
Alonso , 25 , is a former lifeguard who came to Canada two years ago from Cuba .
He , too , heard the sound of shattering glass — “ bing , bing , like a movie ” — down the street .
But rather than run for cover , he and two employees , Egidio ( Eddy ) Citro , 55 , and Jordan Ayoub , 27 — defied the rioters .
Wearing their white chef jackets , they stood in front of the tiny café .
They kept their hands in their pockets .
Alonso thought it was cowardly for the rioters to cover their faces .
And he was surprised at their youth : they seemed to be 18 to 20 .
Many were girls .
“ If you live here and this is your city , you have to take care of it , ” Alonso says .
“ I come from a place where people have nothing and they take care of what they have . ”
A girl with a camera stood beside them filming the progress of the vandals up Yonge St. One of the rioters told Alonso to move .
“ I said , ‘ No , I will not move . ’
He wanted to break the glass , so I stayed .
The feeling I had was bigger than fear .
I was angry .
This is our store .
I care .
It ’s not only the money ; it ’s the time , the effort , how many hours we work every week . ”
The vandals passed by .
“ If you have a reason to do something , you do it , all the way , ” says Alonso .
“ They do n’t have any reason for what they were doing . ”
Business had n’t come back by mid-week , says Robert Ayoub , who owns several Wanda ’s Waffles shops .
“ We feel people are edgy .
People are coming to Yonge St. to see the broken glass . ”
Meanwhile the wreckage continued on the west side of Yonge St . The rioters shattered windows at a Swiss Chalet , where pedestrians had waved in warning to customers sitting near the front , motioning them to flee to the back .
They broke a window at Money Mart , at 368 Yonge , but missed Li ’s second shop , Canada Gifts , at 370 Yonge .
They were moving swiftly , and one of them was carrying a heavy crystal ball .
He was young and wiry , hooded , and heaved the ball through the south window of Barclay Jewelry Ltd. at the northeast corner of Yonge and Gerrard .
It bounced back .
He hurled it again .
Photographers and film crews turned their cameras toward him , but a dark - haired woman in a clear rain jacket darted in front of them twirling an open umbrella , to hide his identity .
The crystal ball , meanwhile , rolled to the curb .
The ball - tosser abandoned his task and as he did , angrily instead kicked the window .
He brushed past umbrella girl .
Behind this splintered window stood Zohrab Kilislian , who is in his 60s .
He ’s had jewellery stores on Yonge for more than 30 years .
He is tall and wears suspenders .
The rioters had already rammed a two - by - four through the front window ; the tempered glass lay like shining rubble on the sidewalk .
Kilislian cut his hands , which had several bandages on them last week , while cleaning up the mess .
A young woman who works for him was struck on the hip by the two - by - four .
Another employee was so angry , he ran out the door chasing the masked man who ’d thrown the lumber .
He did n’t catch him .
The crystal ball now lies by the front door .
It is surprisingly heavy , dented but unbroken .
Another rioter apparently found it on the street and hurled it through the window .
Kilislian says the police can come and get it if they ’d like .
He did not board his windows in preparation for the demonstration .
“ I was relying on the police , ” he says .
“ I really did not believe the police would allow this to happen .
That same day , in the morning , my friends said , ‘ Close up and go home . ’
I said , ‘ Why ? ’ ”

There was no jewellery in his showcases last Tuesday , three days after the riot .
The windows were still being repaired .
He estimates he may not be back in business until tomorrow .
The display cases are cracked , as are the molded forms that hold necklaces .
He has two questions : “ What do they gain from doing this ?
Who ’s going to pay for the damage ? ”
His wife called when she saw the rioting on television .
“ She said she was shaking , ” Kilislian recalls .
“ I said nothing , except that we were okay . ”
Then he adds : “ Honestly , I have never been like this .
I did n’t sleep that night .
I wanted to , I could n’t . . . ”
Kilislian is the landlord at 399 Yonge , which houses two other stores besides his own .
His tenant on the north side of the building is Khalil Salimi , a 36 - year - old immigrant from Afghanistan .
He sells leather jackets , purses and biker vests in his shop , All Leather .
Salimi , the middle of nine children , is married and has two little girls , 6 and 2 .
Salimi was standing by the display cases near the front of his shop when the vandals struck .
They hurled a section of movable fencing through the front glass window .
“ I was standing where you are .
I was frozen .
Their faces were covered , like Halloween Day .
Then we hid behind the counter .
We were scared . ”
Like Kilislian , he has questions .
“ Why would they do this ?
Do they want to kill us ?
In this country ?
This kind of stuff ?
“ You ’re standing in your store and someone comes to you like this ? ” continues Salimi , who has also lived in India and Pakistan .
“ I ’ve never seen that before . ”
Salimi checks his phone and sees that he called police at 4:15 p.m. on Saturday .
“ They said they could n’t come .
They said , ‘ Protect yourself . ’ ”
It will cost up to $ 2000 to fix the windows .
Is insurance likely to cover the costs ?
“ We do n’t have a police report . ”
For the small shopkeepers on Yonge St. , Saturday is the money day , the one they look forward to .
Salimi might have sales of about $ 8,000 over a weekend .
( His monthly rent is $ 9,000 . )
“ That Saturday , we sold zero — nothing , ” he says .
“ All week the radio was saying , do n’t come downtown . ”
Last Monday at 2.30 p.m. , a customer bought a leather jacket at a discounted price of $ 100 .
“ This is our first sale in three days .
They are still scared from downtown . ”
The losses he suffered in the days before and after the G20 summit ripple far from Toronto .
Every month he sends money — sometimes $ 500 , sometimes $ 800 — home to his parents who live in Kandahar City and are in their mid-70s .
“ Always , I give them money for their food . ”
He adds : “ This week was very bad for me , but what can you do ? ”
There ’s a fruit shop called Fruit Express Plus next door to Salimi ’s store .
It had metal gates pulled across the storefront , though the boxes of fruit were still outside .
Behind the closed gates , Olga Serebrennikova , who manages the flower department , was frightened .
“ But nothing bad happened , ” she says .
A boy in black rushed by , paused and raced back to pick up a few peaches .
He passed one to a comrade .
They laughed as they bit into the fruit .

( Beyond Pesticides , June 17 , 2010 ) Researchers have found detectable levels of common household pesticides in the majority of umbilical cord blood of babies born at an urban hospital .
The study looks at concentrations of organophosphate ( OP ) , carbamate , pyrethroids , and organochlorine pesticides in samples of umbilical cord blood taken from newborns delivered at the Johns Hopkins Hospital Labor and Delivery Suite in Baltimore .
Researchers looked at the umbilical cord serum , as opposed to maternal serum , in order to provide a more direct estimate of exposure to the fetus .
While human biomonitoring studies have found detectable levels of these pesticide chemicals in urine and blood samples from children and adults in the past , few studies have been carried out in the U.S. evaluating exposure in utero .
In addition to tracking pesticide concentrations , researchers also aimed to identify demographic and socioeconomics factors associated with in utero pesticide exposure .
Anonymous anthropometric and sociodemographic characteristics of the mothers and infants were collected along with umbilical cord blood that would have otherwise been discarded .
Included in the characteristics collected that researchers considered might affect pesticide exposure risk were : age , race , body mass index , parity , education , health insurance , marital status , smoking , area of residence and housing density .
There were a total of 591 live singular births between November 26 , 2004 and March 16 , 2005 , of which 300 were used for chemical laboratory analysis for this study .
Of these , 297 samples were successfully analyzed for organochlorine pesticides , and 185 were successfully analyzed for pesticides that are traditionally thought of as being “ nonpersistent ” with half - lives ranging from hours to weeks .
Using principal component analysis , a statistical method to identify pesticides and metabolites that tend to appear together , the authors found that newborns rarely received exposure to both permethrin and carbamates .
Permethrin levels were higher among infants of mothers who did not complete high school compared with women with at least a high - school education , possibly suggesting that less educated women live in environments with greater pest problems .
Highly educated mothers , on the other hand , had babies with higher cord serum concentrations of DDT mixtures , suggesting an association between higher education or socioeconomic status with high consumption of foods containing levels of DDT , such as fish .
Of the persistent pesticides , the parent compound p , p’ - DDT and its metabolite , p , p’ - DDE were detected in 90 % and 100 % of serum samples , respectively .
Hexachlorobenzene was detected in 98 % , and two chlordane - related chemicals ( trans - nonachlor and oxychlordane ) were detected in 93 % and 84 % respectively .
Researchers considered the carbamate , pyrethroids and OP pesticides to be the nonpersistent pesticides .
Results of the study found that among the carbamate pesticides , bendiocarb was detected in 73 % of the samples and propoxur was detected in 55 % .
Permethrin isomers ( cis– and trans - permethrin ) were detected in 41 % and 52 % respectively , and piperonyl butoxide ( PBO ) was detected in 36 % .
Cyfluthrin was found in only four samples .
For OP pesticides , chlorpyrifos was detected in five of the samples and diazinon was not detected in any .
Because scientists think that these pesticides disappear from the human body within a few days , the study suggests that the pregnant women either received regular , chronic exposure , which may cause fetal development problems , or that they were exposed shortly before childbirth , perhaps even in the hospital , the authors speculate .
“ We can see that they ’ve been exposed , but we do n’t know if there are health consequences , ” says first author Gila Neta , an epidemiologist who is now at the National Cancer Institute .
While the study measured pesticide levels in the umbilical cord blood , there was no information on pesticide - use behaviors as some other studies have done .
However , though the study was very narrowly focused , it provides a valuable case for the need for further assessment of exposure to pesticides , particularly in vulnerable populations such as pregnant women .
Furthermore , because this study only sampled newborns in one urban area , results might be higher in other areas , such as agricultural and rural regions where exposure is increased .
According to Donald Wigle , Ph.D. , an epidemiologist at McLaughlin Centre for Population Health Risk Assessment at the University of Ottawa , the results point to important questions that could be resolved by the National Children ’s Study .
The study , among many other goals , plans to look at pesticide exposure patterns and their possible effects on pregnancy and child health .
Results of this study , “ Distribution and Determinants of Pesticide Mixtures in Cord Serum Using Principal Component Analysis ” can be found online in the journal Environmental Science & Technology .

Climate groups to target ' Big Oil Welfare Tax '
With foes of new energy legislation describing most moves toward regulating carbon as a " national energy tax , " backers of the legislation are launching an aggressive campaign to go on offense , and to muddy those waters , with an assault on the tax treatment of the oil industry as a " Big Oil Welfare Tax . "
Writes consultant David Di Martino in a memo to the members of a coalition assembled to support the bill , Clean Energy Works :
The other side is on message and determined to defeat a new energy policy with the tired old false attack that climate and energy legislation is a “ national energy tax . ”
What they do n’t want anyone to know is that the American people already have a national energy tax – The Big Oil Welfare Tax - in the form of billions of dollars in subsidies to the wildly profitable big oil companies .

RE : The Big Oil Welfare Tax
DA : July 9 , 2010
The coming weeks will be very important for supporters of comprehensive clean energy and climate legislation .
The opposition , in the form of API and Big Oil lobbyists in Washington , are spending millions on smear campaigns and calling on their cronies in the Senate to do everything they can to continue America ’s dependence on oil and prevent a new policy that moves us away from oil and toward a clean energy economy .
The other side is on message and determined to defeat a new energy policy with the tired old false attack that climate and energy legislation is a “ national energy tax . ”
What they do n’t want anyone to know is that the American people already have a national energy tax – The Big Oil Welfare Tax - in the form of billions of dollars in subsidies to the wildly profitable big oil companies .
That ’s right ; American taxpayers SUBSIDIZE an industry that earns hundreds of millions of dollars in profits each quarter , and turns around and charges $ 3 , $ 4 even $ 5 for a gallon of its subsidized gasoline .

By The Numbers : The Big Oil Welfare TAX
As Big Oil and their lobbyists work overtime to prevent being held accountable for their actions and a change in our nation ’s energy policy , polluters benefit from generous energy tax provisions that effectively raise taxes on average Americans .
These provisions subsidize the oil industry with $ 4 billion in tax breaks and loopholes every year .
Big
Oil companies make record profits each year yet still benefit from this Big Oil Welfare Tax Breaks that costs Americans dearly in both tax revenue and continued dependence on oil .
The Republican Leadership in Congress opposes a new clean energy and climate policy that will reduce our dependence on oil , create jobs , enhance our national security and protect our environment .
They apologize to BP , protect big polluters , and want to preserve the big oil welfare tax policy that supports oil companies that already make a killing .
Here are the tax provisions that constitute the Big Oil Welfare Tax on Americans :
$ 4 Billion Energy Tax Benefits Big Oil Every Year : A $ 4 Billion Self - Admitted Welfare TAX subsidies to the Oil Industry .
“ Oil industry officials say that the tax breaks , which average about $ 4 billion a year according to various government reports , are a bargain for taxpayers . ”
[ New York Times , 7/6/10 ]
16 Percent Tax Break : Big Oil ’s Overall Tax Rate Is 9 Percent – 16 Percent LOWER
Than The Overall Business Tax Rate .
“ According to the most recent study by the Congressional Budget Office , released in 2005 , special treatment for capital investments like oil field leases and drilling equipment mean that oil companies are taxed at an effective rate of 9 percent , significantly lower than the overall rate of 25 percent for businesses in general and lower than virtually any other industry . ”
[ New York Times , 7/6/10 ]
$ 1.8 Billion In Tax Loopholes : Transocean Has Saved $ 1.8 Billion With Offshore Tax Loopholes .
“ Transocean — which has approximately 18,000 employees worldwide , including 1,300 in Houston and about a dozen in Zug , Switzerland — has saved $ 1.8 billion in taxes since moving overseas in 1999 , the study found . ”
[ New York Times , 7/6/10 ]
$ 2.6 Billion In Additional Tax Breaks : Bush Pushed Through $ 2.6 Billion In Taxpayer Giveaways To Big Oil .
“ Despite the public anger at the gulf spill , it is far from certain that Congress will eliminate the tax breaks .
As recently as 2005 , when windfall profits for energy companies prompted even President George W. Bush — a former Texas oilman himself — to publicly call for an end to incentives , the energy bill he and Congress enacted still included $ 2.6 billion in oil subsidies .
In 2007 , after Democrats took control of Congress , a move to end the tax breaks failed . ” [ New York Times , 7/6/10 ]
$ 340 Million To Protect Tax Loopholes : Since 2008 , Big Oil Has Spent $ 340 Million In Federal Lobbying Fees .
Since 2008 , the oil and gas industry has spent $ 340 million on federal lobbying fees .
[ New York Times , 7/6/10 ]
$ 18.6 Million For The Grand Oil Party : Senate Republicans Have Accepted At Least $ 18.6 Million From Big Oil .
Since 1989 , members of the Senate Republican Caucus for the 111th Congress have accepted at least $ 18,690,814 from the oil and gas industry .

Earlier in the spring , Mr. Bellerive and Mr. Voltaire , who is an architect and urban planner , had visited Mr. Clinton at his home in Chappaqua , N.Y .
At one point , Mr. Clinton kept getting distracted by incoming e-mail messages .
According to Mr. Voltaire , Mr. Clinton said , “ If I receive one more suggestion for the ideal house for Haiti , I will explode . ”
And Mr. Bellerive said , “ You , too ? ”
After that , the government hired a London firm to solicit and sift through proposals for “ the best , safest and most sustainable housing designs of the future .
“ In October , several dozen model homes will be built and displayed at a housing expo in Oranger , Haiti .
People will be selected to live in the prototypes and to evaluate them , Mr. Voltaire said .
Eventually , permanent housing will be built , he said , at one of a few sites that the government is seizing through eminent domain and hoping to turn into new population centers .
One of those sites is Corail - Cesselesse , about 10 miles north of Port - au - Prince , where the first planned tent city was installed in April on a chalky gravel plane .
Hastily created for displaced people who seemed most at risk from flooding or landslides in another camp , it is now home to about 5,000 who live in an orderly grid of white tents far from their bustling urban neighborhood .
Some aid groups criticize the location .
“ That site does not represent clear strategic thinking on the part of the government , ” said Ms. Schindall of Oxfam .
“ It ’s like the Sudan .
There ’s not a tree in sight .
And people feel marooned .
They are having major issues finding income - generating activities and soon they are going to have trouble feeding themselves .
It ’s inevitable . ”
But several residents interviewed seemed willing to tolerate the camp ’s remoteness because living there puts them in line for the transitional shelters that are supposed to be erected there , and then for the permanent houses that may follow .
Jean Mérite Pierre , a mason , asked visitors to accompany him to the barren land .
“ Look at all this space , ” he said , sweeping his arms over an empty lot .
“ All those people who died lived in houses that collapsed like dominoes .
So even if we are uprooted , life could be better here .
We were renters , almost all of us .
Here , maybe we can own a house someday .
That ’s what they say .
You have to believe them . ”
There 's great parts in it , we 're talking about getting Nathan Fillion for one of those parts depending on his availability ; there 's a couple of parts he'd be great for so we 'll have to see how it goes .
While everyone was quite bummed when Nathan Fillion did n't take the stage as Ant - Man at the Marvel panel this past Saturday at Comic Con , it 's hard to feel too sorry for him .
After all , Super looked fantastic , he was surrounded by a legion of browncoats ( that 's Firefly fans for those not in the know ) , and , in many ways , he just awesome .
Because of his popularity , he never seems to be out of work for too long and now it looks like he 's close to another gig .
Movie
Hole caught up with Drive Angry 3D director Patrick Lussier this weekend at Comic Con and discussed Lussier 's next project , a film titled Condition Dead , based on a script by movie blogger Dave Davis of JoBlo .
Falling in the horror / action genre , the film follows a special government organization tasked to control the dead rising from the grave , and Fillion is being heavily considered for a role .
The issue of the actor 's availability likely has something to do with Fillion 's commitments to the television show Castle , but is there a fan alive who would n't be willing to forsake a season of that show to watch Fillion blow away some zombies ?
They do n't have to write him out completely , perhaps just put Richard Castle in a coma for most of the season and fill gaps with archive footage .
It would be worth it .
After teasing gamers that today would be " a great day for BioWare fans , " the company responsible for chatty roleplaying epics like Dragon Age and Mass Effect 2 has officially trotted out preliminary details on Dragon Age 2 .
The new site 's predictably skeletal , just some vaguely Asian - Nordic looking guy clad in pointy greaves , gloves , and boots , grasping a sword - spear weapon in front of a dragon rising phoenix - like behind a crowd of silhouettes ( The people you 'll encounter ?
A doubled or tripled array of potential party members ? )
" Rise to power ... by any means necessary , " teases the site , just below a note indicating the debut trailer wo n't be out until August 17 .
( Kind of early to announce , then , given the month lead on video -- I guess that 's how marketing keeps " exclusive " - subsidized print mags like Game Informer happy . )
" You are one of the few who escaped the destruction of your home , " reads the indeterminate , spoiler - free game overview .
" Now , forced to fight for survival in an ever - changing world , you must gather the deadliest of allies , amass fame and fortune , and seal your place in history .
" This is the story of how the world changed forever .
The legend of your Rise to Power begins now . "
That last could double as a tagline for Lionhead 's Fable III , another ethically mercurial fantasy romp with a " rise to power " angle .
The Fable III similarities continue : Dragon Age 2's timeframe occurs " across an entire decade , " and changing based on " every decision you make . "
You 'll evolve " from a destitute refugee " to " the revered champion of the land . "
( In Fable III , you " rally and fight alongside your people , " " ascend to the seat of power , " and " the choices you make will change the world around you . " )
" Think like a general and fight like a Spartan with dynamic new combat mechanics that put you right in the heart of battle whether you are a mage , rogue , or warrior , " reads the one combat - related bullet point .
Let 's hope the push to " put you right in the heart " of things does n't translate as a button - mashy " lowest - common - denominator " makeover .
What else ?
" An entirely new cinematic experience , " " updated graphics , " and " a new visual style . "
Judging from the concept art ( the female with the Witchblade -y arm - thing in particular ) perhaps the latter implies a stylized animation or cel - shaded look ?
All that , not coming soon .
With the debut trailer delayed until mid-August , we 're probably talking 2011 at the earliest .

It was , however , quite apposite that the Liberty Prize was announced just as the Chilcot Inquiry into the Iraq war made evident the naked contempt that Blair and his cohorts held for the legal advice of Lord Goldsmith , then attorney general , in the run-up to the invasion .
On January 30 , 2003 , the day before Mr Blair was due to fly off for a meeting with President Bush , Goldsmith sent a note reminding the prime minister of his view that a second UN Security Council resolution was necessary before any invasion could be considered legal .
Blair scrawled petulantly in the margin : " Just do n't understand this " , while a cross aide wrote : " Specifically said we did not need further advice on this matter . "
The next day in Washington , Bush informed Blair that military action would begin with or without a second resolution , and Blair blithely assured the president that he was solidly behind him .

Leave this field empty if you 're human :
Today is a morning I wake with dread in my heart .
My legs feel heavy and tense .
Before I even realize that I am awake , my mind is racing .
Pacing .
Fluttering and bouncing .
I feel like a victim to my Inner Thinker .
On an ordinary morning like this , the walls of my head feel like a jail cell that keeps captive my simple desire for peace , happiness , simplicity .
On a morning like this , I hear myself say ,
“ Have I not worked hard so as to deserve the peace ?
What more would it take to wake to a slow , tempered , joyous morning when my heart is full of love and my mind is clear and cool ? ”
I ponder , I beg .
But in my belly I know the truth :
The Divine Source of all things speak to us in moments of agony .
Moments of “ breaking , ” I call them .
Each and every waking morning that is riddled with angst , anxiety , fears or worries is no more than The Hand of the Universe striking you , like a bell , with a padded mallet .
And now , you hum .
You vibrate and shake .
Your mind races and paces with thoughts and ideas and stories and conversations with a flurry so uncontrollable that your heart is sparked into a dizzy of worry and wonder .
You are being spoken to .
God is speaking to you now .
You are n’t trapped in your head .
You do n’t need to escape your mind .
You need to understand ( as I have –slowly , so slowly ) this is Universal Energy that stirs within you .
God , manifest .
All you need do is to listen , to trust , and to surrender to this love .
And yet , even to hear myself say such a thing is so bizarre and uncertain that you might sooner seek a doctor to bring me medication than join me in looking up and throwing our hands into the sky in gratitude .
Entertain me for a few minutes , friend :
You came here for a reason .
You typed the words “ escape your mind ” into Google .
You are looking for release , for peace , for quiet –I understand it .
Breathe deeply now and understand all is well –read on .
A source from somewhere is transcending time and space to emanate through you in this moment of curious turmoil .
The dread you feel in your heart is a seed of truth waiting to burst through its walls .
Your legs feel heavy and tense for you are ready to stand tall and proud upon them .
Your mind is racing because a message is being spoken to you .
Like a plucked guitar string , it shimmies from your cranium down your spine and through your limbs .
This is it , this gift .
It ’s here !
While the feeling is fresh , you give yourself to it .
Sit down and write .
Go off and run .
Meditate .
Salute the sun in your yoga .
Connect your body to breath .
Whatever practice you desire , whatever habit you wish , in this moment you must sync your soul to the Divine .
Answers are finding you .
Clarity is being bestowed .
You have earned this .
You have worked so hard to deserve a clue ; a revelation .
Your life may well change from this moment forward .
Our minds tend to deceive us — to fool us .
Mine deceived me for nearly two decades before I came to see the truth : that my ego was once the captain of my ship , directing my thoughts and thus directing my actions .
I moved selfishly and in fear of the world–in fear of people .
I judged , I criticized .
I sought to find the path that was “ right ” and made all others “ wrong . ”
Our minds deceive us , but that is just our nature .
Our task in this life is to recognize the lies our egos tell us .
I used to say , “ Kill your ego . ”
Do n’t do that .
Simply forgive it .
I believe that God speaks to each of us routinely .
And please , replace my use of “ God ” for whatever title you wish : Divine Source , Source Energy , Om , Ganesha , The Eternal , One Love , The Universe , Buddha , Ra , Yahweh , Allah .
We are all speaking of the same source ; the same ocean .
I am a writer .
I write because I have found , one thousand times throughout my life , that writing is how I listen .
When God speaks and the Universe suddenly feels as if it is talking to me all at once , I must make myself sit down and write to transcribe what it says .
I believe that we are each our own conduits to the Universal .
I believe that we human beings , made up of little more than energy and a soul , are channels by which energies , seen and unseen , pass .
But , your mind deceives you .
That ’s why I share this message with you today .
For , like you , I am a student of life who is trying his best to live well and do some good for others , and beyond all else , to be happy and content and in his actions and words feel more and more true to self .
We all desire these , purpose and fulfillment , meaning and love , joy and truth .
But so often we do not feel them .
We are all the more inclined to feel anxiety and pain , angst and worry .
We are more likely to wake in the morning with dread in our hearts and heavy legs .
Our minds are more often racing than they are quiet ; we feel like victims to our own thought , for thought seems to occur independent of our choice : our will , our want , our ability to control it .
If there ’s an “ Off Switch ” to our thought we cannot seem to find it .
I would use an analogy to say we are crawling through the dark room of our minds and scouring for the wall , but then , would we not be searching for an On Switch instead ?
See , even when “ Divinity speaks to you , ” clarity is not certain .
When God speaks to you and through you , the Universe does not pull back the curtain of unknowing for you to glimpse into a revealing and picturesque portrait of the future .
If that were the case , my analogy would n’t have fallen so flat .
And goodness knows , I should be so much more a poet than I am if all that was required was this sort of listening !
The feeling is enough , friend .
The feeling of connection to the Divine Source to which we are each connected is enough to remember that it is there .
That , no matter what , we ’re forever bound to it .
Connected through it .
Answers are not what we need .
Clarity is what we say we desire .
We hear ourselves say in conversations with friends that we want to make sure we “ do what ’s right . ”
We say that we want to be “ sure . ”
We do n’t want to screw up , make the wrong move , set ourselves back , hurt the ones we love , feel misunderstood by the ones closest to us .
We say these things because our minds deceive us into thinking that life is linear–as if we are driving upon a highway called life and if we take the wrong exit , we ’re flat out fucked .
There ’ll be no going back , we say .
If we choose the wrong job , the wrong partner , the wrong anything , then we ’ll receive an F on the test and be condemned to it eternally .
We ’re terrified of choosing wrong .
But more so , we ’re terrified of choosing what we do n’t know , whether “ right ” or “ wrong . ”
And we never know how a decision , a choice , a path , a job or career , a relationship or partner will pan out .
We do n’t have that ability to know , we never will and even if we could , it would make your life unworthy of being lived at all .
Life is a journey and how you maneuver through it , whether for better or worse , is the gift of life itself .
We ’re terrified of choosing when we can not see the path ahead .
And so instead of choosing what feels right and true and honest and authentic to us right now , we do n’t choose .
We sit on the same path that has n’t been working for us .
We sit in an unhealthy relationship that we know will never change , but because we ’re familiar with it , it is certain ; because we know it , it feels safer than the unknown , which is what we ’d choose in leaving that relationship .
I wrote in my book God Whispers on the Wind that the brain “ likes to think in highways . ”
When there ’s a decision , a choice , a path , a problem that needs solving or an obstacle that needs overcoming , that ’s where our thinking brains default : the biology of the brain looks to find the “ right ” answer and attempts to see the result before making the decision .
If you ca n’t find the right answer or see the result , the brain says to not make the decision .
The problem is that our brain likes to make decisions right here and right now on a basis of something we will never know : the future .
Your mind deceives you for this reason , friend .
Forgive it .
Forgive yourself .
We are all in this together .
Every human being experiences this feeling .
You need to make your decisions right here and now on the basis of right here and now , knowing full well that what you choose today will indeed influence , affect , shift , and shape your tomorrow–but there is not “ one path ” for you to walk .
Rumi said , “ There are a hundred ways to kneel and kiss the ground . ”
Today , kneel and kiss the ground in one way that feels good and true to you .
Put pen to paper , sing a song in your car , go to the beach , walk in the woods , call a friend by surprise and say hello .
Honor yourself , honor others around you .
Be kind , be gentle , be loving .
I often say , “ Tomorrow belongs to the unapologetic . ”
The unapologetic are those who choose because they believe in themselves , in spite of the unknown .
They are those souls who stand and walk upon their paths with certainty in spite of the fact that , in their bellies , they are so afraid and deathly uncertain .
What guides the unapologetic is a pure and unwavering dedication to self , to soul and by extension to every other self and soul in this life : each human being , an equal ; each beating heart that cares and wills for the same honest and earnest and good and true desires .
Are you remembering now , friend ?
The Federal Trade Commission announced a milestone this week : its Do Not Call registry has just passed 200 million numbers .
It 's quite amazing that any of this came to pass , really .
When the registry was being considered back in 2002 , telemarketing opposition was fierce , and for obvious reasons .
The industry was large , powerful , and willing to be unbelievably annoying .
It also saw quite clearly that a tough Do Not Call rule would chop off its business at the knees .
So , when the time came to object to the rules being drafted , every card was played : First Amendment rights , the jobs that telemarketing offered to " patriotic " Americans , and dire warnings about " unintended consequences " and regulatory overreach .
In fact , it was argued , telemarketers were really an unpopular minority whose rights were being trampled .
" First , let 's be honest here , " said one telemarketing executive at a 2002 FTC meeting in which the registry was being considered ( read the transcript [ PDF ] ) .
" This is a proposal not to regulate but to prohibit speech , not because it 's deceptive or abusive , but because it 's unpopular .
As was said here , there is public sentiment against telemarketing , per se .
Some people are mad .
Some people are fed up .
Some people just hate such calls , but freedom of speech , our most cherished freedom , means the freedom to speak when it 's against public sentiment . "
For good measure , the same speaker later switched gears and praised the millions of people employed in telemarketing ( many part - time ) , saying that " the overwhelming number who are employed in this business are lawful , patriotic and normal Americans , and for the Government to cut out a series of these jobs is a very serious matter . "
These Americans might have been " normal " and " patriotic , " but the rest of the country just wanted to eat in peace .
Testimony at the same hearing from one aggrieved mother conjured up the spectre of those dark days , back before the federal list existed and rules governing telemarketing were loose .
( One could ask companies not to call again , but that was about it . )
It all began with some calls about vinyl siding .
My name 's Diana Mey .
I 'm a housewife and stay - at - home mom .
I have three teenaged sons .
I live in Wheeling , West Virginia .
Telemarketing impacted me about two years ago when I had , as I said , three sons and we were running in a bunch of different directions , and I was wanting to get us all together at one time to have dinner together at night , and I found that with increasing frequency our dinners were being interrupted by telemarketing calls , and I heard about the law that regulated telemarketing , and I thought this would be a way that I could — I did n't want to be rude , but I thought the law would be my best answer .
So , I tried to enforce the law , asking companies to not call me back , and over a period of about six months , I had a telemarketer for Sears call me repeatedly over and over despite my request to stop calling .
To make a long story short , I filed a small claims suit after writing to the company , and they continued to call .
In fact , the last call they placed to my home , I grabbed a tape recorder and I taped it and I wrote the company , I told them , I said , look , you know , you keep calling , I can prove it , I 've got the proof .
I filed a small claims suit , and the next thing I knew , Sears ' lawyers turned around and countersued me for $ 10,000 saying I violated state and federal wiretap statutes — and by the way , it is legal in my state to tape my own calls .
They also threatened punitive damages .
I was very afraid .
I ended up having to get a lawyer , got the dispute dismissed .
Mey 's story landed her on national TV ( Matt Lauer interviewed her on the Today Show , for instance ) and Sears eventually flew someone to her town to apologize to Mey in person .
According to her website , where she later kept up the fight against telemarketers , Mey was paid $ 4,000 by Sears , some of it in the form of gift cards .
As she told the FTC , when her husband used the cards to buy an air compressor at Sears ... the company started calling again .
" The jig is up "
The telemarketing industry was n't opposed to the idea of one national list ; indeed , some execs complained publicly about the cost of keeping up with all sorts of private and state - run lists , so a single list would be easier to manage .
But the industry wanted lenient rules about pre-existing business relationships and the percentage of computer - dialed sales calls that could be " abandoned " when no operator was available .
Instead , in late 2002 the FTC adopted a tough rule , including a national Do Not Call list and a three percent " abandonment " rate on auto - dialed calls .
Initially , the list would only last for a few years before a renewal was required , but the list became so politically popular that it was later changed to last indefinitely .
The Direct Marketing Association filed a lawsuit .
So did the American Teleservices Association .
Both complained , in the words of a Congressional Research Service report ( PDF ) , that " the FTC 's rule infringes on the telemarketers ' rights under the First Amendment and violates the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution .
The plaintiffs also argue that the FTC exceeded its statutory authority in promulgating regulations establishing a national do - not - call registry and acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner in so doing . "
Eventually , though , the industry admitted defeat .
In a 2004 article in Direct , a trade journal , the author admitted that the " jig is up , " but she blamed the new rules on marketers who had insisted on " doing what we never should have done in the first place . "
Instead of carefully targeting customers , using experienced sales reps who knew their products , and treating people with respect , the industry blanketed US phone lines , used predictive dialers that abandoned huge numbers of calls , and relied on ridiculous and stilted sales " scripts " for operators who had no idea what they were selling but could manage to read from a screen .
Today , 200 million numbers are on the US Do Not Call list , and the government has generally forbidden all telemarketing calls to cell phones .
Taken together , these two rules fundamentally changed the telemarketing business .
Back in 2002 , some marketers complained that , without their helpful calls , consumers would pay more for things like credit cards .
Even if true , no one seems to be complaining .
Since the list went into effect , the FTC has gone after more than 60 companies alleged to have violated the law .
Most recently , in May 2010 , it targeted three companies that were robocalling consumers with " urgent - sounding messages from ' Card Services ' or ' Financial Services , ' stating that consumers needed to ' press one ' to speak to a representative about their credit card interest rates .
Many consumers believed the calls were from their credit card issuers . "
In reality , the calls were from some companies who thought it would be a nice business to charge in - debt consumers $ 500 to $ 1,500 in return for bringing down the interest rate on their credit cards .
When the people paid up , the companies " sent consumers instructions to pay down their credit card debts early , thus saving money on interest .
Consumers who complained and demanded refunds allegedly were denied outright , got the run-around , or had a $ 199 ' nonrefundable fee ' deducted from their refund . "
A federal judge finally put the three businesses into receivership and froze the assets of their owners .
Ah , telemarketing !
Now , if only the FTC 's anti-spam crusade was anywhere near as effective as its telemarketing regulation .
Once the Buddha told his monks the following story :
There was once a pair of jugglers who performed their acrobatic feats on a bamboo pole .
One day the master said to his apprentice : “ Now get on my shoulders and climb up the bamboo pole . ”
When the apprentice had done so , the master said : “ Now protect me well and I shall protect you !
By protecting and watching each other in that way , we shall be able to show our skill , make a good profit and safely get down from the bamboo pole . ”
But the apprentice said : “ Not so , master !
You , O master , should protect yourself , and I too shall protect myself .
Thus self - protected and self - guarded we shall safely do our feats . ”
“ This is the right way , ” said the Blessed One and spoke further as follows : “ It is just as the apprentice said : ‘ I shall protect myself ’— in that way the foundations of mindfulness ( satipatthana ) should be practised .
‘ I shall protect others ’— in that way the foundations of mindfulness should be practised .
Protecting oneself , one protects others ; protecting others , one protects oneself .
“ And how does one , in protecting oneself , protect others ?
By the repeated and frequent practice of meditation ( asevanaya bhavanaya bahulikammena ) .
“ And how does one , in protecting others , protect oneself ?
By patience and forbearance , by a non-violent and harmless life , by loving kindness and compassion . ” ( Satipatthana Samyutta , No. 19 ) :
Commentary by Nyanaponika Thera from “ Protection Through Satipatthana ”
“ Moral self - protection will lack stability as long as it remains a rigid discipline enforced after a struggle of motives and against conflicting habits of thought and behaviour .
Passionate desires and egotistic tendencies may grow in intensity if one tries to silence them by sheer force of will .
Even if one temporarily succeeds in suppressing passionate or egotistic impulses , the unresolved inner conflict will impede one ’s moral and spiritual progress and warp one ’s character .
Furthermore , inner disharmony caused by an enforced suppression of impulses will seek an outlet in external behaviour .
It may make the individual irritable , resentful , domineering and aggressive towards others .
Thus harm may come to oneself as well as to others by a wrong method of self - protection .
Only when moral self - protection has become a spontaneous function , when it comes as naturally as the protective closing of the eyelid against dust–only then will our moral stature provide real protection and safety for ourselves and others .
This naturalness of moral conduct does not come to us as a gift from heaven .
It has to be acquired by repeated practice and cultivation .
Therefore our sutta says that it is by repeated practice that self - protection becomes strong enough to protect others too .
But if that repeated practice of the good takes place only on the practical , emotional and intellectual levels , its roots will not be firm and deep enough .
Such repeated practice must also extend to the level of meditative cultivation .
By meditation , the practical , emotional and intellectual motives of moral and spiritual self - protection will become our personal property which cannot easily be lost again .
Therefore our sutta speaks here of bhavana , the meditative development of the mind in its widest sense .
This is the highest form of protection which our world can bestow .
He who has developed his mind by meditation lives in peace with himself and the world .
From him no harm or violence will issue .
The peace and purity which he radiates will have an inspiring , uplifting power and will be a blessing to the world .
He will be a positive factor in society , even if he lives in seclusion and silence .
When understanding for , and recognition of , the social value of a meditative life ceases in a nation , it will be one of the first symptoms of spiritual deterioration . ”

While President Obama may be trying to avoid diving into the racial fray Rachel Maddow jumped right in last night .
In a fairly devastating segment Maddow tied this week ’s Shirley Sherrod debacle to previous cases , dating back to the Sixties , of politicians and the media using “ scare white people ” tactics to generate support .
At and after the Civil Rights era the political strategy of terrifying white people by the threat posed by black people , black people coming to get them , coming to take what ’s rightfully theirs , that strategy got a new name , the Southern Strategy … it about making white people feel like they are the victims of black people .
Black people are the racists …it ’s good politics , it always has been in this country .
It still is .
Maddow then aired a series of , it should be noted , rather selective soundbites of conservative personalities including Rush Limbaugh , Glenn Beck , and a variety of Fox News clips — “ crusades ” including Van Jones , ACORN , and the new Black Panthers — all of which touched on the same theme : white people are the victims .
Maddow is certainly not the first to draw this conclusion , though there are signs that , justified or not — you ’d be hard - pressed to paint the entire network in this light — this is going to be a new theme for critics of Fox .
Dave Weigel also briefly touched on a similar point in his excoriation of Megyn Kelly the other day , pointing our her fear mongering of the DOJ with the Black Panthers story was reminiscent of the 1966 rumor that flew around “ that black gang members on motorcycles were going to head from Chicago to ransack Des Moines . ”
However , Maddow sees the trend as being network - wide .
What do the four major Fox News only stories of the Obama era have in common ?
The four major stories , pressed and pushed relentlessly on Fox , over and above the facts , as their own make up the news cycle you wish you had narrative that they want to pin on the Obama administration ?
… Van Jones , ACORN , the New Black Panthers , and Shirley Sherrod … .
This is n’t about racism , this is n’t a story about picking on black people .
This is a story about political outcomes … a strategy to feel afraid of black people .
To feel afraid of African American people as if they are not fellow Americans , rather a threat to what white people have …
This is a political strategy , advanced not by a news organization , but by political activists who use a cable channel as a political outlet and they are pros at this , there is no reason to expect them to stop doing stuff like this .
Unless it stops working some day .
Watch below .
Have a tip we should know ?

Political Opinion , Not Pathology
The Washington Post
Thursday , August 28 , 2003 ; Page A27
By Arie W. Kruglanski and John T. Jost *
In the May issue of Psychological Bulletin , we published a review that statistically summarizes dozens of studies conducted over 50 years dealing with psychological differences associated with left - vs. right - wing thinking .
Based on this literature , we found that the likelihood of adopting conservative rather than liberal political opinions is significantly correlated , among other psychological dimensions , with a sense of societal instability , fear of death , intolerance of ambiguity , need for closure , lower cognitive complexity and a sense of threat .
Apparently without reading our original articles or attempting to contact any of us , many commentators and syndicated columnists , including Ann Coulter and Cal Thomas -- George Will [ op-ed , Aug. 10 ] apparently read but misunderstood our work ) -- assumed that such a psychological analysis of ideology entails a judgment that conservatism must be abnormal , pathological or even the result of mental illness .
The British media seem to have settled on the highly stigmatized and equally inaccurate term " neuroses . "
All of this reflects a crude and outdated perception of psychological research .
Historically , some of the better known psychological analyses of right - wing thinking , especially the famous Adorno et al. volume on " The Authoritarian Personality " ( 1950 ) , assumed that anti-Semitism and racial intolerance were consequences of faulty parenting styles and traumatic childhood experiences .
The German psychologist Erich Jantsch in 1938 had described liberalism as morbid .
We part ways with these and other theories based on a " medical model " that ranks political orientations on dimensions of abnormality .
All the variables we have reviewed pertain to normal cognitive and motivational functioning .
We would argue that all beliefs have a partial basis in one 's needs , fears and desires , including beliefs that form one 's political ideology .
Our research has identified several factors that seem to underlie the propensity to find conservative vs. liberal thought systems appealing .
It 's wrong to conclude that our results provide only bad news for conservatives .
True , we find some support for the traditional " rigidity - of - the - right " hypothesis , but it is also true that liberals could be characterized on the basis of our overall profile as relatively disorganized , indecisive and perhaps overly drawn to ambiguity -- all of which may be liabilities in mass politics and other public and professional domains .
Because we assume that all beliefs ( ideological , scientific and otherwise ) are partially ( but never completely ) determined by one 's needs , fears and desires , we see nothing pathological about this process .
It is simply part of what it means to be human .
Our " trade - off " model of human psychology assumes that any trait or motivation has potential advantages and disadvantages , depending on the situation .
A heightened sensitivity to threat and uncertainty is by no means maladaptive in all contexts .
Even closed - mindedness may be useful , provided one tends to have a closed mind about appropriate values and accurate opinions ; a reluctance to abandon one 's prior convictions in favor of new fads can be a good thing .
The important task for social scientists is to identify the conditions under which each of these cognitive and motivational styles is beneficial , rather than touting one or the other as inherently and invariably superior .
Our findings highlight the importance of situations and historical factors that can produce political shifts by affecting psychological needs pertaining to uncertainty and threat .
The need to achieve closure and to resolve ambiguity , for example , are heightened under conditions of destabilizing uncertainty ( for example , with the outbreak of terrorism , economic turmoil or political instability ) .
Thus our research is best understood as addressing the cognitive and motivational bases of conservatism ( and liberalism ) rather than the personalities of conservatives ( and liberals ) .
We readily acknowledge that identifying the motivational underpinnings of a belief system does not constitute a valid argument in a political debate any more than it does in scientific debates .
What counts is the cogency of the political arguments and the degree to which they fit with independently verifiable facts and reasonable assumptions .
When the dust settles on the current debate , we hope that these important messages will be seen as the real focus of our research .

UK PM cautions Pakistan over ' terror exports ' Published duration 28 July 2010
image caption Leaked documents accuse Pakistani intelligence of helping Afghan militants
British Prime Minister David Cameron has warned Pakistan not to have any relationship with groups that " promote the export of terror " .
He said that he would be raising the issue with his Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh when they held talks in Delhi on Thursday .
Mr Cameron 's spokeswoman insisted he was talking about Pakistan as a country , not its government .
She said that the main message was for Pakistan to shut " terror groups " down .
More stable
" We should be very , very clear with Pakistan that we want to see a strong , stable and democratic Pakistan , " Mr Cameron told reporters after a speech in the southern Indian city of Bangalore .
image caption Mr Cameron wants to give more attention to Anglo - Indian relations
" We can not tolerate in any sense the idea that this country is allowed to look both ways and is able , in any way , to promote the export of terror , whether to India or whether to Afghanistan or anywhere else in the world . "
His remarks on Pakistan follow the leaking of US documents on the WikiLeaks website in which Pakistan 's Inter Services Intelligence agency was accused of secretly helping the Afghan insurgency .
UK Foreign Secretary William Hague , who is travelling with the prime minister , sought to further clarify Mr Cameron 's remarks .
" He was n't accusing anybody of double dealing , " Mr Hague said .
" He was also saying that Pakistan 's made great progress in tackling terrorism .
Of course there have been many terrorism outrages in Pakistan itself . "
' Very clear '
The BBC 's world affairs correspondent Mike Wooldridge says that the leaking of this particular allegation has already been the cue for increased American demands that Pakistan needs to step up its efforts to tackle terrorism and Mr Cameron is saying the same .
Our correspondent says that Mr Cameron and his officials also put great emphasis on the importance of Britain and Pakistan working together to make the country stronger and more stable .
" It should be a relationship based on a very clear message : that it is not right to have any relationship with groups that are promoting terror , " Mr Cameron said .
" Democratic states that want to be part of the developed world cannot do that .
The message to Pakistan from the US and the UK is very clear on that point . "
His comments are likely to be welcomed by officials in Delhi , which has long accused its neighbour of backing attacks on Indian targets .

WEB EXTRA :
If you have n't gotten enough of ginger beef ... here is an extended version of Khalil 's interview with Calgary food reviewer , John Gilchrist .
LISTEN NOW :
Everybody knew except for Gus Vagenas .
The TTC knew last Friday .
His neighbours in the Greenwood community knew Monday .
Vagenas found out — from the Star — on Tuesday .
The TTC will expropriate Vagenas ’s property at 9 Linnsmore Cres. in order to build an emergency exit for the Greenwood subway station .
They are also building an emergency exit at the Donlands subway stop .
“ Nobody told me up to now — that ’s crazy , ” a stunned Vagenas said , who scrambled to get in touch with his daughter to make sense of the news .
The transit commission originally proposed to expropriate four houses , two near each station , but community groups mobilized and pitched alternative solutions .
One of those proposals included Vagenas ’s property to be sacrificed — without his knowledge .
The TTC accepted the proposal , which saved the other two houses .
Alternate plans also saved the other two house , leaving just Vagenas ’s property as the only casualty .
Neighbours assumed it was derelict , including Steve Martin , a Greenwood community spokesperson .
“ There ’s no way to talk to anyone , ” Martin said .
“ No one lives there . ”
Cheers erupted at a community meeting Monday when the TTC decided to expropriate Vagenas ’s house rather than the other two units .
The TTC later admitted that they had n’t even spoken with Vagenas before the announcement .
The house has been vacant for years as Vagenas slowly worked on gutting the house and reconstructing it .
He hoped to present the finished product to one of his daughters as a gift one day .
Vagenas lives nearby and co-owns the large property at the corner of Linnsmore Cres. and Danforth Ave .
He heard the initial proposal through the news and was under the assumption that the TTC would follow its original plan to expropriate two houses at 245 and 247 Strathmore Blvd .
The TTC decided that the property at 9 Linnsmore Cres. was a viable option for the second exit last Friday , according to transit spokesperson Brad Ross .
When first contacted around 11 a.m. Tuesday , Vagenas was confused , initially thinking that the TTC was still examining the two houses on Strathmore , but also wanted to put an offer on his place .
“ Well , they can look , but I ’m not interested in selling , ” said Vagenas , 67 , who was n’t aware of Monday night ’s meeting .
When it became clear that his house was targeted for expropriation , rather than the other two units , Vagenas wanted to know who to call .
“ It ’s a very crazy situation , ” said Vagenas , “ They do n’t even talk to me and they want to make a decision tomorrow ( Wednesday ) and I do n’t even know where this meeting is . ”
Unfortunately for Vagenas , the decision has already been made .
His property will belong to the city and the TTC once the commission passes the recommendation at a meeting on Wednesday .
“ For all intents and purposes that is the option we are recommending and .
. . that is to have a second exit where 9 Linnsmore currently stands , ” Ross said .
The city will enter into negotiations with Vagenas to acquire his property for market value .
If negotiations break down , the city still has expropriation at its disposal , according to Ross .
Vagenas was shocked that his neighbours would figuratively throw him and house under the bus .
But expropriating Vagenas property was the option put forth by Martin and the Greenwood community .
“ I think , to me , it ’s a much better solution , ” Martin said .
“ In truth , in a couple of years from now he ’ll tell you that it was actually a good thing for him as well . ”
Vagenas ’s daughter , Soula , disagreed .

“ It would have been nice to hear something , ” an emotional Soula said .
Neighbours said they tried to contact Vagenas .
“ Regardless of what it is , it ’s his house , ” Soula said .
“ We live in a democratic society — you do n’t just go in and say ‘ we ’re taking over your house , period . ’ ”
If you have a question , just ask .
Facebook has an answer .
The site launched a beta version of its new " Facebook Questions " service today , a feature which allows users to ask a question and then have anyone in the Facebook community take a crack at answering it .
Questions are posed from a new " Ask Question " button on a users profile , and are visible to all of that persons friends , as well as the entire Facebook community .
Users also have the option to add a photo or poll to the question , making it easy to get an opinion on everything from what color paint would look best in your bathroom to your next hairstyle .
( click on either image to zoom )
Questions posed using the service can also be tagged as a specific topic , and then will be shown to Facebook users who have expressed an interest in that topic .
For instance if you are a wine connoisseur , then you can search for " wine " and answer questions about vino .
All of the questions on the site are searchable and can be answered or read by anyone .
Opening the questions up to be answered by the entire Facebook community allows users to get a little more out of the service .
For instance if you 're going on a trip , you can get advice from locals in the area on where to eat and what to do .
If you need help with you car you can get advice from a mechanic , rather than your friend who just thinks they know about cars .
Facebook Questions puts itself directly in competition with other question and answer sites such as Ask.com and Yahoo Answers .
With 500 million Facebook users and counting , that competition is bound to be a fierce one .
Facebook Questions is currently only available to a small number of Facebook users with plans to roll the service out to the rest of Facebook as quickly as possible .
What do you think about Facebook Questions ?
Can you see yourself using the service ?
I got an e-mail from a group called 21st Century Democrats , bemoaning the fact that a recent poll shows that 55 % of likely voters said that the word “ socialist ” describes Obama and his policies .
The 21st Century Democrats said , “ You and I know [ that ] is not the case . ”
I only wish it were !
I wish Obama had pressed for single - payer national health care .
I wish Obama had nationalized Citicorp and Bank of America , rather than bail them out .
I wish he would have favored breaking up the rest of the big banks so they could n’t destroy our economy .
I wish he would have forced any banks taking federal bailout money to freeze foreclosures for at least a year and freeze interest rates on mortgages and credit cards .
I wish Obama would have proposed redistributing income from the wealthy to those who really need it by raising the marginal income tax , and the capital gains tax , and the estate tax .
I wish Obama would have proposed a transaction tax on every stock sale so as to curb speculation .
I wish Obama would have proposed raising the minimum wage to $ 10 an hour , as Ralph Nader has proposed .
I wish Obama would have replaced Ben Bernanke at the Fed with Nobel Prize - winning economist Joseph Stiglitz .
I wish Obama would have come out for democratizing the Fed , as Dennis Kucinich has recommended .
I wish Obama would have proposed a public works program to put every American who needs a job to work .
I wish Obama would have ordered every federal building to be installed with a solar panel , and almost every car in the federal fleet to be a hybrid or electric car .
I wish Obama would have proposed opening federal grocery stores in areas that are food deserts .
I wish Obama would have addressed the cruel problem of poverty in America .
I wish Obama would have proposed 12 months of paid maternity and paternity leave , mandatory paid sick leave , and federal child care .
I wish Obama would have advocated the nationalization of the armament companies , as Sen. Robert La Follette did back in 1924 .
I wish Obama would have promoted ideas of worker participation in management , as it prevails in Germany , for instance .
No decent socialist would have implemented policies that have left unemployment at over 9 percent and foreclosures at record heights .
No decent socialist would have let the banks get off so easily .
No decent socialist would have been caught dead praising the CEOs of Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase and justifying their obscene salaries the way Obama did .
( “ I know both those guys ; they are very savvy businessmen .
I , like most of the American people , do n’t begrudge people success or wealth .
That is part of the free - market system . ” )
No decent socialist would have left the health insurance industries in the driver ’s seat .
No decent socialist would have empowered a panel to advocate the cutting of Social Security , Medicare , and Medicaid .
No decent socialist would have expanded the war in Afghanistan , a hopeless war being fought by the sons and daughters of America ’s working class .
So , no , Obama is n’t a socialist .
Not even close .
But we ’d be a lot better off in this country if he were .

Mass grave in northern Mexico contains 50 bodies Published duration 24 July 2010
media caption Police found blood on an earthen ramp and traces of petrol at the bottom , where victims may have been tortured .
The Mexican authorities say they have recovered more than 50 bodies from a clandestine cemetery in the northern state of Nuevo Leon .
The dead are thought to be victims of drugs gangs who have been fighting for control of smuggling routes into the United States .
Investigators have been using heavy machinery to dig for the bodies outside the city of Monterrey .
Forensic experts are working to identify the dead .
" The majority of the bodies have tattoos which could give us an indication about whether they belonged to one group or other and whether they were linked to organised crime " said state attorney general Alejandro Garza y Garza .
Some have bullet wounds , and some are badly burned .
Almost all the victims were men .
Refrigerated lorries are being used to store the bodies because local morgues do not have enough room .
Torture
The remote site near a rubbish dump was discovered by the army after an anonymous tip - off .
Most of the bodies were buried in deep pits , but others were found on or near the surface .
Investigators believe drug gangs used the spot to torture and kill their victims .
In the past weeks , two other mass grave sites have been discovered in Nuevo Leon , which is the scene of a fierce battle between between rival drugs gangs .
The powerful Gulf cartel has been fighting its former allies , the Zetas , for control of lucrative smuggling routes to the US .
More than 200 people have disappeared in the border state over the past three years .
Funny Face Off
Guest Comic Artist : Part Two !
Today ’s comic was sent in by none other than cubist painter , Pablo PIcasso .
Here we can see a seldom show cartoon by the master painter ’s “ Comic Period ” , expressing his love for ugly face contests .
District 6 candidate Terry Kemple was born to dirty fucking hippie parents and quickly fell prey to the evil secular elements of society - a society which forced him to choose to make himself a slave !
He continues ...
And asks :
By the early 1980's , Kemple had evolved into a weak , drunken godless shell of a human being , but his pickled brain nonetheless made him a legend in his mind as he purposelessly motored the Northeast on boozy two - wheeled excursions , occasionally threatening his minor offspring with " a ride to Pennsylvania . "
Kemple reinvented himself in the mid ' 80s .
He was an alcoholic , divorced , separated from his daughters for 10 years .
He would come by on his motorcycle to see the kids in Connecticut .
He would say crazy things like , " Let 's take a ride to Pennsylvania . " ...
In 1986 , Kemple paid a visit to his oldest brother , Morry , headmaster of a Christian school in Jacksonville .
He went to a tent revival on Sunday with Morry 's family .
The star speaker was Tim Lee , the famous evangelist who had lost both his legs in Vietnam .
Like Kemple , Lee had been rebellious , godless ....
In the revival tent , Kemple felt overwhelmed .
Tim Lee had lost his legs .
He had lost his children .
He went back that night to hear Lee tell the story again .
Kemple told brother Morry he wanted to change .
Morry urged him to get started .
" Find a church that preaches the Bible . "
Kemple lived just a few blocks from Bell Shoals Baptist Church .
First thing he did was join the Bible class for singles .
First , Kemple leveraged Bible verses to convince his new church lady girlfriend to get a divorce .
Then they married and Terry leveraged his shiny new Jesus - loving family - man cred to take on some of the most pressing issues of our times .
He has made the protection of children his mission .
He has hosted sexual abstinence rallies for thousands of teenagers , lobbied for right - to - life laws , declared war on lap dancing .
He cruises Christian Web sites .
He collects evidence of God 's banishment from classrooms , of porn­ographers ' subversion of the First Amendment .
Kemple articulates an absolutist view — that homosexuals are stealing children from Christians by indoctrinating the young to gay lifestyles .
He calls it the " homosexual agenda . "
Gay marriages pose the biggest threat of all .
Recently , Kemple has fought to give teachers the Academic Freedom to refute the Darwinist lies that are taught as " Biology , " and he was a big part of the successful Florida campaign to deny the homosexuals their perverted marriage agenda item .
Oh , and he wants kids to be taught abstinence only .
In elementary school AND in college .
And how does that play out in the arena of sex education in public schools ?
One of the things that 's mentioned most frequently in the Bible is sexual immorality and how we are supposed to refrain from it .
Much of the education that our kids get today ... encourages them to become sexually involved at earlier and earlier ages ....
I 'm old enough to remember when we were n't encouraged to have sex in school , and we did n't have sex .
So are you saying that schools are encouraging kids to have sex ?
Yes ....
So then I do n't suppose you would agree with the proposed legislation called the Healthy Teens
Act that would require school districts to emphasize abstinence while teaching students how to protect themselves from disease and pregnancy ?
No ....
So you 're advocating abstinence only sex education for college students ?
Why not ?
We need to turn that group around and give them some inducement not to be sexually active .
I 'm not actually old enough to remember when we did n't have sex .
If I ever do get that old , I hope that someone will shoot me .
The District 6 race is crowded , but only the top 2 vote getters in the 4 - way non-partisan primary will advance to the November ballot .
Incumbent April Griffin , backed by unions and other progressive groups , should be favored , but Kemple 's church connections are proving to be lucrative .
Challenger Terry Kemple jumped to an early lead in campaign contributions , reporting $ 16,100 in April compared to $ 3,024 for incumbent April Griffin .
Griffin , 41 , of Temple Terrace , is seeking her second term on the board and said she will report about $ 16,000 in contributions by the next deadline .
Her donors include Iron Workers Local 397 , the Hillsborough County Agricultural PAC , and retired principal Manuel Duran .
... Kemple , 63 , of Brandon , president of the Christian - based Community Issues Council , said he has benefitted from the generosity of friends at church and in the community .
Kemple expects to report a total of $ 27,000 in contributions by the July 23 deadline .
Fifty - three of Kemple 's 63 contributions are for $ 100 or more , and 20 are for $ 500 or more .
He received $ 300 from Orlando personal injury attorney John Stemberger , president of the conservative Florida Family Policy Council , whose interests tend to attract campaign money and votes , political analysts say .
Other top Kemple contributors include Bart Azzarelli of Dallas 1 Construction and Development in Thonotosassa ; Mary Ott Wood of Plant City , president of Florida West Coast Credit Union ; and 411 Communications of Tampa , a consulting firm whose clients have included Attorney General Bill McCollum and former U.S. Sen.
Mel Martinez .
Griffin and Kemple will probably advance to the next round to face each other in November when Kemple 's experience as an organizer combined with his notoriety and fundraising prowess among the local fundamentalist crowd could be enough to propel him to victory in a race that is off of most voters ' radars .
He certainly has a fundraising advantage right now , and he seems to be going out of his way to appear reasonable to low knowledge voters - his official website is useless if you want to know anything about him .
Luckily , some person has put together something a little more informative than the official Terry Kemple site .
But more important than making fun of him is supporting incumbent April Griffin .
The other side has been very successful in organizing to win local down ballot races such as this one for School Board .
They know how important these positions really are , and they are praying to win .
Spread the word about Terry Kemple : make sure voters in November know who they they are voting for and what their candidate stands for .
Kemple 's fundamentalist machine is going to turn out for him .
We have to turn out voters for April Griffin .
Support April Griffin for Hillsborough County School Board District 6 .

Hesher exited Sundance earlier this year with a fair amount of buzz — some good , some not so good .
Regardless , the film ’s star Joseph Gordon - Levitt ( a FlickSided fave ) continues to pick disparate projects and display excellent range well beyond his 29 years .
Mysterious Skin , Brick , ( 500 ) Days of Summer and Inception are evidence JGL is capable of nailing four different characters in four different types of movies .
Looks like we can add Hesher to the list as well .
In it he plays the titular role , a chain - smoking anarchist who mentors a young lad through a personal tragedy .
Natalie Portman co-stars as a Plain Jane cashier named Nicole who tries to steer the boy away from Hesher ’s bad influence .
In the following clip , Hesher helps Nicole navigate a fender - bender while showing off the giant middle finger tat on his back .
The flick is supposed to hit theaters this year , but no release date has been set .
Microscopic marine algae which form the basis of the ocean food chain are dying at a terrifying rate , scientists said today .
Phytoplankton , described as the ' fuel ' on which marine ecosystems run , are experiencing declines of about 1 per cent of the average total a year .
According to the researchers from Dalhousie University in Canada the annual falls translate to a 40 per cent drop in phytoplankton since 1950 .
The research into phytoplankton comes as a separate report today offered evidence that the world has been warming for the past 30 years .
The reduction in the amount of algae in the seas could have an impact on a wide range of species , from tiny zooplankton to marine mammals , seabirds , fish and humans .
If confirmed , the decline of the phytoplankton would be a more dramatic change change to nature 's delicate balance than the loss of the tropical rainforests , scientist said .
The research , published in the journal Nature , said the declines were linked to rising sea-surface temperatures and changes in the conditions of the ocean , particularly close to the equator .
Most of the declines were seen in polar and tropical regions and in the open ocean , where most phytoplankton are produced .
The scientists suggested that in warmer oceans there was less movement between the layers of the sea , reducing the amount of nutrients delivered from deep water to the surface ocean .
As phytoplankton need both sunlight and nutrients to grow , the limits on the amount of nutrients in the upper layer of the sea affects production of the algae .
In addition , large - scale fluctuations in the climate , such as El Nino in the Pacific , affect phytoplankton on a year - to - year basis , the scientists said .
The research adds to the evidence that global warming was altering the oceans , with the changes in phytoplankton potentially having an impact on the health of the seas and on fisheries which people rely on for food .
Lead author Daniel Boyce said : ' Phytoplankton is the fuel on which marine ecosystems run .
A decline in phytoplankton affects everything up the food chain , including humans .
Co-author Boris Worm , said : ' Phytoplankton are a critical part of our planetary life support system .
' They produce half of the oxygen we breathe , draw down surface carbon dioxide and ultimately support all our fisheries .
' An ocean with less phytoplankton will function differently and this has to be accounted for in our management efforts . '
Fellow author Marlon Lewis added : ' Climate - driven phytoplankton declines are another important dimension of global change in the oceans , which are already stressed by the effects of fishing and pollution . '
It comes as scientists today announced that the world is ' unequivocally ' warming and has been for the past 30 years .
Researchers at the Met Office compiled data from a series of several independent studies including sea levels , air temperature , humidity and glacier loss .
The review also said the past decade had been the warmest on record , while Met Office scientists said this year was on track to be the warmest ever .
The report comes in the wake of the ' climategate ' furore around climate science , which stemmed from emails stolen from the University of East Anglia 's Climatic Research Unit ( CRU ) .
The scandal prompted prompted claims from sceptics that scientists were manipulating data to back up a theory of global warming .
They were since been cleared of any wrongdoing but were accused by an inquiry set up in the wake of the scandal of being secretive and unhelpful .
But today 's report published as part of the annual State of the Climate review led by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration , shows that global warming is ' undeniable ' , scientists said .
The Met Office looked at surface temperature records and other aspects of climate that scientists predict will change as a result of increased levels of greenhouse gases , such as warming of the ocean , increased humidity and reductions in Arctic sea ice .
For each of the 10 indicators they compiled several studies done independently of each other , revealing broad agreement between different analyses on what was happening to the climate .
Seven of the areas , including air and sea surface temperatures , the amount of heat in the ocean and humidity , were on the rise , while three areas - the extent of Arctic sea ice , glaciers and winter snow cover in the northern hemisphere - were in decline .
Dr Stott said : ' Despite the variability caused by short - term changes , the analysis conducted for this report illustrates why we are so confident the world is warming .
' When we look at air temperature and other indicators of climate , we see highs and lows in the data from year to year because of natural variability .
' Understanding climate change requires looking at the longer - term record .
When we follow decade - to - decade trends using different data sets and independent analyses from around the world , we see clear and unmistakable signs of a warming world . '
Many believe that the rise in temperatures around the world is a natural , cyclical process of the world warming and cooling over time .
An Ipsos Mori survey of 1,822 people for Cardiff University in June found 40 per cent believed the seriousness of global warming was exaggerated .
But Dr Stott said studies showed the changes were consistent with an increase in greenhouse gases , which provided the ' glaringly obvious explanation ' for why the climate was changing .
But he said it was possible the reason for the warming could be due to something scientists had not thought of - an ' unknown unknown ' - but the patterns of change were not consistent with other suggested causes , such as solar activity or volcanoes .
The merge , traffic , and various busted website issues have all sort of settled out over the last few months , so the bug fixes and corresponding releases should be a little bit more regular now .
At least until the next weird thing comes up .
L'Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) est un traité international sur le droit d'auteur , négocié de façon informelle et en secret entre l'Australie , la Corée du Sud , la Nouvelle - Zélande , le Mexique , la Jordanie , le Maroc , Singapour , les Etats - Unis , l'Union européenne , la Suisse , le Japon , les Emirats arabes unis et le Canada , depuis 2007 .
Le but du traité serait d'harmoniser la manière dont ces pays protègent la propriété intellectuelle , tant en ce qui concerne la contrefaçon " classique " ( médicaments , sacs … ) que la contrefaçon numérique ( téléchargement illégal ) .
Décryptage avec Michael Geist , chercheur en droit d'Internet à l'université d'Ottawa , au Canada .
La Chine et l'Inde laissent entendre qu'elles s'opposeront à l'ACTA .
Pourquoi ces deux poids lourds économiques sont - ils contre ce traité ?
Michael Geist :
Ce n'est pas une surprise ; une telle possibilité était déjà évoquée il y a un an .
Je pense que l'ACTA représente une menace significative pour de nombreux pays en voie de développement .
Il réduirait leur marge de manœuvre au sein des institutions que sont l'Organisation mondiale de la propriété intellectuelle ( OMPI ) et l'Organisation mondiale du commerce ( OMC ) .
Surtout , les Etats - Unis et l'Europe considèrent que l'ACTA ne doit pas s'appliquer aux seuls pays qui négocient , mais à tous les pays .
La Chine et l'Inde craignent donc de devoir se plier aux standards édictés par l'ACTA , alors qu'elles sont exclues des négociations .
La Commission européenne a publié fin avril une " version consolidée " du traité .
Négociée depuis plus de deux ans , elle n'avait pas fait l'objet jusqu'alors de communication officielle .
Pourquoi l'Inde et la Chine se manifestent - elles seulement aujourd ' hui ?
Le calendrier présente une opportunité pour les deux pays : l'Organisation mondiale du commerce réunit , les 8 et 9 juin , un conseil sur les aspects des droits de propriété intellectuelle qui touchent au commerce .
Le fait qu'une version " officielle " ait été rendue publique , fin avril , permet aussi aux gouvernements de se positionner plus facilement , car il n'existait jusqu'alors que des versions non-officielles , disponibles sur Internet .
Par ailleurs , le prochain tour de négociations sur l'ACTA aura lieu dans trois semaines en Suisse .
Les négociateurs font pression pour que l'accord soit entériné d'ici la fin de l'année .
Si les pays qui souhaitent s'opposer ne parlent pas maintenant , il sera peut - être bientôt trop tard ...
De telles pressions de la part de l'Inde et de la Chine peuvent - elles réellement peser sur les négociations ?
Des organisations non-gouvernementales sont déjà parvenues à faire pression sur les gouvernements afin qu'ils fassent preuve de transparence et publient les documents des tractations .
Si des Etats comme l'Inde et la Chine critiquent à la fois le processus et la substance des négociations , cela peut avoir un impact .
D'autres pays envisagent - ils de rejoindre le front sino - indien ?
Certains Etats , comme le Brésil , l'Argentine et l'Egypte , semblent partager l'avis de la Chine et de l'Inde .
La manière dont les négociateurs d'ACTA vont intégrer cette opposition aura une influence sur la crédibilité de l'accord .
Si le traité ACTA doit ensuite s'imposer à tous , il faut que chacun soit inclus dans les négociations dès le début .
Propos recueillis par Laurent Checola
Inspired by the Tour de France ?
Time to start training for next year 's amateur Étape challenge , a section of cycling 's toughest race .
Or you could do it the Kevin Rushby way ...
Coming up the long hill behind the village of Acklam in the Yorkshire wolds , I stopped the bike and lay down among the scarlet poppies .
The sun was truly hot for the first time in the year , the land shimmering in haze .
I lay down my straw hat and prepared to snooze .
This was my kind of bicycle training session .
Nothing to it .
At some point later I heard a swish of tyres swooping down the lane towards me .
I sat up and watched as a phalanx of Lycra - clad road bike titans swept past in a blaze of product endorsements .
No one looked at me , or if they did I could n't tell as they were all wearing sun visors .
In a second they were gone .
My peace was ruined .
My peace of mind that is .
I telephoned my brother , Chris , who is into road bikes .
" I 've come out for a ride because I 've been given the chance to enter a cycle event , " I said .
" It 's called the Étape du Tour . "
There was a long silence .
" You are joking ? "
" No , it 's in a couple of months – in the Pyrenees somewhere . "
" That 's the toughest amateur cycling event in the world , " he said authoritatively .
" People spend years preparing .
I think this year 's route follows the hardest stage of the Tour de France : the Col du Tourmalet – also known as the Assassin .
More than 100 miles and over 4,000 m of climbing .
People die . "
I lay back in the poppies .
" So should I take the shopping basket off ? "
There is , I had discovered , a whole world of sporting travel options : marathons , triathlons , swims and cycle rides – challenges waiting to be taken up by those who want a trip with bite .
My way in to the Étape , open to anyone on production of a doctor 's certificate of good health , was to apply through the UK charity Get Kids Going , which specialises in placing competitors on events of their choice , in return for raising money for disabled children .
There were dozens of other , equally exhausting options around the globe , but the Étape was the one for me .
Not only is 2010 the centenary of the Tour de France taking in the Pyrenees , but the Tourmalet was the ultimate , the greatest , the man-eater .
" Yes , " agreed my brother , " but popping down to the shops on your rust - bucket is not training .
You 've got to get serious . "
The world of road bikes , I quickly learned , is definitely serious .
David Ward from Giant Bikes talked me through chain sets , frames and cranks until my head was spinning .
Then he got on to calories and ionic balancing .
" It 's going to take you 10 hours , " he said , " so nutrition is crucial . "
I shrugged .
" Maybe take sandwiches ?
Local patisserie ? "
David gave me a withering look .
" You 'll need energy gels and high - calorie drinks .
They 'll give you at least 10 % extra . "
I smiled politely .
Consumerisation , I thought .
My Central Asia - specialist friend Bruce Wannell put his own spin on it : " You want tarkhan , the mix of dried mulberries and walnuts used by Afghan fighters – it's the snack food that defeated the Russians . "
Next time we met he handed over a large bag of it .
" With the compliments of the Panjshir valley . "
Kevin Rushby , and the dog , in the Yorkshire wolds – before the arrival of the superbike .

My first foray on my superbike did not go well .
Riding along at walking pace , I turned to look at the dog – he'd insisted on coming along – and the front wheel dived from under me .
As I went down my left knee gave a nasty click and I momentarily blacked out .
When I came round I was lying on the ground and two men in cycling gear were looking down at me .
" Clip - on pedals – lethal , " said one .
" Worth 30 % extra on hills , " observed the other .
Word of my little mishap spread and people rang to offer advice :
" Do n't worry .
French roads are much safer – better tarmac .
That 's worth 3 % extra . "
" Shave your legs for a 2 % speed advantage . "
Adding up all my advantage points , I discovered I was almost at the finish .
But then this confidence – so generously donated – was snatched away with a simple , but terrifying , refrain : " Two months ' training !
At your age !
The Broom Wagon is gonna get you . "
The broom wagon is a nasty cycling institution where the stragglers , pootling along quite nicely , are suddenly swept up and out of the race for being too slow .
But despite my burgeoning broom wagon fear and a sore knee , my pre-Étape training was going well .
I enjoyed my rides along lovely back roads of the Yorkshire wolds .
I saw roe deer standing by the lanes , owls watching from fence posts ; a weasel almost ran under my wheel .
I noticed how these roads were constantly criss - crossed by small creatures : beetles , frogs , lizards , caterpillars and , on one occasion , a foot - long slow worm .
The days went by too fast .
Two weeks before the Étape , I managed 100 miles in seven hours .
On the television I watched the first days of the Tour itself .
Men and machines in a catastrophic tangle – a reminder that no amount of training can prepare for everything .

" This year 's Tour , " the commentator said , " will be decided in the Pyrenees , probably on the toughest stage , the Tourmalet . "
My local bike shops in York , Cycle Heaven and Fulford Cycles , helped calm my fears and gave lots of useful advice .
By mid-July I was as ready as I would ever be .
I dismantled the Giant and took the train to Toulouse , then a hire car to Pau .
At 5.30 am on the big day I headed in the dark towards town and the start .
There were cyclists everywhere , all rushing to get to their starting positions .
My number was 9,955 in a field of 10,000 , so I was at the back .
A car cut across me .
Some drunks shouted .
I touched the kerb at 20 mph and suddenly I was skidding along the road on my side .
People ran to help and an English voice shouted a commentary : " He 's bleeding !
He 's getting up .
He 's worried about his bike ...
Oh , his bike is knackered . "
A local twisted the handlebars back straight .
" Are the wheels buckled ? "
No , it was just the brakes that had been knocked .
Together we adjusted them .
I got back on , blood trickling down my leg and arm .
At the start I was still early enough to claim a front position in the pen for the last 1,000 riders .
The atmosphere was electric .
I felt like first - world - war cannon fodder about to go over the top .
There are so many routes to failure : a mass pile - up , bike breakdown , or that defect in your heart that will only come out in extremis on the last climb .
Mark from Australia was white - faced : " It 's not fear , " he claimed , " just zinc . "
Each had a tale of fortitude to get here .
There was Daniel from Sydney who had a cougar run out on him when he was training in Colorado .
He also had a multiple fracture of his forearm after a crash , set in a bike - friendly cast by his understanding doctor .
Chris from Teesside had trained on the same hills as me .
" Two months ' training ? " he said sceptically , " you 'll never make it . "
But we all shook hands and wished each other luck .
Seven o'clock came and went , but we were n't moving .
At half past we rolled across the start .
Then we were shifting , sweeping down Pau 's streets , part of the oldest Grand Prix circuit in the world , past the train station at 30 mph .
Already there were casualties : bloodied men sitting on the verges , bikes twisted .
We crossed the river and I was enjoying myself .
The early sun was breaking through the trees , and villagers were standing by the road ringing cow bells and yelling " Courage ! "
A man played an accordion .
Everyone was out in the squares , by the fountains and old churches .
We started climbing , but this was just a lung - opener , not the real thing .
At Escot I was 20 minutes ahead of the broom wagon , but then we turned uphill , a six - mile slog up 8 oom to the Col de Marie - Blanque .
Any chatting stopped .
Some riders got off .
Then , half a mile from the summit , there was a crash and everyone had to dismount .
Then came another baptism of fire : the big descent : swooping down through the trees at breakneck speed .
Within minutes my forearms were aching from holding the brakes , so I just let go and joined the madcaps .
The result was total wild exhilaration .
Under the trees the air was cold and whipped tears from my ears .
The feeding station at the bottom was a gleeful spree of complimentary bananas , flapjacks and water .
I 'd already been munching my tarkhan and it was working fine .
With the first climb over and some food inside me , I really began to roll .
We were in the foothills of the Pyrenees , and early clouds lay below us in the valleys , high peaks looming ahead .
My head emptied of thoughts and worries .
I thought of nothing .
My existence was only the click of the gears .
I was meditating at 20 mph .
As we climbed the second challenge , Col du Soulor , I broke the silence to chat to Malena , a Danish woman .
" Why are there so few female riders ? " I asked .
" It 's becoming more popular , " she said .
" In France Jeannie Longo is still a champion rider and she is over 50 .
Women are starting to realise that cycling can be great exercise for them . "
After Soulor came another epic descent , mile upon mile of fast looping roads and beautiful high Pyrenean villages .
But at 80 miles we were heading up in to the mountains again .
At the last food stop , the celebratory chatter of the early stops had gone .
Everyone was worrying about the final climb : 1,600 m without a spot of shade .
I ate flapjacks , oranges , apples , cake and the last of my tarkhan .
They say a rider can burn 10,000 calories on the Étape , and for many it is just too much : the muscles simply run out of energy and can't get any more .
At that point you stop .
Cyclists call it " bonking " .
And on the Tourmalet , once you 've bonked , the only way back is in a broom wagon .
I was doing well though : 40 minutes ahead of the broom .
The climb started gently , curling alongside an icy blue river fed by streams tumbling down the hills .
Many riders stopped to take a dunk .
Imperceptibly the gradient increased .
I was on my last gear and out of the saddle every hundred metres , but there were still 12 miles to go .
My speed dropped to 4mph and then 3 ½ .
Some riders were lying in the shade , asleep .
Some were being attended to .
Most , however , were just grimly going on .

The final three miles was sheer torture .
The Tourmalet towered over us , its pale grey crags seeming never to come any closer .
A mile from the top , I simply came to a halt and was about to topple sideways when a spectator grabbed me .
I sat on the grass , admiring the hillside covered in blue irises .
Someone poured cold mountain water over my head .
I fumbled in my saddlebag and found my last resort : one of the energy gels that I swore I would n't use .
It tasted like heavenly nectar .
I got up and back on the bike .
The finish came at 2,115 m and when I crossed the line , I had been on the bike for 11 hours .
I collected my medal and my food bag .
Some people were celebrating , hugging each other and screaming , but I just sat down beside another competitor , who was curled up in a deep peaceful sleep .
My brain had not yet started working and I was enjoying the dreaminess , a reverie tinged with a melancholy sense that this whole grand enterprise was over and ordinary life would soon resume .
But then a voice disturbed me .
" Kevin ! "
It was Chris from Teesside .
" I take my hat off to you , " he said , " I really did n't think it could be done on two months ' training . "
Well , I say it can be done and it should : for the thrill , the excitement , the sense of achievement , the meditative pleasure of rolling through magnificent mountains – and the 20lb of excess weight I lost .
When the Tour de France finishes in the Champs Elysées tomorrow , I will be cheering them on , and afterwards , maybe I 'll get the bike out and head for the hills once more .
Q. Can I wish you a happy birthday ahead of schedule ?
A . You can .
And you can put the gift in the post or you can leave it at the concierge .
Q. What would you like to get this year ?
A . You know what I ’m asking for : peace and love .
Q. How are you feeling about the number 70 ?
A . As far as I ’m concerned , in my head , I ’m 24 .
That ’s just how it is .
The number , yeah , it ’s high .
But I just felt I ’ve got to celebrate it .
I ’m on my feet and I ’m doing what I love to do , and I ’m in a profession , as a musician , where we can go on for as long as we can go on .
I ’m not hiding from it , you know .
Q . When you were 24 what did you think you ’d be doing at age 70 ?
A. I do n’t know , but when I was 22 , actually , I remember this so well , and I was playing , and there was another band , and these people in that other band were 40 , and I was saying , “ My God , you ’re still doing it ? ” [ laughs ]
Which does n’t look funny in black and white , but it was incredible , and now I ’m waaaaay past 40 .
My new hero is B. B. King .
I have a great line : B. B. is still playing , even though he is sitting down now .
But hey , I ’m sitting down already .
You ’ve just got to get on with it .
I ’d like to be out there pretending I ’m only 55 , but I ’m not .
Q . What seems like an advanced age to you now ?
A. I think 90 .
But we ’ll see .
It ’s a birthday at a time .

Well !
I 've sure had a nice relaxing blog - free year .
No worries , no haters , no Nooglers wandering by my office and staring at me through the window as if they expect me to crap in my hand and hurl it at them .
Not that I was n't tempted .
Nope , it 's just been peace and quiet and reading and coding and practicing my guitar and stuff .
It 's been awesome .
And now that everyone 's completely forgotten who I am , or whatever exactly I 'd said that made them feel all butthurt inside -- as measured by my incoming email rate , which is finally near - zero -- I figure it 's probably safe to get back in the water .
I 'm not really sure what my plans are going forward , other than staying employed at Google until the day comes when I need one of their comfy , brightly - colored caskets .
Other than that , my plans are flexible .
I 'm feeling downright leisurely at the moment .
I realize now that I was trying way too hard to change the world via blogging , and it made me care maybe just a little too much .
This was bad for my mental and emotional health .
Caring is fine .
Lots of things are worth caring about .
Very few of them merit sacrificing your health .
Fortunately during my ad - hoc sabbatical I was able to gain some new perspectives by distancing myself a bit from the constant storm going on in the tech world .
One nice perspective I gained is this :.
Reddit is a huge , living , breathing demonstration of this , since essentially no reddit post ever goes above maybe 80 % approval , and a " good " post seems to hover around 65 % - 70 % liked .
That made me feel better about the haters .
Haters abound .
They 're just a fact of life , part of the human condition .
There 's no need to waste energy hating haters .
Another perspective I gained was that decorating your mansion with works of art you know nothing about is amazingly rewarding , as long as you can mix it up by leaping across rooftops and assassinating bad guys and hanging with your buddy Leonardo .
I swear , if they ever make a movie about my life , the handsome and dashing actor who plays me , when asked on his deathbed which of life 's pleasures had given him the greatest happiness , will say something cheesy that makes the audience ooh and aww with appreciation , but it 'll be total Hollywood bullshit , because what I really will have said was " gaming " .
Yet another perspective I gained is that I now actually agree with everyone who complained that my blog posts were too long .
Reddit has ruined my attention span for online material .
There seems to be no such thing as too frequent , but there 's definitely such thing as too long .
So I 'll be better about that .
I used to have this pet theory that the length of my blogs is a big part of why they 've been noticed at all .
I mean , look at this dude .
If he 'd written only one or two crazy things , he'd be just another nutjob , but by dint of almost superhuman persistence he 's managed to get the entire world to laugh at him .
I was sort of aiming for getting people to laugh with me , but I used the same basic recipe as Time Cube Dude .
And the formula seemed to be working , modulo the haters .
However , Dave Barry -- my Personal Childhood Hero ( 66 % liked ! ) -- always wrote his columns in chunks of 800 words , even if it necessitated inserting filler words such as " booger " and " legislative session " into his articles about wine tasting or car engines or bat guano , or whatever it was that caught his fancy that week .
Overall it seems likely that post - length is less important than factors such as quality , consistency , passion , relevance , and legislative booger session .
So I was originally thinking of writing up to a maximum of 800 words today , and I 'm at about 500 now , but I 've been really successful at my Not Caring Too Much Initiative , so ... later !
Nice chatting with ya .
Cheerio !... Just to ensure this post is n't entirely devoid of content I 'll share something important that I learned last year .
Here 's what I learned : after Carpal Tunnel Syndrome , the second most common hand ailment is known as Trigger Finger Its more formal name is digital tenovaginitis stenosans , which is ancient Latin for " electronic hand inflamed vagina without writing " , which I believe is why most people prefer to call it Trigger Finger .
I have it , you know .
Trigger Finger , I mean , not an inflamed vagina .
Although Trigger Finger is " idiopathic " , a fancy word meaning that doctors do n't have a fucking clue what causes it , it is widely known in musical circles as a musician 's injury .
It happens to musicians who overpractice , usually in preparation for a recital , performance or recording session .
I found all this out after being diagnosed with it .
It is not idiopathic in my case .
I have the benefit of hindsight , and I know exactly what caused it .
It turns out that if you play a certain right - hand arpeggio on a classical guitar enough times -- where " certain arpeggio " here refers to Hector Villa - Lobos ' Etude No. 1 , and " enough times " is approximately 650,000 times in a 5 - month period -- you acquire Trigger Finger .
That 's not precisely what I was playing , but it 'll serve .
Trigger Finger is a painful , debilitating , demoralizing injury .
I highly recommend not letting it happen to you .
Your body will begin telling you when it 's time to ease up on the practice sessions .
Listen to your body when it says that .
As for specifics , there 's not much to tell .
My hand started hurting .
Then it hurt real bad for a month .
Ibuprofen and cold / hot packs did n't help .
It got steadily worse .
Even quitting guitar altogether for another month did n't help .
I could no longer use my right hand , and it was beginning to feel permanent .
I was n't even sure why it was happening .
I was terrified and I began to despair .
My Google doctor was great .
She referred me to a specialist -- a hand surgeon .
I told her I did n't really want to see a hand ... S - word .
I could barely say it aloud .
She reassured me that seeing a specialist did n't necessarily mean surgery .
They might have other tricks up their sleeves .
So I decided to brave it .
My first trip to the specialist only took about 15 minutes .
She listened to my disoriented bleating , asked me a few questions , gently felt my hand here and there , and informed me that I had Trigger Finger .
She said she was going to give me a cortisone shot .
She was pulling out a giant needle as she told me this .
It just sort of materialized from under the table , the way a knife appears in a bar fight .
It was a very large needle .
She explained calmly that the cortisone is a steroid that stays wherever you inject it .
They use it on athletes to reduce inflammation from certain injuries .
Then she stuck the giant needle all the way into the base of my right middle finger and squeezed .
Compared to the pain of my trigger finger , the injection felt like a mosquito bite .
She told me that I 'd start feeling better in a week , and in a month I 'd be pretty much all cleared up .
If not , I should come back and see her for more treatment .
And no , I was n't going to lose my hand .
It was kind of weird , but on my way back to my car I think someone had been cutting onions in the elevator .
A lot of onions .
In the last fifteen minutes my whole life had been handed back to me with an almost casual lack of concern .
I was overwhelmed with onions .
A month later I was back to see her .
The cortisone had helped a lot .
I gave it a 66 % approval rating .
She said she could give me another shot , or do surgery .
This time I 'd done my homework .
I elected for surgery .
That was back in September .
It was an interesting story in its own right , but the upshot is she did great .
And then after that there was a lot of physical therapy .
I typed the word " September " in the previous paragraph three times before I got it right .
The word does n't even have letters that need my right middle finger .
My right hand , which had shaped itself into an unusable , agonized claw between March and July , is still afraid to flex and extend my middle finger .
It 's up to , oh , a 95 % approval rating now , which I believe is phenomenally successful .
Who could ask more of a hand surgery ?
It could have been much worse .
Much much .
But that last 5 % is rough .
The haters in my hand are a constant reminder of the old pain .
When I type , or play piano or guitar , my right - hand fingers twist and curl in elaborate , incomprehensible dances to avoid a pain that is for the most part no longer there .
Yep , I think it 'll be easier to keep my blog posts shorter going forward .
Ironically , some good came out of the experience .
I 've switched to a sustainable new guitar style and a new repertoire , one I enjoy greatly .
And I now pay much more attention to economy of motion in my typing .
And I spend more time finding pain - saving Emacs shortcuts .
It makes me wonder what I might have achieved had I focused on it sooner .
Surgery notwithstanding , on the whole I still think it was a great year .
The year was in fact more complicated and more painful than I 've let on here , but that 's life for ya .
And now that I 'm rested up , I believe I 'm ready to start tech blogging again ... in moderation , anyway .
The rest and relaxation and research did wonders for me .
I used to have lot of open , long - standing concerns about the future of programming and productivity , but my sabbatical last year finally brought me some clojure Talk about caring too much .
I may explain this 650 k figure in a future blog post if I can ever get over my embarrassment .
The seasonal monsoon rains in Asia feed nearly half the world 's population , and when the rains fail to come , people can go hungry , or worse .
A new study of tree rings provides the most detailed record yet of at least four epic droughts that have shaken Asia over the last thousand years , from one that may have helped bring down China 's Ming Dynasty in 1644 , to another that caused tens of millions of people to starve to death in the late 1870s .
The study , published this week in the journal Science , is expected not only to help historians understand how environment has affected the past , but to aid scientists trying to understand the potential for large - scale disruptions of weather in the face of changing climate .
By sampling the wood of thousands of ancient trees across Asia , scientists at Columbia University 's Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory assembled an atlas of past droughts , gauging their relative severity across vast expanses of time and space .
" Global climate models fail to accurately simulate the Asian monsoon , and these limitations have hampered our ability to plan for future , potentially rapid and heretofore unexpected shifts in a warming world , " said Edward Cook , head of Lamont 's Tree Ring Lab , who led the study .
" Reliable instrumental data goes back only until 1950 .
This reconstruction gives climate modelers an enormous dataset that may produce some deep insights into the causes of Asian monsoon variability . "
There is some evidence that changes in the monsoon are driven at least in part by cyclical changes in sea-surface temperatures .
Some scientists have speculated that warming global temperatures could alter these cycles and possibly make some of them more intense , but at this point there is no consensus on whether or how they might change .
For some tree species , rainfall determines the width of their annual growth rings , and these rings are what the scientists were able to read .
The researchers spent more than 15 years traveling across Asia to locate trees old enough to provide long - term records .
The hunt took them to more than 300 sites , from Siberia down to Indonesia and northern Australia , as far west as Pakistan and as far east as Japan .
The project involved collaborations with numerous national governments , local villages and other university scientists .
" It 's everything from low - land rain forests to high in the Himalayas , " said study coauthor Kevin Anchukaitis , a Lamont tree ring scientist .
" You have a tremendous diversity of environment , climate influences and species . "
The tree -ring records in the study reveal at least four great droughts that are linked to catastrophic events in history .
For starters , the study suggests that climate may have played a powerful role in the 1644 fall of China 's Ming dynasty .
The tree rings provide additional evidence of a severe drought in China referenced in some historical texts as the worst in five centuries .
This study narrows it down to a three - year period , 1638 - 1641 .
The drought was most sharply expressed in northeastern China , near Beijing , and is thought to have influenced peasant rebellions that hastened the demise of the Ming .
Another severe monsoon failure came in 1756 - 1768 , coinciding with the collapse of kingdoms in what are now Vietnam , Myanmar and Thailand .
The drought roiled political structures all the way to Siberia , and the tree rings also indicate that western India was severely affected .
This drought is not documented in historical records ; scientists first identified it in teak rings from Thailand , and later in Vietnamese cypress trees .
Some historians have speculated that climate must have played a role for such sweeping political changes to have happened simultaneously ; fragmentary accounts suggest that dry periods may have been punctuated with devastating floods .
The study appears to provide an explanation for the so - called " strange parallels " that Victor Lieberman , an historian at the University of Michigan , has spent his career studying .
" It provides confirmation that there are very strong climate links between monsoon regimes in India , Southeast Asia and southern China , " said Lieberman in an interview .
Then , the so - called East India drought hit in 1790 - 1796 .
This one appears to have been felt worldwide , spreading civil unrest and socioeconomic turmoil .
For instance , in Mexico , water levels at Lake Pátzcuaro fell so much they gave rise to ownership disputes over the land that emerged .
In Europe , drought led to crop failures that preceded the French Revolution .
Famines hit India .
Perhaps the worst drought , the scientists found , was the Victorian - era " Great Drought " of 1876 - 1878 .
The effects were felt across the tropics ; by some estimates , resulting famines killed up to 30 million people .
According to the tree-ring evidence , the effects were especially acute in India , but extended as far away as China and present - day Indonesia .
Colonial - era policies left regional societies ill - equipped to deal with the drought 's consequences , as historian Mike Davis details in his book Late Victorian Holocausts .
Famine and cholera outbreaks at this time in colonial Vietnam fueled a peasant revolt against the French .
The study follows a related report last month by the Lamont tree - ring team suggesting that dramatic variations in the monsoon may have influenced the collapse of the ancient Khmer civilization at Angkor nearly 600 years ago , in what is now Cambodia .
That paper , appearing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , showed evidence of a mega - drought in the wider region around Angkor from the 1340s to the 1360s , followed by a more severe but shorter drought from the 1400s to 1420s .
The droughts were interspersed with severe flooding , and the kingdom collapsed shortly after .
The scientist who led that study , Brendan Buckley , coauthored the present drought atlas .
Scientists are n't exactly sure how factors such as volcanic eruptions , greenhouse gases and variations in solar output combine to drive the many variations in the monsoon over the long term .
Over shorter time periods , variations seem to be more closely linked to the El Niño - Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) , the warming and cooling of the tropical Pacific atmosphere - ocean system .
Separate studies suggest that El Niño , the warm phase of ENSO , often coincides with a weak monsoon and droughts ; it also seems linked to weather changes in Africa and parts of South America .
The deadly 1876 - 1878 drought coincided with one of the most extreme El Niños of the last 150 years .
However , the parallels are not perfect , so other factors may come into play at different times , including changes in snow cover over Asia and cycles of sea-surface temperature in the Indian Ocean .
There is intense interest in how El Niño and other phenomena may be affected by a warming climate , and how monsoon extremes may affect the growing populations that depend on the rains .
Southern China is currently suffering its worst drought in 80 to 100 years , bringing not only water shortages , but tensions with Southeast Asian nations downstream of its watersheds .
Data from the drought atlas is already providing information on particular regions , say the scientists .
Using the Indonesia tree ring records , for example , Lamont scientist and study coauthor Rosanne D'Arrigo has reconstructed stream flow in Java 's Citarum river basin , a region that waters much of Indonesia 's rice .
In a recent study in the journal Climate Dynamics , D'Arrigo found a close link between El Niños and weak monsoon rains or drought in Indonesia over the last 250 years .
The atlas is valuable to monsoon forecasters because the record is long enough and the spatial areas detailed enough that modelers can pick out short - term and long - term patterns , said Bin Wang , a meteorologist and monsoon modeler at the University of Hawaii who was not involved in the study .
" It is extremely valuable for validating climate models ' simulation and understanding their origins in terms of model physics , " he said .
Black Hat A researcher has uncovered a sophisticated check counterfeiting ring that uses compromised computers to steal and print millions of dollars worth of bogus invoices and then recruit money mules to cash them .
The highly automated scheme starts by infiltrating online check archiving and verification services that store huge numbers of previously cashed checks , Joe Stewart , director of malware research for Atlanta - based SecureWorks , told The Register .
It then scrapes online job sites for email addresses of people looking for work and sends personalized messages offering them positions performing financial transactions for an international company .
The scammers then use stolen credit card data to ship near exact replicas of the checks to those who respond .
“ They 're able to utilize this high - tech botnet to go out there , get the shipping labels , print them and pay for them with stolen credit cards , ” said Stewart , who was in Las Vegas for the Black Hat security conference that begins Wednesday .
“ That 's the cleverness of it .
So much of it is reliant on 21st century botnet technology to carry out what 's an old - school kind of crime . ”
Stewart was able to track the operation by infecting a lab computer and observing its interactions with command and control channels .
A database file the criminals carelessly exposed showed that 3,285 checks had been printed since June of 2009 and 2,884 job seekers had responded to the employment offer .
Assuming each check was written in amounts of $ 2,800 – a threshold sum that brings increased scrutiny to transactions – Stewart estimates the checks were valued at about $ 9 m .
Ironically , many of the check images were downloaded from services that merchants use to prevent check fraud .
One of the sites was breached using a SQL injection attack .
In other cases , they were accessed using account credentials from legitimate users that were stolen using the Zeus and Gozi password - stealing trojans .
“ They 're actually abusing anti-fraud systems in order to commit fraud , ” Stewart said .
“ The systems that are designed to prevent check fraud are actually being used to help the bad guys commit check fraud . ”
Stewart said he contacted some of the money mules who were recruited to cash the checks and send it along to Russia in return for keeping a percentage of the sum .
Most told Stewart that the transactions had n't gone through .
Still , the scheme cost shipping companies at least $ 65,000 in costs to deliver the counterfeit checks .
Stewart has dubbed the group , which he says is located in Russia , the “ BigBoss Operation ” because one of their malware components reaches out to a server located at bigbossfinance .
net .
The scheme first came to Stewart 's attention in April during an unrelated investigation .
When probing a new strain of the Zeus crimeware family , he discovered malware that used the PPTP , or point - to - point tunneling , protocol included in Microsoft Windows to establish a virtual private network with a remote server .
Fearing the malware represented a new threat , the researcher began to dig deeper .
Eventually , Stewart found the VPN functionality was used only to evade firewalls and network address translation services , rather than to encrypt traffic as it passed from command and control channels .
“ We found out it was a lot more boring that that , ” Stewart said .
“ It was not using any of these advanced features .
I do n't know if it's an evolution or something that shows [ that ] an old - school criminal who 's been doing this for a long time is able to adapt them for their own purposes .
The could n't do it without these modern components . ” ®

Listen to the fabulously successful discuss their lives , and you 're almost certain to hear them attribute their eventual successes to the challenges that they first faced and overcame .
Hardscrabble childhoods , menial jobs , discrimination , disabilities , doubt - these are the cliches of American autobiography .
And few would trade away their triumphs in exchange for an easier path through life .
But take a look at their children .
They do n't pick out failing schools for them to attend or arrange for them to spend their summers in difficult , dangerous , low - paying work .
So if adversity paved the way to their own success , why do n't they replicate that adversity to give their offspring a similar advantage ?
The answer lies in the nature of adversity .
Obstacles generally reduce the odds of success .
A child at an elite prep school is vastly more likely to gain admission to a competitive university than her peer at an enormous public school in a poor neighborhood , and vastly less likely to end up unemployed or in jail .
The average outcomes are so dramatically different that parents would be crazy to disregard them .
But adversity also has tail - end effects .
For the small subset that surmounts the obstacles , the experience can be life - altering and irreplaceable .
They may well be driven to work and to achieve at levels their peers with more comfortable childhoods cannot match .
Social science tends to focus on average outcomes .
It makes some allowance for negative tail - end effects .
When a medicine , for example , generally alleviates symptoms but also cripples a small percentage of patients , we tend to take notice .
But it rarely attempts to identify positive tail - end effects .
We find it uncomfortable to consider the moral implications of a policy that might lower average outcomes while raising the odds of extraordinary achievement .
It 's an interesting twist to the American dream of giving our children a life better than our own .
We want to spare them the things we suffered , but also seek to instill in them the virtues in which we take the greatest pride .
And sometimes , those ambitions may prove mutually exclusive .
WHEN AN ENTIRE POLITICAL PARTY MOVES TO BIZARRO WORLD ….
Senate Minority Whip Jon Kyl ( R - Ariz . ) probably did n’t realize the impact his remarks would have .
The right - wing Arizonan was asked on Fox News how his party would pay for $ 678 billion in tax cuts for the wealthy , which Republicans are currently demanding .
Kyl said what he actually believed : Republicans would n’t pay for them , and thinks it ’s a mistake to even try .
Spending should be paid for , Kyl said , but tax cuts should n’t .
Kyl later said his bizarre views are endorsed by “ most of the people in my party . ”
As Brian Beutler discovered , that ’s apparently true .
“ That ’s been the majority Republican view for some time , ” Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told TPMDC this afternoon after the weekly GOP press conference .
“ That there ’s no evidence whatsoever that the Bush tax cuts actually diminished revenue .
They increased revenue , because of the vibrancy of these tax cuts in the economy .
So I think what Senator Kyl was expressing was the view of virtually every Republican on that subject . ”
Sen. Judd Gregg ( R - N.H. ) , considered by much of the media as a credible voice on budget issues , is singing from the same ludicrous hymnal .
“ When you ’re spending money , you ’re spending money that is — it ’s not the same thing because it ’s growing the government , ” he told Brian .
“ So I tend to think that tax cuts should not have to be offset . ”
Honestly , what ’s to be done when an entire political party buys a first class ticket to Bizarro World ?
It ’s one thing when right - wing blogs and Fox News hosts spout such nonsense , but how does our political system function when “ virtually every Republican ” believes reckless tax cuts for the wealthy that created huge deficits actually “ increased revenue ” ?
How can we have an intelligent conversation with those who use the word “ vibrancy ” when describing the economy in the Bush years ?
Republicans are n’t just wrong about this ; they ’re pathologically confused .
The evidence is n’t ambiguous —
Bush ’s tax cuts led to massive deficits , and if existing policies are left in place , those tax policies will be the single biggest factor in our budget deficits for many years to come .
As far as “ virtually every Republican ” is concerned , the incontrovertible evidence just is n’t real .
They see reality , but prefer to replace it with a fantasy they find more ideologically pleasing .
It makes meaningful , substantive debate quite literally impossible — there ’s no foundation of reality to build upon .
It ’s like trying to teach algebra to someone who believes arithmetic is a scam .
It ’s also a reminder that , as conservative as Republicans have been in recent years , they ’re not done moving off the right - wing cliff .
Just a few years ago , the Bush / Cheney Office of Management and Budget and the Bush / Cheney Council of Economic Advisers fundamentally rejected the notion that tax cuts can pay for themselves .
Now , “ virtually every Republican ” accepts as gospel an argument even Bush ’s economists found to be devoid of any policy seriousness .
Paul Krugman laments the Republicans ’ “ invincible ignorance . ”
That ’s as good a label as any .
Everybody wants to know just where the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico will spread .
Intel ‘s Encanto supercomputer in New Mexico has calculated that information , using a complex ocean current simulation .
As the company described in a blog post , the computer model predicts that the oil on the surface will be carried by the gulf ’s Loop Current over hundreds of miles to Florida .
Then it will curl around the state and head into the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic Ocean .
The spill could thus cause damages thousands of miles up the East Coast of the U.S .
The model was created by scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , Colo .
The Parallel Ocean Program had already been created as part of a theoretical experiment to model the weather in the ocean , and scientists adapted it for the spill .
The simulation ran on Intel ’s Encanto supercomputer in Rio Rancho , New Mexico .
The supercomputer , No. 32 on the list of fastest supercomputers , is a water - cooled machine with 28 tall cabinets and more than 3,500 Intel quad - core Xeon processors .
The first runs at the simulation took more than 250,000 hours of computer time , with 1,000 cores working in parallel .
The simulation showed that the big mass of oil that was deep underwater was moving slowly .
But the oil at 65 feet and higher was moving quickly to Louisiana and Florida .
In the Gulf Stream , the oil can move 100 miles per day .
The simulation is n’t perfect , as it does n’t take into account things such as oil density and buoyancy .
Here ’s a video that shows the predicted path of the oil .
YAKAGHUND , Pakistan ( AFP ) Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ
The death toll from a suicide bombing and car bomb blast that devastated a Pakistani tribal town has soared to 102 in one of the country ’s deadliest attacks , officials said Saturday .
The explosions targeted a busy market in Yakaghund town in Pakistan ’s northwest tribal belt on Friday , destroying government buildings and shops and leaving victims buried under the rubble .

Local administration chief Rasool Khan said the death toll had jumped to 102 , after he and other officials had earlier put the number of dead at 65 .
“ Some bodies were recovered from the spot and some died in hospitals overnight , ” he told AFP .
Another local official , Mairaj Mohammad , confirmed the higher toll and said there were 98 people receiving treatment in different hospitals .
“ Some of them are in critical condition , ” he said .
It was the deadliest attack in Pakistan since a massive car bomb destroyed a market crowded with women and children in the northwestern city of Peshawar in October 2009 , killing 125 people .
Khan said the toll could rise further as rescue work was underway to recover victims who are feared trapped under pulverised buildings .

Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for Friday ’s blasts , saying the target was a gathering of pro-government tribal elders .
Qari Ikramullah , a spokesman for Taliban militants in the region , said in a telephone call with AFP that the elders were meeting in an administrator ’s office and planning to raise a lashkar , or tribal force , to fight the Taliban .
“ We will attack such gatherings in future also , ” he said .

A Taliban and Al - Qaeda - linked bombing spree across Pakistan has killed more than 3,500 people in three years since government troops besieged the radical Red Mosque in the capital Islamabad in July 2007 .
Witnesses said the huge explosions Friday damaged an administration office , shops , a jail and other buildings in the small town not far from the border with Afghanistan , where 140,000 US - led foreign troops are fighting the Taliban .

The attack sent a pall of gloom over the town .
Bodies wrapped in white shrouds were being brought to a local playground for funeral prayers , an AFP reporter saw .
At least 1,000 people gathered at a nearby graveyard where workers set about digging dozens of new graves .
“ I lost two brothers , their bodies were found in pieces , ” 27 - year - old drinks vendor Mohammad Siddiqullah told AFP after a burial ceremony .

Local official Mairaj Mohammad said more than 60 bodies were buried on Friday and around 30 were laid to rest on Saturday .
Islamist militant groups have carved out havens in the remote and craggy mountains of Pakistan ’s tribal belt which lies outside direct government control .
“ The attack appears to be part of a sustained campaign to disrupt peace efforts in the region , ” said security analyst Imtiaz Gul , the author of a recently published book on the tribal region , “ The Most Dangerous Place ” .
“ There seems to be good coordination among forces , which are out to create instability and perpetrate violence ” .

The Islamic republic is on the frontline of the US war against Al - Qaeda , and the Pakistani military are bogged down fighting homegrown Taliban in the northwestern border areas .
Hugging the border with Afghanistan , where US and NATO allies are trying to end a nearly nine - year war , northwest Pakistan has suffered a wave of bombings causing mass casualties and insurgency , fanning fears about regional stability .
Pakistani leaders this week called for a landmark national conference to develop a strategy to counter the Islamist militant threat after a twin suicide attack killed 43 people at a shrine in Lahore on July 2 .
Pakistani security forces have fought in the tribal belt and parts of the northwest for years , but deadly clashes are still largely a daily occurrence .
National Wildlife Federation says catalogue of oil industry accidents proves BP disaster in Gulf of Mexico is not a one - off
The oil industry has been responsible for thousands of fires , explosions , and leaks over the last decade , killing dozens of people and destroying wildlife and the environment across America , according to a report published today .
None of the individual incidents catalogued by the National Wildlife Federation comes close in scale to BP 's oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , the worst environmental disaster in America 's history .
But the thousands of lesser offshore spills , pipeline leaks , refinery fires and other accidents demolish the industry argument that BP 's ruptured well was a one - off , and that the oil and gas business has grown safer , the report 's authors said .
" These disasters make it clear that the BP disaster is n't a rare accident , " said Tim Warman , who directs the global warming programme for NWF , which calls itself the country 's largest conservation organisation .
" These are daily occurrences .
These are daily incidents of not paying attention . "
In a further grim reminder , the American midwest was in the throes of its own environmental disaster today , with a ruptured pipeline gushing gallons of oil into Michigan 's Kalamazoo River .
Enbridge Energy , which is Canadian - owned but based in Houston , said the spill may have reached 1 m gallons .
Federal government officials in Washington and the state of Michigan were struggling to stop the oil from reaching the Great Lakes .
In the Gulf of Mexico , meanwhile , while BP 's oil well remains capped , a tugboat crashed into an abandoned well this week and set off a 100ft gusher of oil and gas .
The coastguard commander , Thad Allen , told reporters today that operations were switching from response to recovery , suggesting that equipment and personnel in the Gulf could be drastically scaled back in four to six weeks .
" If you need fewer skimming vessels out there , there is going to be a levelling you need to consider , " he said .
The report from the National Wildlife Federation drew on records from the Minerals Management Service , which regulates offshore drilling , and the Environmental Protection Agency , to come up with a figure of 1,440 offshore leaks , blowouts , and other accidents were reported between 2001 - 2007 .
In addition to environmental damage , these caused 41 deaths and 302 injuries .
The safety record for onshore activities was even more dismal .
Some 2,554 pipeline accidents occurred between 2001 and 2007 , killing 161 people and injuring 576 .
" Oil and gas is being produced in 34 states across the country and it is just not being regulated to the extent it needs to be , " said Lauren Pagel of Earthworks , which monitors extractive industries .
At times , the accidents occurred far from industrial installations such as offshore drilling rigs or refineries .
In one particularly gruesome incident from August 2000 , three families with young children on a camping trip in New Mexico were consumed by a 500ft fireball from a ruptured pipeline .
All 12 people were killed , and an official investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board later blamed the pipeline company for failing to detect or repair severely corroded pipes .
Four years later , a tanker truck lost control and crossed guard rails outside Washington DC , igniting 8,000 gallons of burning petrol on one of the country 's busiest highways .
" There was fire everywhere , " the report quotes highway officials as saying .
Four people were killed .
Among the causes for the poor safety record was the industry 's relentless costcutting , despite record profits , said the report 's authors , describing equipment failures , tank corrosion , and other signs of poor maintenance .
The poor safety and environmental records were not restricted to the so - called Big Oil companies .
Enbridge Energy has had 400 separate spills between 2003 and 2008 , spewing 1.3 m gallons of crude into the environment , according to official records .
The British design company , Priestmangoode , has designed a new double - decker high - speed train that they pledge could be the next British transport design icon .
Since the Concorde , they say , nothing has emerged in the U.K. design landscape in the transport sector that a Brit could be proud of .
The train is supposed to " persuade people to travel by train " , by making train travel " as exciting as air travel and as sexy as the latest car " .
Both short and long journeys will be made comfortable and relaxing , the design company assures .
The vehicle is designed to travel at 225 mph and will be about 400 meters or 1,312 feet long .

BUTTONED -UP , blasphemy - obsessed Pakistan has a dirty little secret – it ’s the world ’s No 1 consumer of on - line pornography .
And not just your common - or - garden smut .
According to this report it has been top - dog in searches per-person for “ horse sex ” since 2004 ; “ donkey sex ” since 2007 ; “ rape pictures ” between 2004 and 2009 ; “ rape sex ” since 2004 and “ child sex ” between 2004 and 2007 .
“ Animal sex ” and “ dog sex ” searches are pretty damn popular too in “ The Land of The Pure ” , as Pakistan likes to think of itself .
You wo n’t find strip clubs in Islamic countries .
Most Islamic countries have certain dress codes .
It would be an irony if they have n’t shown the same vigilance to pornography .
The country also is topsÂ – or has been No. 1 – in searches for “ camel sex , ” “ rape video , ” “ child sex video ” and some other searches that Fox News was too coy to print .
The stats are based on findings generated by Google Trends and Google Insights , features of Google that produce data based on popular search terms .
Ironically , the Islamic country has banned content on at least 17 websites to block offensive and blasphemous material .
In addition to banning content on 17 websites , including Islam Exposed , Pakistan is monitoring seven other sites – Google , Yahoo , Bing , YouTube , Amazon , MSN and Hotmail – for anti-Islamic content .
Said Gabriel Said Reynolds , professor of Islamic Studies at the University of Notre Dame :
Reynolds claims that Pakistan is intent on shutting out the rest of the world .
[ It ] could lead to conversion , which would undermine the very order of the state .
Part of protecting the society is making sure that there is no way it could be undermined in terms of foreign influences .
And while Pakistan is taking measures to prevent blasphemous material from being viewed by its citizens , pornographic material is “ certainly ” contradictory to Islam , too , Reynolds said .
The country ’s punishment for those charged with blasphemy is execution , but the question remains what – if anything – can be done about people who search for porn on the Web ?
Reynolds said :
It ’s a new phenomenon .
I still remember vividly taking the Five Mindful Trainings vow in 2002 from Thich Nhat Hanh at Stonehill College in Massachusetts .
By now , the Trainings are written in my heart , but I still look at them once a week , renewing my vow and sending to Thây , his monks and nuns , and his students , any merit I may have gained through my own dharma work .
No matter what tradition you may follow , I think these Five Mindfulness Trainings are a wonderfully skillful way to train the heart and mind in the way of Awakening .
May they be a help and inspiration to you as well !

Apple has been busy releasing swaths of new mobile hardware this year , including the iPad , new notebooks , and most recently , the iPhone 4 .
Apple did manage to squeeze in a revised unibody Mac mini earlier this year , but a couple new pieces of information suggest that new iMacs and Mac Pros could be showing up soon .
A report from AppleInsider indicates that Apple is clearing the channel of current iMac models .
Distributors and resellers are supposedly being told to not expect any additional new stock and to sell through the stock they currently have on hand .
The updated iMacs are expected to ditch the Core2 Duos used in lower - end models for Core i5 and — in the lowest - end models — Core i3 processors .
Additionally , MacRumors reports customers around the country have discovered that Mac Pros are no longer available to reserve for pickup at some retail locations .
This suggests that inventory is shrinking , and may be a sign that the long ( and we mean long ) overdue Mac Pro update is nearing release .
Apple has n't released a new Mac Pro in nearly 18 months , though the update cycle for the workstation averages about 8 months .
These new desktops are expected to feature updated Intel processors , much faster graphics cards , USB 3.0 , and perhaps a faster version of FireWire .
AppleInsider also suggests that Apple has test prototypes in its labs using processors from Intel - rival AMD .
Given what we know about both companies ' current line - ups , though , we are doubtful that iMacs or Mac Pros powered by AMD processors will be released anytime soon .
Apple CEO
Steve Jobs said of the company 's recent record breaking quarter that it had " amazing new products still to come this year . "
In addition to the Mac Pro , other products that have been seemingly ignored for updates include the MacBook Air , 30 " Cinema Display , and Xserve , so perhaps desktop fans will get something before the year is out after all .
JOHANNESBURG
US taxpayers spend about US $ 140 million every year on non-emergency food aid in Africa , and roughly the same amount to ship food aid to global destinations on US vessels ; money that could have been used to feed more people says a new study by researchers at Cornell University in the US .
The US Agency for International Development ( USAID ) has accounted for more than half of the world 's food aid every year for decades , but has been " the last and slowest donor to reform its food aid policies " , noted Christopher Barrett , a leading food aid expert , and his colleagues , Elizabeth Bageant and Erin Lentz .
Their study , Food Aid and Agricultural Cargo Preference , has come up with the numbers to back a long - standing call for reforms , and goes a step further in showing that the policy designed to " nurture " or subsidise the US shipping industry " under the guise of humanitarian assistance " is not doing either effectively .
Most donors have moved towards cash transfers or vouchers to buy food , instead of providing food as aid , but the paper points out that most countries only had agribusiness and some NGO interests to contend with while reforming their food aid policy .
Reforms in the US have faced much tougher opposition from " a uniquely effective lobby " , referred to as the " iron triangle " , comprising agribusiness , the shipping sector and some NGOs .
Barrett and Daniel Maxwell , an associate professor at Tufts University , Boston , in the US , who wrote at length about the " iron triangle " in their 2005 book , Food Aid After Fifty Years : Recasting Its Role , estimated that it cost more than two dollars of US taxpayers ' money to deliver one dollar 's worth of food procured as in - kind aid .
If our objective is to generate US jobs , why do so through a humanitarian food aid programme , rather than focusing on generating jobs directly
Little known shipping subsidy
Little has been written about the costs and effects of a policy called the Agricultural Cargo Preference ( ACP ) , which affects the shipping sector of the " iron triangle " , and USAID , the world 's largest food aid programme .
The ACP requires that 75 percent of US food aid be shipped on privately owned , US registered vessels , even if they do not offer the most competitive rates .
Some of these costs are reimbursed by the Department of Transportation 's Maritime Administration , but ultimately the US taxpayer foots the entire bill .
The Cornell researchers used data available for every USAID food aid shipment in 2006 , when ACP cost US taxpayers $ 140 million , " The amount paid above the regular cost of ocean freight on the competitive market , " said Barrett .
ACP was calculated by taking into account the costs of transporting the food aid on competing foreign vessels plying the same waters , after deducting the ACP costs borne by US Department of Agriculture food aid programmes , and reimbursements .
The un-reimbursed cost of ACP to food aid agencies was almost the same as what USAID spent on non-emergency food aid to Africa , which benefited 1.2 million people and was " widely deemed important to preventing food emergencies " .
USAID declined to comment on the findings of the study , saying the research " spoke for itself " .
About 20 years ago the US Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) , an independent investigative arm of Congress , looked at the costs of shipping food aid in US - flag vessels rather than using cheaper foreign ships , and estimated that it cost $ 150 million each year .
Another report in 1994 put the cost as high as $ 200 million a year .

Failing shipping as well
The ACP was put in place to achieve four objectives : ensure that US vessels remained seaworthy and prepared should a war break out ; maintain skilled jobs for American seafarers ; maintain the financial viability of US ships ; protect US ocean commerce from foreign domination .
Barrett , Bageant and Lentz found that " contrary to its national security and ' buy American ' objectives " , ACP used vessels which were not useful to the military , and most of the vessels used were ultimately owned by foreign corporations .
They recommended that the US administration revisit the ACP , and suggested separating security objectives from humanitarian ones , with direct support for the Maritime Security Program .
But shipping industry says
The US shipping industry , which produced its own study - Impacts on the US Economy of Shipping International Food Aid - around the same time as the Cornell researchers , argues that eliminating the ACP would shrink the US - flag merchant fleet by 15 percent to 30 percent , with the loss of between 16,500 and 33,000 jobs .
Barrett said the shipping industry 's study had used " very crude multipliers not developed for this application , and seem to use the total ocean freight costs , not the marginal cost of cargo preference , thereby assuming that every maritime job would disappear .
That 's a highly questionable assumption that they then inflate , using highly questionable multipliers " .
The Cornell study 's calculations showed that US taxpayers were paying a subsidy of almost $ 100,000 every year per mariner on an ACP vessel shipping food aid .
" That 's a pretty handsome subsidy , " he commented .
" One would hope there would be some economic multiplier .
The question is whether that 's the best use of those funds , if our objective is to generate US jobs ; and if the objective is to generate US jobs , why do so through a humanitarian food aid programme , rather than focusing on generating jobs directly ? "

Rockstar has not released any screenshots of the new modes , so you 'll have to guess what their Red Dead zombies look like .
Interesting DLC strategy for this game .
Rockstar 's last big games , Grand Theft Auto IV , received two massive single - player - centric add - ons released more than a year after the game and offering over a dozen hours of gameplay and story for $ 20 .
With Red Dead , Rockstar is creating smaller portions of content and releasing them much closer to release , emphasizing an expansion of multiplayer more than single - player .
Both plans were ambitious , showing that Rockstar is serious about post - release support .
( But not so serious , folks — zombies ! )
Overview
I 'm going to explain why this is going on , and then how fix the specific " Base SDK Missing " problem .
You can skip to the bottom for just the fix , though I recommend reading all of this .
I also recommend John Muchow 's excellent take on this issue .
If you are specifically interested in the Xcode 3.2.4 upgrade , which has a strongly related problem , you might want to confer here .
One SDK to rule them all
Here 's the deal : 4.0 is now the only SDK version allowed for submitting new or updated iPhone - only apps .
This is direct from Apple 's iOS 4 Readiness Checklist ( reg reqd ) :
All new applications and updates to existing applications must be built with iPhone SDK 4 .
Please note , the App Store will no longer support applications that target iOS 2.x .
Presumably -- I 'm guessing here -- iPad-only and universal apps should use the 3.2 SDK .
That is why 4.0 & 3.2 are your only choices for SDKs .
That is also why your project is now broken , since the SDK it was previously mapped to is deprecated , gones - ville .
( But ) 3 is a magic number
Relax .
You can still target devices running iPhone OS 3.0 ( but not lower ) .
The SDK you use to compile does not limit -- downward -- what iOS version you can program to or support .
Once you 've patched things up in your project etc. ( cf. next section ) you can set " iPhone OS Deployment Target " to a lower iOS version .
For a quick shot of how to do this , cf. step 7 in the next section .
Note that you are now entering some tricky terrain .
Your usual Xcode 3.2.3 compiler will no longer be enforcing your compliance to 3.0 - only calls , nor does it have a simulator for these .
And if you want to support 4.0 features , you 'll have to do some conditional code to prevent crashes on 3.0 devices .
Fun .
You can still download ( from Apple ! ) and install a previous Xcode version or SDK ( cf. here ) .
Yes , you can install multiple Xcode versions , in different directories , i.e. put only one version in / Developer .
You can use the old Xcode to test your app 's compliance vs. a 3.x SDK , moving the hard work to a fancy compiler , and simulator .
But you can no longer use the products of the previous SDKs to submit to the app store .
FWIW , I plan on doing just this check before I ship .
What condition my condition is in
Matt Gallagher has a Cocoa with Love post on version conditional code entitled " Tips & Tricks for conditional iOS3 , iOS3.2 and iOS4 code " .
If you are planning on conditionally using 4.0 features , this is a strong recommendation to check it out .
Fixing " Base SDK Missing "
Load your project
From the menu , select Project > Edit Project Settings ...
Under Architecture >
Base SDK , choose one of the available device options : iPhone 3.2 or iPhone 4.0 .
If you are iPhone - only , 4.0 is the way to go .
Close that window .
From the menu , select Project > Edit Active Target " YourTarget " Under Architecture >
Base SDK , choose one of the available device or simulator options : iPhone 3.2 or iPhone 4.0 .
If you want to target previous iOS versions , then in that same window , under Deployment > iPhone OS Deployment Target , select the lowest version you want to support .
Note that support for 2.x versions through the app store is deprecated .
See the " Readiness Checklist " quote above .
Base SDK location for Xcode 4 and above
Follow the steps above , but for Step # 2 , click the following :
Select the Project navigator using folder icon on the left of the navigator sidebar
Select the Project , which will be at the top of that view .
The project configuration will appear in the main editor panel ; select " Build Settings " at the top and below will be the ' Architecture ' section .

After amassing more than 14,000 images and 500 videos of burning , looting and window smashing during the G20 summit , Toronto police have launched another public appeal .
On Wednesday , investigators announced they are asking for help in hopes of identifying the people who were involved in the rampage on downtown streets where police cruisers were burned and windows were smashed .
“ These people will be systematically located and apprehended , ” said Det. Sgt. Gary Giroux as he presented clear images of 10 men .
He said two of the “ most wanted ” — both masked , one wielding a pick axe , the other a bag of rocks — were captured on security video from inside businesses where windows were smashed .
While the bulk of images and video have come from the public , some were taken by undercover officers who were in the G20 crowds .
The 22 - member G20 investigative team is using facial recognition software supplied by the banking industry in an attempt to identify suspects in poorer quality images .
Police say even a face partially hidden by a bandana can be identified by the technology that can match a person 's eyes with someone on file .
Last week , after police issued a series of images of six men , three were identified the same day with help from the public .
Accompanied by a lawyer , another man turned himself in at 7 a.m. Wednesday .
Ashran Ravindhraj , 25 , of Toronto , is in custody facing charges of arson and two counts of mischief over $ 5,000 .
Long Beach could join several other California cities in seeking to boost city coffers by taxing marijuana .
The City Council on Tuesday will consider a proposal to place a measure on the November ballot that would levy a 5 % tax on medical marijuana collectives .
Another tax of up to 10 % on other marijuana businesses would go into effect only if California voters also pass Proposition 19 , which would legalize , regulate and tax marijuana for recreational use .
Long Beach 's proposal , drafted by the city ’s Department of Financial Management , also calls for taxing medical marijuana cultivation sites at .0075 cents per square foot .
The growth of pot dispensaries -- and the drug ’s potential legalization statewide -- has presented a rare opportunity for cities desperately searching for new revenues .
Berkeley and Sacramento are considering similar measures .
Long Beach is facing an $ 18.5 - million budget deficit , and for some on the city council , which voted in May to regulate medical marijuana collectives , taxation is the next logical step .
" We tax alcohol .
We tax cigarettes .
Why would n't we look at taxing marijuana ? "
Long Beach Councilman Patrick O’Donnell said .
" We 're turning over every rock to find new revenues , and under one of those rocks may be marijuana . "
Critics , however , say such a tax could unfairly target medical marijuana patients .

" That 's just someone behind a desk , mate , " said Chris Hibbard , who runs a squirrel - breeding farm in western Sydney .
" There 's never been any study done that says they will become a pest .
That 's just the government saying scientifically they 're related to a rat and we have rat and mice problems .
I cannot see how any animal who produces one or three animals in a nest could become a problem . "

Manchester City have decided Craig Bellamy can be sold after completing the £ 25 m transfer of David Silva to fill his position on the left side of attack .
Bellamy was one of City 's more impressive players last season but has not convinced Roberto Mancini that he merits a place in a team that aspires to be regarded as authentic title challengers , and his inability to get on with the former Internazionale manager has counted against him .
The two men clashed on several occasions after Mancini 's appointment last December , and the club held an internal investigation after Bellamy was overheard allegedly saying something detrimental about the Italian after the 2 - 0 home defeat against Everton in March .
Nothing was proven but their relationship has been fractious , at best , and potential buyers will not be discouraged from bidding now that Silva is officially a City player .
The Spain international passed his medical examination after flying into Manchester today .
That leaves Bellamy facing a decision about whether to stay and fight for his place , having effectively won a similar battle with Robinho , or leave a club where he is not expected to feature prominently .
If the latter is the case , he might also have to consider taking a pay cut to help engineer a move .
Bellamy , who turned 31 this week , earns £ 95,000 a week and when the Tottenham manager , Harry Redknapp , was asked about his admiration for the Wales international he suggested it would be out of his club 's price range .
" City bought him for £ 12 m and the player must be on considerably high wages , " he said .
" I just do n't see it happening . "
City have also signed Jérôme Boateng and Yaya Touré and are trying to put in place deals for Aston Villa 's James Milner and two more attackers , Mario Balotelli of Internazionale and Edin Dzeko of Wolfsburg .
Inter 's sporting director , Marco Branca , said tonight that Balotelli " does not have a price " and is " not on the market " .
Roque Santa Cruz , the injury - plagued Paraguayan , does not feature in Mancini 's plans , while Robinho and Stephen Ireland have both asked to leave and the club will also listen to offers for Nedum Onuoha .
However , City have no intention of selling Micah Richards , rumoured to be a target for Liverpool 's new manager , Roy Hodgson , and are not looking to move on Shaun Wright - Phillips despite his erratic form during an unresolved contract dispute last season .

Barack Obama made a surprise video appearance at the Netroots Nation conference today , but the most interesting development to me is what else was in the video with Obama .
After saying , “ I hope you take a moment to consider what we have accomplished so far , ” he cut to a video of Rachel Maddow running down and a list of his accomplishments , and somewhere Ed Schultz blew a blood vessel .
Here is the Obama video :
Advertisements
The best part of the collection of clips from The Rachel Maddow Show on Obama ’s accomplishments was her saying , “ The last time any president did this much in office booze was illegal .
If you believe in policy , and a government that addresses problems , cheers to that . ”
Obama followed up by saying , “ In ways both large and small , we ’ve begun to deliver on the change you fought for , and we ’re not done . ”
The Washington Post played the Left is angry at Obama narrative by describing the response to his remarks as , “ Hundreds of activists and bloggers applauded warmly after the video ended , but some were not appeased . ”
In all honesty , I have a big problem with many on the Left who are bashing Obama .
Regular readers have noticed that I do n’t exactly keep my feelings hidden on this topic .
The difference between me and many other bloggers is that I come from a background in legislative process and policy .
I can see that what Obama has accomplished during his time in office is nothing less than a minor miracle given the current political climate .
People like Rachel Maddow and me can appreciate what Obama has managed to do , and just how difficult it was to get done .
The people who bash Obama on the Left , quite honestly , are free to express their opinions on his accomplishments , but many of them are basing their evaluations on a personal vision of a legislative utopia which they believed would occur after Obama ’s election .
The point that they seem to miss is that some of the positions that they and I held were / are not popular with rest of America .
For example , I am in favor of the Employee Free Choice Act .
Most of America is n’t , so it got buried off the agenda .
I guess if I was narrow minded and ignorant of political limitations , I would bash Obama for this , but I see the bigger picture .
It is interesting that the White House would use a video of Maddow to list his accomplishments .
Obama could have easily listed his own accomplishments , but instead they chose to showcase Rachel , who has mega credibility with the Left , and I am glad they did , but I ca n’t help but think that Olbermann , Matthews , Schultz , etc. are not amused .
Olbermann , Matthews , and Schultz have all been part of the culture of leftwing Obama bashing .
Maddow regularly criticizes the administration , but she does it in a fair way with facts , whereas Olbermann and Schultz throw temper tantrums , and act as if this president owes them something .
The difference between me and the angry at Obama Left is that I do n’t write for “ the cause . ”
I do n’t care about “ the cause . ”
I do n’t even know what “ the cause ” is .
I am not a journalist , but I am also not an advocate .
I am just a writer , and I come here every day to share a little news and talk a bit of politics with you .
Politics and the ways that it shapes our lives is what matters to me , not some abstract “ cause ” built around an ideology .
I can guarantee you that this site will cover and opine on the 2012 election , but it will not tell anyone who to vote for .
We are n’t Fox News , and that ’s not our role .
Many of those who grumble about Obama on the Left are upset because they wanted Obama to govern for them .
They believe that they should be his only constituency .
They viewed Obama election as payback for the Bush years , and they want Obama to govern to his base like George W. Bush did , but if Obama did this , he would be as successful as George W. Bush was .
They are blasting Obama for trying to be the President , not only of the Left , but of the United States of America .
Much like Rachel Maddow does , the complainers need to keep things in perspective .
The next time you read or hear someone who supported Obama complain about him not being far enough to the left , ask them if they think that the country would be better off under President McCain and Vice President Palin ?
Some on the Left refuse to see that their political fantasy was and is unrealistic and unobtainable , if they think Obama is so bad , he is paradise compared to the having the GOP running things again .
Some on the Left have lost touch with reality , and by using a bit of Rachel Maddow video , Obama was trying to reach them and emphasize what is really at stake this November .
It was a fascinating and novel approach .
Let ’s hope it works .

Wake Up America .
How can we solve the world ’s problems if we ca n’t solve our own problems here at home ?
Once again , war is being paid for with a credit card while investments in our children ’s future are tossed aside .
These investments -- $ 10 billion for teacher jobs , $ 1 billion for summer youth employment , $ 5 billion for Pell grants , $ 701 million for border security -- were cut from the war funding bill coming to the House floor despite being fully paid for and not adding to the budget deficit .
They have been jettisoned in favor of further borrowed war spending .
Today ’s bill does n’t include anything to maintain first responder , police or firefighter positions despite the dramatic need for those jobs in every community in America .
We believe this is fiscal insanity and a moral tragedy .
Consider the following : Despite widespread shortfalls in education funding around the country , the $ 10 billion that would have saved 140,000 teacher jobs across the nation -- all of it offset -- has been cut .
The $ 37.12 billion in war funding , on the other hand , is not paid for .
Every single penny adds directly to the national debt .
This is not good for national security .
This is continuing a failed policy at the exact wrong time .
The bill before the House denies our children the right to an education and takes away their future earning power .
It also adds to the economic burden they will eventually have to bear .
This is a moral outrage .
We find it unacceptable that this Congress places a greater priority on foreign wars than urgent domestic needs .
We have compounded our moral short - sightedness with utter fiscal irresponsibility .
After the dramatic revelations of this week , it is clearer than ever just how daunting a task our troops face in Afghanistan .
We are trying to build a modern , democratic state in an area divided by tribal and ethnic identities that has successfully resisted foreign powers for centuries .
We are fighting for one side in a civil war , killing civilians , building resentment toward the United States , and making it nearly impossible to gain the popular support that could make success possible .
As multiple reports have shown , pervasive corruption in Iraq and Afghanistan siphons resources so that even worthwhile projects are doomed to fail .
This is not how we want to spend borrowed money .
Our people at home are facing a difficult job market , lower funding for education , and a shattered Gulf economy that needs significant attention .
We need to prioritize and make the right choices , not continue as before out of inertia or a lack of urgency .
We urge the president to consider how this spending really improves the lives of Americans and how it can be spent in more productive ways .
Most presidents start wondering -- or , more often , worrying -- about their “ legacy ” well into their first term .
Or , if they have a second term , they worry even more feverishly about what posterity will think of them .
Obama need not wonder about his legacy , even this early .
It is already fixed , and in one word : Afghanistan .
He took on what he made America ’s longest war and what may turn out to be its most disastrous one .
It is time for me to break a silence I have observed for over a year , against my better judgment .
On June 30 , 2009 , I and eight other historians were invited to a dinner with President Obama and three of his staffers , to discuss what history could teach him about conducting the presidency .
I was asked shortly after by several news media what went on there , and I replied that it was off the record .
I have argued elsewhere that the imposition of secrecy to insure that the president gets “ candid advice ” is a cover for something else -- making sure that what is said about the people ’s business does not reach the people .
But I went along this time , since the president said that he wanted this dinner to be a continuing thing , and I thought that revealing its first contents would jeopardize the continuation of a project that might be a source of information for him .
But there has been no follow up on the first dinner , and certainly no sign that he learned anything from it .
The only thing achieved has been the silencing of the main point the dinner guests tried to make -- that pursuit of war in Afghanistan would be for him what Vietnam was to Lyndon Johnson .
At least four or five of the nine stressed this .
Nothing else rose to this level of seriousness or repeated concern .
I will let others say what they want ( some already have ) .
But I will now reveal what I contributed that night .
I told him that Richard Nixon had advised Ronald Reagan not to make too many public statements himself -- let others speak on a daily basis , and save his appearances for big issues .
Obama replied that he would speak less often in the future , but at the moment no one else in his administration could command the attention that he did .
He added that Secretary Clinton had some ability to get the public ’s ear , but she could not speak on domestic issues like the economy .
When Obama said that he was surprised that the left was so critical of him , I said that it would continue to be critical so long as he issued signing statements before passage of a law .
He asked which one I objected to , and I said that any are unconstitutional .
At the end of the meal , he went around the table one time more to ask if there was a final bit of advice we would give .
When my turn came , I joined those who had already warned him about an Afghanistan quagmire .
I said that a government so corrupt and tribal and drug - based as Afghanistan ’s could not be made stable .
He replied that he was not naïve about the difficulties but he thought a realistic solution could be reached .
I wanted to add “ when pigs fly , ” but restrained myself .
Jonathan Alter , in The Promise , becomes almost rhapsodic when describing the President ’s official Afghanistan review sessions , to reach “ the most methodical security decision in a generation . ”
But no one in those meetings said that the Afghanistan war was a sure loser , a thing not to be pursued in the first place .
The only voice of dissent that we know of was Vice President Biden ’s calling for a smaller troop increase ( ten or fifteen thousand or so ) and more drone attacks .
The main point made by the historians he consulted was not referred to by Alter -- one of the deleterious effects of governmental secrecy .
The President might have been saved from the folly that will be his lasting legacy .
But now we are ten years into a war that could drag on for another ten , and could catch in its trammels the next president , the way Vietnam tied up president after president .
So today 's the day we get a straight up - or - down vote on continuing the brutal , dysfunctional occupation of Afghanistan and the disastrous , pointless war there .
The Senate stripped away the sweeteners -- keeping the economy afloat -- that gave reluctant Democrats cover to go along with it -- and gave some Republicans cover to oppose it !
The money the Senate removed for state governments to pay teachers and the money that would have gone to small family farms , many of them impoverished black farmers will make it all the harder to round up enough non-Blue Dogs to help Republicans pass this Frankenstein 's monster of a war funding bill .
As we pointed out Sunday , the giant wikileak is making it harder for Obama to put enough lipstick on this pig for most Democrats to want to bed down with .
It comes up today on the suspension calendar , which means it needs a two - thirds majority to pass .
That 's not going to happen .
There 's no way the House leadership is going to round up 130 Democrats to declare openly that they are nothing but corrupt , filthy shills for the Military Industrial Complex .
As David Swanson from WarIsACrime.org , " here 's where the hypocrisy hits the highway .
On July 1st , 162 congress members voted to require a withdrawal plan and end date for the occupation of Afghanistan , and 100 voted to fund only withdrawal , no continuation of war , while 25 voted to simply stop dumping any money into this war .
Now all of them must vote yes or no , probably on Tuesday , on whether to fund a major escalation of the war in Afghanistan .
You wo n't hear anyone mention it , but this $ 33 billion is to add 30,000 troops plus contractors to the war .
" Most of the debate this morning consisted of Republicans and sold - out conservative Democrats angry at the world babbling about not spending any money on anything but wars -- just the worst kinds of crap representatives a democracy can vomit out -- from Buck McKeon ( R- CA ) , Jerry Lewis ( R - CA ) and Harold Rogers ( R - KY ) to Norm Dicks ( D - WA ) and Ike Skelton ( D - MO ) .
A couple of breaths of fresh air came from Jim McGovern ( D - MA ) who flat out called the war " a disaster , " something most of these imbeciles refuse to admit , even the ones who know it .
He pointed out that we 're allowing our soldiers to die while borrowing money , putting the country in hock to prop up a corrupt , barely legitimate government in Kabul .
He railed against presidents getting blank checks from Congress .
Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) : Barbara Lee , who was themember of Congress to oppose attacking Afghanistan in the first place , followed Kucinich .
She spoke about ending the war by defunding it and reiterated what every Democrat should be saying -- that no money should be spent on anything to with Afghanistan other than bringing our troops home safely .
The chair then asked for a voice vote and claimed it passed with two - thirds , at which time Dave Obey called their bullshit and demanded a recorded vote .
The leadership postponed that to see if they could actually find enough Democrats do vote with GOP warmongers .
At that point , staunch anti-war progressives Raul Grijalva , Barbara Lee Dennis Kucinich , Alan Grayson and others released this statement :
So how could Democrat vote to continue funding this mess ?
Chellie Pingree ( D - ME ) , who signed on to the letter above ( as did Jared Polis , John Conyers , Donna Edwards and several other progressives ) , was onlast night talking about the wikileaks and the pointless war in Afghanistan with Tweety .
She did a great job : Jim Holbert is a progressive Democrat running for Congress in Kentucky 's 5th congressional district .
Unfortunately his opponent longtime warmonger Hal Rogers got to vote today instead .
And Rogers voted for more war , more billions of much needed taxpayer dollars down the Central Asian sewer .
Holbert 's comment : " De-fund it , bring the troops home , and there 's the end of it .
This is going to happen sooner or later , the only questions are how many more lives will be lost and how much more debt we 'll run up . "
Rogers voted against Kucinich 's War Powers resolution in regard to Pakistan -- so did almost everyone else .
It failed 38 - 372 , 6 Republicans and 32 Democrats voting YES , with 4 abstentions .
And then the supplemental a few minutes later .
102 Democrats and 12 Republicans voted against it .
So it passed -- more unjustifiable war in our names -- 308 - 114 .
Let me take a quick look and see if any good Democrats voted for it .
Hold on a sec ...
Yep , joining the Borens , Boyds , Barrows , Beans , Brights , Harmen and Shulers , we find a scattering of progressives , whose names we should keep in mind when they ask for campaign contributions : Bruce Braley ( IA ) , Susan Davis ( CA ) , Diana DeGette ( CO ) , Martin Heinrich ( NM ) , Tom Perriello ( VA ) , Lucille Royball - Allard ( CA ) , Chris Van Hollen ( MD ) ... ugghhhh , too many to name .
All the real good guys voted no though , people like Donna Edwards , Tammy Baldwin , Carol Shea - Porter , Jared Polis , Lloyd Doggett , Steve Filner ... you know .
Obamabots are not going to like the new issue of the New York Review of Books ... not one bit .
It 's worth reading the whole piece , which Wills starts off with a real bang :
Labels : Afghanistan , Dennis Kucinich , Garry Wills , Pakistan , supplemental budget
FCC Finally Admits US Broadband Competitiveness Sucks ; Broadband Co's Then Order Their Favorite Politicians To Trash FCC
from the gee , - who - coulda - thunk - it dept
The report ditches the inaccurate zip code determination , and takes the long - overdue step of bumping the minimum definition of broadband from just 200 kbps , to at least 4 Mbps downstream and 1 Mbps upstream .

Every year , the FCC is required to come out with a report on broadband competitiveness .
Every year , it 's a joke .
Way back in 2006 , the GAO looked at the 2005 report and pointed out that the FCC 's methodology sucked and was highly inaccurate .
Basically , the FCC looked at whether or not a single node in a zip code was wired for broadband ( defined at some laughably low rate ) , and declared that the provider offered service across that entire zip code .
On top of that , it relied on the broadband providers themselves to let the FCC know who was covered .
So , in theory , you could have a zip code where only two houses were covered by broadband , and the FCC would define that entire zip code as not only covered , but a competitive market .
That was in 2006 .
Yet , the FCC basically ignored the GAO and kept putting out its bogus reports each year , even as the GAO continued to highlight the problems of the report .
So here we are , years later , and the FCC haschanged its methodology and for the first time released a report admitting that all is not well in the US broadband market .
As Broadband Reports notes : I should admit , by that definition , even I do n't have broadband at home .
To be honest , I 'm less concerned about the amount of people who have access to broadband , as I am about the actual level of competition , which is n't really covered by this report .
Still , it 's amusing to see how angry the telcos and some elected officials are about the FCC finally telling the truth .
A telco lobbying organization , US Telecom immediately trashed the report saying it " strained credulity . "
And , it did n't take elected officials long to start grandstanding as well .
Rep. Cliff Stearns wasted little time blasting the FCC report , saying he was " perplexed " by the report .
Perhaps we can clear up some of the confusion .
You see , it appears that over the course of Cliff Stearns career , the single largest contributor to his campaign was ( you guessed it ) AT&T .
Oh , and as for this year 's campaign , it 's probably worth noting that while AT&T is still his top contributor Comcast and Verizon are number two and three respectively , and closing in fast .
And , of course , in the last election ( 2008 ) , Stearns ' top two contributors were AT&T and the National Cable & Telco Association .
Verizon was fourth .
But I 'm sure that haswhatsoever to do with Stearn 's confusion over the FCC report .
Could n't possibly be ...
And people wonder why every day citizens think that DC is corrupt .

Egypt temporarily lifted its blockade of the Gaza Strip Tuesday to allow aid into the area , according to an Egyptian official .
The move came a day after Israel raided an international flotilla carrying supplies to the Palestinian territory , reportedly killing nine activists .
Also on Tuesday , Israel transferred the humanitarian supplies aboard the ships to the Gaza Strip after inspecting the cargo .
According to Channel 10 , COGAT transferred most of the aid which had been on the ships , with the exception of pills whose expiry dates had passed .

Australia : Socialist Equality Party announces its 2010 election candidates
the Socialist Equality Party ( Australia )
19 July 2010
The Socialist Equality Party is proud to announce its candidates for the 2010 federal election , to be held on August 21 .
In the course of its campaign the SEP will advance the socialist alternative to the program of austerity , militarism and attacks on democratic rights being pursued by both the Gillard Labor government and the Abbott - led Liberal - National opposition , along with governments around the world , amid the deepening global economic crisis .
Nick Beams
The SEP will contest a total of 10 House of Representative seats in New South Wales , Western Australia and Victoria .
It will also field above - the - line party tickets for the Senate in Victoria and New South Wales , enabling all voters in Australia ’s two most populous states to cast a vote for the SEP .
Gabriela Zabala
Nick Beams , 62 , the SEP ’s national secretary , and member of the International Editorial Board of the World Socialist Web site , is heading the Senate ticket in NSW , and will be the party ’s national spokesman .
Beams , a founding member of the party in 1972 , is a well - known writer on Marxist political economy and on the historical experiences and struggles of the Australian working class .
Gabriela Zabala , 47 , an English literature postgraduate student at the University of NSW , and an SEP member since 1997 , is the other member of the Senate ticket in NSW .
Across Sydney , the SEP is standing candidates in six lower house seats : Kingsford - Smith , Grayndler , Reid , Parramatta , Blaxland and Fowler .
Zac Hambides
Zac Hambides , 22 , president of the University of NSW 's International Students for Social Equality ( ISSE ) , the SEP ’s student movement , and an SEP member since 2007 , will contest the seat of Kingsford - Smith , a predominantly working class electorate in south Sydney .
The electorate covers the Botany Bay dockyards , Sydney airport , light industry in Alexandria , as well as the University of NSW and the beachside suburbs of Maroubra and Coogee .
Hambides will challenge Labor ’s environment minister , the former rock - star Peter Garrett .
James Cogan
James Cogan , 40 , the SEP ’s national organiser , is standing in Grayndler , an inner-western electorate with large concentrations of students , urban professionals and immigrants .
Cogan , who has written extensively for the WSWS on the US - led occupations of Afghanistan and Iraq , will challenge Infrastructure Minister Anthony Albanese , a long - time Labor faction boss .
Carolyn Kennett
Carolyn Kennett , 47 , a former nurse , and now mathematics lecturer at Macquarie University , will contest Reid , which covers the mainly working class areas along the southern bank of the Parramatta River , including Auburn , one of the poorest areas of Sydney .
As president of the university ’s branch of the National Tertiary Education Union for the past four years , Kennett has opposed the union ’s backing for the Rudd / Gillard governments ’ pro-market restructuring of tertiary education .
She joined the SEP in 2007 and is married with five children and three grandchildren .
Chris Gordon
Chris Gordon , 42 , a university mathematics teacher and an SEP member for five years , will stand in Parramatta , the seat he also contested in 2007 .
The city of Parramatta is the commercial hub of the western suburbs and home to major factories and worksites , including public sector offices , the large Westmead Hospital - Children ’s Hospital complex and a University of Western Sydney campus .
The seat is currently held by Labor backbencher Julie Owens .
Richard Phillips
In another key western suburbs seat , Richard Phillips , 61 , a long - standing member of the SEP ’s national committee , is the party ’s candidate in Blaxland .
Phillips is a regular contributor to the WSWS , particularly on the arts .
Centred on Bankstown , the electorate is one of the most culturally diverse in Australia , with over 40 percent of its population born overseas .
Once a major industrial centre , the area now has an unemployment rate for youth aged between 15 and 19 of 45 percent — almost double the national rate of 25.8 per cent .
The seat is held by Jason Clare , a Labor Party apparatchik who is being touted as a future minister .
Mike Head
Mike Head , 57 , an SEP national committee member , WSWS correspondent and University of Western Sydney law lecturer , will contest the outer south - western seat of Fowler .
The area includes major working class suburbs and newer outlying areas where young families are struggling with rising home repayments and record levels of personal debt .
Head will challenge former union official Chris Hayes , whom Labor ’s factional bosses shunted into the electorate from neighbouring Werriwa to make way for another MP , Laurie Ferguson , whose seat was abolished in an electoral redistribution .
Noel Holt
In the industrial city of Newcastle , 170 kilometres north of Sydney , the SEP ’s candidate is Noel Holt , 62 , a retired Telstra worker with 41 years ’ service .
Holt also contested the seat in 2007 , warning of the pro-business character of a Rudd Labor government .
Newcastle used to be one of the country ’s biggest industrial centres , with mining , steelworks , docks and railways .
Over the past 30 years , thousands of permanent jobs have been eliminated through closures , leaving school leavers to compete for casual and part - time jobs in call centres and the retail and service sectors .
Joe Lopez
In Western Australia , Joe Lopez , a 45 - year - old hospital worker , will stand in Swan , the same seat he contested in 2007 .
The electorate features sections of light industry , the railway marshalling yards , and Perth ’s international and domestic airport terminals .
It contains a large population of students from Curtin University , and is currently held by the Liberal Party ’s Steve Irons by a slim margin .
Lopez , a member of the party since 1984 , has written for the WSWS on the devastating consequences of the underfunding of the public health system and of escalating living costs that lie behind the image of Western Australia as a “ boom ” mining state .
Patrick O'Connor
Keo Vongvixay
In Victoria , the SEP ’s Senate team is Patrick O’Connor and Keo Vongvixay .
O’Connor , 30 , joined the party in 2003 , is a national committee member who has written extensively for the WSWS on international and Australian politics , including Canberra ’s neo-colonial operations in the Asia - Pacific region .
Vongvixay is a 39 - year - old health worker who came to Australia as a young boy with his family from Laos in 1981 .
He first became attracted to the SEP during its 1996 federal election campaign because of the party ’s internationalist perspective .
Peter Byrne
For the northern Melbourne working class seat of Calwell , the party ’s candidate is Peter Byrne , 51 , an architect and son of a car worker , who joined the SEP in 1983 .
For more than two decades , he has played a leading role in the work of the party ’s Melbourne area , including in campaigns to defend the jobs and basic rights of car workers , building workers , pilots and teachers .
Calwell is home to the Ford motor company and associated car parts suppliers where workers face the continual threat of closure and the slashing of conditions .
With a growing population of Iraqi and other immigrant families , the electorate extends out to Craigieburn and Sunbury , encompassing newer housing developments in northern mortgage - belt suburbs like Roxburgh Park .
Tania Baptist
Tania Baptist , 38 , a law clerk who joined the party in 2006 , is the candidate for Gellibrand , an inner-western electorate that covers the working class suburbs of Footscray , Altona , Braybrook , Brooklyn , Maidstone , Yarraville and Williamstown .
It was once the industrial heart of Melbourne , the site of major meatworks , tanneries , ship building , ammunitions , petrochemical , railway workshops and automobile construction .
Much of this industry was shut down in the 1980s and 1990s under the Hawke and Keating Labor governments .
It remains the site of major workplaces , including a Toyota car plant , petrochemicals and Tenix shipbuilding , as well as Victoria University .
Baptist , who stood on the SEP ’s Senate ticket in Victoria in 2007 , will challenge Health Minister Nicola Roxon , who is in charge of Labor ’s blueprint to cut long - term health spending .
The SEP urges all supporters and readers of the World Socialist Web Site to give their full support to the SEP ’s election campaign by distributing our election statements , donating to our $ 40,000 election fund , attending our regular election committee meetings in each electorate , voting for our candidates and above all by joining and building the SEP as the new socialist and internationalist party of the working class .

Ben Goldacre , The Guardian , Saturday 3 July 2010
What do people do when confronted with scientific evidence that challenges their pre-existing view ?
Often they will try to ignore it , intimidate it , buy it off , sue it for libel , or reason it away .
The classic paper on the last of those strategies is from Lord in 1979 : they took two groups of people , one in favour of the death penalty , the other against it , and then presented each with a piece of scientific evidence that supported their pre-existing view , and a piece that challenged it .
Murder rates went up , or down , for example , after the abolition of capital punishment in a state , or comparing neighbouring states , and the results were as you might imagine .
Each group found extensive methodological holes in the evidence they disagreed with , but ignored the very same holes in the evidence that reinforced their views .
Some people go even further than this , when presented with unwelcome data , and decide that science itself is broken .
Politicians will cheerfully explain that the scientific method simply cannot be used to determine the outcomes of a drugs policy .
Alternative therapists will explain that their pill is special , among all pills , and you simply cannot find out if it works by using a trial .
How deep do these views go , and how far do they generalise ?
Professor Geoffrey Munro took around a hundred students and told them they were participating in a study on “ judging the quality of scientific information ” , now published in the Journal of Applied Social Psychology .
First , their views on whether homosexuality might be associated with mental illness were assessed , and then they were divided into two groups .
The first group were given five research studies that confirmed their pre-existing view .
Students who thought homosexuality was associated with mental illness , for example , were given papers explaining that there were more gay people in psychological treatment centres than the general population .
The second group were given research that contradicted their pre-existing view .
( After the study was finished , we should be clear , they were told that all these research papers were actually fake , and given the opportunity to read real research on the topic if they wanted to ) .
Then they were asked about the research they had read , and were asked to rate their agreement with the following statement :
“ The question addressed in the studies summarized … is one that cannot be answered using scientific methods . ”
As you would expect , the people whose pre-existing views had been challenged were more likely to say that science simply cannot be used to measure whether homosexuality is associated with mental illness .
But then , moving on , the researchers asked a further set of questions , about whether science could be usefully deployed to understand all kinds of stuff , all entirely unrelated to stereotypes about homosexuality : “ the existence of clairvoyance ” , “ the effectiveness of spanking as a disciplinary technique for children ” , “ the effect of viewing television violence on violent behavior ” , “ the accuracy of astrology in predicting personality traits ” , and “ the mental and physical health effects of herbal medications ” .
Their views on each issue were added together to produce one bumper score on the extent to which they thought science could be informative on all of these questions , and the results were truly frightening .
People whose pre-existing stereotypes about homosexuality had been challenged by the scientific evidence presented to them were more inclined to believe that science had nothing to offer , on any question , not just on homosexuality , when compared with people whose views on homosexuality had been reinforced .
When presented with unwelcome scientific evidence , it seems , in a desperate bid to retain some consistency in their world view , people would rather conclude that science in general is broken .
This is an interesting finding .
But I ’m not sure it makes me very happy .
WW - II Trophy tank
14 September 2000 , a Komatsu D375A - 2 pulled an abandoned tank from its archival tomb under the bottom of a lake near Johvi , Estonia .
The Soviet - built T34/76A tank had been resting at the bottom of the lake for 56 years .
According to its specifications , it ’s a 27 - tonne machine with a top speed of 53 km / h .
From February to September 1944 , heavy battles were fought in the narrow , 50 km - wide , Narva front in the northeastern part of Estonia .
Over 100,000 men were killed and 300,000 men were wounded there .
During battles in the summer of 1944 , the tank was captured from the Soviet army and used by the German army .
( This is the reason that there are German markings painted on the tank ’s exterior . )
On 19 September 1944 , German troops began an organised retreat along the Narva front .
It is suspected that the tank was then purposefully driven into the lake , abandoning it when its captors left the area .
At that time , a local boy walking by the lake Kurtna Matasjarv noticed tank tracks leading into the lake , but not coming out anywhere .
For two months he saw air bubbles emerging from the lake .
This gave him reason to believe that there must be an armoured vehicle at the lake ’s bottom .
A few years ago , he told the story to the leader of the local war history club “ Otsing ” .
Together with other club members , Mr Igor Shedunov initiated diving expeditions to the bottom of the lake about a year ago .
At the depth of 7 metres they discovered the tank resting under a 3 - metre layer of peat .
Enthusiasts from the club , under Mr Shedunov ’s leadership , decided to pull the tank out .
In September 2000 they turned to Mr Aleksander Borovkovthe , manager of the Narva open pit of the stock company AS Eesti Polevkivi , to rent the company ’s Komatsu D375A - 2 bulldozer .
Currently used at the pit , the Komatsu dozer was manufactured in 1995 , and has 19,000 operating hours without major repairs .
The pulling operation began at 09:00 and was concluded at 15:00 , with several technical breaks .
The weight of the tank , combined with the travel incline , made a pulling operation that required significant muscle .
The D375A - 2 handled the operation with power and style .
The weight of the fully armed tank was around 30 tons , so the tractive force required to retrieve it was similar .
A main requirement for the 68 - tonne dozer was to have enough weight to prevent shoe - slip while moving up the hill .
After the tank surfaced , it turned out to be a ‘ trophy ’ tank , that had been captured by the German army in the course of the battle at Sinimaed ( Blue Hills ) about six weeks before it was sunk in the lake .
Altogether , 116 shells were found on board .
Remarkably , the tank was in good condition , with no rust , and all systems ( except the engine ) in working condition .
This is a very rare machine , especially considering that it fought both on the Russian and the German sides .
Plans are under way to fully restore the tank .
It will be displayed at a war history museum , that will be founded at the Gorodenko village on the left bank of the River Narva .
Looking at the two tracked machines , the modern yellow Komatsu dozer is a reminder of how machine technologies have advanced , and the region ’s prospects of peace and prosperity have brightened .
Preparing to pull it out .
People from the nearby village come to look how it would be done .
Komatsu D375A - 2 is ready to go .
Here it comes …
Through muddy shore of the lake …
What a mint condition .
As it has been mentioned it was captured by Germans and that ’s why there are Nazi symbol on it .
As far it has been known , after a small repair and service they were able to start it ’s diesel engine .
Here is the video footage of the event :
