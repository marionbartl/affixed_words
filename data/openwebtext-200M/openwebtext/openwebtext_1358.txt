PHOENIX -- As many as 15,000 immigrants and activists marched four miles through the city on January 16 to protest the ongoing racist law enforcement practices of America 's most notorious anti-immigrant sheriff .
Though he is currently under federal investigation for civil right abuses , Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio has continued to terrorize immigrants and communities of color with his draconian policies .
But last weekend 's demonstration -- which dwarfed the size of other recent protests against Arpaio - - drew faith , labor and community organizations together to declare that " Arpaio 's America is not our America . "
The march was organized by a number of immigrant rights organizations , led by the Puente Movement and the National Day Laborers Organizing Network ( NDLON ) .
Thousands assembled in Falcon Park before marching to Arpaio 's famous " tent city " jail , holding signs that read " We are human " and chanting " Joe must go ! "
Last year , Arpaio made national headlines when he marched more than 200 undocumented prisoners , shackled and wearing striped prison suits , before television cameras to an outdoor prison surrounded by high - voltage electrified fences .
Arpaio is infamous for his bigoted policing against documented and undocumented immigrants in Arizona , where he has used his authority under the federal government 's 287 ( g ) program -- which allows local officials to enforce federal immigration laws -- to harass , detain , humiliate and divide immigrant families .
Racial profiling in neighborhood sweeps and raids that target Latino and other communities of color have continued under Arpaio .
Sandra Castro , a local organizer with the Puente Movement in Phoenix , said the aim of the march was to bring Arpaio 's injustices to the attention of Barack Obama and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano .
" We are calling for the termination of the 287 ( g ) program and an end to the collaboration between Arpaio and ICE [ Immigration and Customs Enforcement ] , " she said .
OVER THE past year , organizing by activists in Arizona and across the country pressured the Department of Justice to open a federal investigation of the civil rights crisis that Arpaio has created in the state .
Additionally , congressional hearings were convened , and the Department of Homeland Security stripped Arpaio of his power to arrest undocumented immigrants .
But despite having his 287( g ) powers weakened , Arpaio continues to legally target the immigrant community under a revised federal agreement that allows jail officials to enforce immigration laws .
Activists report that local police continue to arrest undocumented immigrants in the streets , in violation of the law .
This systematic racial profiling has more generally terrorized communities of color , documented or not .
" The conditions in the tent city are still harsh , " said Castro .
" There is still segregation between documented and undocumented prisoners and chain gangs are used . "
As the Puente Movement put it in a call - to - action statement on its Web site in the run-up the march , " Unfortunately , fear and injustice remain prevalent in Maricopa County .
Not much has changed as Joe Arpaio and his sheriff 's deputies continue to terrorize the streets of Maricopa County and continue their physical abuse in the jail with the 287 ( g ) agreement . "
The marchers last weekend wanted to highlight these ongoing civil rights abuses and demand an end to the 287 ( g ) program and other efforts like the so - called " Secure Communities " initiative , which lead to the kind of racial profiling and civil rights abuses that Arpaio has come to epitomize .
Activists also called for an end to the raids and separation of families , and demanded that Washington enact comprehensive immigration reform that would provide legalization for the undocumented .
Sarahi Uribe , an organizer with NDLON , emphasized the demonstration 's purpose in sending a message to Washington .
" We want to tell [ Napolitano ] to stop the deportations and abuses of civil rights , " she told The Arizona Republic .
" We 're very inspired by the civil rights struggle in this country , and we see this as a continued fight . "
Much of the media coverage of the march was dominated by violence that erupted between police and a small group of protesters , resulting in five arrests .
While organizers said that the small group of black - clad anarchists who sparred with police , allegedly throwing rocks and bottles , did n't represent the agenda of the march , others claim the police violence was unprovoked .
Police used horses and pepper spray that reportedly affected several small children and families downwind from the incident .
Overall , though , the atmosphere of the march was peaceful and powerful , according to Castro .
Speakers included Dolores Huerta , cofounder of the United Farm Workers , as well as singers Linda Ronstadt and Zach de la Rocha .
" People have seen that Obama has n't really done anything on immigration reform and the injustice in Arizona is still happening , " said Castro , explaining the high turnout at the march in spite of diminished national media attention on Arpaio 's abuses .
Castro also referred to the anger locally at the passage of HB 2008 late last year , a new state law that requires public employees to report any undocumented immigrants who request public benefits .
This law is adding to the anti-immigrant climate in Arizona that Arpaio has spearheaded .
" But as Arpaio continues his attacks , we 've seen constant national solidarity with the immigrant community here , " said Castro , adding that local groups like the Puente Movement will continue to protest against Arpaio , as it has for the past year and a half .
Arizona has become a testing ground for anti-immigrant laws , which reactionary policymakers seek to impose on a national scale .
It will take a revived national immigrant rights movement to resist such bigoted policies that terrorize immigrants in Arizona and in other parts of the country - - a movement that stands with the immigrant community in Arizona and accepts nothing less than full legalization .
( CNN ) --
Got a wish for fish ?
These days , it 's hard to know what underwater life you should be eating .
There 's talk of great benefits from fish - originating omega - 3 fatty acids but worries about contamination and concerns about the environmental impact of farmed fish .
PETA , People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals , even launched a campaign last year to discourage people from killing and eating fish , suggesting that they be called " sea kittens " instead .
In answering a recent reader question about the relative benefits of farmed and wild salmon , CNNHealth 's nutrition expert , Dr. Melina Jampolis , urged the reader to " limit farmed salmon consumption to once a week at most if you are unable to find fresh , wild salmon . "
The answer , which also quoted a spokeswoman for the nonprofit Environmental Working Group , generated a flurry of questions and comments .
In response , CNNHealth took a deeper look at the issue .
" It 's really high time that people have a new perspective on farmed salmon from a nutrition standpoint , " said Gavin Gibbons , spokesman for the National Fisheries Institute Inc. , the largest seafood trade organization in the United States .
Salmon is rich in omega - 3 polyunsaturated fat and is a good source of protein while being low in calories and saturated fat .
Omega - 3 fatty acids have been shown to reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death and are associated with better cholesterol levels .
Six ounces of East Coast Atlantic salmon has more DHA and EPA omega - 3 fatty acids than the same weight of wild salmon , shrimp , chicken or beef ( which has none ) .
Because of these benefits , the American Heart Association says , people should eat fish twice a week , especially fatty fish such as salmon .
But studies have found that some species of fish are contaminated with methylmercury , dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) .
A 2003 report from the Environmental Working Group showed that farmed salmon in the U.S. has the highest levels of PCBs , toxic man-made chemicals .
And a widely publicized study in the journal Science in January 2004 suggested that farmed Atlantic salmon had higher levels of PCBs and other toxics than wild Pacific salmon .
Amid public concern , the importation of farmed Atlantic salmon to the United States went down by 20 percent in early 2004 .
But subsequent research has found that the health benefits of both farmed and wild salmon exceed potential risks , said Eric Rimm , associate professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health .
Rimm was a co-author of a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2006 that said the PCB levels in farmed salmon were not a cause of concern compared with the benefits .
" It 's clear that if there is any risk , the benefit is still in the range of 300 to 1,000 times greater from the fact that you 're getting the omega - 3s , " he said .
Jampolis , citing the more recent research , agreed that the benefits of eating any salmon outweigh the risks , especially with heart disease being the leading cause of death in the United States and the fact that salmon is one of the best sources of heart healthy omega - 3 fatty acids .
She continues to recommend trimming the skin and fat as much as possible and using cooking methods such as grilling and boiling to reduce fat , as this is where the toxic chemicals are stored .
Farmed fish receive a diet that often consists of smaller fish , such as sardines , and if they eat contaminated food , the fish themselves retain that toxicity .
In recent years , fish - feed makers have done a better job of regulating themselves , and the levels of some contaminants have gone down , Rimm said .
Farmed salmon is not the main source of PCBs for the average person ; in fact , the majority of these chemicals that we ingest daily probably comes from other animal products such as beef and chicken , he said .
Because farmed salmon are fed more , they contain more omega - 3 fatty acids than wild fish , which tend to burn off these fats , he said .
Anyone concerned about contamination issues should try to find out where their fish came from and read about any potential problems in that area , said David Love , project director at the Center for a Livable Future at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health .
He called for more widespread testing of contaminants in fish in the United States and better labeling practices so consumers know how and where their fish were caught .
Fish eaters should also consider eating smaller fish on the food chain , such as anchovies , mackerel and sardines , because they live shorter lives and do n't have as much opportunity as larger fish to pick up toxics , Love said .
Since they are lower on the food chain , they are a more sustainable choice , he said .
The environmental impact of eating particular kinds of fish is an important matter but not so straightforward , experts say .
To produce one farmed salmon , you have to feed it more than its weight in smaller fish , which leads to a net loss of fish from the sea and potential ecosystem disruption , Love said .
" It may not hurt my health , and it may not hurt your health , but on a population level , you can see some issues , " Love said .
Some farmed fish may also receive antibiotics that , if spread in the human population in large quantities , could lead to antibiotic resistance , meaning bacteria would no longer respond to these drugs , he said .
But there are also farmed fish produced in environmentally friendly situations , Rimm said .
In some cases , it may take more energy to capture wild fish than to keep them in a pen , leading to a negative environmental impact .
Eating different kinds of fish is good for both your individual health and for the environment , experts say .
From the health angle , it minimizes your risk of contamination from any one fish group , Jampolis said .
From the environmental perspective , it would be detrimental to the ecosystem if everyone ate just one kind of fish en masse , Love said .
In the race to say something stupid about the tragedy in Haiti , the competition has been fierce .
A proud British entry , John Sentamu , the Archbishop of York , spent a full five minutes yesterday waffling on the Today Programme in response to an increasingly bewildered John Humphrys asking him how he reconciled belief in a loving God with the devastation .
Then another man of the cloth , US Christian fundamentalist preacher Pat Robertson , weighed in with a history lesson : back in the 19th century , the Haitian people " got together and swore a pact to the devil .
They said , we will serve you if you 'll get us free from the French .
True story .
And so , the devil said , OK it 's a deal . "
And while it is easy , and even necessary , for the sake of sanity , to remind ourselves that Pat Robertson is a deluded old man who also thought that the attacks on the World Trade Centre were divine retribution for the legalisation of abortion and gay marriage , and that Hurricane Katrina was just God 's way of evening up the score after too much bonne temps roulez on Bourbon Street , the same can't be said of the most promising entrant so far in this dismal race to the bottom .
Rush Limbaugh may be a recovering painkiller addict , but he's also the chief ideologue of the Republican party in the US .
With his fellow shock - jock Glenn Beck , Limbaugh has waged a fierce and largely successful campaign to drive the few remaining moderates out of the party .
So when he says that Americans should feel no need to contribute to Haitian Earthquake relief , since " We 've already donated to Haiti .
It 's called the US income tax , " it matters .
Limbaugh has his own pathology , and you do n't have to be Sigmund Freud to think that a man in whose luggage DEA agents found a bottle of Viagra on his way back from a trip to the Dominican Republic might have picked another way to express his disdain for the Haitian people than by observing last year : " Haiti ?
You can't even pick up a prostitute down there without genuine fear of Aids . "
But crude racism – the same crude racism that scotched Limbaugh 's plans to buy the St Louis Rams football team – is only part of what 's going on here .
It 's true that a certain kind of white person will never forgive the Haitians for freeing themselves from the French – just as another kind of person , white or black , will recall that same glorious history as one of the reasons not to write off Haiti or the Haitians .
( And if you have any interest in the history , I urge you to read CLR James 's great The Black Jacobins , published more than 50 years ago and still one of the best books about Haiti ever written . )
But it 's also a sign of how crazed the American right has become that Limbaugh could claim the Haitian earthquake was " made to order " for Obama because it would allow the president to " burnish his credibility … with both light - skinned and black - skinned " African Americans .
Now there are plenty of reasons to be disappointed with Obama – we write about them every week in the Nation .
But you 'd need more than a serious OxyContin habit to think Obama needs any burnishing among African Americans .
No , what Rush is really doing is what he gets paid for : speaking aloud the things his millions of dittohead followers would love to say , but know they should n't .
Will this make some Americans switch him off ?
It would be pretty to think so .
Even prettier to think that millions more will be outraged enough to give to Haitian relief .
But you need n't remain a bystander in this fight .
Limbaugh 's employer , Premier Radio , is a subsidiary of Clear Channel , the largest provider of outdoor advertising in the UK .
It would probably be unlawful to scribble " Shut Up Rush " on all their billboards , but you could certainly make your feelings known by telephone ( +4420 7478 2200 ) to their offices at Golden Square – or via their corporate website .
January 8 , 2010
Nicole Colson looks at the increasing numbers of families struggling to pay for heat in one of the coldest winters in decades -- and the sometimes deadly consequences .
THREE LIVES lost over a $ 181 utility bill .
That 's the ugly truth in Detroit , where a house fire killed three people on January 5 .
The deaths were entirely preventable .
Brothers Marvin Allen , aged 61 , and Tyrone Allen , 60 , and Lynn Greer , Tyrone 's 59 - year - old girlfriend , were killed when the Allens ' two - story home caught on fire , and they were unable to escape .
The Allens ' nephew was able to climb out of a second - story window to safety , but Tyrone and Marvin used canes and walkers to get around the house , and were unable to get out .
According to Detroit Fire Department Capt .
Steve Varnas , the blaze was most likely sparked by space heaters running to provide warmth to the home in sub-freezing temperatures .
The residents , it appears , had been reduced to illegally accessing power in order to heat their house ever since DTE Energy cut the home 's electricity in June 2008 .
" People struggling will try to do whatever they can , " Varnas told the Associated Press .
As recently as last month , DTE apparently told Lynn Greer that a deposit of $ 181 would have to be paid before power could be turned back on .
A West Detroit house where a fire likely originating from space heaters killed three
Charlotte Nash , Marvin and Tyrone 's sister , told reporters that her brothers survived on Social Security benefits .
" They were good brothers , " she said from the driveway of the burned home .
" They were caring .
If they had a dime and you needed a nickel , they would give it to you . "
But rather than examine why it is that three people could lose their lives over $ 181 , an energy company spokesman suggested that the Allens and Greer were to blame -- because they did n't seek funding assistance to help with the past due bills .
" This is obviously a tragic situation , " DTE Energy spokesman Scott Simons told the Detroit Free Press , " but possibly one that could have been avoided . "
THE TRUTH is that the deaths of Marvin and Tyrone Allen and Lynne Greer wo n't be the last ones that occur this winter as a result of people being cut off from heat in the richest country on the planet .
Dangerous cold -- in some areas breaking decades - old records -- has already been blamed for the deaths of several elderly and / or homeless people across the U.S. .
And even those with a place to stay are n't immune to the danger , as the Detroit fire shows .
Across the country , the recession has made it increasingly difficult for people to pay home heating bills .
As a result , many families are suffering in freezing - cold temperatures , unable to afford home heating oil or payments to keep their utilities from being shut off .
Others , inevitably , are turning to dangerous practices like propping open oven doors for warmth , or relying on overtaxed space heaters .
According to a report last month by the Washington - based National Energy Assistance Directors Association , a record number of U.S. households received help with heating and cooling bills in fiscal year 2009 - - nearly 8.3 million compared to 6.1 million the previous year , a 25 percent increase , despite the fact that energy costs have dropped slightly since last year .
At the same time that more people were receiving assistance , utility shutoffs across the country actually continued to rise by nearly 5 percent -- to 4.3 million in 2009 , from 4.1 million the year before .
DTE Energy alone reported 221,000 gas and electric shutoffs in the calendar year 2009 , compared with 142,000 in 2008 - - out of roughly 2.7 million electric and natural gas customers throughout Michigan .
In other words , DTE cut off more than 8 percent of its customers in 2009 .
Similar increases in shutoffs and requests for aid are being reported in other cities and states .
In Montana , applications for the Low - Income Home Energy Assistance Program ( LIHEAP , a federally funded program administered individually by states ) are up 17 percent from a year ago .
In Bozeman , Mont. , Caren Couch of the Human Resource Development Council , which oversees the area 's LIHEAP program , told the Bozeman Daily Chronicle that she expects the number of applications this year to double -- driven by layoffs in the construction industry and those who are ineligible for unemployment benefits .
Just as food banks across the country have reported a rise in the number of formerly middle - income people seeking assistance , a similar trend is occurring with those in need of heating assistance .
" We 're also seeing households who have never had any type of assistance or social service programs , people who own larger or more expensive homes who are struggling because they do n't have the same incomes they used to have , " Couch said .
" They 're grasping at any program that might be out there . "
In Hempstead , N.Y. , LIHEAP program director Liz McDermott told NBCNewYork.com that her hotline receives 300 calls a day from people seeking help to fill their oil tanks or pay their gas bills .
" We 've had a number of calls from frustrated people on the verge of tears , " said McDermott .
In Chicago , power company ComEd is shutting off service in record numbers .
According to a local CBS news report last month , " ComEd 's net power shutoffs have soared this year ; from 39,000 in 2008 to more than 67,000 through October 2009 . "
Virgina Rivers was one of those trying to get by in frigid weather without heat .
Walking with a crutch because of a shooting that injured her spine nearly two decades ago , Rivers recently told reporter Mike Flannery that she had been cut off from both gas and electric in August .
" It hurts , " she said .
" I literally sat here last night and I cried , just for the thought that [ the bills ] are just so high , I really can't afford it . "
Another woman , Veronica Hoskins , who raises her grandson , told Flannery that she was forced to seek help with her bills from Lutheran Social Services .
ComEd had been demanding more than $ 626 , while Peoples Gas demanded more than $ 117 .
Both utilities were threatening to shut off service .
AID AGENCIES like Lutheran Social Services have become an important lifeline for many .
But they 're feeling the pinch themselves , as the federal government and cash - strapped states cut funding .
According to Flannery , Lutheran has had a hard time making its payroll - - because the state of Illinois has failed to pay the organization $ 8 million since last summer .
" We 're spiraling out of control in this state , with our state services , " Lutheran Social Services ' Jo Ann Dollard told Flannery .
" It 's a ripple effect .
It affects companies like ComEd .
And it affects the people we 're serving , "
In Pennsylvania , a $ 56 million decrease in federal funding for the LIHEAP program this year means that the state is tightening eligibility requirements -- so fewer people will qualify for assistance programs than last year .
The maximum annual income allowed for a family of four to receive assistance is now $ 33,075 -- over $ 11,000 less than last year 's limit .
Additionally , the state is decreasing the size of so - called " crisis grants " -- intended for households in the direst need that have no source of heat and face a health - or life - threatening emergency -- from $ 800 last year to $ 400 this year .
The state also delayed the opening for crisis grant applications by an additional two months this year , leaving many families scrambling in emergency situations .
" We are getting calls every day from people with no oil , " Fred Lettieri , executive director of the Scranton - Lackawanna Human Development Agency , which administers LIHEAP in Lackawanna County , Pa. , told the Scranton Times - Tribune .
" People do n't want to be in this position , but they are .
We should be providing more help ; instead , we 're providing less . "
In December , according to the Pittsburgh Tribune Review , the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission announced that 17,037 Pennsylvania households started winter with their heat cut off -- an 18.5 percent increase over last year .
Sixty - five - year - old Vietnam veteran Grant Dunlap and his wife Deborah sat in a waiting room at Carolina Community Actions in Rock Hill , S.C. , this week , waiting to ask for heating assistance .
The couple , forced to get by on Grant 's $ 1,068 a month in disability after Deborah was laid off in November , brought their bank statements showing that they had just $ 1.62 in their account .
In her hands , Deborah held an electric bill of $ 285 , with $ 192 past due .
Their cutoff date was scheduled for that day .
" We 've been worried about it for days , " Deborah told the Rock Hill Herald .
" We had no Christmas . "
In a country that squanders nearly $ 2 billion a week on its wars , it 's criminal that Grant and Deborah Dunlap -- and millions more families like them -- should be forced to worry about being able to afford such a fundamental necessity of life .
It 's been simultaneously amusing and horrifying to read through the comments on my post about the misguided atheist holiday display in Illinois .
This is still the Internet after all , and " reading comprehension " is not a highly valued skill , even among subsamples self - selected for their logic and reasoning abilities .
In brief : thinking that atheists should n't be needlessly obnoxious does n't make me a " faithiest " or an " accommodationist " or someone without the courage of my convictions .
Those would be hard charges to support against someone who wrote this or this or this or this .
I just think it 's possible to have convictions without being a jerk about them .
" I disagree with you " and " You are a contemptible idiot " are not logically equivalent .
Phil just pointed to a good post by Steve Cumo about precisely the same issue , with " atheism " replaced by " skepticism . "
A lot of skeptics / atheists are truly excited and passionate about their worldviews , and that 's unquestionably a good thing .
But it can turn into a bad thing if we allow that passion to manifest itself as contempt for everyone who disagrees with us .
( For certain worthy targets , sure . )
There 's certainly a place for telling jokes , or calling a crackpot a crackpot ; being too afraid of stepping on people 's toes is just as bad as stomping on feet for the sheer joy of it .
But there 's also a place for letting things slide , living to dispute another day .
We atheists / skeptics have a huge advantage when it comes to reasonable , evidence - based argumentation : we 're right .
( Provisionally , with appropriate humble caveats about those aspects of the natural world we do n't yet understand . )
We do n't need to stoop to insults to win debates ; reality is on our side .
And there are many people out there who are willing to listen to logic and evidence , when presented reasonably and in good faith .
We should always presume that people who disagree with us are amenable to reasonable discussion , until proven otherwise .
( Cf. the Grid of Disputation .
See also Dr. Free - Ride . )
That 's very different than " accommodationism , " which holds that science and religion are n't really in conflict .
The problem with accommodationism is n't that its adherents are n't sufficiently macho or strident ; it 's that they 're wrong .
And when respected organizations like the National Academy of Sciences , the National Center for Science Education , or the American Association for the Advancement of Science go on record as claiming that science and religion are completely compatible , as if they were speaking for scientists , that 's unconscionable and should be stopped .
They do n't have to go on at great length about how a scientific worldview undermines religious belief , even if it 's true ; they can just choose not to say anything at all about religion .
That 's not their job .
It 's also wrong to fetishize politeness for its own sake .
Some people manage to forfeit the right to be taken seriously or treated politely .
But that should n't be the default position .
And being polite does n't make you more likely to be correct , or vice - versa .
And -- to keep piling on the caveats -- being " polite " does n't mean " keeping quiet , " at least as a general principle .
We all know people who will resort to a cowardly tactic of claiming to be " offended " when you say something perfectly reasonable with which they happen to disagree .
There 's no reason to give into that ; but the solution is not to valorize obnoxiousness for its own sake .
The irony is that the pro-obnoxious crowd ( obnoxionists ? ) is ultimately making the same mistake as the accommodationist crowd .
Namely : blurring the lines between the truth of a claim and the manner in which the claim is presented .
Accommodationists slide from " we can work together , in a spirit of mutual respect , with religious people on issues about which we agree " to " we should pretend that science and religion are compatible . "
But obnoxionists tend to slide from " we disagree with those people " to " we should treat those people with contempt . "
Neither move is really logically supportable .
A lot of the pro-obnoxiousness sentiment stems from a feeling that atheism is a disrespected minority viewpoint in our culture , and I have some sympathy with that .
Atheists should never be ashamed of their beliefs , or afraid to support them vigorously .
And -- let 's be honest -- there 's a certain amount of pleasure to be found in being part of a group where everyone sits around congratulating each other on their superior intellect and reasoning abilities , while deriding their opponents with terms like " superstition " and " brain damage " and " child abuse . "
But these are temptations to be avoided , not badges of honor .
Within the self - reinforcing culture of vocal non-believers , it 's gotten to the point where saying that someone is " nice " has become an insult .
Let me hereby stake out a brave , contrarian position : in favor of being nice .
I think that folks in the reality - based community should be the paragons of reasonableness and even niceness , while not yielding an inch on the correctness of their views .
We should be the good guys .
We are in possession of some incredible truths about this amazing universe in which we live , and we should be promoting positive messages about the liberating aspects of a life in which human beings are responsible for creating justice and beauty , rather than having them handed to us by supernatural overseers .
Remarkably , I think it 's possible to be positive and nice ( when appropriate ) and say true things at the same time .
But maybe that 's just my crazy utopian streak .
Morning Fix : A premature celebration for the GOP
Republicans in Washington can barely contain their glee at the turn of President Obama 's political fortunes in the first nine months of the year but a new Washington Post / ABC News poll suggests the GOP still faces serious perception problems in the eyes of the American public .
Less than one in five voters ( 19 percent ) expressed confidence in Republicans ' ability to make the right decisions for America 's future while a whopping 79 percent lacked that confidence .
Among independent voters , who went heavily for Obama in 2008 and congressional Democrats in 2006 , the numbers for Republicans on the confidence questions were even more worse .
Just 17 percent of independents expressed confidence in Republicans ' ability to make the right decision while 83 percent said they did not have that confidence .
( While Obama 's numbers on the confidence question were n't amazing -- 49 percent confident / 50 percent not confident -- they were far stronger than those for Republicans . )
On the generic ballot question , 51 percent of the sample said they would cast a vote for a Democratic candidate in their congressional district next fall while just 39 percent said they would opt for a GOP candidate .
( As late as this summer , Republicans had seemingly narrowed the wide generic ballot lead Democrats enjoyed for much of the last two election cycles . )
And , perhaps most troubling for GOP hopes is the fact that just 20 percent of the Post sample identified themselves as Republicans , the lowest that number has been in Post polling since 1983 .
( No , that is not a typo . )
These numbers , coming roughly one year before the 2010 midterm elections , show that any celebration on the GOP 's behalf is premature as the party has yet to convince most voters that it can be a viable alternative to Democratic control in Washington today .
As former House speaker Newt Gingrich ( Ga. ) told the Post 's Dan Balz recently , voters are " more skeptical of Republicans than they were in ' 93 and ' 94 " when the GOP took back the House majority for the first time in four decades .
That 's not to say that 2009 has n't been a good year for Republicans .
By and large , it has been .
The party that was left for dead in January slowly but surely -- thanks to a growing sense of frustration and fear about the growth of government under the Obama administration -- has crawled its way back to relevance .
But , relevance is not all it takes to reclaim the majority mantle in Congress .
While Republicans are outgunned by the bully pulpit of President Obama , they need to find ways over the next year ( or so ) to make sure the American people know what they would do if they were placed in charge after the 2010 election .
In short : Republicans are still a long way from the sort of standing they held with the American people earlier this decade when they controlled the White House , the Senate and the House .
That does n't mean they wo n't find their way there between now and 2010 -- or , more realistically , 2012 -- but they are n't there yet .

Inhofe for Rubio : Sen. Jim Inhofe ( R - Okla . ) , a conservative firebrand , threw his support behind the Senate candidacy former Florida state House speaker Marco Rubio ( R ) on Monday calling him " exactly the type of conservative leader Americans need in Washington today . "
Inhofe is the latest national conservative leader -- former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee ( R ) and Sen. Jim DeMint ( R - S.C. ) are among the others -- to back Rubio 's challenge to Gov. Charlie Crist ( R ) who has secured the endorsement of the National Republican Senatorial Committee among other establishment organizations .
Crist still holds wide leads in both polling and fundraising in the primary race but his recent decision to begin running radio ads touting his conservative credentials suggests he is nervous about his standing .
DeMint Draws a Challenge : Democrats have finally found a challenger to South Carolina Sen .
Jim DeMint in advance of his bid for a second term in 2010 .
Attorney Chad McGowan announced his intention Monday and previewed a message likely to focus heavily on the fact that he has never before held elected office .
" Right now , we have a government of the lobbyists , by the lobbyists and for the lobbyists , " McGowan said in a release .
" It 's time to put middle class families first . "
For all of the vitriol directed at DeMint from national Democrats , it 's not immediately clear that his emergence as a spokesman for conservatives will negatively affect him back in South Carolina .
The state remains solidly conservative and Democrats are far more optimistic -- though not all that optimistic -- about their chances of winning the seat being vacated by Gov. Mark Sanford ( R ) next fall .
McGowan is sure to benefit from some anti-DeMint money headed his way and reportedly has considerable personal wealth of his own to spend on the race but the demographics of the state are tough to overcome .

In one wordless ad , a man is shown moving out of his home and into an apartment due to cost of health care for his hospitalized wife ; the other ad is a more traditional commercial aimed at informing undecided voters what 's in it for them as it relates to the health care plan .
Sestak Gets Ned Nod : Connecticut businessman Ned Lamont , who upset Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I ) in the 2006 Democratic primary only to lose to the incumbent in the general election , endorsed Rep .
Joe Sestak 's primary challenge to party - switching Sen.
Arlen Specter ( D ) at a event in Philadelphia on Monday .
" Joe Sestak knows where he stands politically , " said Lamont .
That 's not something that comes from calculation , that comes from the heart . "
Sestak had touted the endorsement -- without saying who would actually be doing the endorsing -- since last week , and , on a conference call with reporters on Monday , sought to draw a straight line between Lamont 's 2006 campaign and his 2010 bid .
" He is someone we are modeling our campaign on , " said Sestak of Lamont .
One thing Sestak lacks that Lamont had in abundance is personal wealth ; Lamont , like Sestak , was shunned by the party establishment but his deep pockets more than made up for the lack of financial support .
Sestak is a strong fundraiser but does not have that luxury .

How to Be Funny Even When You Think You ’re Not
Evidence of dogs ' sixth - sense : Labrador bolts from U.S. office before earthquake tremors strike building
Animal instinct , pet owners swear by it .
From cats sensing impending health problems like seizures , to dogs barking madly when unfamiliar footsteps appear on the garden path .
Even as far back as 373BC , it is recorded that animals , including rats , snakes and weasels , deserted the Greek city of Helice in droves just days before a quake devastated the place .
Those without that ' special bond ' , though , remain sceptical .
But doubters , prepare to be converted .
Sixth sense :
The dog relaxes on the floor ( above ) before dashing for the exit ( below ) seconds before a quake hits the office
CCTV footage has emerged of a news station office in North Carolina seconds before an eathquake struck on January 9 .
It shows a dog idly passing the time on the floor before , apparently without any duress , springing up and making a swift exit .
Seconds later seats swing out of position , draws slip open and fixtures and fittings begin to wobble .
Then , the shuddering really starts .
While our K9 friend has escaped prior to the quake , people dash for the exits when the room begins to shake forcibly .
The only question is , why did n't man 's best friend warm his unaware human collegues ?
In addition , based on lobbying by certain drug companies , the FDA softened and even omitted some of the warning language on the risk of suicide in pediatric patients associated with some antidepressants .
Bush even appointed David Hager , a physician with few credentials and a known penchant for trying to cure women's health issues with prayer and refusing to prescribe birth control to female patients , as head of the FDA 's Reproductive Drugs Health Advisory Committee .
Food safety was also a concern , with a peanut - related salmonella outbreak that sickened hundreds and killed several people and few foods imported from overseas receiving inspection .
Corruption was so pervasive that when Obama took office in January 2009 , FDA scientists wrote to him essentially begging for help in overhauling the failing agency .
In April 2009 , nine staff members at the FDA wrote him again , asking that some long - time top - level employees be fired -- or even prosecuted .
The staffers are ecstatic about new leadership at the FDA but want bad managers who still remain on the job to be run out of the agency , and in some cases , prosecuted as criminals .
The staffers , whose names are redacted , call for an end to " the culture of wrongdoing and coverup . "
In President Obama 's first budget , he allotted $ 1 billion to the FDA to " increase and improve inspections , domestic surveillance , laboratory capacity and domestic response to prevent and control foodborne illness . "
President Obama 's 2010 budget requests an additional 19 percent budget increase over last year , to $ 3.2 billion .
The agency is in the midst of a three - year plan to raise the number of inspectors from 1,200 to 1,700 by 2010 .
In February 2009 , he also called for a full review of all departments at the FDA .
In March , he appointed two esteemed professionals -- Margaret Hamburg and Joshua Sharfstein -- as commissioner and principal deputy commisioner of the FDA and announced establishment of the Food Safety Working Group to meet regularly with cabinet officials and help advise the president on food safety issues and needs of the department .
These were clearly steps in the right direction .
Since taking over , Hamburg 's FDA has conducted several raids of manufacturers of items like soaps and food products , closing the companies down for poor sanitation and , in some cases , prosecuting owners .
A maker of tuna salad sandwiches was closed after
Recent FDA inspections found evidence of widespread and active rodent and insect infestation , filthy conditions , and poor employee practices , such as allowing food - processing utensils to lie on the floor near live insects .
In June , the President signed a law giving FDA oversight of tobacco products , something many people felt was long overdue .
This is expected to reduce smoking rates significantly in the long term , particularly by discouraging teen smoking through strict advertising laws .
A judge recently upheld nearly all of the legislation 's provisions in a lawsuit filed by tobacco manufacturers that sought to overturn sections of it .
The Center for Drug Evaluation & Research ( CDER ) is responsible for approving new drugs .
After the Vioxx and other scandals , and possibly due to funding cuts , the process of approvals slowed significantly under the Bush administration .
This drew complaints not only from pharmaceutical companies but from patient advocacy groups , who said many patients were being denied potentially lifesaving drugs due to the slow approval process .
As of December 1 , 2009 , the FDA had approved 26 new drugs , which is only 1 more than approved in 2008 .
However , they completed reviews of 85 % of drug applications on time , which is a significant improvement .
One reason for the improvement in meeting deadlines , even though the number of approvals remained nearly stagnant , was the increase in hiring :
Over the last two years , CDER has seen a 34 percent increase in the number of full - time equivalents , or 760 new hires .
The Office of New Drugs has swelled by 26 percent , or 193 full - time equivalents .
Most of these hires came in the last year ; under Bush , the FDA had 700 vacancies that remained unfilled .
The FDA plans to hire more than 1000 more employees agency - wide in the coming year and expects reviews by CDER to pick up as new employees get trained in .
The number of black box warnings added to drug labels dropped from 56 to 31 , but the number of early warnings -- those issued to consumers at the first indication that there might be a serious problem with a certain medication before causality has been established -- more than doubled .
This might indicate that the FDA is invested in becoming more transparent , letting consumers know when it has information rather than keeping quiet about it until the problem has caused enough deaths or damage to establish causality .
Other FDA initiatives under President Obama :
January ( 2009 ) -- FDA sets guidelines for drug and food importations .
March -- Enters into collaboration with 8 academic / research institutions to explore nanotechnology initiatives for medical uses
April -- Launches plan to review all medical devices approved before 1976
June -- Establishes a transparency task force to identify ways for the agency to become more transparent , a major reversal from the secrecy of prior years .
August -- Launches initiative with the European Medicines Agency to establish " good clinical practices "
September -- Releases strategic plan for risk management
December -- Launches widget to address pet health and safety , so pet owners can get rapid information on any concerns with tainted food or illnesses ( Recommend all the Pootie and Woozle owners get this ! )
December -- Launches initiative to study the safety of medications during pregnancy
January ( 2010 ) -- Unveils phase I of transparency initiative
In addition , the FDA has been doing its job , launching numerous raids on companies that fail to abide by safety standards and recalling numerous products for safety reasons or bogus health claims .
Already this month , the FDA has shut down 3 manufacturers of food products with unsanitary conditions .
Also , this FDA approved the first cancer drug for dogs .
This , the alert application , and the section on the site about pets and animals , suggests that this FDA recognizes that pets are an important part of many Americans ' lives .
The one disappointment in the FDA is its recommendation against the reimportation of drugs from outside the US , which they say is for safety concerns .
President Obama says his long - held support of drug reimportations remains firm .
As a Senator , he proposed legislation to allow drug re-importation .
The proposed healthcare legislation also provides an avenue that would , for the first time , allow the FDA to establish a process for approving generic biopharmaceuticals .
While there are quibbles about how long exclusivity should be maintained , it is still imperative to establish this process to ensure that American consumers will get access to generic biopharmaceuticals in the future .
With Pfizer now investing in the " generics " market and several other Big Pharma companies looking to do the same , we may see Big Pharma less engaged in the fight to keep a long timeline against patent expiration .
There is much more to be done , but this agency is clearly headed in the right direction thanks to strong leadership from individuals who place science ahead of ideology .
This is a clear departure from the previous administration and one that will benefit many Americans for years to come .
ONE hot June morning in 1953 , a retired couple from western Missouri packed their Chrysler New Yorker with 11 suitcases and started driving east .
A few hours later , they stopped at a diner in Hannibal , Mo. , and ordered fruit plates and iced tea .
“ We thought we were getting by big as an unknown traveling couple until we went to the counter to pay the bill , ” Harry Truman later wrote of that lunch .
“ Just as we arose from the table some county judges came in and the incog was off . ”
What made Truman , less than six months removed from the presidency , believe he could travel incognito in the first place ?
It ’s true that former presidents quickly drop from public consciousness .
( Did you know that George W. Bush is preparing to throw the ceremonial first pitch at the Texas Rangers ’ home opener ?
Or that Bill Clinton gave a speech to the European Union Parliament in Brussels last week  in the shadow of President Obama ’s celebrated European tour ? )
But they remain famous , and surrounded by assistants and security agents .
In Truman ’s time , things were quite different .
When he retired , 10 years before the Kennedy assassination , former presidents had no Secret Service protection .
Nor were they entitled to pensions .
Truman ’s only income was an Army pension of $ 111.96 a month , and he refused to “ commercialize ” the presidency by accepting lucrative business offers or extravagant speaking fees .
Like his hero Cincinnatus , the Roman leader who forsook power to return to his farm , Truman believed he could easily make the transition from leader of the free world to , as he put it , “ plain , private citizen . ”
As the economy develops , our world has been thick with commercials and advertisements .
However , not all the advertisements have worked as well as what the advertisers thought .
After all , no one wants to read a boring paragraph or a long list about the promoted product .
It ’s the creativity in the ads that can capture the attention of an audience .
Here ’s a collection of stunning and creative advertisements found at the Creative Ad Awards – a new ads collecting website that features the most creative ads from the world .

The Nobel prize for peace .
It is a controversial award having been granted to many who seemingly do n’t deserve it , and not granted to those who do .
This list looks at ten people who were robbed of the prize .
10 Irena Sendler
Irena Sendler was a Polish Catholic who died in 2008 .
From 1939 to 1945 , she personally saved the lives of 2,500 Jewish children from the Warsaw Ghetto .
She forged identification papers , passports , sheltered them in children ’s homes throughout Warsaw .
The Gestapo caught her in 1943 and severely tortured her for the location of the Jews she had extricated from the Ghetto .
She refused to give them up .
She was sentenced to death and saved by a bribe to the Nazi officer in charge , who simply left her in deep in a forest with all four limbs broken .
She recovered and went right back to work saving Jews from the Ghetto .
She was nominated in 2007 , but was passed over in favor of Al Gore .
She was 98 when she died .
9 Mohandas Gandhi
Mohandas Gandhi was murdered in 1948 .
He began his work for Indian independence from Britain in 1916 and finally succeeded in 1947 , when Louis Mountbatten relinquished India from Britain to the Indians .
One man , by himself , Gandhi has been credited with defeating the British Empire singlehandedly , without raising one finger in violence .
He was nominated in 5 years , 1937 , 1938 , 1939 , 1947 , and 1948 .
19 people nominated him in those years , especially Ole Colbjornsen , member of the Norwegian Parliament , who nominated him the first 3 times .
In the years between 1939 and 1947 , he was either not nominated by anyone , or the Swedish Academy refused to consider nominations during the War .
Likewise , in the years preceding 1937 , not one person on Earth nominated him .
A rule stipulates that death before being awarded the Prize renders one ineligible for it , nominated or not .
But I think the Academy could have given it to him posthumously , and no one would have complained .
In which case , they could still award it to him for the year 1948 .
He could certainly replace Cordell Hull , for 1945 .
Hull is mentioned on another Listverse list .
It is possible that his “ experiments ” with under - aged children ( item 8 ) reduced his chances of receiving the prize , but as earlier stated , most people would probably not object to his having been awarded the prize despite them .
8 Abdul Sattar Edhi
The head of the Edhi Foundation , based in Pakistan , he is a philanthropist , who in 1951 opened a small medical shop in Karachi , using his own meager funds , with the sole intention of helping anyone who came in .
He had learned little about medicine , but wanted to help people .
He claims that he does so because he enjoys it , in the same way that an evil man enjoys hurting people .
He has been treating everyone in the Karachi area , and all areas where his branches are located , over the whole world .
He treats people at extremely low cost .
He began the Edhi Foundation with donations from friends and supporters around Karachi , and the Foundation is a free maternity clinic and nursing school .
Students may enroll at absolutely no cost .
Tuition , books , and other equipment are free .
Karachi suffered a flu outbreak in 1957 , and Edhi immediately set up tents in which he and his faculty treated everyone for free .
He bought an ambulance with donations , which he personally drove to accidents , and to his own clinic , or to hospitals .
The Edhi Foundation has a $ 10 million budget , but Edhi refuses to take any of the money for himself .
As he is still alive , it is not entirely fair that he should be on this list , as he may win in the future .
But I thought it fitting , given the recent 2009 Peace Prize , and the fact that he was considered for it also .
7 Jose Figueres Ferrer
Jose Figueres Ferrer was the President of Costa Rica 3 times , and during his first term , he granted women the right to vote , stating that while men may be stronger , there is no difference between male and female mental faculties .
He abolished his country ’s army , arguing that only a police force is necessary for domestic law enforcement , and that an army only exists for the promise of invading another country ; he did not believe any country around him wanted to invade Costa Rica .
After nationalizing Costa Rica ’s banking and creating a welfare state , he outlawed Communism .
Ferrer oversaw the writing of a new constitution , guaranteed state managed public education for every citizen , gave citizenship to the children of black immigrants , and established a civil service bureaucracy .
6 Dr. Feng Shan Ho
He graduated from Munich University in 1932 , and was appointed as a diplomatic secretary in Turkey , then in Vienna in 1937 .
The next year , Hitler annexed Austria , and Ho was promoted to Consul - General of the Chinese Embassy in Vienna .
After Kristallnacht , everyone in Austria knew full well the predicament facing the 200,000 Jews throughout the country .
Their only hope was to escape from Europe , and this was possible only with exit visas .
The Evian Conference of 1938 caused 38 countries to refuse Jews immigration , and Ho was ordered by Chen Jie , the Chinese ambassador to Berlin , not to provide visas for Jews .
Ho endangered himself for all six years of the War by refusing to obey this order .
He issued 1906 visas by 27 October 1938 , some for Jews , some not .
How many Jews he saved will never be ascertained , but given that he issued almost 2,000 in only his first 6 months , he may have saved thousands of lives .
Whoever saves one life saves the world entire .
He was 96 when he died .
He has been nicknamed “ China ’s Schindler . ”
5 Cesar Chavez
He has been called “ the Mexican Martin Luther King . ”
He found working conditions appalling for common Latino laborers in California , and co-founded the National Farm Workers Association , which is now called United Farm Workers .
He organized civil rights activism , and became the Community Service Organization ’s national director in 1958 .
His efforts to gain higher wages and better working conditions for farm laborers finally succeeded in 1966 .
After that , he fought to restrict illegal immigrants from entering the U. S. and taking jobs from legal Mexican citizens .
His birthday is a state holiday in California .
He died in 1993 , and the next year was awarded the Medal of Freedom from Bill Clinton .
4 Stephen Biko
After Nelson Mandela was imprisoned in 1964 , Steve Biko became the primary authority of the anti-Apartheid movement in South Africa .
He founded the Black Consciousness Movement and advocated a worldwide “ brotherhood of man . ”
He was the primary architect of the protests that reached a head at the Soweto Uprising in June , 1976 .
He preached non-violence , which was not entirely heeded , and the uprising resulted in Apartheid police slaughtering school children at random in the crowds .
They then targeted Biko and finally caught him , and beat him to death , from 11 September to 12 September , 1977 .
3 Dorothy Day
Dorothy Day ( November 8 , 1897 – November 29 , 1980 ) was an American journalist , distributist , and devout Catholic convert .
In the 1930s , Day worked closely with fellow activist Peter Maurin to establish the Catholic Worker movement , a nonviolent , pacifist , movement that continues to combine direct aid for the poor and homeless with nonviolent direct action on their behalf .
A revered figure within segments of the U.S. Catholic community , Day is being considered for sainthood by the Catholic Church .
Day has been the recipient of numerous posthumous honors and awards .
Among them : in 1992 , she received the Courage of Conscience Award from the Peace Abbey , and in 2001 , she was inducted into the National Women ’s Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls , New York .
2 Oskar Schindler
Oskar Schindler was the most famous member of the Avenue of the Righteous .
He saved 1,200 Jews from the Nazis by employing them in his munitions factories from 1943 to the end of the War .
He therefore placed himself in extreme mortal peril constantly during that time , as the Nazis knew full well that his workers were Jewish .
He was very persuasive , having paid millions to the Nazi Party up to that time , and insisted that his workers were more useful to the Wehrmacht by manufacturing pots , pans , and ammunition .
But secretly , he had his workers sabotage the ammunition so it would not function .
1 Venerable Pope Pius XII
On April 28 , 1935 , four years before the War even started , Eugenio Pacelli ( soon to become Pope Pius XII ) gave a speech that aroused the attention of the world press .
Speaking to an audience of 250,000 pilgrims in Lourdes , France , the future Pius XII stated that the Nazis “ are in reality only miserable plagiarists who dress up old errors with new tinsel .
It does not make any difference whether they flock to the banners of social revolution , whether they are guided by a false concept of the world and of life , or whether they are possessed by the superstition of a race and blood cult . ”
During the war ( when Pacelli had become Pope ) he spoke out strongly in defense of the Jews with the first mass arrests in 1943 , and L’Osservatore Romano carried an article protesting the internment of Jews and the confiscation of their property .
The Fascist press came to call the Vatican paper ‘ a mouthpiece of the Jews . ’
Prior to the Nazi invasion , the Pope had been working hard to get Jews out of Italy by emigration ; he now was forced to turn his attention to finding them hiding places : “ [ t ] he Pope sent out the order that religious buildings were to give refuge to Jews , even at the price of great personal sacrifice on the part of their occupants ; he released monasteries and convents from the cloister rule forbidding entry into these religious houses to all but a few specified outsiders , so that they could be used as hiding places .
Thousands of Jews — the figures run from 4,000 to 7,000 — were hidden , fed , clothed , and bedded in the 180 known places of refuge in Vatican City , churches and basilicas , Church administrative buildings , and parish houses .
Unknown numbers of Jews were sheltered in Castel Gandolfo , the site of the Pope ’s summer residence , private homes , hospitals , and nursing institutions ; and the Pope took personal responsibility for the care of the children of Jews deported from Italy . ”
The consequences of the actions of Venerable Pope Pius XII in defense of the Jews were such that the Chief Rabbi of Rome ( Rabbi Zolli ) during WWII converted to Catholicism and changed his name to Eugenio ( out of reverence for the Pope ) .

Dear EarthTalk :
What ’s better for the local ecology , sewers or septic tanks ?
— T. H. , Darien , Conn .
You probably wo n’t have much choice as to whether that home you ’re thinking of buying is on sewer or septic .
Most likely it ’s a done deal , unless the neighborhood is presently all on septic but is considering a petition to the town to switch to sewers ( in which case you can usually agree to hook up or stay put ) .
There are pros and cons to each in regard to the environment .
Both types of systems are designed to handle and treat so - called “ blackwater ” ( wastewater from toilets ) and “ graywater ” coming from our sinks , showers , dishwashers and laundry machines .
On - site septic and community - wide sewer systems work in similar ways , utilizing micro-organisms to filter out bacteria , viruses and other disease - causing pathogens before releasing the cleansed water back into the environment .
In general , most people prefer to be on a shared sewer system if they have a choice , as the burden of keeping the system running smoothly falls on the local government , which presumably has the money and expertise to ensure that wastewater is properly treated across the region .
Also , in a shared sewer system , wastewater is whisked away to a centralized treatment facility ; anyone who has ever experienced a septic system backup on their property can appreciate what a benefit off - site wastewater treatment can be .
Another advantage to a shared sewer is that such systems are usually built to withstand heavy loads and can better accommodate periods of heavy precipitation or storm surges that might overwhelm smaller , poorly conceived or maintained home - based septic tanks , which are by virtue of their size and the laws of physics more prone to overflow and send contaminants into nearby surface and ground waters .
Septic systems have their proponents , though , who say that a professionally designed , installed and maintained system should hold up in even the biggest of storms .
The University of Minnesota Extension ( UMNE ) , which publishes the useful online “ Septic System Owner ’s Guide , ” says vigilance is key : “ The only way to guarantee effective treatment is to have a trained professional ensure adequate unsaturated and suitable soil exists below the soil treatment area to allow for complete wastewater treatment . ”
When homeowners do n’t take care of their septic systems properly , though , they can become a nuisance for the surrounding ecosystem .
Wastewater that is not properly treated can contaminate surface and groundwater and threaten public health .
According to UMNE , improperly treated sewage can be the culprit behind the spread of hepatitis , dysentery and other diseases resulting from pathogens in drinking water , while also compromising the purity of lakes and streams .
Additionally , flies and mosquitoes that are attracted to and breed in wet areas where sewage reaches the surface can also spread disease .
Improperly treated sewage can also lead to increased nitrates in local water supplies , which is dangerous for infants , pregnant women and those with already compromised immune systems .
In and around lakes and streams , this influx in nitrates can lead to plant growth out of whack with the local ecosystem ’s ability to handle it , resulting in oxygen - free “ dead zones ” devoid of marine and riparian life altogether .

No more paying $ 80 for a 700 c mountain bike studded tire .
No more worrying about falling or slipping on ice or snow .
No more excuses for gaining five pounds .
The game is up .
I have you covered , and it will only cost you anywhere from a Hamilton to a Jackson ( $ 10 – 20 for those who are not from the USA
Tools / Supplies Needed :
For a 700c
Wheel :
24 ft of Braided Cable . 1/16 ″ or 3/32 ″ ( I ’m sure picture frame wire will work too )
Braided Cable Clamps x 4 – two for each wheel
Chain
Zip Ties
Adjustable wrench or Crescent wrench
Needle nose pliers
Cable Cutter – I used an old pair of Bowden cable / housing cutters from my bike tools .
You do have one , right ?
Note :
You will need a bike with disc brakes for this to work .
Step 1 :
Measure your Braided Cable around the edge of where your wheel rim meets the tire .
Clip with an extra 2 ″ - 4 ″ for clamping space .
Once you have this piece measured , cut three more pieces to this length .
Step 2 :
Measure the length of chain needed to have the chain reach both sides of the rim .
Mine were roughly 5.75 ″ with a 700 x 51/53 ( 2.1 ″ ) Tire .
Clip either 32 or 64 sections depending on how spread apart you want the chain .
Step 3
This is the point in which I goofed up .
I was expecting to be able to make these tire chains modular enough for quick installation / removal .
Nope .
Not going to happen … at least not this time .
You can see here that I used twist - ties to temporarily hold the chain pieces in place .
What you really need to do is properly space the chains equidistantly between your spokes and ZIP - TIE them into place .
Pull the zip ties tight enough to hold well , but not tight enough to make indents into the tire .
Note : I deflated my tires to 10 psi before wrapping / zipping the chain .
Step 4 :
Put the wire through the chains on the respective sides of the tire , then pull tight and clamp with the little aluminum clamps .
Note :
This took two people do to for me .
Once you are done with one wheel , complete the other also .
All in all this project cost me $ 10 , and about an hour and a half of time ( even with twist tie fiasco ) .
I was luck and found 20 feet of chain on sale for $ 3.00 or about $ 0.19 a foot instead of $ 0.50 a foot . 😀
Here is a quick video of me trying the snow chains out the night I made them .
Fun Stuff
This is my second video of trying out the snow chains .
You turn and move like you are in loose dirt with no slipping .
It ’s actually pretty equivalent to riding in August .

President Obama in his speech last week rightly focused on fixing the intelligence failures that resulted in Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab being ignored , rather than on technologies targeted at the details of his underwear - bomb plot .
But while Obama 's instincts are right , reforming intelligence for this new century and its new threats is a more difficult task than he might like .
We do n't need new technologies , new laws , new bureaucratic overlords , or - for heaven 's sake - new agencies .
What prevents information sharing among intelligence organizations is the culture of the generation that built those organizations .
The U.S. intelligence system is a sprawling apparatus , spanning the FBI and the State Department , the CIA and the National Security Agency , and the Department of Homeland Security - itself an amalgamation of two dozen different organizations - designed and optimized to fight the Cold War .
The single , enormous adversary then was the Soviet Union : as bureaucratic as they come , with a huge budget , and capable of very sophisticated espionage operations .
We needed to defend against technologically advanced electronic eavesdropping operations , their agents trying to bribe or seduce our agents , and a worldwide intelligence gathering capability that hung on our every word .
In that environment , secrecy was paramount .
Information had to be protected by armed guards and double fences , shared only among those with appropriate security clearances and a legitimate " need to know , " and it was better not to transmit information at all than to transmit it insecurely .
Today 's adversaries are different .
There are still governments , like China , that are after our secrets .
But the secrets they 're after are more often corporate than military , and most of the other organizations of interest are like al Qaeda : decentralized , poorly funded and incapable of the intricate spy versus spy operations the Soviet Union could pull off .
Against these adversaries , sharing is far more important than secrecy .
Our intelligence organizations need to trade techniques and expertise with industry , and they need to share information among the different parts of themselves .
Today 's terrorist plots are loosely organized ad hoc affairs , and those dots that are so important for us to connect beforehand might be on different desks , in different buildings , owned by different organizations .
Critics have pointed to laws that prohibited inter-agency sharing but , as the 9/11 commission found , the law allows for far more sharing than goes on .
It does n't happen because of inter-agency rivalries , a reliance on outdated information systems , and a culture of secrecy .
What we need is an intelligence community that shares ideas and hunches and facts on their versions of Facebook , Twitter and wikis .
We need the bottom - up organization that has made the Internet the greatest collection of human knowledge and ideas ever assembled .
The problem is far more social than technological .
Teaching your mom to " text " and your dad to Twitter does n't make them part of the Internet generation , and giving all those cold warriors blogging lessons wo n't change their mentality - or the culture .
The reason this continues to be a problem , the reason President George W. Bush could n't change things even after the 9/11 commission came to much the same conclusions as President Obama 's recent review did , is generational .
The Internet is the greatest generation gap since rock ' n ' roll , and it 's just as true inside government as out .
We might have to wait for the elders inside these agencies to retire and be replaced by people who grew up with the Internet .
WASHINGTON --
The suicide bomber who killed seven Central Intelligence Agency employees and contractors and a Jordanian intelligence officer was a double agent the CIA had recruited to provide intelligence on senior al Qaeda leadership , according to current and former U.S. officials and an Afghan security official .
The officials said the bomber was a Jordanian doctor likely affiliated and working with al Qaeda .

Obama to Accept Nobel Peace Prize as War President , Address Afghanistan Troop Surge Trip to Norway reignites the debate over Obama 's qualifications for the award .
Dec. 9 , 2009  --
There is a bit of irony in that just 10 days after announcing the deployment of 30,000 more American troops to Afghanistan , President Obama will accept the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize Thursday in Oslo , Norway .
The award , which the Nobel committee said was for Obama 's " extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples , " comes as he presides over wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and faces an American public that is increasingly skeptical about the U.S. - led efforts there .
Obama will walk a delicate line in his acceptance speech , and the White House said he will acknowledge that he accepts the peace prize as a war president .
Aides said he will address Afghanistan and the decision to add troops there and present it in the overall context of the award he is accepting .
Senior administration officials said that Obama will discuss what the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq mean in the context of peace and his role as president and the role of the United States .
The president is likely to note that while the United States will never be able to avoid war entirely , that fact redoubles the U.S. commitment to finding peace wherever it can .
" We 'll address directly the notion , I think , that many have wondered , which is the juxtaposition of the timing for the Nobel Peace Prize and his commitment to add more troops into Afghanistan , " White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said .
" That 's obviously something that he will address . "
The award was seen internationally , and at the White House , as a mixed blessing -- given for the promise of what an Obama presidency could do across the globe and an acknowledgement of what his election represented , but also carrying with it the added pressure to produce tangible results .
Obama is just the third sitting U.S. president to win the prestigious award , and the first to win it in his first year in office .
The previous sitting U.S. presidents who won were Theodore Roosevelt in 1906 and Woodrow Wilson in 1919 .
The peace prize sparked considerable debate over Obama 's qualifications :
Was his resume too thin ?
Was the committee actually rewarding the United States for its election of Obama ?
Was the award more for what Obama represents than what he has accomplished ?
Obama provided a preview of the humble tone he is likely to strike in Oslo when he spoke at the White House the day the award was announced .
" To be honest , I do not feel that I deserve to be in the company of so many of the transformative figures who 've been honored by this prize , " Obama said in brief remarks Oct. 9 . " I do not view it as a recognition of my own accomplishments , but rather as an affirmation of American leadership on behalf of aspirations held by people in all nations . "
The president sees the award as less a recognition of what he has done in office than an affirmation of the desire for American leadership .
The White House views the prize as a boost of momentum for the key issues the president has outlined in his foreign policy agenda , including climate change , nuclear non-proliferation , strengthening international institutions and mechanisms to avoid war , closing the gulf in opportunity in countries where a lack of opportunity can breed conflict , human rights and building bridges of understanding with Muslim world .
Ceremony Reignites Debate Over Obama 's Qualifications for Nobel Prize
The award again opens up the debate over whether Obama deserved the Nobel Prize after less than a year in office .
The deadline for nominations was Feb. 1 , meaning the president was nominated after being in office for just 11 days .
Danielle Pletka , vice president of foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute , said that Obama needs to accept the award with humility , given his thin resume so far in office .
" I think the best thing he can do is to take the prize and accept it in the name of those who the Nobel committee apparently did n't want to consider and who really are deserving , " Pletka said , citing the Iranian people and Rebiya Kadeer , president of the World Uighur Congress as examples of others who she thinks have done more in the last year to advance world peace .
Republican strategist Kevin Madden said the fact that Obama accepts the prize as the commander in chief of a military engaged in two wars is " the elephant in the room .
They 're going to have to acknowledge it . "
" What you 're going to see is the White House project an image that says , ' This is n't about me , and this is about the people who actually have done something .
This is a shared reward , a shared responsibility , ' " Madden said on " ABC News Now 's Top Line . "
" And sort of deflect away from his most recent actions , which was to essentially increase troop movement in Afghanistan . "
The news that Obama was awarded the prize came as a surprise even to the White House back in October .
Press aides said they had heard from news reports that the president had been nominated for the peace prize , but they do not believe Obama himself even knew of his nomination .
The Nobel committee apparently took a forward approach with the prize , citing the " hope " that Obama 's presidency brings to the global community .
" Obama has , as president , created a new climate in international politics , " the citation from the Nobel committee read .
" Only very rarely has a person to the same extent as Obama captured the world 's attention and given its people hope for a better future . "
The director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute said this fall that the decision to award Obama with the peace prize was unanimous .
" President Obama has changed , very dramatically , international politics , " Geir Lundestad told " GMA's " Diane Sawyer Oct.
9 . " We feel he has emphasized multilateral diplomacy , he has addressed international institutions , dialogue negotiations .
He has inspired the world with his vision of a world without nuclear arms .
He has changed the U.S. policy dramatically .
There 's a whole list . "
Michael Worek , author of " Nobel : A Century of Prize Winners , " said Obama 's win was " extraordinarily unprecedented . "
" It 's like giving an Oscar award halfway through the movie when you have n't seen how it ends , " Worek said .
" We 're saying , ' Well , Obama has just started , we do n't know if he 's going to be successful . '
Yes , he 's said good things , but is it going to work ?
" I think in America we feel he 's been given his Oscar too early . "
But Worek said the award was given not for what Obama has done but what the international community expects he will do .
" It 's rewarding hope and they use that word in their release , they use vision twice and hope once , " Worek said of the Nobel committee 's citation .
" It says Obama has captured the world 's attention and given its people hope for a better future . "
" I will applaud President Obama if he one day does something that earns him the Nobel Peace Prize , but he has n't done that yet , and if they want to honor this symbolically , let them honor the people of America that elected Barack Obama , " Pletka said .
Obama Will Donate Prize Money to Charity
Obama will be joined in Oslo by his half - sister , Maya Soetoro - Ng , and his brother - in - law , Conrad Ng , who will attend the Nobel ceremony .
The White House said this week it is likely his other sister , Auma Obama , would meet him there as well .
The award comes with a $ 1.4 million prize , which the Obamas will donate to charity .
Gibbs said that while " a series of charities are being looked at , " no final decision has been made .
The nomination process is kept secret , and it may be 50 years before the world finds out who nominated Obama .
Many U.S. presidents have been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize but never won , among them presidents William Howard Taft , Warren G. Harding , Herbert Hoover , Franklin D. Roosevelt , Harry Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower , and foreign ministers Charles Hughes and John Foster Dulles .
Jimmy Carter won in 2002 , after his presidency .
In Lack of Ceremony and the Marketing Gap , I argued that Perl 's unwillingness to force any particular development style or structure has contributed to the misperception that it 's difficult to write consistent , coherent , and maintainable code ( as if microblogging makes sestinas impossible ) .
I also mentioned whipuptitude as a factor in Perl 's power and perception .
Adam Turoff gave the best definition :
Whipuptitude is the property where , starting from zero with a large library of easily combined tools , you quickly hack a solution to a moderately simple , but annoyingly tedious problem that occurs frequently .
— Adam Turoff , Manipulexity and Whipuptitude
Whipuptitude is a deliberate design decision .
Some people call Perl a distillation of the Unix principle ; read Usenet from the early '90s for long discussions of this concept and implications .
In short , the design goal is to give people the ability to combine small tools in ways unforeseen by the language designers to solve their problems .
Sometimes that means shelling out to grep and find .
Sometimes that means writing Perl one - liners to stick in a long piped shell command .
Sometimes that means writing a language agnostic testing protocol and communicating with software written in a dozen languages to produce a single good report .
Some people call this scripting .
Other people call it glue .
Combine this whipuptitude with the lack of ceremony , and you have the ability to create nice abstractions as well as the ability to throw some spare parts together and hope it holds long enough for you to get your job done .
When you see ugly glue code written in Perl , you see scrappy programming , chicken wire and paper mâché , thrown together in a hurry by someone who did n't take the time and the effort to put things together the " right " way -- as if there were a single right way .
Perl does n't hold your hand and force you into a theoretical axis .
Perl does n't take away features it thinks you 're not ready to use .
Perl 's like English ; you can speak a pidgin if you like , if you think that 'll communicate what you need to communicate effectively .
Yet woe to you if you write the instructions for baking a cake in a pidgin that leaves out important information and you end up with a soggy brick that not even your cat will eat .
It 's all up to you how maintainable and portable and efficient and effective your code needs to be .
( Most programmers are lazy . )
There 's a flip side to this whipuptitude , and that 's how it scales to larger projects .
Perl 's not only good for throwaway ten - line programs that massage data from one text file to another ( though it 's shockingly good at that ; yesterday I debugged a garbage collection tuning problem in Parrot by annotating the GC with simplistic fprintf ( ) statements and massaging the output ) .
Properly applied whipuptitude works at the macro level as well .
You see this at its best when you look at the CPAN .
Consider it not as a collection of additional libraries , but as a set of easily - combined tools intended for quick assembly to help you solve modest but annoying problems .
Moose ?
A better object system than the default .
Try :: Tiny ?
Effective and complete encapsulation of everything you need to know to handle exceptions safely .
WWW :: Mechanize ?
Simple automation of web requests .
Modern :: Perl ?
Scrapping the boilerplate to enable Perl 5's nice new features .
autodie ?
Remove tedious return code checking without reducing the safety of your code .
Perl programers extract tools and make them reusable .
Whipuptitude is n't just for small programs .
It 's how to make great medium and large Perl programs as well .
( There 's a dark side to this , however .
ExtUtils :: MakeMaker is a glue wrapper around the make utility which attempts to enable portable shell programming around operating systems , shells , and make variants .
Sometimes even core Perl gets things wrong . )

The Big Freeze has created the internet 's latest celebrity , but the search for his actual identity outlasted the cold snap .
A young man who was filmed by RTE News slipping in dramatic fashion on ice in Dublin has become an internet phenomenon , with nearly one million people viewing his heavy fall on YouTube since it was posted on January 8 .
RTE was filming ' vox pops ' about the hazardous conditions on Dublin 's Church Street , close to the Four Courts , when a man is seen rounding a corner and slipping on the glassy ice before crashing to the pavement and exclaiming : " Oh s*** " .
A spokeswoman for RTE stated that they checked after the incident if the man was alright and while they did not get the unlucky pedestrian 's details they would be delighted if he got in touch to discuss his new - found fame .
A number of Facebook groups have been established to try and identify the ' Ice Fall Guy ' , with numerous members of the social networking site claiming to be the Internet star .
However the man in question , has been identified as being from being from Navan , Co Meath .
A dedicated Facebook site titled ' We have found the RTE fall guy ' has been set up with a link to his own personal page .
The page runs under the tagline : " He thought he could hide but his status update has given him away . "
The plight of the Big Freeze Faller has gone international with newspapers in the UK , Turkey and the US reporting on it .
On Friday , a Canadian television station requested the footage from RTE .
Perhaps when the man goes public he can recount his treacherous tale -- just like the 6,000 members of the Facebook group entitled ' I fell on my arse in the big freeze of 2009 - 2010 ' .

It ’s been a bloody new year so far in this violence - racked city , leaving authorities stunned and apparently speechless .
Three teenagers in school uniforms were mowed down by automatic - weapons fire Wednesday .
Another youth was shot multiple times last week as he sat in his car outside his parents ’ upscale home .
Four people were decapitated , at least 10 people were killed in drive - by attacks , and five people were kidnapped , including two security guards and a prominent businessman .
Just a few months ago , Tijuana was hailed by some as a success story in Mexico ’s war on drug cartels .
Top officials from the U.S. and Mexico , including President Felipe Calderon , praised the city ’s efforts as a model for the rest of the country .
The city ’s leading crime fighters -- Army Gen. Alfonso Duarte Mugica and Secretary of Public Security Julian Leyzaola -- were named “ men of the year ” by Baja California ’s leading news weekly .
Authorities boasted that they were closing in on the city ’s notorious crime boss , Teodoro Garcia Simental .
Now the bodies are piling up at the morgue again , and authorities appear dispirited by the turn of events .
After the drive - by shooting of the three teenagers -- two boys and a girl -- outside their high school , authorities did n’t even hold a news conference .
“ What are they going to say ?
They have no answers , ” said Vicente Calderon , a veteran journalist who runs the local news website Tijuanapress.com .
Narco - violence has flared regularly since early 2008 , when war broke out between rival factions of the Arellano Felix drug cartel .
That year , the city ’s homicide toll peaked at 844 .
By the middle of 2009 , however , the crime rate had receded as the warring gangs were believed to have reached a truce .
Mugica , the military commander , paraded captured crime bosses through the Morelos military base downtown , and Leyzaola continued his purge of corrupt officers from the police force .
Mayor Jorge Ramos ’ “ state of the city ” speech in November emphasized Tijuana ’s progress against organized crime and the presentation included video of favorable comments from U.S. Ambassador Carlos Pascual and San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders .
Since December , however , the violence has surged .
The rival gangs appear to have broken their truce and are , at times , employing different and deadlier tactics .
Attackers have firebombed police cars and a funeral home with Molotov cocktails .
They ’ve shot up a hospital .
Women are increasingly targeted .
At least two of the recent beheading victims were women , one of whom was left naked outside a cemetery , a narco - message left between her legs .
Although most of the victims remain young men -- typically foot soldiers or drug dealers -- gunmen seem more willing , perhaps deliberately , to kill anyone associated with their targets .
“ These acts of violence appear more and more like narco - terrorism , ” said Victor Clark , the director of the Binational Center for Human Rights in Tijuana .
In late December , the government seemed to score a major victory .
Gilbert Sanchez Guerrero , a former police officer and top lieutenant for crime boss Garcia , was arrested in an early morning raid at his upscale condominium in Ensenada .
His apprehension led to the arrests of at least seven more Tijuana police officers suspected of corruption .
But , as in so many cases in Mexico ’s battle with organized crime , the blow was followed by another round of bloodshed , including an attack on New Year ’s Eve , when gunmen broke into a home and killed an elderly couple and two other people .
Last week , 17 - year - old Jose Fernando Labastida Fimbres , the grandson of a supermarket magnate , was shot as he sat in his Audi outside his home in a hillside neighborhood .
A student at Mater Dei Catholic High School in Chula Vista , a San Diego suburb , the youth was memorialized by hundreds at a local church .
Two days later , gunmen wielding AK - 47 s shot dead the three teenagers , who had just finished final exams at Ricardo Flores High School .
Scores of students witnessed the gunmen ’s car creep up on the teenagers ’ vehicle and open fire , sending their Jeep Cherokee into an electrical pole as nearby students scrambled for safety .
Though media reports , citing anonymous sources , say Labastida Fimbres and one of the other teens may have had links to organized crime , authorities have made no statements on the motives .
Officials at Ricardo Flores High School , located in a tough east Tijuana neighborhood , do random drug tests and searches of students ’ backpacks , but teenagers said those precautions are n’t enough anymore .
As students lingered outside school last week , many said they choose their friends with great care now and do n’t get into a car unless they know the person driving it .
“ We ’re scared it could happen again , ” said Myra Zamudio Guzman , a 17 - year - old who saw the shooting .
Through all the recent violence , law enforcement officials have been mostly silent .
To some observers , their reticence betrays a sense of impotence .
It ’s as if authorities have exhausted their tough rhetoric , they say .
One of the few government officials who made a public appearance last week was Baja California ’s secretary of tourism .
Oscar Escobedo Carignan announced a public relations initiative to improve the city ’s image .
The negative portrayals are unfair , he said , blaming the media and citing per-capita crime figures that he said supported his case :
“ We [ Tijuana ] finish with 20 homicides per 100,000 people .
Brazil gets 150 homicides , and they get the Olympics . ”

Caching is one of the first things you can do when you need to start thinking about scaling .
Among efforts such as query minimization , denormalization , code optimizations , compression , database tuning , indexing , and load balancing , caching remains one of the lowest hanging fruits in methods to lighten your server load and handle huge amounts of traffic .
There are many options , and I chose to evaluate a few of the most interesting setups .
This is not intended to be a rigoriously scientific test , but more of a first impression of the different caching systems .
For all the tests I 'm describing , I 'm using a single VPS on Rackspace Cloud with 320 MB of RAM , a quad - core AMD Opteron 2350HE , and a bleeding edge server stack using Ubuntu Server 9.10 , NGINX with UWSGI , Python 2.6 , Django 1.1 , and PostgreSQL 8.4 .
I 'm serving the home page view of Django - Mingus , which provides a realistic amount of complexity to the Python side of things and gives us a 9387 byte response .
I 'm using 4 UWSGI processes and a single NGINX worker .
All my tests are using ApacheBench , which I 'm running on the same machine .
Note that for all my cache tests I 'm prepopulating the cache before running the benchmark .
Here are the different setups I 'm going to evaluate :
No caching whatsover .
Django's template caching templatetag .
Django's two - part caching middleware .
NGINX Memcached module .
On - disk caching with Django - staticgenerator .
Varnish as front - end load - balancing cache .
No Caching
For any content - driven website , this is probably the worst idea of them all , and as you 'll find out , it is trivial to implement most of the above caching strategies .
Clearly , my single server arrangement is not going to be representative of your large app server cluster , so I urge you to evaluate all the options if you are anticipating scaling .
Finding the right recipe for your server setup is going to be the fun part .
For the purpose of establishing a baseline , I ran ApacheBench on my setup with no caching turned on .
I 'm running 10 concurrent requests for a 1000 requests using the following ApacheBench command :
ab -n 1000 -c 10 < server - name >
Here 's a snipped version of the results :
Concurrency Level : 10
Time taken for tests : 68.619 seconds
Sent requests : 1000 Completed requests : 1000 Failed requests : 0 Total transferred : 9660000 bytes HTML transferred : 9387000 bytes Requests per second : 14.5732231597662 Transfer rate : 141.610400362873 kb/s received Connnection Times ( ms ) min avg max Connect : 0 0.12 10 Response : 309 681.65 1330
It 's probably possible to tune this for shorter latency , but we got the main number we were looking for ; we can push 14.57 requests / second without a cache .
Not bad , until you get Slashdotted !
Django's template caching templatetag
Django provides an easy way to cache parts of your template using the " cache " template tag .
Here is an example of usage :
{ % load cache %} { % cache 500 sidebar %} This goes into cache .
{ % endcache %}
Django - Mingus makes good use of the cache template tag in the default templates .
In this test , I enabled Memcache in Django and removed view caching so I could get an idea how segment caching affects performance .
This page benefits from 10 template cache hits and 4 other Memcache hits used in some of Mingus 's apps .
Concurrency Level : 10
Time taken for tests : 26.19 seconds
Sent requests : 1000 Completed requests : 1000 Failed requests : 0 Total transferred : 9479000 bytes HTML transferred : 9387000 bytes Requests per second : 38.1825124093165 Transfer rate : 353.449253054601 kb/s received Connnection Times ( ms ) min avg max Connect : 0 0.29 10 Response : 90 260.61 490
Enabling templatetag caching has given a significant speed boost to 38.18 requests / second .
This is a 262 % improvement over no cache .
Response time is also improved , down from 682 ms to an acceptable 260 ms .
Good , but there 's still a lot of room for improvement .
The subtle increase in performance should n't deter you from implementing the tag though , as template caching bears the benefit that one segment can be cached and used across multiple pages ( for example , a sidebar that is the same on different parts of the site ) .
Django's two - part caching middleware
Django comes equiped with middleware that provides frontend proxy - style full page caching with almost no configuration .
Full page caching is clearly where you 're going to find the greatest benefits .
Something like Squid , Varnish , or NGINX is better suited for this job , but the ease of setup makes this middleware useful for environments where a minimal amount of complexity is desired .
Because of the greater performance , I 'm running 10,000 requests instead of 1,000 to get a better sample .
Concurrency Level : 10
Time taken for tests : 9.07 seconds
Sent requests : 10000 Completed requests : 10000 Failed requests : 0 Total transferred : 130040000 bytes HTML transferred : 127560000 bytes Requests per second : 1102.53583241455 Transfer rate : 14001.3437155458 kb/s received Connnection Times ( ms ) min avg max Connect : 0 0.15 10 Response : 0 9.02 470
This is about as fast as Django 's going to run on this hardware without a more sophisticated caching proxy .
We 've revved Django 's internal caching to give us 1103 requests / second , over 75 times as many as we had with no caching .
However , we 're still passing every request into Python , which gives us limits we cannot avoid without moving the caching layer into the frontend server .
For this we 'll need to explore NGINX or Varnish .
NGINX 's Memcached module
NGINX has a very nice caching feature that most servers lack : it can serve an HTML document directly from Memcached without ever touching your Python code .
Since we are already using NGINX , enabling the Memcached HTTP caching module was a trivial task .
For this test , I will disable Django 's caching middleware and add a custom cache update middleware that sets a cache key that NGINX can be configured to read .
I used a modified version of the middleware from Oliver Weichold 's blog post on using Django with NGINX + Memcached .
Enabling the module in NGINX config was just adding a new location directive for Memcached and assigning the web app as a 404 handler for that location :
Before :
location / { uwsgi_pass unix:///tmp/mingus.sock ; include uwsgi_params ; }
After :
location / { default_type text / html ; set $ memcached_key nginx.$request_uri ; memcached_pass 127.0.0.1:11211 ; error_page 404 = @cache_miss ; } location @cache_miss { uwsgi_pass unix:///tmp/mingus.sock ; include uwsgi_params ; }
Running the same benchmark as above , here are my results :
Concurrency Level : 10
Time taken for tests : 3.699 seconds
Sent requests : 10000 Completed requests : 10000 Failed requests : 0 Total transferred : 130640000 bytes HTML transferred : 129190000 bytes Requests per second : 2703.43336036767 Transfer rate : 34489.8959178156 kb/s received Connnection Times ( ms ) min avg max Connect : 0 0.36 30 Response : 0 3.66 109
Now we 're getting serious !
I was serving 2703 requests / second through memcache on my VPS .
Now we 're in Slashdotting territory .
This is over 185 times as fast as vanilla Django .
The important thing to note here is that we 're accomplishing the same thing as Django 's built - in two - part caching middleware , but now we are doing it 2.5 times faster .
On - disk caching with django- staticgenerator
Another approach is to use on - disk caching techniques to serve static files .
This is made possible with django - staticgenerator , which has middleware that generates flat files that NGINX can serve directly .
It was simple to set up , and here are my results :
Concurrency Level : 10
Time taken for tests : 2.78 seconds
Sent requests : 10000 Completed requests : 10000 Failed requests : 0 Total transferred : 131320000 bytes HTML transferred : 129190000 bytes Requests per second : 3597.12230215827 Transfer rate : 46130.2832733813 kb/s received Connnection Times ( ms ) min avg max Connect : 0 0.67 90 Response : 0 2.66 190
Now we 're rocking 3597 requests / second .
NGINX can serve static files like nobody 's business .
Varnish
Varnish is a very powerful load balancing caching proxy that is made for heavy traffic .
I 'm configuring it as an HTTP proxy to my NGINX server to see how it stacks up .

Varnish is very competitive in raw speed , serving 3623 requests / second , an impressive number , nearly 250 times higher than if there was no cache .
Varnish is also very configurable and built for extremely high traffic .
Conclusion
Every scaling problem has it's own variables that can greatly affect the types of decisions that need to be made to implement a good caching stategy .
For example , a multi - server setup is likely to behave much different given the same benchmarks .
There are also more complicated factors such as how to treat logged - in users and cookies .
There are workarounds for cookie hashing problems ( such as removing the " Vary : Cookie " response header ) that can add complexity to certain environments , so there is more to consider than raw performance .
Also make note that not all of these are mutually exclusive .
A good combination of caching might be internal template caching plus either Varnish or NGINX acting as a frontend cache .
My best suggestion is to experiment and see what works best for your environment , and I hope this post was helpful for summarizing your options .
Yesterday , Steve Jobs worked his charm , attempting to wow the world with the Apple iPad , a new , super - slim computer he touted as the missing link between iPhones and laptops .
It 's an undeniably beautiful device , but it also represents some serious problems .

Note :
This subjective post gets rather long winded , so if you do n't have time for every hem and haw , skip straight to the meat of the problem .
The Good
At first glance , the iPad does a lot of things really well — particularly compared to its competition .
This depends on what you consider its competition , but for sheer size and price alone , let 's say its primary competition is the Kindle , followed by netbooks .
Last , and maybe more importantly , consider that maybe it does n't have any competition because it 's aiming for a mostly new market , much like the iPhone completely goosed the primarily business - friendly , BlackBerry - dominated smartphone market .
No matter what you consider its competition , it 's likely that the iPad outpaces said competition handily .

The Kindle : To start , if we compare the iPad to a Kindle , it 's really only lacking in one or two arenas from the standpoint of most consumers :
It 's not using e-ink , so it 's potentially not as friendly on the eyes ( okay , it 's definitely not as eye - friendly ) , and the battery life is only 10 hours ( with video , mind you , which was the only benchmark Apple gave ) , which is seriously short by e-book reader standards .
Now consider this :
It 's roughly the same size as the Kindle , can do infinitely more ( even running a complete end - around the Kindle by running Kindle software ) , and it 's beautiful .
Like in life , that last bit — the looks — matter more than we may like to admit .
And why should n't it matter ?
Apart from , you know , the usefulness factor , eye candy has always played an important role in technology adoption .

Netbooks :
Full disclosure : I 've never owned a netbook .
And maybe that 's part of the problem .
For all the useful , inexpensive netbooks out there , the netbook market has yet to take hold in a truly meaningful way outside of the enthusiast niche .
I 'm not relying on any real numbers here — more on experience at airports , coffee shops , and public places where people with computers go .
Those are the places netbooks were made for , right ?
And yet all I see at those places are laptops and iPhones .
Update :
As many commenters have pointed out , the netbook market has been very successful , and my personal experience is n't a good substitute for the numbers .
Either way , do n't get too hung up on this point — whether or not netbooks are popular is really not the problem .
Advertisement
For most people , netbooks have very limited sex appeal .
There 's no question they do what they 're supposed to do , or that they do it well , but last I checked , the netbook has n't really filled that " When you just need a lightweight computer to do some lightweight surfing , word processing , etc. " need .
The iPad is aiming straight at this market , and could potentially succeed where netbooks have n't .
Lack of competition :
Most disconcerting to this technology lover — which I 'll discuss in more detail below — is that the iPad really has no little direct competition out yet .
( Several tablets showed up at CES , but I have n't seen any release date for promising slates .
We 'll see how those turn out , but at the end of the day , this is still a market like the smartphone market was before the iPhone came along .
It was n't the first smartphone , but it had the best hardware and usability . )
In fact , at the end of the day it 's much more like an iPhone or iPod touch than it is anything else .
It 's just got better guts and a bigger screen .
It seems most accurate to consider the iPad a computer that runs the iPhone OS .

The Problem
So why is it a problem if the iPad is better than its competition , or , more importantly , fills a niche that has n't been addressed well enough to this point ?
Yesterday Gizmodo rounded up 8 things that suck about the iPad , focusing primarily on hardware issues like its lack of camera , an ugly bezel , and lack of even a single USB port ( sans adapters ) ; we could likewise complain about how the iPad 's graphical design seems like a complete afterthought .
But much more important , at least from the perspective of a blog that 's pretty serious about the free use and control of computers :
Advertisement
The iPad , much like the iPhone , is completely locked down .
The user has no control over what she installs on the hardware , short of accepting exactly what Apple has approved for it .
From past experience , we know what happens when a completely legitimate application — from a huge company that 's actually partnered with Apple — does n't gel with Apple 's business plan .
They reject it , and you can't use it .
And what recourse does the power user have ?
Advertisement
Jailbreaking !
And certainly the iPad will see plenty of hacking , but only because Apple requires you to hack the device if you actually want control over it yourself .
Apple 's gotten into the habit of acting like you 're renting hardware .
They 've become the all - powerful , over - restrictive , ambivalent IT person in the sky , restricting what users can and can't install on their hardware .
With a device like the iPhone , most people slowly accepted Apple 's IT state over time .
Apple 's stance is basically that their lockdown is for your own good — they 're protecting us from unstable apps , pornography , confusion , and other nasties .
And for the most part , it worked , right ?
iPhones have remained fast , capable , strong - like - bull , and extremely popular .
But conceding that Apple 's restrictive policies are to credit is sort of like claiming you 've cured cancer because you knocked on wood every morning of your life and , as a result , never got cancer .
( Sorry for the weak simile . )
Advertisement
What 's dangerous about the iPad is that it 's much closer to a " real " computer than the iPhone is .
If you dock it with the keyboard accessory , it really is just a sort of low - powered franken - laptop .
And yet this is a computer over which you have absolutely no control .
And the question is :
If we all continue to buy Apple 's locked - down products hand - over - fist ( Jobs went so far as to talk about Apple as a mobile device company yesterday ) , what reason does Apple have not to keep moving forward with that model — a model that , to many , is defective by design .
Apple 's saying to consumers : " Trade in choice for a guarantee that this will work exactly as we designed it to , and you 'll never be upset with a computer again . "
Unfortunately there 's no reason to believe the trade is necessary .
At the very best , it seems like Apple 's extreme and obsessive control over what you 're allowed to run on the iPad , iPhone , and iPod touch is maybe delaying the point at which your software demands outpace the hardware , but even that is debatable .
With the iPad , iPhone , and iPod touch , you 're trading choice and control in exchange for unsubstantiated promises .
The Free Software Foundation put it another way :
DRM is used by Apple to restrict users ' freedom in a variety of ways , including blocking installation of software that comes from anywhere except the official Application Store , and regulating every use of movies downloaded from iTunes .
Apple furthermore claims that circumventing these restrictions is a criminal offense , even for purposes that are permitted by copyright law .
If Jobs and Apple are actually committed to creativity , freedom , and individuality , they should prove it by eliminating the restrictions that make creativity and freedom illegal .
Attention needs to be paid to the computing infrastructure our society is becoming dependent upon .
This past year , we have seen how human rights and democracy protesters can have the technology they use turned against them by the corporations who supply the products and services they rely on .
Your computer should be yours to control .
By imposing such restrictions on users , Steve Jobs is building a legacy that endangers our freedom for his profits .

A Simple Solution ?
The App Store is n't exactly the problem — it 's the way Apple runs and limits the App Store .
Let 's say , for example , that Apple added one simple section to the App Store .
I 'll leave it to the Apple Geniuses to come up with a more marketable name , but for our purposes , let 's call it the Restricted section .
Advertisement
Now let 's say that Apple continues to run the App Store the way it always has , but rather than reject applications that it feels may confuse the user ( like they claimed Google Voice * or Google Latitude might ) , or applications that allow users to access naughty pictures , or even applications that it has n't had time to vet for the App Store proper , they put those applications in the Restricted section .
Before a user is able to install applications from the Restricted section , that user has to agree that the application may confuse their feeble minds , offend their delicate sensibilities , or even slow down their device .
Is this such a problem ?
(* Incidentally , even if we accept Apple 's reasons for rejecting the Google Voice application on the iPhone , what reason is there to likewise reject it for the iPod touch and , presumably , the iPad ?
Neither have phone functionality out of the box , and now the non-phone devices actually outnumber the iPhone . )
Advertisement
Even better , it could work like the package manager it actually is and allow users to add their own trusted repositories as sources for other applications .
Same disclaimers apply , but Apple is even further removed from culpability — they 're not even hosting the apps .
The point is , users should at least be allowed to flip some switch , somewhere on the machine , that says , " Hey computer , I 'm an adult , and I take responsibility over how I use this machine . "
Advertisement
So You 're Saying I Have to Make a Statement with My Computer Purchases Now ?
I 'm not here to get all political ( though Apple does n't give a shit about poor people ) , but the point is this :
As power users , do we really want to send the message to Apple and other hardware manufacturers that we 're cool with them taking away our choice ?
The iPad looks great , and by every account it also feels great and performs like a peach , but it 's rife with problems .
Unlike the iPhone , where it was easy enough to convince ourselves that these problems were imposed for good reason , the iPad is basically a keyboard - less netbook that will exert complete control over what you 're allowed to use on it .
Advertisement
A very quick response to the many , many people who feel I 'm missing the point because the iPad is n't for me , but for the non -tech savvy users :
There 's no reason it can't be both .
OS X ships with Terminal , even though most Mac users will never use the command line .
To say that " either a device is user friendly or it's open " is a false dichotomy .
It 's also worth mentioning again , as I did above , that Apple 's proven itself to be an unreliable , user - hostile gatekeeper .
Caveat Emptor !
Sending messages aside , my main aim is to discourage readers from buying an iPad .
Or if not to discourage , to ensure that people understand the system they 're buying into , if and when they do purchase one .
The fact remains that the iPad is probably better than any device of its kind out there , so it 's very tempting if you want a big , pretty tablet that can do a lot of neat computer things .
But it also comes with some serious problems .

We all love urban legends , we all love to hear them , and we all love to spread them .
From dead animals , dead people , and the living dead , to animals in fast food , humans have an odd desire to be horrified by these tales .
This is a list of 10 of the most famous urban legends that are still doing the rounds but are completely false .
10 Walt Disney ’s Body is Cryogenically Frozen
The rumour tells us that Disney , who was well known for being a technical innovator , had his body put into a vat of liquid nitrogen upon his death so that he could be re-animated ( har har ) when scientists discovered the means .
Some versions of the tale even tell us that Walt ’s cryo-vat is hidden under the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction in Disneyland !
Sorry to tell you , this is entirely false .
On December 15 , 1966 , Walt Disney died of complications from the treatment he was receiving for lung cancer .
Following Disney ’s wishes , his family had him cremated ( they have since confirmed this fact ) and his ashes were interred at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale , which you can visit to this day .
Do n’t stop here !

9 Santa Claus was invented by Coca-cola
Advertisement
In the 1930 ’s , Coca - cola was looking for ways to spread their burgeoning empire during the winter months – traditionally slow for soft drink sales .
They hire Haddon Sundblom , a highly regarded commercial illustrator who proceeded to create a series of images of Santa Claus that associated him with coke .
His drawings became a regular annual sight for the coca - cola corporation which helped to spur on the idea that they had conceived the image .
In fact , the red- suited jolly man was already a well established depiction of Santa Claus by the 1920s .
The New York Times reported this in 1927 : “ A standardized Santa Claus appears to New York children .
Height , weight , stature are almost exactly standardized , as are the red garments , the hood and the white whiskers .
The pack full of toys , ruddy cheeks and nose , bushy eyebrows and a jolly , paunchy effect are also inevitable parts of the requisite make - up . ”
8 McDonald ’s Shakes are made from reconstituted animal fat
This rumour has been very popular on the internet and I even remember it from my own childhood .
The belief was that the liquid poured into the milkshake machine ( and the icecream machine ) was reconstituted fat – either from pigs or chickens .
I even witnessed the filling of one of the machines when I was a teenager and the colour and consistency did seem to give weight to the legend .
However , these days fast food restaurants like McDonald ’s are required by law to make the full nutritional information of their products available to consumers .
This is the complete list of ingredients in a McDonald ’s shake :
Whole milk , sucrose , cream , nonfat milk solids , corn syrup solids , mono and diglycerides , guar gum , vanilla flavour , carrageenan , cellulose gum , vitamin A palmitate .
Admittedly some of these things sound a little weird , but they are all perfectly safe for human consumption and are not animal by - products .
Incidentally , carrageenan is a type of seaweed ( also called Irish Moss ) – it is used to control freezing agents in the shakes – if it were excluded the milkshake would be a solid block .
7 Snuff films
I am almost certain that this one will cause a stir in the comments !
The idea is that films are made ( either because very wealthy people will pay for them , or sick people will make their own ) in which a person is murdered in the course of filming .
This legend probably piggy - backs on other rumours of cannibalism , necrophagia ( if you do n’t know what this means , do n’t look it up – you will regret it ) , and necrophilia .
In recent years it has been helped along by films such as 8 mm ( starring Nicholas Cage ) which treats the subject as if it were fact .
But actually , the fact is , there has not once been a snuff film that has been found .
Every time there is a report in the press about one , upon investigation it turns out to be false .
There is even a one million dollar reward for anyone that can come up with a commercially sold snuff film .
The reward has been on offer for many years now with no one ever stepping forward to claim it .
6 The most Holy religion of Jedi
Some years ago a strange rumour started to pass around the internet – the claim was that if enough people wrote “ Jedi ” as their religion on a census form , the government would be compelled to include it as an official religion on the next census .
This first started with an English census in 2001 , followed by an Australian one , and a New Zealand one in the same year .
Not only is it entirely false ( as census departments have nothing to do with the wing of Government that could make this happen ) , but in Australia , and New Zealand , you can be fined $ 1000 for falsifying your census results .
Not only do you risk a fine , but the census information is used to determine allocation of tax funds , so by lying people are doing other members of society a disservice .
5 Kentucky Fried Chicken name change
I should first state that I actually believed this urban legend !
The legend is that Kentucky Fried Chicken changed its name to KFC because they feared that the word “ Fried ” had negative connotations that were not good for marketing .
( There was another ludicrious legend that surely no one would believe , it claimed that KFC were breeding super chickens to get more meat from them and by law they could not refer to them as Chickens because they were a new race of animal . )
As it turns out , Kentucky Fried Chicken were not concerned about bad publicity at all – in fact , the company has not given a specific reason for the name change .
You may be interested to know that the company is now once again beginning to use the original name of Kentucky Fried Chicken .
4 Lemmings occasionally throw themselves from cliffs
This urban legend has quite an awful beginning ; in the 1958 Disney documentary White Wilderness , a camera crew forced a group of lemmings off a cliff to document their supposed suicidal behaviour .
The film was made in Canada and lemmings were brought in for the film after they were purchased from Eskimo children .
The lemmings were filmed in a variety of artificial situations and then herded to a cliff where they were pushed to the edge to simulate a migration .
It is unknown whether Disney was aware of the behaviour of the film crew , but the fact remains , lemmings do not throw themselves from cliffs .
3 The Daddy Longlegs
For quite some time there has been a rumour spreading that the daddy longlegs spider is the most venomous spider but is unable to kill humans simply because its fangs are not strong enough to pierce our skin .
In fact , there is a small twist here – it is not possible for us to test the toxicity of the spider because of international codes of ethics and amnesty international ( for some bizarre reason ) .
In reality , the most venomous spiders are the Brown Recluse and the Funnel Web Spider .
2 Who invented the toilet ?
Contrary to popular belief , it was not Thomas Crapper .
Crapper is known to most as an ingenious Victorian plumber who came up with the idea of a flushing lavatory .
The majority of this deceit comes from a book written in 1969 by Wallace Reyburn : Flushed with Pride : the Story of Thomas Crapper .
This author also , interestingly , wrote The Uplifting Tale of Otto Titzling and the Development of the Bra .
Crapper was in fact a plumber , and he did take out a number of plumbing related patents in his time , but none was for the flush toilet .
In reality , Alexander Cummings is generally credited as being the inventor of this illustrious gadget , in 1775 ( 50 years before Crapper was born ) .
Joseph Bramah and Thomas Twyford improved upon Cummings ’ design by adding the ball - cock .
Finally , the use of the term crapper for a lavatory is of unknown origin but is believed to have started out in America .
1 Made in USA , Japan
I am sure you have all heard this one : apparently the Japanese renamed a town in Japan to Usa so they could legally exports goods to the US and conceal their original place of origin .
This legend was spurred on by the fact that in post - war American , Made in Japan became synonymous with cheap poorly made goods .
It is , of course , ludicrous to think that American customs officially would simply shrug off the import of products that are clearly labelled to mislead .
An interesting addition to this tale is that Sony Corporation intentionally made their “ Made in Japan ” labels small so that American people would not realise that it was a Japanese company .
A large number of Sony shipments were turned away by Customs officials because the labels were smaller than regulations required them to be .
All sorts of things might change the public mood before polling day , but if nothing does , a Guardian / ICM poll gives a good snapshot of the likely result .
Like most other polls from different companies this year , it puts the Tory lead at about 10 points , the party 's share at about 40 % and Labour 's share at about 30 % – the precise scores are 40 % to 29 % , an increased lead of 11 points .
Meanwhile the Liberal Democrats are creeping into contention for an influential third place , at 21 % .
Another way of summing things up is to look at the answers to the Guardian 's regular " time for a change " question .
In the poll 66 % think this is a moment for a change of government , against 25 % who say continuity matters more and who want to stick with Labour .
These are not far off the figures from March last year .
Then 69 % wanted change and 25 % more of the same .
Back in September 2006 , when discontent with Tony Blair was at its height , 70 % of people wanted change .
Immediately after Gordon Brown took over that dropped to 55 % .
But now the public mood seems made up .
There may be nothing the governing party can do to shift it .
Even among people who backed Labour in 2005 , 38 % think it is time for a change .
Labour 's hope must lie partly in the economy , with figures tomorrow expected to show that Britain has finally left recession .
But even here the polls have bad news for the party .
Asked whether on balance Brown 's leadership has helped Britain through recession or made things worse , 50 % say worse – including 28 % who say he made things a lot worse .
Against that , 43 % think he has helped the situation , but only 6 % say he made things a lot better , and 37 % a little better .
If the prime minister is looking for gratitude , he is not going to get it .
Unsurprisingly , Labour voters remain loyal to the former chancellor : 72 % think he helped to limit recession .
But Lib Dems are unconvinced , and Tory supporters strongly hostile .
If recovery strengthens , Labour may not get the credit .
Of people who say they voted Labour in 2005 , 32 % think Brown made the recession worse .
If figures such as these do not change dramatically over the next few months , Labour 's main ambition will be to deny the Conservatives a parliamentary majority .
This is certainly possible .
Last week , at a conference in London , leading pollsters expressed confidence in their methodologies for calculating shares of party support , but there is less certainty about the best way to estimate the number of seats each party will win .
One reason is that this contest will go in at least three directions , with Lib Dem support holding up and the party fighting both Labour ( mostly in the north ) and the Conservatives ( in the south and west ) .
About one in 10 2005 Labour supporters now back the Conservatives , as do about one in five 2005 Lib Dems .
Meanwhile One in 10 current Lib Dems has switched from Labour .
Smaller parties however may prove less influential than looked likely during the European elections last year .
Put together , other parties are down to 10 % , against 15 % last June .
Nationalist parties in Wales and Scotland account for 4 % , the Greens 2 % , Ukip 2 % and the BNP 1 % .
David Kelly 's body was found near his Oxfordshire home in 2003 Details of the post - mortem examination of government weapons inspector David Kelly should be seen by doctors seeking an inquest , Lord Hutton has said .
The peer confirmed he had requested a 70 - year gagging order on the material at the conclusion of his inquiry into Dr Kelly 's 2003 death .
But he said on Tuesday the purpose of the secrecy order had been to avoid causing distress to Dr Kelly 's family .
He has written to ministers saying the report may be seen by the doctors .
Dr Kelly 's body was found in woods close to his Oxfordshire home in 2003 , shortly after it was revealed that he was the source of a BBC report casting doubt on the government 's claim that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction capable of being fired within 45 minutes .
Challenge
An inquest was suspended by then Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer , who ruled that Lord Hutton 's inquiry could take its place .
Lord Hutton 's report in 2004 concluded that Dr Kelly had killed himself by cutting an artery in his wrist .
But the finding has been challenged by doctors who claim that the weapons inspector 's stated injuries were not serious enough .
It 's astonishing and unheard - of for material of this nature to be hidden away for any length of time , let alone 70 years
Norman Baker , Lib Dem MP
One of them , former assistant coroner Michael Powers , raised concerns over the secrecy order after seeing a letter from the legal team of Oxfordshire County Council explaining the unusual restrictions placed by Lord Hutton on material relating to his inquiry .
The letter stated : " Lord Hutton made a request for the records provided to the inquiry , not produced in evidence , to be closed for 30 years , and that medical ( including post - mortem ) reports and photographs be closed for 70 years . "
On Tuesday , Lord Hutton released a statement explaining his decision and revealing that he had written to the Ministry of Justice .
In it , he said : " At the conclusion of my inquiry into the death of Dr David Kelly , I requested that the post - mortem report relating to his death should not be disclosed for 70 years as I was concerned that the publication of that report in newspapers , books and magazines would cause his daughters and his wife further and unnecessary distress .
" Much of the material in the post - mortem report had been given in oral evidence in public at the inquiry and substantial parts of that evidence had been set out in my report .
" However , I consider that the disclosure of the report to doctors and their legal advisers for the purposes of legal proceedings would not undermine the protection which I wished to give to Dr Kelly 's family , provided that conditions were imposed restricting the use and publication of the report to such proceedings , and I have written to the Ministry of Justice to this effect . "
Liberal Democrat MP
Norman Baker , who has conducted his own inquiries into Dr Kelly 's death , said : " It 's astonishing and unheard - of for material of this nature to be hidden away for any length of time , let alone 70 years .
" Coroners ' inquests are held in public .
Lord Hutton 's inquiry was unique in its format and unique in requesting restrictions of this nature .
" His statement today undermines the validity of his own inquiry and gives further justification to the case being made by many for a proper inquest to be held into this most public of deaths . "

Dear Richard , I ’ll try to keep it short .
My 10 - year old daughter has started complaining about her being picked on in school because she does not subscribe to the majority religious views .
I cannot blame the school for this , since it ’s coming from her peers , not staff .
I could only advise her to go away from the topic once it arises and avoid making any comments when other kids talk about their personal communications with god .
She , however , is not mature enough to restrain herself from that .
She sees the solution to the problem is us ( our family ) becoming Christians .
I think she does n’t mean actually believe , but only social concepts – going to church , participating in religious groups meetings , praying before eating and so on .
I find it hypocritical and a waste of our time .
She , however , thinks this would solve the problem of her fitting in and getting along and making friends .
Maybe I ’m wrong and in reality she is willing to subscribe to religious views , but this is not how it seems at this point .
We live in the south and atheists are largely underrepresented here , and while I can understand her wish to fit in , I can not see how this can be done without her ridiculous proposal .
We ’ve always told her that she is free to choose her beliefs and it ’s also ok to be atheist , but obviously , that ’s not what she sees , so her conclusion is that parents are wrong .
I am willing to start looking for some youth atheist organization around here , but I do n’t think there are any at this time .
This may become less of a problem when our two younger kids approach this age , but I ’m really lost now with the oldest one .
We want her to be happy and find friends she could feel comfortable with , but we also want her to be honest with herself and free to feel and think what she wants .
Any suggestions for us ?
Regards ,
Belinda
Dear Belinda ,
This problem is much more complicated than it might first appear on the surface , because a ten year - old is at a stage where some things need to be left for her to resolve on her own , while other things need parental intervention .
It depends on the severity of the challenges that she ’s facing .
There are many variables , many “ ifs ” that are not clear in the letter that would effect the best response , and each response in turn has its own ifs .
But none of the best responses will include your pretending to be Christians .
First , there is the severity of the “ picking on ” that you mentioned :
If this ranges from a subtle , indignant cold shoulder up to a terse remark alluding that your daughter is not as good as or does not belong with the other kids , then I ’d suggest that you continue what you ’ve been trying , coaching your daughter to avoid the topic and to be discrete in her remarks , as well as simply looking for more open - hearted friends .
If the picking on is up to the nyah nyah nyah level of taunting and humiliation in front of bystanders , this can be very painful to the child , and then you might need to politely approach the parents of the little Christian tormenters , asking them to instruct their kids that this is not what Jesus would want .
This intervention immediately opens up a host of possible complications because of the ifs around how tolerant or bigoted are the parents .
Not all Christian parents , even in the South , would approve or defend their kids behaving unkindly in such a manner , but sadly , enough parents do to give this option its risks .
There is also your own sense of confidence or risk about calling attention to your position on religion , and what social consequences , if any , you might be inviting .
If the picking on has reached the level of severe verbal abuse , threats , intimidation or physical acts , then the school administration and their resources would need to be involved .
Again , the unknown variables complicate things , including the possibility of all the social consequences mentioned above , as well as teachers reacting negatively , and perhaps the most likely , an apathetic shrugging of the principal ’s shoulders .
Secondly , there is the severity of your daughter ’s remarks when her schoolmates talk about God , prayer or religion :
Is she only answering honestly when asked a direct question by her companions , or is she taking the initiative to contradict or challenge them ?
I ’m not convinced that , as you say , she is not mature enough to restrain herself from making comments when other kids talk about their personal communications with God .
I think an average ten year - old is very capable of learning when to keep her mouth shut .
If she makes argumentative or antagonistic remarks , she ’s going to have a conflict and lose friends , and she ’s already witnessed that .
Make it clear to her that how well she gets along with her friends is her responsibility , and it is not your responsibility to fix it unless the problem is getting severe , as described above .
Everyone has to find their own balance between speaking their mind and holding their tongue .
There is no fixed , constant , inflexible position on that balance .
A person ’s age , resources , and the consequences inherent in each situation are just some of the factors that will tilt the balance one way or the other .
Teach your daughter to be honest , and also teach her to be prudent .
When we have to choose one over the other , we have to rely on our experience and judgment , rather than a prescribed formula .
That ’s tough for a ten year - old , so offer her your suggestions as you have been doing , but the choice still remains hers to make .
Explain to her in a ten year - old ’s terms that she is experiencing one of the main ways that organized religion grows and reinforces its hegemony : social pressure to conform to at least the outward appearance of belief .
Ask her if she would really want to be part of a group that forces her to lie and fake things in order to belong .
Then be prepared , because she might say “ Yes . ”
Your daughter is entering the stage where the herd instinct is very strong , a time when fitting in with a group is seen as more important than anything else .
It ’s a difficult time for kids who have differences that set them apart , and seeing their children ’s distress , some parents can be very tempted to make all sorts of accommodations and concessions to help their child belong .
Sometimes those concessions carry unfortunate lessons with them , such as :
A group ’s approval defines your goodness as a person .
Giving in to a group ’s expectations is more important than being true to your own principles .
Excluding others is a way to be included .
Faking things is a legitimate way to go through life .
Unfortunately , from many a child ’s point of view , all that makes sense , but your daughter is very lucky to have parents who are not willing to teach her those lessons just for the expediency of reducing tension in the family .
While she is probably old enough to intellectually understand the difference between joining a religion for sincere belief and joining just to please others , she might not be mature enough yet to care about that difference .
Nevertheless , make it clear to her that she cannot ask you to do the lying and faking , to do most of the outward conforming so that she will get the social acceptance she wants .
Looking for alternative social outlets for her that are more secular , even an atheist youth organization is a very good idea , but in your region that may be fruitless .
In some parts of the country , religion permeates every social forum , like water seeping through solid rock .
Finally there is the stickiest of all the possible responses .
You said , “ We ’ve always told her that she is free to choose her beliefs and it ’s also ok to be atheist . ”
She may want to start attending church , Sunday school or youth prayer meetings with other kids , under the supervision of one of her friend ’s parents .
That will involve some awkward meetings with those parents to see if you trust them , and to work out the understandings about you not accompanying her to these things .
Then you might have to face having a little Marjoe running around your home , spouting “ Jesus this , ” and “ Jesus that , ” and repeating who knows what she ’ll be told about her atheist parents .
You may be spending quite a lot of time sorting out how while she ’s free to choose her beliefs , she ’s not free to pester , badger or insult her parents with those beliefs .
The division that is between you and her now may be tiny compared with how deep it could get .
What a mess .
If you ’re not willing to risk that , then you may have to just ride out the next few years , trying your best to reassure her that you love her and care about her even though you cannot perform this charade for her social standing .
Reiterate that you ’re on her side , and her schoolmates are the ones who are being divisive , intolerant and unloving .
Time is on your side .
Some kids by their nature are more compelled to do anything to fit in than other kids , and some groups by their nature are more demanding of conformity than other groups .
Over time , with some drama and trauma along the way , the groups and the members sort each other out .
I wish you all the very best of good fortune and the best of outcomes over the next few challenging years .

Much as I hate to disagree with my state representative , Tom Massey of Poncha Springs , it is time for our legislature to take “ free - market ” principles seriously , and take our state totally out of the marijuana - enforcement business .
Cannabis ought to be like any other plant grown in Colorado .
You and I are free to cultivate , buy and sell alfalfa , potatoes or chili peppers .
Why should marijuana be any different ?
The benefits of flat - out legalization are numerous .
Local and state government budgets are tight these days , and there have to be better uses for our tax dollars than the millions we spend on enforcement , prosecution and incarceration .
The current “ medical marijuana ” controversy just adds to the complication — as well as the cost , since “ licensed growers ” are n’t going to welcome unbridled competition that would lower prices .
But that ’s their problem ; why should it be anyone else ’s ?
As for the violence and corruption that accompany prohibition , that ’s a result of the big profits to be made by dealing in substances made artificially scarce .
To put it another way , when was the last time you heard of a gunfight over a bale of hay , or a bribe to transfer a bushel of potatoes ?
Granted , there are objections , but they do n’t stand up well .
• The law - enforcement community wants tighter regulation , or even a return to outright prohibition .
Of course .
But this is n’t because they ’re concerned about public safety .
It ’s because they ’re concerned about keeping their jobs and expanding their bureaucracies .
The more things that are illegal , the more work there is for them .
In other words , we are naturally skeptical when educators tell us they need smaller classrooms and longer school days and terms , which means more teachers and higher pay .
So why are n’t we just as dubious about sheriffs and police chiefs who crave bigger budgets ?
I do n’t blame them for wanting more money and power — we ’re all tempted along that line — but let ’s drop the pretense that it has anything to do with improving the public welfare .
• Legalization would send the wrong message to children .
The main message from the current system — the futile and expensive War Against a Plant — is that America is run by hypocritical morons .
How could legalization present a worse message ?
• It would make our highways more dangerous , and we already have trouble enough with alcohol .
For one thing , that ’s really an argument for better public transportation and improved pedestrian facilities , so that people feel less of a need to drive under various influences .
For another , I confess to having ridden with drivers who were ripped to the gills , back in the day .
Somebody who putts along at 4 miles per hour , and pulls over frequently on account of the confusion from all those glaring lights , is certainly an annoyance on the road .
But he ’s not a serious threat to life or limb , and our police are certainly capable of noticing such behavior and acting appropriately .
Driving while intoxicated or impaired is and should be illegal — no matter what the intoxicant .
• Marijuana is still illegal under federal law .
So let the feds enforce it .
We have better things to do with our state ’s limited financial resources .
Add it all up , and the arguments against full legalization do n’t hold much water .
But doubtless there are Coloradans who honestly believe the state should put its resources into fighting a plant .
They ’re welcome to go after the water - sucking tamarisk along some of our river banks .
And there ’s Kentucky bluegrass , the stuff of lawns that inspire expensive storage and diversion projects with associated environmental degradation .
So if we must attempt to improve Colorado by fighting plants , let ’s go after the truly pernicious species .

David Tennant 's swansong on Doctor Who , " The End of Time " , airs today in the UK and tomorrow night on BBC America .
But how will the Tenth Doctor 's finale — and his big regeneration — compare with those that came before ?

There are really two ways in which to evaluate a Doctor 's final story .
First , you can consider the quality of the story itself , particularly in how well it sums up that particular Doctor 's run on the program .
Second , you can take a look at the regeneration itself , both in terms of the final scene itself and how the rest of the story builds toward it .
So let 's run through the previous regeneration stories and take a look at both of these aspects before getting into the tricky business of ranking which was best .
1st Doctor to 2nd Doctor : " The Tenth Planet "
Advertisement
The Story :
It 's difficult to separate the story of " The Tenth Planet " from its overwhelming historical importance .
The story not only featured the first regeneration ( or , as it was then known , " renewal " ) , but it also introduced the Cybermen .
This is the first of the so - called " base under siege " stories that dominated the next three years of Doctor Who .
It also comes from an era of Doctor Who that is almost entirely lost ; it is the only story in the show 's fourth season from which more than half of its episodes survive intact .
Sadly , the final episode is the one that has gone missing , meaning it 's impossible to appreciate the regeneration in its full , original context .

Still , once you look past all of that , there is a very solid , at times excellent story waiting to be discovered .
The Cybermen have possibly been more intimidating in other stories , but they have never been creepier than they are here , with their cloth faces and disturbingly singsong voices .
More so than in later appearances , writers Kit Pedler and Gerry Davis really get to heart of what a completely logical race would be like , as the Cybermen try to destroy the Earth with chilling detachment .
Somewhat uniquely , the Doctor knows about the Cybermen before they appear , suggesting he has had prior contact with them .
Considering he had never heard of the Daleks before his first encounter with them , this represented a rather sizable shift in his knowledge of the cosmos .
Although parts of the story rely on some staggeringly bad science — the idea of a twin planet to Earth wandering through space is pretty much completely bonkers — the plot at the heart of " The Tenth Planet " is about as gripping and tense as early Doctor Who could be .

The Regeneration :
Again , it 's kind of hard to look past the larger importance of this first regeneration .
After all , if the producers had n't come up with a way to continue the series after illness forced William Hartnell to leave the show , Doctor Who would have come to an end in 1966 , lingering on only as a mostly forgotten curiosity .
That said , " The Tenth Planet " does a good job of building up to this final scene , as the Doctor grows progressively weaker over the course of the serial .
Unfortunately , this was partially because Hartnell was too sick to appear in episode three , which forced a hasty rewrite to work around his sudden absence .
Even so , this does set up a rather appropriate arc for the Doctor in the story , as he is quite clearly in decaying health in the story 's final episode .
Advertisement
Since the footage of the regeneration itself has thankfully survived , we can evaluate it from a special effects perspective .
Honestly , it 's astounding just how well the production team pulled off the change from William Hartnell to Patrick Troughton , particularly considering how often far simpler effects defeated them .
Doctor
Who was made for shockingly little money and in shockingly little time in the sixties , but director Derek Martinus insisted they take the time to ensure they made the regeneration as well as possible .
At that , they certainly succeeded .
2nd Doctor to 3rd Doctor : " The War Games "
Advertisement
The Story :
With the 12 - part serial " The Dalek Masterplan " all but lost to history , the ten episodes of " The War Games " represent Doctor Who at its most epic .
Expanded from its original , more standard six - part length when another story fell through ( a common problem in Patrick Troughton 's final season on the program ) , writers Malcolm Hulke and Terrance Dicks were forced to pull out all the stops to make the second Doctor 's farewell story worthy of its insane length .
And , somehow , they just about pull it off .
Advertisement
The Doctor , Jamie , and Zoe find themselves in what looks like a World War I battlefield , which was instantly one of the darkest , scariest places the series had visited up to that point .
The situation gets far grimmer as it becomes clear that larger forces are at work .
Unnamed aliens have kidnapped soldiers from throughout Earth 's history so that they might take part in massive , deadly war simulations .
The ultimate goal is to create an invincible fighting force that will conquer the entire universe .
And they 're doing it with the technical advice of the War Chief , who reveals himself to be another Time Lord .
" The War Games " works as well as it does because it constantly expands the story 's scope , with at least four or five potential big bads revealed to be mere subordinates of even scarier villains .
Most classic series Doctor
Who stories tend to be padded , and " The War Games " is certainly no exception , as the Doctor gets captured and recaptured a few too many times .
But Patrick Troughton is obviously having the time of his life in his swansong , and he gives it even more of his all than usual , which tends to paper over any of the story 's deficiencies or redundancies .
" The War Games " is a massive , epic tale ... and one that I 've watched in a single sitting on more than one occasion .
Advertisement
The Regeneration :
Well , technically speaking , there is n't a regeneration .
( Doubly technically speaking , the term " regeneration " was n't even coined until the third Doctor 's departure . )
The next Doctor had not yet been cast , and the only thing the show 's producers knew was that neither Patrick Troughton nor his costars were coming back .
Indeed , there was n't any certainty that Doctor Who would return at all .
As such , the tenth and final episode of " The War Games " is radically different from what preceded it , as it dramatically alters the Doctor 's place in the universe .
Advertisement
It does this both by introducing the godlike Time Lords , providing a fleeting glimpse of the society the Doctor had fled , and by exiling the Doctor to Earth .
The latter was far more important to the show 's survival , as it provided the production team a blueprint to cut costs and establish a format that would restore the series 's dwindling popularity .
However , the former is more interesting to us , as it began establishing the conventions that still affect the series forty years later .
For instance , it is established here that Time Lords have some control over what they regenerate into , although the Doctor is almost always too busy dying an agonizing death to put much thought into this .
( The Master had more success with this when he chose to become young and strong again in " Utopia . " )
The absolute control that the Time Lords wield is also something that the series has returned to again and again , and indeed it looks like that is one of the crucial ideas in " The End of Time . "
Advertisement
Anyway , although we never actually got to see the 2nd Doctor turn into the 3rd Doctor , it probably should n't be forgotten that " The War Games " does end with the Time Lords essentially putting this incarnation of the Doctor to death .
Not too many series had the guts to execute their protagonist in a season finale .
The sheer audacity of it all has got to earn this regeneration a few points , even if it never technically happened .
3rd Doctor to 4th Doctor : " Planet of the Spiders "
Advertisement
The Story :
" Planet of the Spiders " is sort of a mash - up of a bunch of different types of Third Doctor stories .
There 's an investigation of mysterious happenings in a seemingly peaceful location in rural England , there are a bunch of humans struggling to free themselves from oppression on an alien planet , there is a mild alien invasion , and there 's a big action sequence .
There is also a lot interest in Eastern mysticism .
If nothing else , the story manages to touch upon just about everything iconic about Jon Pertwee 's tenure as the Doctor , with the tragic exception of the Master .
( Roger Delgado , who originated the role , had died earlier that year in a car crash . )
Advertisement
The actual plot amounts to little more than a bunch of different groups trying and failing to get their hands on a blue crystal that can grant its possessor extraordinary mental powers .
Since there is n't a lot more for the story to accomplish from a narrative perspective , this leads to some incredibly padded sequences .
The most infamous of these is a car chase that takes up the bulk of the second episode and is , considering one of the characters involved can teleport , entirely unnecessary .
This is hardly the only part of the story that seems unnecessary ; indeed , entire characters seem to have been created for no other reason than to chew up time in a story that is stretched over six episodes .
What 's probably most interesting about this story is that pretty much everything that happens is the Doctor 's fault , and he can only resolve the essential conflict by sacrificing himself .
He has to be pushed in this direction by his old Time Lord mentor K'Anpo , and the fact that the Doctor is not immediately willing to accept the fate he has created for himself lends the story a tragic quality .
Thematically , " Planet of the Spiders " throws around a ton of great ideas and is a fitting end for the Third Doctor .
It 's a shame then that the story these ideas are built around is so threadbare .
Advertisement
The Regeneration :
More than perhaps any other regeneration , this scene really plays like the Doctor 's death .
Indeed , the Doctor comes about as close to death here as he ever has , considering K'Anpo has to show up to instigate the regeneration process .
Leaving the precise mechanics of it all aside , Jon Pertwee 's final moments as the Doctor are quite moving , and Elisabeth Sladen 's despair as Sarah Jane Smith really complements the intense emotions of the scene .
The actual physical change from Pertwee to Tom Baker is almost an afterthought , and that seems entirely appropriate .
" Planet of the Spiders " is more about death than regeneration anyway ; the Doctor is just lucky that he gets to come back .

4th Doctor to 5th Doctor : " Logopolis "
Advertisement
The Story :
Tom Baker 's final season as the Doctor began as something of a creative resurgence after an increasingly silly year with Douglas Adams as script editor .
" The Leisure Hive " and the E - Space Trilogy offered more serious , thoughtful science fiction stories that echoed Baker 's early years on Doctor Who .
As such , it 's a real disappointment that his era limped to such a disastrous conclusion with two tedious , nonsensical stories that accomplished little more than bringing back the Master .
Advertisement
Following on from the boring if inoffensive " Keeper of Traken " , " Logopolis " proves an utterly unworthy finale for the classic series 's most iconic Doctor .
The plot , such as it is , involves the recently revived Master attempting to do something dastardly to the verbal mathematicians of Logopolis , who stave off entropy by doing a lot of really complicated math .
I would explain further , but that 's about as clear as " Logopolis " makes it .
The Master 's original plan never really becomes clear , but it ultimately involves holding the entire universe to ransom .
He does this by broadcasting a message from a radio telescope in England , which is about seven different shades of insane .
( I mean , even if you ignore the fact that his message , which required a pretty much instant reply because the heat death of the universe was close at hand , would take years to reach even the closest solar systems , there 's still the question of how the entire universe was supposed to coordinate a reply to his demands . )
The Doctor stops him , but not before a good portion of the universe is wiped out and , more importantly , he falls off the telescope , starting his regeneration .
Advertisement
Basically , " Logopolis " is the 1981 version of a typical Russell T. Davies finale .
It involves the return of an iconic villain , the stakes are incomprehensibly massive , it throws around a lot of big ideas that do n't really make sense , and the plot does n't stand up to any great scrutiny .
Unfortunately , without the snappy pacing and flashy direction of the new series , it 's a lot harder to get lost in the spectacle of it all , making the fatal flaws of " Logopolis " pretty much impossible to ignore .
The Regeneration :
( Note : The good stuff starts around the 2:10 mark . )
Thankfully , the regeneration is one of the two or three bits of " Logopolis " that sort of works .
Although the story 's attempts to create a melancholy , funereal tone contribute to its general sluggishness , it does pay off with a big regeneration scene that feels appropriately built up .
A mysterious white figure , referred to as The Watcher , appears throughout the four episodes of " Logopolis " , and he is revealed here to be a projection of the Doctor 's future .
It does n't really make any more sense than anything else , but it 's a neat idea that makes the Doctor 's death seem more intrinsic to the story than it otherwise might .
Advertisement
We also see an appropriately big rundown of all the major villains and companions of the fourth Doctor 's tenure .
Admittedly , it 's not the best edited montage I 've ever seen , and there 's a hell of a drinking game to be had from the amount of times people say the word " Doctor " in the final two minutes , but it all ends in a moment of quiet dignity from Tom Baker .
The regeneration itself is handled well enough , although I would have liked to see Tom Baker actually turn into Peter Davision without the Watcher crammed in between .
In any event , the regeneration is far from perfect , but it 's a work of brilliance compared to everything that comes before it .
5th Doctor to 6th Doctor : " The Caves of Androzani "
Advertisement
The Story :
I hope you all like superlatives , because " The Caves of Androzani " is my choice for best Doctor Who story of all time , bar none .
I realize that 's a slightly unorthodox opinion ( I can actually feel my critical respectability slipping away ) , but Doctor Who super - writer Robert Holmes was never better than he is here .
He constructs a fully - realized society using just a few sets , one location , and a ton of brilliant little details .
He makes everybody in the story a complete bastard without any of it seeming gratuitous or nasty , something that all too often tripped up Doctor Who in the eighties .
This is one of the few times Doctor Who actually feels Shakespearean in its scope , though that might just be because the villainous Trau Morgus keeps making asides to the cameras .
Advertisement
He also constructs a story that moves inexorably towards the Doctor 's regeneration , something that director Graeme Harper picks up on perfectly .
Every single cliffhanger finds the Doctor seemingly facing certain death ( the end of episode 3 is maybe the tensest cliffhanger in the history of the series ) .
Every male character in the story dies , the Doctor very much included .
Indeed , the Doctor dooms himself in the first few minutes of episode one , as he idly touches the poisonous spectrox that will destroy his body .
What always amazes me is how contained a story " The Caves of Androzani " is .
The stakes in the story do n't really extend beyond a petty local squabble over a precious material , and the Doctor is too busy trying to save Peri to ever really get involved .
But almost because of all that , everything that happens here seems so much more important than , say , " Logopolis . "
Throughout , the Doctor is fighting for Peri 's life at the expense of his own , and Peter Davison makes it clear that the Doctor is fighting harder than he ever has before to save his friend .
Advertisement
The Regeneration :
Graeme Harper 's bravura direction extends to the regeneration scene .
As he explained in the DVD commentary , his approach to the regeneration was influenced by the crescendo in " A Day in the Life " , and this idea of starting small and building to a huge conclusion is very much in evidence .
The idea of bringing back old companions ( plus the Master ) owes a debt to " Logopolis " , but it 's far better executed here .
Instead of a bunch of old clips of various villains and companions saying the word " Doctor " , they actually brought back the original actors to record new lines that sum up their relationship with the Doctor .
Their disembodied heads then revolve and intermingle , until the Master interrupts them all with a demand that the Doctor finally die .
Advertisement
There are only a couple problems with the scene .
I have to admit , part of the thrill of a regeneration is actually getting to see one Doctor turn into another , and we do n't get that here .
Also , the Sixth Doctor is maybe just a little too flippantly dismissive of his predecessor in his closing lines .
Still , there might be a common explanation for both of these issues .
There 's a sense here that the show is trying to create a definitive , clean break between the eras , as it sends the Fifth Doctor off in style and introduces the Sixth Doctor with a bang .
All of which would have worked great , if only the next story was n't the utterly disastrous " The Twin Dilemma . "
6th Doctor to 7th Doctor :
The first thirty seconds of " Time and the Rani " and possibly the novel Spiral Scratch
Advertisement
The Story :
And so begins a long run of Doctors not getting their own proper regeneration stories .
For Sylvester McCoy and Paul McGann , it was because the series was canceled ( or , if we 're being technical , not picked up ) before they could regenerate .
Colin Baker , on the other hand , had the inglorious distinction of being the only Doctor ever fired from the role , as he was ( unfairly ) blamed for the show 's declining quality and popularity .
Executive producer John Nathan - Turner offered him the opportunity to return at the start of the next season for a regeneration story .
Understandably , he refused , which meant the show had to somehow pull off a regeneration without one of the two required Doctors .
( But more on that in a moment . )
Advertisement
Perhaps the only circumstances worse than those of Colin Baker 's departure from Doctor Who were those of his Doctor 's regeneration .
Based on what we see in the opening minute of the seventh Doctor 's debut adventure , " Time and the Rani " , one can only assume the sixth Doctor died from a bump on the head .
Gary Russell , Doctor
Who 's resident fixer of minor continuity problems , took it upon himself to offer a more dignified death for the sixth Doctor in his novel Spiral Scratch .
The book suggests that the Doctor actually died from intense blasts of chronon energy while attempting to save the entire multiverse .
Hey , it beats a bump on the head .
The Regeneration :
Ooh boy .
When people talk about Doctor Who hitting rock bottom in the eighties , I 'd nominate this minute as the show at its absolute worst .
Crappy space effects accompanied by horrifically cheesy music ?
Check .
Shockingly inept direction and daft camera movies ?
Check and check .
Indefensible artistic choices ?
Oh , that 's a big check .
I mean , the TARDIS crashes on a rainbow .
I think .
Honestly , I 'm not sure my mind can really process what I just saw .
Advertisement
Oh , and then there 's the regeneration itself , which features the world 's best Colin Baker impersonator subbing in for the absent Sixth Doctor .
That 's right , folks : it 's Sylvester McCoy in a big blond wig !
With an opening like that , you just know you 're in for something special .
I think anyone who has seen " Time and the Rani " can back me up on that one .
I honestly can't believe the Doctor Who production staff thought this was preferable to just skipping the regeneration .
After all , no one has ever criticized Spearhead from Space for not featuring five seconds of Jon Pertwee in a Patrick Troughton wig .
And if anyone has , I 'll fight them myself .
7th Doctor to 8th Doctor : " Doctor Who : The Movie "
Advertisement
The Story :
Much like " Time and the Rani " , the 1996 TV movie is really more an introduction to the eighth Doctor than a farewell to the seventh , but at least here Sylvester McCoy is given a proper chance to pass the torch onto Paul McGann .
As I 'm one of the dozen or so people who really likes the TV movie ( and there goes the last shred of my critical respectability ) , I 'll spare you my epic defense of its misunderstood brilliance and just focus on how it treats the seventh Doctor .
Advertisement
This treatment is , on balance , just OK .
Although Sylvester McCoy is one of the more limited actors to play the Doctor , he can be great when he plays to his strengths , and the TV movie really does n't ask him to do very much .
He does do a good job getting across just how impossibly old the Doctor is , and there is a weariness to his performance that suggests he somehow senses the end is near .
It would have been nice if he got more than three lines , but what 's there is rather good .
The Regeneration :
Director Geoffrey Sax and writer Matthew Jacobs really love their symbolism .
In an artistic decision that is either totally awesome or unspeakably cliched ( or both , maybe ) , they juxtapose the regeneration with a classic scene from the 1930 version of Frankenstein where the monster is first given life .
( We also later see the Eighth Doctor wander into a room full of broken mirrors .
Because he does n't know who he is , you see . )
This regeneration is notable , because it really suggests how horrific the process is , as the mostly dead Seventh Doctor writhes in pain as his entire body rearranges into its new form .
Unfortunately , the actual , final change is a bit anticlimactic .
I 'll have to deduct points for that .

8th Doctor to 9th Doctor : Who knows ?
Advertisement
Since Russell T. Davies ( wisely ) began the revived series with Christopher Eccleston already in place as the Ninth Doctor , we still do n't have any definitive idea as to the fate of the Eighth Doctor .
Though there 's a slight chance the second part of " The End of Time " might shed some light on the subject , this will likely remain unexplained for the foreseeable future .
The closest thing I 've ever found to an official word on the subject — and this takes a hell of a lot of digging to uncover — can be found buried deep within the archives of the old tie - in website " Who Is Doctor Who ? " , which was the first of a bunch of quickie websites the BBC created to promote the first series of new Doctor Who .
If you click through to the " Sightings " page on the original incarnation of the website , you 'll find this nugget :
Steven Hudson
I saw him a couple a years ago outside a new building development in Totters Lane , East London .
The guy seemed really confused and keep muttering , " They 're all gone , I 'm the only one left " .
The man was either a complete loon or was drunk .
Looking back I think he was probably drunk as he looked as if he'd been to a fancy dress party .
He was wearing some old Edwardian outfit , not a leather jacket .
Advertisement
So , if I may add 2 and 2 together to make 100 , this obviously means the eighth Doctor regenerated right at the end of the Time War , in which he wiped out Daleks and Time Lords alike , and then the ninth Doctor went to Totters Lane in 2003 — exactly forty Earth years after his adventures began in that very same location ! — to try and get his bearings while still wearing his predecessor 's clothes .
Obviously .
Or we can just file all that away as massively non-canonical and move on .
9th Doctor to 10th Doctor : " Bad Wolf " / " Parting of the Ways "
Advertisement
The Story :
I 've warmed to this story considerably since the first time I watched it .
Like I suggested earlier , this is pretty much the 2005 version of " Logopolis " , and the big difference is that it moves just fast enough and is just gleefully crazy enough to make me look past its sometimes sizable faults .
I already went over my list of what worked and what did n't in a recent post , so I 'll try not to repeat myself too much .
Advertisement
If I might add one point to the earlier critique , it 's that I 'm not sure how well " Bad Wolf " / " The Parting of the Ways " works as the Ninth Doctor 's farewell episode .
It 's still a bit of a mess trying to figure out exactly what happened when with Christopher Eccleston 's decision to leave Doctor Who , so I 'm uncertain whether the story was originally intended to serve as his swansong .
( I do n't believe it was , but I would n't bet my life on it . )
As such , there 's a bit of a sense that the regeneration is bolted onto the rest of the story .
Advertisement
Considering the entire first series is built around the predestination of the words " Bad Wolf " , you might think it would have been possible to drop a few more hints of the Doctor 's fate .
There might have been an opportunity for the Doctor to consider his own mortality and how it is different from those of his human allies .
It 's actually a bit weird that the Doctor regenerates after an entire episode of expecting certain death at the hands of the Daleks .
Thematically , it does n't quite line up .
And , if nothing else , it would have been nice if the ninth Doctor 's final appearance did n't begin with a Big Brother homage .
Oh well .
The Regeneration :
I 'm not sure why I feel like using this particular word , but the Ninth Doctor 's regeneration is fantastic .
Absolutely fantastic .
It 's certainly remarkable how well the show pulled off the first regeneration back in 1966 , but here you can really see how impressive a regeneration of a proper budget can look .
Although the regeneration in the TV movie captured something of the body horror of the process , " Parting of the Ways " really brings out the kind of explosive energy such a process would surely involve .
Advertisement
The actual visual transformation from Christopher Eccleston into David Tennant looks spectacular , and Tennant gets across exactly what the Tenth Doctor is all about in just a few short lines .
( I 'd actually argue he did n't recapture that performance until late in series two , but that 's another issue for another time . )
But this regeneration is really about Christopher Eccleston .
Although he starts out babbling and overly manic - an understandable fault , considering he 's dying — he excels once he shifts into his more serious goodbye to Rose .
He really nails the bittersweet emotions of saying goodbye when he 's not really going away at all .
Much as I 'm a classic series
Who fan at heart , I 've got to admit it - this is probably the best regeneration .
10th Doctor to 10th Doctor : " The Stolen Earth " / " Journey 's End "
Advertisement
The Story :
It 's Dalek Armageddon once again , and it's going to take every single person the Tenth Doctor has ever met to save the day .
In the midst of all this insanity , Rose Tyler and the Doctor are pining after each other , desperate for a reunion .
After a bunch of near - misses , the two finally find each other on an abandoned London road .
Well , not quite abandoned , as a Dalek lurks around the corner .
Advertisement
Yes , at long last , the Daleks finally manage to do something the Cybermen , the Master , some poison , a bump on the head , and the American medical system had already accomplished : force the Doctor to regenerate !
( Well , I guess they kind of did that in " Parting of the Ways " too .
But here they actually exterminated him ! )
The Regeneration :
I really do n't like that Russell T. Davies pulled a psych - out regeneration .
( I believe that 's the technical term . )
I would say that it was n't all that tense , considering I knew David Tennant was already filming that year 's Christmas Special and thus would definitely be staying on , but I suppose not everyone scoured the Internet for spoilers as much as I did .
( And even those who did were n't necessarily convinced this meant he was n't regenerating — the Outpost Gallifrey boards were even awash with theories even more half - baked than usual . )
So maybe it really was the " biggest cliffhanger ever " to some viewers .

Still , it just seems a bit cheap to me to use regeneration like this .
I try to avoid acting too much like an insufferable old - school fan , but I kind of think you should only use regeneration when a Doctor is actually leaving .
Beyond the fact that the Doctor 's explanation of what just happened is cloyingly cute and requires David Tennant to vomit up exposition at an alarming rate , it also does no favors for the eventual Eleventh Doctor ( who we will of course be meeting very , very soon ) .
Perhaps I 'm just being paranoid on Matt Smith 's behalf , but it seems a bit unfair for the Tenth Doctor to actually ask why he would ever want to change .
It 's a question I rather wish had never been placed in viewers ' minds .
So now , with all that out of the way , here 's my incredibly authorative and entirely inarguable ranking of both the regenerations and the stories that preceded them .
I should note that , for the stories , I 'm only considering the Doctors that got proper regeneration stories , and I can't in good conscience count the first minute of " Time and the Rani " or the opening of the TV movie .

If the machine shows German writing , the car park is full
Drivers using a Birmingham city centre car park have had their language skills tested by a ticket dispenser which operates in German .
The machine gives instructions in English until the multi-storey Brunel Street car park becomes full - then it switches to German .
The council blamed a change in software in December , when the city was hosting its Frankfurt Christmas Market .
" Maybe the machine got confused , " a council spokesman said .
Brum Eye
The council hopes to have the problem rectified by next week .
In the meantime a notice has been put up and staff are on hand to translate .
One motorist , looking at the notice on the machine , said : " It is quite funny , but I do n't understand how that can happen . "
A few years earlier , visitors to the city 's big wheel , dubbed the Brum Eye , were confused to find themselves listening to French commentary describing Paris .
HEALTH experts have warned dieters against taking advice from actress Megan Fox .
The Transformers star has been blasted for hailing the benefits of swigging vinegar .
She recently said , " It just cleanses out your system entirely .
" It will get rid of ... for women who retain water weight from your menstrual cycle and all that ... it gets rid of it really fast .
" I 'm not one for dieting or exercising , because I 'm lazy and I have a really big sweet tooth , so I have to do cleanses every once in a while ' cause of the amount of sugar I take in . "
However , experts in the field have dismissed Megan 's claims , insisting there is not a single form of vinegar in existence that will help dieters lose weight .
Dietician Lucy Jones said , " As attractive as it sounds , there is no magic pill , lotion or potion for a quick fix to weight loss .
" The body , including the liver , is a well - oiled detoxing machine , which will not be improved by vinegar , whether it be organic , apple cider , unfiltered , or your bog - standard malt vinegar . "

Today we 're unveiling the TF2 Contribution site .
This nifty site will allow anyone who 's made a custom piece of TF2 content to submit it to us , with a view to it appearing in - game .
Many of you have been building fantastic TF2 work for a while now , and we wanted a way for you to get it in front of all TF2 players , and for everyone to see that you were the one that built it .
Also , we 've now added an official feed for harvesting TF2 inventory data for all the folks out there building nifty web pages around items .
Technical details are as follows :

Economists and others weigh in on the 5.7 % jump in gross domestic product at a seasonally adjusted annual rate .
Today ’s report that GDP grew at a 5.7 % annual rate is good news , but it ’s far too early to break out the champagne and declare ‘ recovery accomplished . ’
Even if this growth rate were to be sustained for 3 years we would still not create enough jobs to climb out of the hole caused by this recession .
Worse , this growth will not be sustained .
This quarter ’s growth was driven largely by a restocking of business inventories that will not be repeated in coming quarters .

– Josh Bivens , Economic Policy Institute GDP growth broke to a level above expectations based primarily on stronger than anticipated inventory …
While consumer spending , the housing markets , and export growth all played a role , the 3.4 % contribution to headline growth from inventory expansions remains easily the biggest factor in today ’s GDP release …
Also note that much of the inventory improvement was limited to non-durable goods and the auto industry , the latter of which is building inventories with questionable short term sales prospects .
This inventory - driven GDP number also calls into question the sustainability of this type of growth–there ’s no reason to anticipate that inventories will continue to build aggressively with consumer spending remaining somewhat stagnant .

While today ’s reading was better than expectations , we must note that real final sales rose by 5.6 % or so on average through 1983 .
Gross domestic purchases , which measure purchases of both goods and services by U.S. residents wherever they are produced , rose by 5.1 % in the quarter .
This is a very impressive reading , having averaged 3 % dating back to 1975 .

Real final demand went from plunging at a 4 % - to - 5 % pace in fourth quarter 2008 and first quarter 2009 to flattish in the second quarter to 2 % growth in the second half of last year .
As households ’ income situations improve and businesses invest more , we look for the upward momentum to continue in 2010 , with gains of around 2.5 % in first quarter , 3 % in second quarter , and close to 4 % in the second half of this year .

The composition of this report will probably cause those analysts carrying fancy growth rates for the first quarter to pare them pack , as the biggest quarterly swing from inventories has likely been seen .
Otherwise , the elements of final demand in this report were probably insufficient to change anyone ’s mind about their fundamental view of the economy .

Big positive story still being overlooked is the gain in equipment & software spending — up 13.3 % plus – John Silvia , Wells Fargo
still being overlooked is the gain in equipment & software spending — up 13.3 % plus – John Silvia , Wells Fargo The 13.3 % rise in equipment investment was the best since the first quarter of 2006 .
Equipment investment contributed 0.8 percentage point to GDP growth in the fourth quarter ( 0.5 point more than we had anticipated ) .
The other big upside surprise was in foreign trade .
This reflected a much smaller advance in imports than we had expected .
The combination of stronger investment and weaker imports suggests that more of the upside in investment was fueled by domestically produced goods than we had assumed .

The good news is that the recession has ended around mid-year and the economy has begun to expand during the second half of the year .
Most of the sectors has contributed to economic growth during the quarter .
Final sales have increased from the second quarter .
The not - so - good news is that most of the growth came from temporary factors such as inventories and government stimulus which ca n’t be sustained .

All things considered , this was a very strong report and is the first GDP report in 2009 to really elicit any semblance of a ‘ wow ’ factor .
Having said that though , it is quite obvious to us that the rebound during the quarter was not a function of some new - found economic dynamism , but rather it was the slowing pace of inventory liquidation that really dealt the winning hand .
The fact that sixty percent of growth can be attributed to this correction suggests the pace of GDP growth going forward will fail to keep pace , though that is not to say growth will stall altogether .

As Haiti reels from yesterday 's massive earthquake and its continued aftershocks , and nations rush to put rescue efforts together , scientists analyzing the seismic event say this disaster may have been a long time coming .
The earthquake in Haiti had a preliminary magnitude of 7.0 and it appeared to have occurred along a strike - slip fault , where one side of a vertical fault slips horizontally past the other , scientists say [ AP ]
.
This fault , called the Enriquillo - Plantain Garden fault , may have been slowly building up pressure since the major 1760 earthquake that struck Haiti .
" It 's been locked solid for about the last 250 years , " said Dr Roger Musson from the British Geological Survey ( BGS ) .
" It 's been gathering stress all that time as the plates move past each other , and it was really just a matter of time before it released all that energy " [ BBC News ]
.
Chillingly , scientists led by Paul Mann warned just two years ago that such a massive quake could strike Hispaniola , the island Haiti shares with the Dominican Republic .
But there was n't much the impoverished Caribbean nation could do with that information , Mann said :
" The problem with these kinds of strikes is that they can remain quiescent -- dormant -- for hundreds of years , " he said Tuesday evening .
" So it 's hard to predict when they 'll occur " [ CNN ]
.
The BBC reports that the fault system of which Enriquillo - Plantain is a part normally moves less than an inch per year as the North American and Caribbean tectonic plates slide by each other , but this earthquake may have caused the earth 's surface along the fault line to offset by as much as three feet .
The fact that the Enriquillo - Plantain appears to have released all its fury at once raises further worry for people living near strike - slip fault zones — California 's San Andres fault also falls under this category .
However , Caribbean geology expert Grenville Draper says that the Hispaniola fault system does n't behave exactly like California's .
The movement along the Hispaniola fault
is relatively small compared with plates moving underground in California , Draper said .
The effect would be less - frequent earthquakes , but relatively large ones when they do occur [ Miami Herald ]

[ 1/08 Update : Widmer Brothers confirms that this will be a year - round brew .
It uses Nelson Sauvin hops from New Zealand .
Rob Widmer disclosed the reason for dumping the beer on the Beervana blog : “ The batch was stuck in the kettle for more than 8 hours .
Color development continues , DMS becomes an issue and we ’d miss our hop bitterness target .
That and the unknown so we did n’t want to fool around . ” ]
( Portland , OR ) – Wow , you do n’t hear about a new beer in this fashion very often .
Sarah Mirk of the Portland Mercury reported earlier this afternoon that there was a morning power outage in the city of Portland .
Other than creating a headache for commuters , the outage left at least one other significant casualty : 7,750 gallons of beer that was in - process at Widmer Brothers .
Not just any beer though .
The batch of beer that was lost is a new Imperial IPA that the Portland brewery was working on for a February 1st release .
Widmer Brothers Deadlift is a heavily - hopped 9.5 % ABV beer and the most expensive one that the brewery is currently making according to Co-Founder , Rob Widmer .
That is 62,000 pints according to his math and a major loss for Widmer .
The Mercury notes that it was n’t a complete loss , “ According to Kurt Widmer , the ruined beer will instead be shipped off to cattle farms to be used as either feed or fertilizer .
As Kurt explains , Widmer turns most of its beer by - products into cattle feed .
After the sugar is extracted from barley malts and wheat malts , the grains apparently make pretty nutritious non-alcoholic cow food . ”
Widmer is getting this beer up and going again quickly so that it can still hit the February 1st release date .
While I have n’t confirmed this , it would appear that Widmer is slotting Deadlift as a late winter / early spring seasonal release given they do n’t currently have one .
Given how expensive it is to produce , I doubt they would make it year - round but I will confirm .
Surprisingly enough , this will be a year - round release , Widmer Brothers confirms .
The brewery currently has Widmer Brothers Brrr , its early winter seasonal on shelves through this month as well as the brand - new Widmer Brothers Pitch Black IPA .
If you 're an avid reader of someone like Gabriel Desjardins , Tyler Dellow or Jonathan Willis you 've already heard quite a lot about players and teams regressing to the mean .
One such study was done by Tyler Dellow who looked at goaltending while on the penalty kill and found that goalies who had a high save percentage one year tended to regress in the following season .
About this time last season I looked at goalies who had jumped out to a very good save percentage while penalty killing and predicted that they would , as a group , regress toward the mean and by the end of the year , each of the eight goaltenders who had started the year with a save percentage above .900 had seen their PK save percentage fall .
Now , some fell further than others but a very high save percentage on the PK is an indication that a goaltender 's overall save percentage has a good chance of declining as the season goes on and a very low save percentage on the PK is an indication that a goaltender 's overall save percentage has a good chance of increasing as the season goes on .
So which goalies have benefited by a high save percentage while penalty killing so far this season ?
We 'll look at that after the jump .
For this study I looked at goalies who had faced at least 60 shots ( mostly so that the study would be maximally relevant to the Oilers. 60 shots really is n't very many ) .
One thing Tyler noted in his study was that a historical average for save percentage on the PK is about .866 .
I like to calculate " goals saved above / below average " and the number I 'm using for " average " is that .866 figure .
The two tables below are the goalies with a PK save percentage above .900 , followed by goalies with a PK save percentage below .840 .
We should expect these goaltenders to regress somewhat toward .866 as the season goes on :
Now , I 'm not trying to say is that there is no skill at all involved in save percentage while penalty killing .
Surely there are some goalies who are good at it and others who are poor .
Nevertheless , there are very few goalies who are this good and very few goalies who are this bad and there have been quite a few goaltenders who have jumped from one category to the other .
Last season only five goaltenders finished the year with a save percentage over .900 while facing over 100 shots .
There were five others in 2007 - 08 .
On the other side , only eight goalies were worse than .840 over at least 100 shots last season and only six were worse than .840 over in 2007 - 08 .
Four goalies ( Dan Ellis , Patrick Lalime , Alex Auld and Mathieu Garon ) were on the " best " list one season and on the " worst " list in the other .
So far this season we 're seeing a very similar phenomenon .
Jonas Hiller was on the " best " list in 2007 - 08 and is on the " worst " list so far this year .
Brian Elliott was on the " worst " list last season but is on " best " list so far this year .
There 's a huge amount of variance , likely because the goalies are facing so few shots .
This makes it very difficult to determine a goaltender 's true skill , especially since it 's quite difficult to know the exact impact the rest of the penalty killing unit has on the goaltender 's performance .
So how will regression impact the Oilers ?
Well , Jeff Deslauriers ' EV save percentage on .916 is currently tied for 33rd in the league ( minimum of 100 shots ) and if that ends up being a true indicator of his skill level , the Oilers are n't likely to be very happy .
But at least they 're not the Thrashers .
Atlanta has really been leaning on Ondrej Pavelec so far this season and his overall save percentage of .914 looks respectable .
However , as we can see in the table above , that 's largely a product of his save percentage while penalty killing .
At EV his save percentage of .908 is tied for 42nd .
The Thrashers will likely need to have better goaltending than that if they hope to make the second season since , as a team , they 've regularly been outshot .
No sooner did Jeff Merkley announce his opposition to Bernanke ahead of tomorrow 's reconfirmation farce / hearing , than key Republican Senator John McCain said that he was leaning against voting for the the Chairman .
McCain said he would favor either former Fed Chief ( and apparently only sane economist in the Administration ) Paul Volcker , or ex-Treasury official , and creator of negative implied interest rates , John Taylor .
Some more from Dow Jones :
McCain joins at least two other Republicans who plan to oppose Bernanke 's renomination .
Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I. , Vt. ) has also said he opposes Bernanke 's renomination .
Despite this , Bernanke is widely expected to be approved by the Senate for a second term .
The Senate Banking Committee is scheduled to hold a confirmation vote on Bernanke Thursday morning .
A spokeswoman for the panel said there is no way for a member to delay Thursday 's vote .
Other Senate committees , like the Judiciary Committee , allow members to delay a vote by a week .
The logical political implications of this move are material : should Democrats be unable to maintain their majority hold after the upcoming mid-term elections , the populist tide against the Fed will be a substantial pent up force in 2011 .
How that would shape the org chart of the Fed subsequently is still unknown but it likely would not be in favor of the Man of the Year .

Decades ago on a characteristically arctic day here , a boy named Scott Rosenberg waited with his neighborhood pals as a certain Chevy Impala glided into view .
It contained the city ’s archbishop , and the boys , all of them Roman Catholic except for Scott , pelted the car with snowballs .
The archbishop braked and emerged to chastise his assailants .
To Scott , whom he correctly identified as Jewish , the prelate said simply , “ You call your rabbi . ”
Consider this a parable or a metaphor or just a piquant coincidence .
Consider it revealing that Shmarya Rosenberg , as Scott is now known , recalled the incident in a recent interview as one of his most enduring memories .
Because , lo , these years later , Mr. Rosenberg has made his name and earned equal measures of admiration and opprobrium for lobbing the digital version of snowballs at a great many rabbis .
Blogging on the site FailedMessiah.com , Mr. Rosenberg , 51 , has transmuted a combination of muckraking reporting and personal grudge into a must - read digest of the actual and alleged misdeeds of the ultra-Orthodox world .
He has broken news about sexual misconduct , smear campaigns and dubious business practices conducted by or on behalf of stringently religious Jews .

The US government has declared that greenhouse gases threaten human health .
The move could allow the US Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) to order cuts in emissions without the approval of Congress .
EPA administrator Lisa Jackson said the agency was now " authorised and obligated to make reasonable efforts " to cut greenhouse gases .
The news came as global climate talks got under way in Copenhagen aimed at forging a deal on major emissions cuts .
ANALYSIS Mark Mardell , BBC North America editor
The announcement had been expected for a while , but it is an important signal before President Obama travels to Copenhagen .
At the moment , legislation restricting carbon emissions is tied up in the Senate , where it faces stiff opposition , both from those who say restrictions will cost the United States in jobs and push up energy prices , and those who simply do not accept that climate change is real or man-made .
If the legislation is passed at all it will not be until next spring .
But this declaration raises the possibility , that if it is blocked , President Obama 's administration could simply impose new rules .
While that is not politically that likely , it is an important symbol to other leaders at the summit that he means business and wo n't be thwarted .
More from Mark Mardell
Ms Jackson said that the scientific evidence surrounding climate change clearly showed that greenhouse gases " threaten the public health and welfare of the American people " .
She said the EPA 's so - called endangerment finding would " cement 2009 's place in history as the year when the United States government began addressing the challenge of greenhouse - gas pollution " .
Reports suggest the announcement , which had been in the pipeline for months , was timed to add weight to US President Barack Obama 's position at the climate change talks in Copenhagen , allowing him to argue that the US is taking action to combat global warming .
However , the president 's preferred way of addressing greenhouse gas emissions is still through the legislative process , says the BBC 's environment correspondent Richard Black .
The president is said to favour a cap - and - trade bill backed by Senators Barbara Boxer and John Kerry which is currently making its way through the US Senate .
Our correspondent says a bill would give political backing to curbs on emissions .
HAVE YOUR SAY
I hope we will recognise the real cost of doing nothing is so much greater than the cost of taking action Bryant , Coeur d'Alene , US A secondary motive , he says , is that prevailing economic theory predicts cap - and - trade to be a more efficient way of reducing emissions .
That is because it uses a market mechanism , whereas acting through the EPA could mean mandating cuts .
Using cap - and - trade legislation as well as EPA mechanisms could in principle reduce US emissions more than the target it has put before the UN climate summit , our correspondent says .
And campaigners will be urging Mr Obama to pledge bigger cuts and use every power at his disposal .
However , while the House of Representatives already passed a cap - and - trade bill , progress through the Senate is not likely before March at the earliest .

In April this year , the EPA decided that carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases could endanger human health and well - being .
The decision was then sent out to public consultation , with people given 60 days - until 23 June - to respond .
An EPA spokeswoman told the BBC that the agency had received more than 300,000 comments and had been working on its response since .
Under a Supreme Court ruling , the EPA 's " endangerment finding " was needed to allow the agency to regulate carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases released by vehicles , power plants and factories under the federal Clean Air Act .

CT scans of Egyptian mummies , some as much as 3,500 years old , show evidence of atherosclerosis , or hardening of the arteries , which is normally thought of as a disease caused by modern lifestyles , researchers said Tuesday .
The study , presented at the American Heart Assn. meeting in Orlando , Fla. , was conceived by Dr. Gregory Thomas , a cardiologist at UC Irvine , after he read about Pharoah Merenptah at the Egyptian National Museum of Antiquities in Cairo .
When he died at age 60 in 1203 BC , Merenptah was plagued by atherosclerosis , arthritis and dental decay .
Thomas reasoned that some evidence of the atherosclerosis -- which is characterized by calcium in plaques -- might still be present .
He organized a team of cardiologists and Egyptologists who scanned a series of 20 mummies in the museum during a week in February .

Among the 16 mummies whose arteries or hearts could be identified , nine had calcification clearly seen in the arteries or in the path where the arteries should have been .
The disease was clearly age - related : Seven of the eight mummies who were older than 45 when they died had calcification , compared with only two of eight that were younger than 45 .
Men and women were affected equally .
The most ancient of the mummies afflicted with atherosclerosis was Lady Rai , who had been a nursemaid to Queen Ahmose Nefertiti .
She died at the age of 30 or 40 around 1530 BC , about 300 years prior to the time of Moses and 200 years before King Tut .
Other mummies that were examined died as recently as AD 364 .
All the mummies were of high social status .
“ We are observing the footprint of the same disease process in people who lived thousands of years ago , ” said coauthor Dr. Michael I. Miyamoto , a cardiologist at the UC San Diego School of Medicine .
“ Perhaps atherosclerosis is part of being human . ”

The study ’s results may mean scientists need to look beyond modern risk factors to fully understand what causes the condition , the researchers said .
Both groups , however , share some risk factors .
The high - status Egyptians ate a diet high in meat from cattle , ducks and geese , all fatty .
And because mechanical refrigeration was not available , salt -- another contributing factor in heart disease -- was widely used for food preservation .

December 27 , 2009 -- The Labour Party Pakistan has lost our four most brilliant comrades , Abdul Salam , Najma Khanum , Rehana Kausar and Wahid Baloch , in a road accident on December 13 near Ormara , Baloachistan .

Millions of dollars in donations and pledges were pouring in to Canadian aid agencies Thursday for disaster relief in earthquake - shattered Haiti — so much that their Web servers teetered on the brink of collapse .
The overwhelming response prompted the minister of national revenue to advise Canadians to make sure they donate wisely , and avoid getting scammed .
“ Canadians have opened their hearts and their wallets in the wake of the terrible tragedy in Haiti , ” Jean - Pierre Blackburn said at a news conference on Parliament Hill in Ottawa .
“ Sadly , there are some who would exploit the generosity of Canadians . ”
Blackburn said Canadians who wish to donate should check the Canada Revenue Agency website for information on how to be an informed donor .
Kieran Green of the Humanitarian Coalition , which includes Care Canada , Oxfam Canada , Oxfam Quebec and Save the Children , said the donations were “ quite literally overwhelming . ”
“ The company that does our online donations has said that they have already had a couple of servers go down from the volume of the response , ” Green said early Thursday .
“ Our phone centres are telling us that the volume of calls is massive , ” he said .
The servers were soon back up and the coalition was pleading with Canadians to keep trying , because the agencies need the money to help people in the earthquake - shattered country .
Doctors Without Borders reported the same massive response , with spokeswoman Avril Benoit tweeting on Twitter that they were “ white - knuckling it ” as the agency ’s website “ teeters from overload . ”
The group said it had to hire outside help to keep the server from crashing .
In a telephone interview with The Canadian Press from the earthquake ’s ground zero , Port - au - Prince , Red Cross worker Miriam Castaneda pleaded for more donations from Canadians .
“ We are trying to get the goods that are required , the items that are required for the provision of first aid , ” said Castaneda , who has been in Haiti with the agency since last September .
“ If Canadians can help we are encouraging them to support the Red Cross relief effort by donating cash , ” she said .
“ We need their help and all the assistance they can provide ...( for ) emergency shelter , food , water and other essentials here . ”
As of early Thursday afternoon , Canadian Red Cross spokeswoman Katie Kallio said the agency had collected $ 2.6 million in pledges and donations .
About $ 1 million of that came in within the first 24 hours .
“ Canadians are always generous in times of disaster and they ’re certainly showing their care and compassion once again , ” Kallio said .
World Vision , which launched social media campaigns on Facebook and Twitter , says the number of donations and pledges were 10 times the usual .
It said $ 1.4 million had been raised since the earthquake hit .
Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his wife Laureen made a donation to the Canadian Red Cross in Ottawa on Thursday afternoon .

By mid-afternoon , The Humanitarian Coalition said $ 600,000 had been pledged and donated , and the organization expected to reach $ 1 million by the end of the day .
That number did not include separate amounts pledged to the coalition members .
The federal government said it would match any donations made to registered charitable groups for the Haitian disaster from Jan. 12 to Feb. 12 , up to a maximum of $ 50 million .
Despite the outpouring of pledges and donations , the Red Cross ’s Kallio said such a major disaster would require yet more money to help up to three million Haitians — a third of the country ’s population — affected by the earthquake .
“ It ’s very important to note the needs on the ground right now are huge , and this outpouring of support will absolutely make a difference in the lives of survivors , but much more is needed , ” she said .
Other charitable groups launched campaigns as well .
The Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops and and the Canadian Catholic Organization for Development and Peace , as well as the United Church , donated funds and urged their church members to do the same .
The Salvation Army in Canada sent an immediate $ 100,000 and began a fundraising campaign .
Ted Menzies , parliamentary secretary to the minister of finance , said “ the fastest and most efficient way to get help to people in critical need is to donate money to experienced humanitarian organizations . ”
“ There are many charitable organizations that have personnel and equipment on the ground in Haiti already , ” he said .
“ These same organizations can deliver much needed humanitarian aid to that country immediately . ”
The Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade has compiled a guide designed to help the public avoid scams and ensure their donations are of maximum value .
It can be found online here .

If you use shared hosting then you may want to know how many websites are hosted on your server .
If there are too many websites hosted on your shared server then its not a good sign and you should switch to a better web host .
Reverse IP Lookup
We will use reverse IP lookup to determine all the websites hosted on a web server .
A web server is basically just like any other computer , except that it runs some server software like Apache , and serves web pages on request ( HTTP request ) .
Check the video below for details ,
A web server has a unique IP address .
So , to determine the list of websites hosted on a web server , we need to determine ,
1 . The IP address of the web server .
2 . Then we have to find all the websites hosted on that IP address .
1. Finding The IP Address of The Web Server
You can easily determine the IP address of the web server that hosts a website .
On Windows ,
Open command prompt ( Start > Run , Type cmd and press Enter )
Type ping sitename.com and press Enter .
You will instantly get the IP address of the web server that hosts sitename.com .
For instance , the image below shows how I determined the IP address of the web server that hosts Google.com .
Similarly you can find the IP address of the web server that hosts your website .
2. Find All Websites Hosted on an IP Address
Now that you have the IP address of the web server that hosts your website , you can easily determine all the websites hosted on this IP address using bing .
Type ip : IP - Address in the bing search box to get the list of websites hosted on the respective IP address .
Easy ?
Is n’t it .
Directly Get The List Of Neighboring Websites
The process of manual reverse IP lookup involves many steps , as explained above , and thus , takes time .
If you are in a hurry , you can use a neat online service provided by SpyThisSite .
Just go to Reverse IP Lookup Tool and enter the website ’s URL .
It will display all the websites hosted on same server automatically .

Dr Julian Finn of Museum Victoria takes it to a new level .
In the video you can see a Veined Octopus , Amphioctopus marginatus , showing sophisticated tool use behaviour , a coconut that he seems to use as a portable armour / hiding place and , using both halves , as a den
Consider this post the third part of a trilogy video about the incredible skills of the octopuses after the previous posts :
That Octopus is the most inteligent of the invertebrates is a well known fact but this footage provided by
Walking down the main street of Tamworth the other morning - gamely dodging yodelling couples in his ' n ' hers double denim begging for loose change - I passed a man wearing a rather fetching navy blue singlet .
Written on the front were the following words : " THIS IS AUSTRALIA .
WE EAT MEAT , DRINK BEER , AND SPEAK F- CKIN ' ENGLISH ! "
My first thought - outside of " I wonder if he 's single / looking ? " - was that it must mean January 26th was just around the corner .
Of course , I realised with a start : Australia Day is upon us .
Time for those racist t- shirts to be dusted off and paraded about by small - dicked rednecks .
There 's a lot to be said for being brave enough to stroll around town with an offensive slogan painted across one 's chestal parts .
While my singlet - wearing chum was clearly an inferior specimen to the morbidly obese man witnessed at the 2009 Big Day Out wearing a t - shirt that read DEAD GIRLS DON'T SAY NO , it was still a Herculean effort .
I took a photo of him to show my grandchildren ( " And this was right before Nanna was referred to as a ' muff - diving pinko ' and chased out of town with burning pitchforks " ) , I need n't have bothered - the entire range of " This Is Australia " clothing was for sale on the main drag .
I bought four shirts , including one for my best friend 's 18 - month - old , because while it 's obviously wrong for babies to wear sexy slogans about tits and copulation , patriotic racism can start at any age .
It 's an odd word , that - " patriot " - and these days mostly seems to signal only one thing : that whoever is yelling it into your face and slapping a hand proudly into their breastplate is possibly not very fond of coloured people .
When did that happen ?
When did it become acceptable for these types of citizens to speak on behalf of their fellow countrymen ?
When did they steal that particular word and hijack it for their own appalling devices ?
And more importantly , who 's dressing them ?
Long before a handful of excitable Alan Jones fans took a nice day out at Cronulla beach a little too far , the term " patriot " began being less a term of misty - eyed endearment and more like the sort of thing a footsoldier of White Australia might use as a pseudonym on an internet dating site .
Chin-jutty bullish types everywhere justified " F - ck Off We 're Full " t- shirts by claiming simple adoration of way of life was to blame .
" It 's alright mate , I love my country .
I'm a patriot " they 'd smilingly and patiently explain to anyone who dared challenge them .
Would it be acceptable to the public if these same people got about in a hat that read " I HATE CHINKS " or " STOP THE IMMIGRATION EXPLOSION : STAB AN INDIAN TODAY ? "
It really does start to seem increasingly possible , particularly if said clothing items were a ) " just a joke " , b ) worn on Australia Day , and / or c ) proudly paraded in the name of patriotism .
It 's become a dirty word , the sort used to disguise a panoply of offences , including race - related violence , scare campaigns , and the kind of jokes even Mahatma Coat might baulk at for being " a little bit too racist " .
Southern cross tattoos and " We Grew Here / You Flew Here " - type accessories are not merely a fashion statement , they 're a way of saying f-ck you to a society where the term " politically correct " is constantly - and incorrectly - equated with being humourless .
It may be frowned upon to burn the Australian flag , but wearing it as a cape whilst off one 's face on Bundy and dry is fine , apparently .
So is wrapping it around your head as a turban , pinning it around your tits as a boob tube , and writing " If You Don't Love It - Leave " underneath to deter pesky gatecrashers threatening your way of life ( said product advertised as follows on a shopping website : " A fantastic way to publically ( sic ) show your pride in our great country ... with ATTITUDE ! " ) .
It 's not racism , god forbid we call it that .
No , it 's patriotism , a thumb in the face of those fussy UnAustralian types , a way for true - blooded men and women to unite against a common enemy : fear .
And overall it's a great pity , as I am very fond of my country .
I like the people in it , I like the frank , robust way they speak .
I like the inimitable , flat , overcooked air of our childhood summers and the impetuous , heart - on - sleeve way in which neighbours rush to assist others in times of natural disaster .
But the last thing I 'm going to do on Australia Day is wave a flag or get some sort of idiotic boxing Kangaroo tattooed to my calf .
Because the very idea of national pride has been soiled by the t- shirt wearers who disguise hate in the name of allegiance .
And I do n't know if we 'll ever get it back .
Just curious if anyone has read anything like the article from Market Skeptics on the supposed 2010 food crisis .
http://www.marketskeptics.com/2009/12/2010-food-c…
It 's a very long article but in summary it states " There is overwhelming , undeniable evidence that the world will run out of food next year .
When this happens , the resulting triple digit food inflation will lead panicking central banks around the world to dump their foreign reserves to appreciate their currencies and lower the cost of food imports , causing the collapse of the dollar , the treasury market , derivative markets , and the global financial system .
The US will experience economic disintegration . "
Now obviously this is rather extreme opinion coming from the doomsayers .
But , I was wondering if anyone puts any weight in the potential to have some form of a food crisis ?
Jim Rogers has also said : " We 're still going to eat , probably ; we 're still going to wear clothes , probably .
Farmers cannot get loans for fertilizers right now .
So the supplies of everything are going to continue to be under pressure " and he talks about food inventories being down and agriculture being one of the best industries in the future .
Just wondering if anyone can find some valid statistics on inventories or can speak on the topic .
Thanks guys .
PARIS 
The neighbors do not like the Zero Zero bar , a graffiti- plastered dive on an otherwise sleepy stretch of Rue Amelot , in the 11th Arrondissement .
It is not so much the look of the place , they say , or any particular distaste for its youthful clientele .
It is the noise .
The neighbors have been known to pelt the Zero Zero ’s patrons with eggs and to dump water on their heads from balconies .
One man once attacked the revelers below his window with a garden hose .
“ It ’s insane ; the neighbors take us for crazy people , ” said Nicolas Dechambre , 26 , a co-owner and bartender at the bar .
The club has paid close to $ 12,000 in fines for street noise in the past year and a half , he said , and has been closed by the police for a cumulative period of nearly two months , the result of complaints from neighbors .
The scale and sophistication of the cyber attacks on Google Inc. and other large U.S. corporations by hackers in China is raising national security concerns that the Asian superpower is escalating its industrial espionage efforts on the Internet .
While the U.S. focus has been primarily on protecting military and state secrets from cyber spying , a new battle is being waged in which corporate computers and the valuable intellectual property they hold have become as much a target of foreign governments as those run by the Pentagon and the CIA .
“ This is a watershed moment in the cyber war , ” James Mulvenon , director of the Center for Intelligence Research and Analysis at Defense Group Inc. , a national - security firm , said Thursday .
“ Before , the Chinese were going after defense targets to modernize the country ’s military machine .
But these intrusions strike at the heart of the American innovation community . ”
The attacks on Google and several dozen other companies have alarmed government officials and lawmakers who warned that the U.S. may already be losing the battle to protect the nation ’s besieged cyber infrastructure .
“ The recent cyber intrusion that Google attributes to China is troubling and the U.S. government is looking into it , ” White House spokesman Nick Shapiro said Thursday .
Rep. Anna Eshoo ( D - Menlo Park ) , a senior member of the House Select Committee on Intelligence , called China a pervasive hacker .
“ This behavior is unacceptable .
We used to use the term ‘ highway robbery . ’
This is high - tech robbery . ”
The cost has been huge , according to a recent study by a congressional advisory panel , the U.S. - China Economic and Security Review Commission .
While it is hard to quantify the value of the intellectual property that is stolen by the Chinese each year -- because many businesses do not like to report getting hacked -- Dan Slane , chairman of the commission , estimated it was in the hundreds of billions of dollars .
Hacker strategy
Alan Paller , director of research at the SANS Institute , a Bethesda , Md. , security firm , said Chinese hackers target Western companies with an approach dubbed “ 1,000 grains of sand , ” meaning they go after every piece of information in search of competitive intelligence .
Most companies keep silent about the attacks , but they draw heavy scrutiny from law enforcement officials .
“ The odds of the 25 biggest companies in California not being fully compromised by the Chinese is near zero , ” Paller said .
“ That is true of companies across the country . ”
China defended its Internet policies at a news conference Thursday .
Jiang
Yu , spokeswoman for China ’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs , said China ’s Internet is open and welcomes foreign companies .
She also said Chinese law prohibits hacker attacks but declined to say whether the Chinese government is bound by the law .
Google on Tuesday revealed that it had fallen prey to a series of cyber attacks originating from China .
The Mountain View , Calif. , Internet giant said it believed the attackers wanted access to the e-mail accounts of Chinese human rights activists .
But the incursions , which also included theft of intellectual property , raised the possibility that the hackers were also attempting economic espionage .
Google took the bold stance of making the attacks public , catching the Chinese government off guard .
The company ’s defiance of the world ’s most populous country stunned observers .
It also prompted questions about the scope and nature of the attacks .
“ For a big multinational company to consider leaving a critical market means the overall damage to its operation and assets is likely to be greater than the benefits , ” said Oded Shenkar , a professor of business management at Ohio State University and the author of “ The Chinese Century . ”
“ Google is not only making a human rights statement ; my educated guess is that there is much more to it than that . ”
It is unclear exactly where the attacks came from , and Google was careful not to directly accuse the Chinese government of orchestrating them .
But Chinese cyber spying has been a persistent problem for years with dozens of attacks on commercial , government and military targets , analysts say .
A growing menace
The attacks against the U.S. are ramping up , according to the congressional U.S. - China commission , which noted in October that Chinese espionage was “ straining the U.S. capacity to respond . ”
The report focused on an attack on one company , concluding that it was supported and possibly choreographed by the Chinese government .
The report also alleged that China ’s military , the People ’s Liberation Army , is responsible for aspects of cyber spying and has created cyber warfare units .
McAfee Labs , which has analyzed the attacks on Google and other companies , said Thursday that the hackers had deployed highly sophisticated “ advanced persistent threats ” that in the past were primarily used against governments .
The attacks targeted individuals with known access to valuable corporate information .
Google may have been particularly vulnerable because all of its technology is online and networked , said Marc Rotenberg , executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center .
On Wednesday , Google said it would improve security for Gmail users by encrypting data to its servers .
Such steps are crucial for Google , whose business hinges on its ability to protect its users ’ privacy and maintain their trust , said Collins Stewart analyst Sandeep Aggarwal .
“ Commercial organizations can rarely defend themselves against sophisticated government attacks , ” said Phil Lieberman , chief executive of Lieberman Software , a Los Angeles security software firm .
Last week , a Santa Barbara software maker filed a $ 2.2 - billion lawsuit against the Chinese government and several Chinese technology firms , accusing them of conspiring to steal and disseminate the U.S. firm ’s Internet filtering technology .
The Los Angeles law firm representing Cybersitter in the lawsuit said Thursday that it was besieged by similar cyber attacks originating in China .
On Monday evening its lawyers began receiving 10 different Trojan horse e-mails designed to retrieve information from its computers , said Gregory Fayer , an attorney at Gipson Hoffman & Pancione .
The law firm has turned over the e-mails to the FBI , which is investigating , Fayer said .
After Google ’s announcement , Adobe Systems Inc. and Rackspace Hosting Inc. also reported attacks .
A national priority
Early last year , President Obama identified protecting computer networks in the private and public sectors as a national security priority .
But bureaucratic infighting among law enforcement and intelligence agencies and disagreements with business interests about the role of government in controlling the Internet delayed naming a White House cyber - security “ czar . ”
In December , Obama appointed Howard Schmidt , a former chief security executive at Microsoft with 31 years ’ experience in law enforcement and the military , to the post .
How to protect the nation ’s cyber infrastructure , largely in private sector hands , from alleged state - sponsored attacks has become a matter of intensifying debate in Washington , analysts say .
The U.S. has no formal policy for dealing with such attacks .
Renewed attention could help shape policy and smooth passage of legislation , analysts said .
“ This highlights a core dilemma for the U.S. cyber strategy , ” Mulvenon said .
“ What can the U.S. government do to defend Google ?
Really not very much . ”

Times staff writer W.J. Hennigan contributed to this report .
The Rachel Maddow Show 's video site summed this one up as well as I could ever hope to .
Rachel Maddow holds Dick Cheney and Republican opportunists to account for their shameless hypocrisy , distortions and outright lies in criticizing President Obama 's response to the attempted bombing of Flight 253 in the face of their abject , egregious failures to deal with terrorists threats to the United States when they were in power .
She also took at whack at her cohorts in the mainstream media for whether they want to act like journalists and fact check the B.S. that 's being fed to them instead of just repeating it , or do their jobs .
This was truly one of Rachel 's finer moments on television .
I do n't expect either of the Cheney 's or any of the other hacks politicizing this terrorism debate to be coming on her show any time soon .
Keep giving them hell Rachel .
Now , as is often the case in politics , when attacks from one side go unanswered for a long time , when one side gets the platform all to themselves , that side can sometimes get over - exuberant .
They can overplay their hand .
Republicans , left to their own devices , have in this case excitedly launched a series of obviously baseless , factually incorrect , demonstrably untrue and hypocritical attacks .
After five days of Republicans owning the airwaves on this issue , doubling and then tripling down on politicizing this thwarted terrorist attack , with almost no opposition from the Democrats , the maestro of terror politics , Mr. Cheney , gave a statement to Politico.com today .
Not decrying the terrorist incident itself , but instead using that attack as an opportunity to bash the president , to accuse the president of not keeping America safe .
MADDOW : After days of essentially unanswered Republican political attacks against the Obama administration , finally , today , we got the big kahuna .
The white whale of Republican politics , former Vice President Richard Bruce Cheney , involved in this .
Dick Cheney`s comments today probably the worst among them .
He said , quote , " He seems to think if he gives terrorists the rights of Americans , lets them lawyer up and reads them their Miranda rights , we won`t be at war . "
Remember Richard Reid , the so - called " shoe bomber " ?
Richard Reid was arrested December 2001 , when a man named Dick Cheney was vice president .
The Bush Justice Department let him , as they say , " lawyer up , " and Mr. Reid later pled guilty in federal court .
Remember 9/11 co-conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui ?
Same deal .
Given American rights , tried in the federal courts and convicted , all while a man named Dick Cheney was vice president .
What President Obama is doing right now with this case is the same thing that was done with the same type of cases while Dick Cheney was vice president .
But Dick Cheney isn`t letting anything like that hold him back , saying , quote , " Why doesn`t he want to admit we`re at war ?
President Obama`s first object and his highest responsibility must be to defend us against an enemy that knows we are at war . "
According to Dick Cheney , see , this has to be seen as a military issue .
This has to be seen as a war .
This can`t be seen as law enforcement .
This is something -- according to Dick Cheney -- this is something that you handle with the Department of Defense , right ?

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE REPORTER : Mr. Secretary , do you have any insights you can share with us about Richard Reid , the American Airlines shoe bomber ?
DONALD RUMSFELD , THEN - U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE :
That`s a matter that`s in the hands of the law enforcement people and not the Department of Defense .
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE REPORTER : Nothing you can share ?
RUMSFELD : And I don`t have anything I would want to add .

MADDOW : Where was Dick Cheney and his outrage when his administration was treating terrorism as a law enforcement issue ?
But , wait , there`s more .
Quote , " He seems to think if he closes Guantanamo and releases the hard - core al Qaeda - trained terrorists still there , we won`t be at war . "
Like , for example , do you mean the Guantanamo prisoners your administration released to go to Saudi Arabia to be put in art therapy ?
The guys who then became leaders of the al Qaeda chapter in Yemen that is reportedly behind the plot to blow up that flight on Christmas Day ?
Did Mr. Cheney think that we weren`t at war when that decision was made by his administration ?
Where was his outrage over his own decision then ?
We`re hearing over and over and over again from Republicans how President Obama waited too long to comment on the Christmas bombing .

REP .
PETER KING ( R ) , NEW YORK : Disappointed it`s taken the president 72 hours to even address this issue .
REP .
PETE HOEKSTRA ( R ) , MICHIGAN :
The president has decided to stay silent for 72 hours .
That -- he needs to explain that .
KARL ROVE , FMR .
BUSH WHITE HOUSE ADVISOR : It`s over 72 hours from the time from the incident until the time the president spoke today .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
MADDOW : Seventy - two hours .
How could President Obama possibly wait so long to comment ?
For the record , after the Richard Reid shoe bombing incident in 2001 , President Bush was not seen or heard from for six days .
Count `em , six days .
Like President Obama , Mr. Bush was on vacation at the time of that incident .
He apparently did not see fit to comment on the situation until almost a full week after it happened .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
GEORGE W. BUSH , THEN - U.S. PRESIDENT :
The shoe bomber was a case in point where the country has been on alert .
I`m grateful for the flight attendant`s response , as I`m sure the passengers on that airplane , but we`ve got to be aware that there are still enemies to the country .
And our government is responding accordingly .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
MADDOW : Where was the Republican criticism of President Bush back then , for taking so long to make those comments ?
Perhaps President Bush dodged criticism on matters of terrorism , because of the language he used to talk about the war on terror .
Remember , smoke `em out of their caves , bring `em on .
That was the type of language that President Bush chose to use when talking about terrorism .
Mr. Obama does it differently .
He has a distinctly non-cowboy rhetorical approach to this issue .
And that is one of the things that`s also most rankling Republicans right now .

SEN .
JIM DEMINT ( R ) , SOUTH CAROLINA :
The important thing now , Harry , is that the president has downplayed the threat of terrorists since he took office .
He doesn`t even use the word anymore .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
MADDOW : He doesn`t even use the word anymore .
That is true , only in Jim DeMint`s mind .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
BARACK OBAMA , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES : Terror and extremism that threatens the world`s stability .
Extremists sowing terror in pockets of the world .
Suffering and civil wars that breed instability and terror .
New acts of terror .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
MADDOW : He never says the word " terror . "
Why let a 30 - second Google search get in the way of your good sound bite , Senator ?
But , you know , Senator DeMint is doing the country a service here -- at least by clarifying things , by getting at the core of the conservative attack on President Obama .
It was the whole point of Dick Cheney`s opportunistic statement today .
The whole point was that President Obama ought to talk more about war .
Vice President Cheney said , quote , " He seems to think if he gets rid of the words " war on terror , " we won`t be at war .
Why doesn`t he want to admit we`re at war ? "
Keep in mind -- this is coming from the former vice president of the administration whose record of talking about war includes dandies like these .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
BUSH : Thanks to the United States and our fine allies .
Afghanistan is no longer a haven for terror .
The Taliban is history .
And the Afghan people are free !
Major combat operations in Iraq have ended .
In the battle of Iraq , the United States and our allies have prevailed .
DICK CHENEY , THEN - U.S. VICE PRESIDENT : I think they`re in the last throes , if you will , of the insurgency .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
MADDOW : You know , talking about war incessantly , beating your chest about it , acting like a cowboy , making premature declarations of victory over and over and over again might feel good , but those things don`t actually translate into effectively waging war , Mr. Chatty Cathy former vice president .
For the most part , Democrats are letting these charges from Dick Cheney and the rest of the Republicans go unanswered , even though these are charges that collapse very quickly in the face of even rudimentary fact - checking .
But even if you step back from the specific , ridiculous claims that they are making , consider what Republicans are trying to do here .
Republicans apparently think they can survive the fact - checking problems they will have here if anybody ever decides to look into these things they`re saying .
They think they can survive the fact - checking because they imagine they have this transcendent credibility on national security matters .
A credibility on national security that , what , transcends the facts of their record ?
The Bush / Cheney administration created the terror watch list system that theoretically should have flagged the Christmas bomber this past Friday .
As has been noted , this is a list that has more than 500,000 names on it .
That`s handy .
It`s a list that`s full of so much noise , so much useless , incoherent junk that random people like the late Senator Ted Kennedy and the former Alaska Senator Ted Stevens` wife would get hassled at airports all the time because of their position on the list , even though that list could not function properly to keep actual terrorists off of actual planes .
That`s their list .
It hasn`t been changed since then .
Maybe the problem is that we haven`t cleaned up after the Bush / Cheney administration fast enough .
The Bush - Cheney administration is , inconveniently enough , also on whose watch 9/11 happened -- unless , of course , you ask them about that .

DANA PERINO , FMR .
BUSH PRESS SECRETARY :
You know , we did not have a terrorist attack on our country during President Bush`s term .
MARY MATALIN , FMR .
BUSH ASSISTANT : I was there .
We inherited a recession from President Clinton and we inherited the most tragic attack on our own soil in our nation`s history .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
MADDOW : Yes , remember how no terrorist attacks happened when Bush and Cheney were in office ?
Remember when the nation inherited 9/11 from that incompetent Democratic administration that was in place in September in 2001 -- in the Bush administration`s own minds ?
The rallying cry now from Republicans is that we shouldn`t try the Christmas bomber in civilian court -- that , instead , he should be tried in a military tribunal , declared an enemy combatant .
I mean , what`s the value of a military tribunal here , other than trying to make political hay out of this case ?
Really , what`s the justice , anti-terrorist , counterterrorist value on this ?
You really think this kid can`t be convicted ?
You really think we don`t have enough evidence beyond the -- beyond the , I don`t know , 300 or so eyewitnesses who were on the plane ?
The fact that we have the weapon that he tried to use ?
The fact that he confessed ?
You think that`s not enough to get this kid convicted ?
You have that little faith in our criminal justice system ?
That little faith in the rule of law ?
You don`t believe that a supermax federal American prison is capable of holding this kid ?
You think it might be cool , instead , to martyr this kid as some impressive soldier , instead of some idiot confused rich kid who couldn`t even handle blowing up his own junk with a bomb that was secreted in his own underpants ?
We`re supposed to take national security advice from you guys ?
Really ?
Republican Congressman Pete Hoekstra is still the captain of the team on this one , now raising money off of a terrorist attack on Americans , the attempted murder of 300 Americans -- politicizing this issue by soliciting campaign donations for his run for governor of Michigan on the occasion of this terrorist attack .
We contacted Pete Hoekstra`s campaign today .
They told us , we should expect to see more of this type of exploitive solicitation from them .
They told us that Congressman Hoekstra himself personally signed of on the " using a terrorist attack on Americans to raise money " effort , proudly saying they think they`ve gotten a significant spike in donations as a result of it .
Though it`s too early to tell , fingers crossed , maybe something else horrible will happen .
This is the Republican response to this terrorist attack at the end of 2009 .
Again , my friends and colleagues in the media have two choices in covering this .
You can just copy down what the Republicans and Vice President Cheney are saying , and click " send , " call it journalism , or you can actually fact - check those comments and put them into context .
Your choice .
It `s your country .
Click image to view the data related to the US air campaign in Pakistan .
Note :
This is an updated analysis of the US air campaign in Pakistan .
The first look at the data was published on July 21 , 2009 ; the second report was published on Oct. 1 , 2009 .
One new chart , “ Number of Strikes , Per Month , ” has been added .
The US air campaign in Pakistan ’s tribal areas remains the cornerstone of the effort to root out and decapitate the senior leadership of al Qaeda , the Taliban , and other allied terror groups , and to disrupt both al Qaeda ’s global and local operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
As expected , in 2009 the US well exceeded the number of attacks in 2008 , with 53 compared to 36 .
And with two strikes in the first four days of 2010 , one can expect the intensity of the campaign this year to equal or exceed last year ’s pace .
Although 16 senior al Qaeda and Taliban leaders have been killed since the air campaign heated up in 2008 , the terror groups remain a force in both Afghanistan and Pakistan .
The US has been compelled to surge forces in Afghanistan and revamp its strategy there , while the Pakistani military has been forced to launch military operations in Swat and South Waziristan .
Despite some tactical victories by the Pakistani military in Pakistan , the Taliban and its allies are able to carry out suicide attacks and complex assaults on secure military and government targets with regularity .
Al Qaeda ’s external operations network , which is assigned to carrying out attacks outside Afghanistan and Pakistan , has been a prime target of US airstrikes ; three external operations chiefs have been killed since May 2008 .
The US air campaign highlights the Pakistani government ’s inability to control its own territory and prevent it from becoming a safe haven for al Qaeda , the Taliban , and a host of South Asian jihadi terror groups .
The US is forced to conduct airstrikes in territories claimed by a nuclear power that is touted as an ally in the Long War .
Frequency of US strikes in 2009 outpaced 2008
The US has maintained the pressure on al Qaeda and the Taliban in Pakistan ’s tribal areas since August 2008 .
The attack tempo has remained high relative to the number of attacks carried out from June 2004 through July 2008 .
Since the first recorded strike in June of 2004 , which killed Taliban commander Nek Mohammed , until the end of 2009 , there have been 99 US strikes inside Pakistan .
There also have been two strikes so far this year .
Beginning in August 2008 , the US began stepping up strikes against Taliban and al Qaeda elements in the tribal agencies .
There were 28 airstrikes in the tribal agencies between August and December 2008 – nearly three times the total number of airstrikes in the previous four years combined .
There was one recorded strike in 2004 , one in 2005 , three in 2006 , and five in 2007 .
[ see Chart 1 , “ Number of US airstrikes inside Pakistan ” ]
There was a 47 percent increase in attacks from 2008 to 2009 .
In 2009 , the number of US strikes exceeded the prior five years combined ; there were 46 recorded strikes in Pakistan from 2004 - 2008 , compared to 53 strikes in 2009 .
[ see Chart 2 , “ Frequency of US strikes in Pakistan , 2008 vs. 2009 ” ]
Lethality of strikes
The lethality of Predator strikes inside the tribal agencies also increased slightly during 2009 .
Using low - end estimates of casualties ( including Taliban , al Qaeda , and civilian ) , the airstrikes in 2009 resulted in 506 killed .
In 2008 , there were 317 deaths reported .
[ see Chart 3 , “ Deaths in Pakistan from Predator strikes , 2008 vs. 2009 ” ]
Another indicator of the increasing lethality of US airstrikes inside Pakistan is the slight rise in the average number of people killed per attack .
In 2009 , the average casualty rate was 9.65 killed per strike , compared to 8.81 in 2008 .
Civilian casualties continue to decrease in 2009
Despite the sharp increase in both the frequency and total number of casualties resulting from Predator strikes since mid-2008 , civilian casualties have remained relatively low .
Naturally , it is difficult to determine the exact number of civilians killed in Predator strikes for many reasons – including intentional exaggeration by Taliban spokesmen , and vague accounts by Pakistani media sources which frequently report that a certain number of “ people ” were killed in a strike , but rarely offer a follow - up report identifying which victims were civilians and which were militants .
However , it is possible to get a rough estimate of civilian casualties by adding up the number of civilians reported killed from the media accounts of each attack .
According to this method , a total of 94 civilians were reported killed as a result of all strikes between 2006 and 2009 .
[ see chart 4 , “ Casualties from Predator strikes inside Pakistan : Civilian vs. Taliban / Al Qaeda ” ]
Considering that drone strikes have resulted in 985 total casualties during that same time period , our numbers show that only 9.5 percent of the casualties reported have been identified as civilians .
And the incidence of civilian casualties appears to be trending downward ; during 2009 , only 8.5 percent of the reported casualties were identified as civilians .
While our number is undoubtedly a low estimate , this extremely small percentage suggests that the accuracy and precision of these strikes have improved along with the increased pace of these strikes over the past few years .
Locations of strikes
As it has in the past , the US air campaign in Pakistan has continued to focus almost exclusively on the tribal agencies of North and South Waziristan .
The total number of strikes in North Waziristan has surpassed the total number of strikes in South Waziristan for the first time .
Of the total of 101 strikes in Pakistan through 2010 , 91 strikes , or 90 percent , have struck targets in North Waziristan ( 48 strikes ) and South Waziristan ( 43 strikes ) .
This trend has only increased after the US branched out and struck several targets outside those two tribal agencies during the fall of 2008 and winter of 2009 .
Since the April 1 , 2009 , strike in Arakzai , all of the subsequent strikes have been in North and South Waziristan .
[ see chart 5 , “ Location of airstrikes inside Pakistan , by district ” ]
The vast majority of the US attacks inside Pakistan have focused on areas under the control of five influential leaders .
[ see chart 6 , “ Number of airstrikes in territories of various Taliban factions ” ]
The tribal areas run by the Haqqani Network have become the primary focus of US operations .
Twenty - five percent of the attacks ( 25 attacks total ) have taken place in the tribal areas run by the Haqqani Network .
Ten of the last 15 strikes in 2009 took place in Haqqani Network territory .
The next hardest - hit group is the Movement of the Taliban in Pakistan , in the Mehsud tribal areas .
Twenty - one strikes ( 21 percent ) have taken place there since the campaign began in 2004 .
Since Baitullah Mehsud ’s death during a strike in August of 2009 , Waliur Rehman Mehsud has taken control of Baitullah ’s territories in South Waziristan , and Hakeemullah Mehsud has taken command of the overall Movement of the Taliban in Pakistan , which stretches into the tribal areas and the greater northwest .
Attacks there tapered off dramatically with Baitullah ’s death and the onset of a Pakistani military operation in October .
The territories of South Waziristan Taliban chieftain Mullah Nazir have been hit 20 times ( 20 percent ) .
North Waziristan leaders Abu Kasha al Iraqi ( 13 strikes ) and Hafiz Gul Bahadar ( six strikes ) round out the list of the top five targeted commanders .
In all , nearly 79 percent of the strikes targeted the territories of these five tribal leaders .
High Value Targets killed
Since January 2008 , the US strikes in Pakistan have killed 15 senior al Qaeda leaders and one senior Taliban leader .
Eight were killed in 2008 ( Abdullah Azzam al Saudi , Abu Zubair al Masri , Abu Jihad al Masri , Khalid Habib , Abu Haris , Abu Khabab al Masri , Abu Sulayman Jazairi , and Abu Laith al Libi ) ; and six were killed in 2009 ( Zuhaib al Zahib , Saleh al Somali , Najmuddin Jalolov , Mustafa al Jaziri , Tahir Yuldashev , Baitullah Mehsud , Osama al Kini , and Sheikh Ahmed Salim Swedan ) .
In addition , 16 mid-level al Qaeda and Taliban commanders and operatives have been killed since January 2008 .
[ see list of al Qaeda and Taliban leaders killed since 2004 , below ]
The highest number of senior and mid-level al Qaeda and Taliban leaders killed by airstrikes is found in territories controlled by Mullah Nazir ( 26 percent ) .
The Pakistani government and the military have held up Nazir as a “ pro-government Taliban leader ” after he feuded with Uzbek fighters from the Islamic Jihad Union .
But Nazir has repeatedly professed his loyalty to Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar .
[ see chart 7 , “ Number of HVTs killed in territories of various Taliban factions ” ]
Abu Kasha al Iraqi continues to have a disproportionate number of senior leaders killed in his territories ; while his strongholds have been hit only 13 times , eight high - value targets ( 23 percent ) have been killed there .
The same goes for Bajaur ’s Faqir Mohammad : two senior leaders have been killed during the three strikes in his territories .
Conversely , a high number of strikes in a leader ’s territory does not mean a higher percentage of HTVs killed there .
Baitullah Mehsud ’s territory was hit 21 times , but only eight HVTs were killed there .
The Haqqani Network , which has been hit the hardest , has yielded only seven HVTs killed .
Also , the US thought it killed Ilyas Kashmiri , the operations commander of the Harakat - ul - Jihad - Islami and al Qaeda ’s Brigade 313 .
But Kashmiri later resurfaced and conducted an interview with the press .
Purpose of strikes
Much of the media ’s reporting on the air campaign continues to focus on the deaths of senior al Qaeda leaders .
But the campaign has more than one objective .
Certainly the US is targeting al Qaeda ’s senior leadership in an effort to disrupt the overall command and control of the terror group , but the attacks are also aimed at hitting al Qaeda ’s external operations network and disrupting the Taliban ’s operations in both Afghanistan and in Pakistan .
First and foremost , the primary objective of the air campaign has been to disrupt al Qaeda ’s external network and prevent the group from striking at the US and her allies .
The campaign has targeted camps known to house foreigners as well as trainers and leaders for the network .
Al Qaeda operatives known to have lived in the West and holding foreign passports have been killed in several Predator strikes .
One such strike on an al Qaeda camp in South Waziristan on Aug. 30 , 2008 , killed two Canadian passport holders as they trained in the camp .
Also , since May 14 , 2008 , the US has killed three of the leaders of al Qaeda ’s external operations branch : Abu Sulayman Jazairi , Osama al Kini , and Saleh al Somali .
Another major objective has been to disrupt the Taliban and al Qaeda ’s operations in Afghanistan .
The Taliban in Afghanistan receive significant support from within Pakistan .
Taliban groups that are very active against Coalition forces in Afghanistan , such as the Haqqani Network , the Mehsud Taliban , and Mullah Nazir , have flourished in Pakistan ’s lawless tribal areas .
The US has targeted both Taliban leaders and fighters during these strikes .
The Haqqani Network , for instance , is the most heavily targeted group because it both conducts operations in Afghanistan and harbors al Qaeda leaders in Pakistan .
Several large Taliban training camps that are known to train fighters for the Afghan front have been the targets of attack .
For instance , a training camp in Kurram operated by an Afghan Taliban commander was hit on Feb. 16 , 2009 .
Also , the US killed Zuhaib al Zahib , a senior commander in the Lashkar al Zil , al Qaeda ’s Shadow Army , during a strike in December 2009 .
The Lashkar al Zil is al Qaeda ’s military unit that partners with the Taliban on both sides of the border .
Along with targeting al Qaeda ’s external operations network and the Taliban ’s Afghan operations in Pakistan , the US has also targeted Pakistani Taliban commanders who threaten the stability of the Pakistani state .
The US hunted Baitullah Mehsud for a year before killing him in a strike in early August of 2009 .
Several of Baitullah ’s deputies have also been killed this past year .
The US has an interest in preventing nuclear Pakistan from becoming a failed state and also needs to keep its supply lines open through Pakistan and into Afghanistan .
More than 70 percent of the US and NATO supplies travel through Pakistan ’s northwest .

In the fall of 2008 , when the worldwide economy began to melt , Google responded by shamelessly expanding ad coverage on its web - dominating search engine , letting more ads onto more pages .
But now that the economy has recovered , the web giant has suddenly become more much vigilant in its efforts to weed out what it considers low - quality advertising .
According to new data from AdGooRoo - a search marketing consultant that tracks search ads from a network of servers across the globe - Google permanently banned 30,000 accounts from its AdWords ad system at the beginning of December .
That 's roughly 5.3 per cent of its active advertisers .
Ad coverage dipped nearly 10 per cent in the wake of the mass axing , and yet AdGooRoo 's data indicates that Google 's revenues surged in the fourth quarter , thanks to increased competition for placement among the web 's top ad spenders .
In other words , when the economy was in the tank , Google needed all the extra revenue it could get .
But now that the economy is healthy again , it can step up efforts up to remove what it sees as inappropriate ads .
The big boys are spending more , so it does n't need as many clicks to boost the bottom line .
What 's more , by shrinking ad coverage , Google can actually drive more traffic to the big spenders .
If you cut 30,000 advertisers , those still on the search engine get more clicks - and the more clicks , the more those big spenders pay .
Google announces its fourth quarter financials next week , and AdGooRoo data is typically a reliable indicator of what 's to come .
" Our ad coverage metric confirms that something big went down at the Googleplex last month .
Ad coverage , which has been steadily climbing for the past 12 months took a sudden and precipitous dive in December , " reads the firms latest search - ad report , due out on Monday .
" Ordinarily , this would foreshadow a weak quarter , but we believe that this small drop will be more than offset by strong ad revenues . "
Two years ago , in January 2008 , Google famously began an effort to shrink ad coverage on the world 's most popular search engine .
This continued through the middle of 2008 , and when the subject came up during Google 's quarterly earnings call that July , senior vice president Jonathan Rosenberg attributed the shrinkage to Google 's " continued focus on quality " advertising .
" [ Google co-founder ] Larry [ Page ] says we'd be better off showing just one ad [ per page ] - the perfect ad , " Rosenberg said , indicating that coverage would continue to shrink .
But then he was interrupted by Google 's other co-founder , Sergey Brin , who piped up with what can only be described as a shocking moment of candor .
" There is some evidence that we 've been a little bit more aggressive in decreasing coverage than we ought to have been , " Brin said .
" We 've been reexamining some of that . "
The economy was softening , and sure enough , coverage soon began to expand .
According to AdGooRoo 's numbers , Google 's search engine showed 57 per cent more ads per page in the fourth quarter of 2008 than it did in Q3 , as the economy imploded following the infamous demise of Wall Street stalwarts Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch .
Google had made significant changes to AdWords that fall , and naturally it said this would also improve ad " quality . "
So , whether Google is shrinking ad coverage or expanding it , the only aim to provide the world with better ads .
But surely it 's obvious that Google is dialing up and down as the economy rises and falls .
And now that the economy is on the rise again , the company has renewed efforts to crack down on ads it does n't like .
Google started banning advertisers en masse in early October - just as it was about to announce that the economic meltdown was over - and this house - cleaning came to head on December 3 .
The official line is what you 'd expect from the Mountain View Chocolate Factory .
" Google is constantly working to ensure that we ’re showing ads to our users that are relevant , in accordance with our ad policies , and safe for users .
To that end , we perform regular reviews , using both manual and automated processes , in order to detect and disable ads that violate our policies , " it told Search Engine Land .
But surely , the timing is no coincidence . ®
What do you think of the nickname “ Murder ? ”
Would it influence you as a juror in a murder trial ?
How about “ Savage Viking ” or “ Extreme ? ”
The US Second Circuit Court of Appeals recently reversed an attempted murder conviction for a US gang member , citing what it called the prosecution ’s “ gratuitous exploitation ” of the defendant ’s nickname , “ Murder . ”
Now lawyers for two former Blackwater guards want to mount the same defense .

Lawyers for two of five Blackwater guards charged in the shooting deaths of 17 Iraqi civilians , killed in a shootout in September 2007 , want their clients ’ nicknames stricken from use by prosecutors .
Their nicknames , according to the lawyers ’ motion , are “ Savage Viking ” and “ Extreme . ”
The lawyers want the nicknames for their clients — Dustin Heard ( “ Extreme ” ) and Paul Slough ( “ Savage Viking ” ) barred from use by government prosecutors .
“ A jury who hears evidence of these nicknames is very likely to unfairly and improperly infer that the nicknames reflect violent or belligerent character traits on the part of these defendants that makes them more likely to have committed the crimes with which they are charged , ” defense lawyer David Schertler said , according to the law blog for Legal Times .
Schertler ’s motion is here .
The Justice Department has n’t yet replied .

“ In October , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit reversed an attempted murder conviction because of the prosecution ’s ‘ gratuitous exploitation ’ of the defendant ’s nickname ‘ Murder , ' ” Legal Times notes .
“ The court , which affirmed on other counts , including murder , ordered a new trial on the attempted murder charge . ”
Blackwater , a defense contractor involved in guarding US diplomats and others in Iraq , recently changed its name to Xe after a series of scandals .
Correction : Due to a reporting error , the nickname “ Murder ” was used by a gang member in the United States , not a Blackwater guard .
It has been corrected in this edition .
People who really , really love chocolate are dubious about cocoa .
Even if you buy the most resplendent cocoa in the world , baking things with it that taste as rich as treats with bars of 70 % is a rarity .
Thus , if you ’d told me about a killer recipe for cocoa brownies a couple weeks ago , I would n’t have believed you , but since then , two things have happened .
The first is that I had one .
It was a tiny square , scattered among little tears of homemade marshmallows , near a puddle of homemade hot fudge sauce and carousel - ed around a cocoa nib buckwheat panna cotta at 10 Downing last week that nothing short of blew my mind because did you know that the opposite of sweet in the world of chocolate need n’t necessarily be bitter ?
Sometimes it ’s just not very sweet , period , so you can really taste the chocolate .
It was awesome * , all of it .
The second is that I looked up a well - regarded cocoa brownie recipe and the description did me in .
Here cocoa is not listed as a compromise — something to use just because might already have in your pantry , something shelf - stable for a brownie mix longevity , etc. — but as an intention .
For the “ chewiest , candylike top ” , the only fat in Medrich ’s brownie is from butter , not a mix of butter and the cocoa butter that comes in bar chocolate and all of the sugar is pure granulated sugar , and not a mix of it and the milled sugar used in commercial chocolate production .
I had never considered either thing before , but there I was nodding along , eagerly agreeing .
The result is something that could convert those that believe the all roads to fudgy , dark and rich brownies must be paved bricks of tempered chocolate .
And now I ’m going to say something that will surely make a good lot of you turn away from this recipe and never look back , although you should n’t : I believe these brownies will be especially beloved by people who enjoy box mix brownies .
They share a moist , dense crumb , though fortunately — for me at least , who finds the taste of boxed brownies to staggeringly lack — not a flavor .
Because the only wet ingredients are eggs , butter and vanilla ( and the vanilla could be swapped with a scrape of a fresh bean segment rubbed into sugar ) , they ’d also be ripe for a Homemade Brownie Mix Gift Kit .
You know , if you were feeling generous enough to share , which may not be your first reaction .
* Speaking of “ awesome ” .

I have no brownie loyalty , and frankly , if I did , how would I ever discover new recipes like this ? ]

Port - au - Prince , Haiti ( CNN ) -- Israeli rescuers pulled a 22 - year - old man from the ruins of a three - story building on Friday , 10 days after the massive earthquake killed tens of thousands of people .
The man , who was not immediately identified , was rescued near the quake - ravaged presidential residence south of the capital , according to the Israel Defense Forces .
Maj .
Zohar Moshe said American and French doctors asked for the Israeli team 's assistance after trying to rescue the trapped man themselves .
The rescuers " were able to release him whole and healthy " and take him to an IDF field hospital in stable condition for further treatment , " he said .
Rescuers continue efforts to find survivors who have defied the odds , including a 7 - year - old boy and 11 - year - old girl who were found Tuesday .
Another 5 - year - old boy , Monley , was pulled alive from rubble nearly eight days after the 7.0 - magnitude quake had leveled much of Port - au - Prince .
More than 121 people have been pulled alive from the rubble , the United Nations said this week .
Fires are expected to flare up in the quake 's aftermath , from broken mains and other damage .
A massive blaze consumed a textile factory in Port - au - Prince Friday night as U.N. workers tried to contain the flames and spare nearby buildings .
The cause of the fire was not immediately known .
Meanwhile , aftershocks from the 7.0 - magnitude quake have become a way of life for people here as they spend their days searching for food , water and shelter .
Haitians brace for each aftershock as they wait for supplies and sustenance to reach them .
More than $ 355 million in donations in the United States alone has been raised for the relief effort , but stacks of aid -- baby formula , pain medication , antibiotics and other much - needed supplies -- are sitting on the tarmac and in warehouses at the airport in Port - au - Prince , the capital .
What is reaching the hands of survivors is getting there at a snail 's pace .
" It 's a shame , because you would hope that everything could get out there within seconds , " Air Force Col .
Ben McMullen told CNN 's chief medical correspondent , Sanjay Gupta , at the airport .
" But that kind of infrastructure just is n't in place . "

Each new aftershock -- smaller earthquakes that follow a more powerful one -- slows down the relief effort even further .
Friday morning 's 4.4 - magnitude quake was much less powerful than the 7.0 - magnitude one that struck January 12 , leaving widespread death and destruction in its wake .
A 5.9 - magnitude earthquake Wednesday was the strongest aftershock of the week -- enough to cause considerable damage , the U.S. Geological Survey said , though the extent of damage that any earthquake causes depends on factors such as its depth , its proximity to dense population centers and the strength of structures where it hits .
An American adoption service provider in Haiti wrote in a blog that the aftershock Wednesday sent " a wall tumbling down on our heads . "
Save the Children said its staff " heard already - weakened structures collapsing " as a result .
Still , the 7.0 - magnitude quake was more than 40 times stronger than the 5.9 - magnitude aftershock , researchers said .
The death toll is estimated at 200,000 , according to the European Union , whose commissioner for development and humanitarian aid , Karel De Gucht , got a firsthand view of the situation in Port - au - Prince this week .
About 250,000 people are in urgent need of aid and another 3 million have been affected , the EU reported .
Despite all the obstacles , some progress was made Friday .
The city 's south pier was operating , though slowly .
Authorities pushed Friday to get operations moving faster at the port .
The north pier remained unusable , and the south pier is the smaller of the two .
In addition to the aftershocks , bottlenecks at all points of entry -- the airport , roads and ports -- have delayed food and medical aid to the estimated 3 million Haitians affected by the quake .
Canadian troops have been working to open an airport in Jacmel , a seaside town about 8 miles from Port - au - Prince .
About 120 to 140 flights a day were coming into the single - runway Port - au - Prince airport , compared with 25 a day just after the quake struck last week .
But there was still a long list of flights waiting to come in , Lt. Gen. Douglas Fraser of the U.S. Southern Command said Thursday .

To improve air traffic , the U.S. military said Wednesday it had obtained landing rights at the Dominican Republic 's air base at San Isidro , about 220 kilometers ( 135 miles ) east of Port - au - Prince .
Dominican troops will start patrolling a critical corridor between Jimani and Port - au - Prince , the United Nations said .
The patrol should speed the delivery aid into Haiti , it said .
In the meantime , working under adverse conditions with limited supplies , medical teams have been forced to improvise .
Renzo Fricke , field coordinator for Doctors Without Borders , said this week staffers had to buy a saw in the market so surgeons could do amputations .
A CNN crew loaned a medic a pocketknife for another operation .
Lacking rubbing alcohol , doctors have used vodka to sterilize equipment and instruments .
Surgical patients are receiving over - the - counter pain medicine because doctors lack stronger medication .
One nurse used a string of Christmas lights as a makeshift extension cord .
The USNS Comfort , a U.S. naval hospital off the coast , received about 240 patients over 36 hours , said Capt .
James
Ware , the commanding officer .
" Most of those individuals are critical care types of injuries , " he told CNN's " American Morning . "
Virtually all are being brought to the ship by air .
The ship has 80 doctors , including 24 surgeons , and 140 nurses , he said .
" I think when we 're totally mature , which will be in the next two to three days , we believe that we 'll be able to push about 150 patients through to the ship and off the ship every day for surgical care , and the government of Haiti is giving us guidance exactly on where those patients will receive their follow - on care , " he said , adding that officials hope the international community and the United Nations will oversee that process .
More than 300 aid distribution sites are up and running , a senior U.S. administration official said .
More than 700,000 meals and 1.4 million bottles of water have been delivered , along with 22,000 pounds of medical supplies , Fraser said .

Puerto Rico's 250 - feet long , 80 - feet wide Barge of Hope -- loaded five pallets high with food and water , medical supplies , generators and sundries -- set sail Friday afternoon .
Puerto Rican authorities say that when it arrives in Haiti on Monday morning , it will be the single largest shipment of aid to arrive there to date .
The roughly 4 million pounds of food are enough to feed the people of Port - au - Prince for a week .
Organizers say it would take 150 planes to carry as much cargo .
A group of rescuers told CNN Friday that each rescue gives them hope to keep working .
" Every time we find a live victim that 's the energy that keeps us going to the next day , " said Capt .
Louis Fernandez of Miami -Dade Urban Search and Rescue .
" These are some of the harshest conditions I 've ever seen , " he said , adding , " Nothing has ever prepared us for what we 've seen here this week . "
At least 9,288 Americans and some of their family members in Haiti have been evacuated , according to the U.S. State Department , though the whereabouts of nearly 5,000 other Americans remain unknown .
Some 75 others from the United States -- including five government officials -- are either confirmed or presumed dead .

ANAHEIM , California – The Willy Wonka of guitar pedal builders is giving away the keys to his kingdom .
Zachary Vex , the mastermind behind the handcrafted and hand - painted Z. Vex line of boutique guitar effect pedals , has decided to release his designs to the public .
His newest device , a new pedal called the Inventobox , allows anyone to hack his creations however they choose .
Z.Vex pedals are coveted by collectors for their mystique and funky vibe and as much as their squealing , crunchy and sometimes alien - sounding tones .
They run the gamut from fuzz and distortion to wah - wahs and ring modulators .
The pedals , with their sparkling , brightly painted cases and bizarre names , are considered high - end curios – they cost between $ 250 and $ 500 each .
Even though Vex 's pedal designs win accolades from guitar gods like Dinosaur Jr's J Mascis and My Bloody Valentine 's Kevin Shields , some customers are n't totally satisfied with what they get .
" Some people who buy the Fuzz Factory find it too bright , " Vex says , referring to his most popular model , a fuzz pedal for the guitar .
" So , I wanted to give them an opportunity to open it up and do whatever they want to it . "
Vex is debuting the hacker - friendly Inventobox here at the National Association of Music Merchants ( NAMM ) show , the industry 's premiere tradeshow where all the latest gear is trotted out .
The Inventobox will be out in April .
It 's basically a DIY hacking kit that lets intrepid Z. Vex fans mess around with his designs , altering the circuits and creating their own variations on his pedals .
$ 400 gets you the Inventobox kit that contains a pedal with a blank circuit board , a set of modules that reproduce three signature Z.Vex sounds – the Fuzz Factory , the Super Hard - On and his Marshall - style tone stack – plus all the wires , tools and spare parts needed to put them together .
There 's also a $ 300 version that comes without the modules so users can build their own circuits .
Pedal enthusiasts are known tinkerers .
They gather online at sites like DIYStompboxes and Build Your Own Clone to trade schematics and debate over the finer points of stompbox design .
You can buy a DIY pedal kit for around $ 80 , so at $ 300 , the Z. Vex Inventobox may seem a little rich .
But you get a full 16 knobs to twiddle , plus a peek inside the mind of one of the acknowledged masters of high - end stopboxes .
Vex envisions hackers will use the Inventobox , which ships in April , both for tweaking his designs and for developing their own pedals .
The modules can be chained together , so people can layer multiple tone circuits on top of one another inside a single pedal .
The Inventobox itself is modular .
Multiple units of the 16 - knob boxes can be strung together to create pedals with 32 , 48 or 64 knobs – or even more .
It also has a built - in work light and a set of braces that prop up the circuit board so you can move the wires around and still be able to switch the pedal on and off .
At some point , Vex 's explanation of everything the Inventobox is capable of went over our heads like a post - graduate Calculus lecture .
Rest assured , though , it 's a pedal hacker 's dream come true .
Vex says he intends to eventually publish each of his designs for free on the internet , giving away the schematics and the instructions on how to assemble the circuits for every last one of his signature pedals .
He is also creating an iPhone app that will let you purchase new pedal modules as they become available and view the published schematics .
" I 'm going to be giving away all my secrets , " he says .
" People are already hacking my pedals anyway , posting my designs on the various forums .
So , I do n't care what they do to them . "

( CNN ) -- A Kansas jury deliberated just 37 minutes before convicting an anti-abortion activist of first - degree murder in the fatal shooting of an abortion provider .
The jury found Scott Roeder , 51 , guilty of gunning down Dr. George Tiller , who operated a clinic in Wichita where late - term abortions were performed .
Roeder , 51 , faces life in prison when he is sentenced on March 9 .
Tiller 's family said the jury reached a " just " verdict .
" At this time we hope that George can be remembered for his legacy of service to women , the help he provided for those who needed it and the love and happiness he provided us as a husband , father and grandfather , " the family said in a written statement .
A day earlier , Roeder told jurors he had shot Tiller in the foyer of Reformation Lutheran Church as Sunday services began .
Testifying as his only defense witness , he said he believed he had to kill Tiller to save lives .
He said he had no regrets .
" There was nothing being done , and the legal process had been exhausted , and these babies were dying every day , " Roeder said .
" I felt that if someone did not do something , he was going to continue . "
" His testimony was delivered very matter - of - factly , but its contents were chillingly horrific , " prosecutor Ann Swengel said in her closing argument .
" He carried out a planned assassination , and there can be no other verdict in this case ... other than guilty . "
Quick verdict surprised prosecutor
Prosecutors initially fought to keep abortion out of the trial , claiming that Tiller 's death was a straightforward case of premeditated murder .
Eventually , the abortion issue took center stage as prosecutors portrayed Tiller as a target of Roeder 's anti-abortion agenda , and defense lawyers attempted to mitigate his culpability under the theory that he believed Tiller 's death was justified to save the lives of others .
Defense attorney Mark Rudy told jurors in his closing argument that Roeder " thought that the babies kept on dying " and he had to stop Tiller from " killing more babies . "
Another defense attorney , Steve Osburn , said Roeder was " disappointed , " with the verdict .
But he added , " He 's known that this day was going to come , I think . "
Osburn said his client " feels remorse toward the family , but not for what he did . "
The trial drew activists from both sides of the abortion debate to the courtroom , and a van plastered with slogans and photographs of fetuses was parked in a prominent spot in front of the courthouse .
Among the attendees were the Rev. Michael Bray , whose history in the anti-abortion movement includes 1985 conspiracy convictions in connection with a string of clinic bombings , and Katherine Spillar , executive vice president of the Feminist Majority Foundation .
Congregants from Reformation Lutheran testified that they had seen Roeder at church several times before the day he killed Tiller by shooting him at point - blank range in the head .
Jurors heard emotional testimony from church - goers who rushed to Tiller 's side and attempted to administer mouth - to - mouth resuscitation as he lay in a pool of blood .
Others , meanwhile , followed Roeder into the church parking lot , where he threatened to shoot them .
Roeder also was convicted of aggravated assault in connection with threats he made to two ushers , Gary Hoepner and Keith Martin .
As Roeder pulled away in his car , Martin testified , something moved him to throw the coffee cup he was holding at the vehicle .
" Frustration , I guess , lack of accomplishment , nothing else to do . "
Prosecutors also called employees of the pawn shop where Roeder purchased the .22 - caliber Taurus pistol believed to have been used to shoot Tiller .
The gun was never found , but surveillance video and receipts showed that he purchased the gun on May 18 and received it on May 23 , the week before he shot Tiller .
Roeder 's defense team did not dispute much of the factual evidence .
Roeder testified that he chose to target Tiller at church because it presented the best " window of opportunity " to attack Tiller , who traveled in an armored vehicle and whose clinic was a " fortress . "
He admitted bringing the pistol with him to Lutheran Reformation on May 24 with the intention of shooting Tiller , but the physician did not attend services that day .
So , Roeder testified , he returned the following week .
" Do you feel as though you 've successfully completed your mission ? "
Sedgwick County District Attorney Nola Foulston asked Roeder on Thursday .
" He 's been stopped , " Roeder answered .
His testimony was intended just as much for the jury as it was to convince Judge Warren Wilbert that evidence existed to support a possible conviction of voluntary manslaughter .
A conviction on the lesser offense , which is defined as " an unreasonable but honest belief that circumstances existed that justified deadly force , " would have set Roeder free from prison after five years .
Earlier in the trial , Wilbert said he would rule after hearing evidence in the case , acknowledging that he felt the defense faced " an uphill battle . "
Ultimately , he rejected the theory , saying testimony did not support the defense claim that Roeder 's beliefs justified using deadly force against Tiller .
" There is no imminence of danger on a Sunday morning in the back of a church , let alone any unlawful conduct , given that what Tiller did at his clinic Monday through Friday is lawful in Kansas , " the judge said .

Berlusconi's new bloomer as he sends EU leaders doodles of women 's knickers at summit
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi shocked leaders at an EU summit on Friday by sending them doodles showing women ’s underwear through the ages .
He passed round his etchings of bloomers and thongs as the leaders discussed climate change at the meeting in Brussels .
His vulgar prank caused titters among some , but indignation among others who passed them back to him .
D'oh !
Mr Berlusconi at the EU summit and old underwear like he drew ( right )
European leaders present included Gordon Brown , German Chancellor Angela Merkel , French President Nicolas Sarkozy , Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen and EU foreign envoy Baroness Cathy Ashton .
It is understood the rude drawings passed across Mr Brown ’s desk , but it is believed he ignored them .
Mr Berlusconi , 73 , started doodling as the leaders discussed giving more money to help poorer nations combat the effects of climate change .
At first , the other leaders thought he was making his own calculations with a view to taking part in the complex talks .
Then they realised he was sketching women ’s underwear .
One source said the etchings were headed ‘ Women ’s knickers through the ages ’ .
The doodles are said to have included loin cloths used by Egyptian women , Victorian bloomers , French satin knickers , thongs and G - strings .
‘ No one could believe it , ’ said a source .
‘ He was scribbling away and then sent round some jottings with women ’s knickers on it .
Some people were amused .
Some were not . ’
Mr Berlusconi has been plagued by allegations of sexual impropriety since April .
His wife Veronica filed for divorce after his attendance at a girl ’s 18th birthday party .
Patrizia D’Addario , a 42 - year old escort girl , claimed that she had spent the night with Mr Berlusconi .
He denied any knowledge of her being a paid escort .
Generally speaking , would you favor smaller government with fewer services or larger government with more services ?
Fifty - eight percent of those polled by The Washington Post recently claimed they preferred smaller government with fewer services , with only 38 percent favoring a larger government with more services ( and , yes , it is a terrific struggle not to place ironic quotations marks around the word " services " ) .
This is the highest number for the " smaller government " category since 2002 .
And a full year into President Barack Obama 's term , most polls and state elections tell us that the electorate is walking — maybe sprinting ?— back from the progressive economic policies that now dominate Washington .
Some Democrats believed grousing about ( the fully imagined ) wild and unregulated days of the Bush years would be sufficient to pass sweeping top - down economic controls .
Yet for all the presidential election - time happy talk , Americans have this sturdy historical aversion to " fundamental " reorganizations of their society .
Still other Democrats convinced themselves that surging opposition to their big plans was fabricated , paid for by insurance companies or oil companies or some other reprehensible profit - motivated boogeyman they 'd conjured up .
They overestimated their mandate and underestimated the electorate .
Many more Democrats continue to convince themselves that the party 's problem is flawed candidates or poorly communicated messages , as White House spokesman Robert Gibbs conceded this week — because , presumably , the idea of socializing medicine is too nuanced and intellectually rigorous for the average voter to digest .
Hardly .
The predicament Democrats face is the opposite .
Too many voters appreciate exactly what health care legislation entails .
This is why Congress conducts clandestine negotiations on legislation and trashes promises of transparency .
This is why leading Democrats have embraced procedural tricks and senatorial bribery — and now the possibility of " reconciliation " — so they can adjust health care reform and pass it with a 51 - vote majority .
You 're gonna get it whether you want it or not .
That 's what happens when these Democrats lose a debate .
According to the latest NBC News / Wall Street Journal poll , only 33 percent of the public believes the health reform effort is a " good " idea , whereas 46 percent considers it a " bad " idea — with 55 percent disapproving of Obama on health care .
What 's most striking about this poll is that opposition to Obama 's plan has increased 20 percentage points since April — coinciding , not surprisingly , with the president 's big push to convince us that it 's needed .
The more people learn , apparently , the less they like .
Now , I am under no grand illusions about democracy .
The electorate can be mercurial and irrational — as nearly every election proves .
Nor do I believe any ethical politician should abandon his core values simply because polls tell him it would be expedient .
I say , keep fighting , Mr. President .
Those of us who believe in capitalism need you .
But the fact is we have one party controlling both houses of Congress — with historically impressive margins .
We have an opposition political party Americans have lost confidence in .
We have endured a frightening downturn that allowed the far left to advance a menu of stunning regulatory intrusions that normally would be non-starters .
Finally , we have a charismatic and articulate president who , armed with a nearly national landslide , was given the stage to make his pitch on health care reform .
If , with all that , the progressives cannot convince voters that the central cause of their movement is necessary , then it is not a messaging problem or a leadership problem , and it is not a Republican problem ; it is an idea problem — a terrible idea problem .

Despite some missteps and a last - minute snag , a developer signed a contract yesterday to take control of the 110 - story World Trade Center complex in a deal worth $ 3.2 billion , the largest real estate transaction in New York history .
The completion of the deal is the end of an effort begun three years ago by Gov. George E. Pataki of New York and Christie Whitman , then the governor of New Jersey , to privatize the huge 10.6 - million - square - foot office complex .
It was built 30 years ago by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to stimulate development in Lower Manhattan .
The governors pledged to use the proceeds from the transaction for new transportation projects .
A group led by Larry A. Silverstein , a developer , and Westfield America Inc. , an owner of shopping centers , signed a 99 - year lease yesterday after working nearly 24 hours straight on the agreement .
Still , the Port Authority delayed the start of its board meeting yesterday afternoon until the developer delivered a $ 100 million letter of credit , the first installment on a $ 616 million down payment .
The group will then make annual rent payments to the Port Authority , manage and lease the complex and spend $ 200 million on capital improvements .
In recent weeks , the deal was beset by a series of problems -- ranging from the enormous difficulty of structuring such a complex deal within a short time to the sudden slowdown in the economy -- that scuttled negotiations with one bidder and nearly toppled Mr. Silverstein .

( Unfortunately , this news comes as I wait to board a flight from Hong Kong to the United States .
It must be written quickly and without editing . )
A reporter at Canwest News Service emailed Saturday asking for information on the four Canadian soldiers and the journalist who were killed on December 30 in Afghanistan .
I supplied a portion of the unpublicized information , and the reporter emailed Sunday that the Canadian military is “ trying to suppress our telling of your information . ”
The reporter also wrote , “ While the Canadian military confirmed to me much of the information you provided , they are trying to prevent us from publishing it , saying it would breach our agency 's embedding agreement . ”
There is nothing classified or sensitive about the information supplied to Canwest .
This smells of a classic cover - up that has nothing to do with winning or losing the war , but more likely something to do with saving embarrassment .
Some information provided to Canwest :
According to my sources , the attack happened during late afternoon on 30th .
At least some of the Canadian soldiers had been dismounted doing an “ engagement patrol ” in district 2 of Kandahar .
The soldiers and Canadian reporter Michelle Lang were in the area of the district center and the Dand district border .
On the way out ( apparently ) a LAV ( armored vehicle ) was hit by the bomb on route “ Molson , ” flipping the LAV .
Four apparently died on scene .
Sgt. Kirk Taylor apparently died at KAF or on the way to KAF ( Kandahar Airfield ) .
Five wounded were flown to Germany .
One soldier was apparently thought to be dead , but was pulled from the wreckage about three hours after the blast and may have started showing signs of life during helicopter flight .
The five Canadians were killed with about 500lbs of explosives , apparently made from fertilizer , buried under route Molson in Kandahar .
A wire approximately 150 m long was used to command detonate the bomb using a radio receiver .
The radio receiver was outside the ECM bubble .
For more discussion , please see .
Insofar as the apparent censorship attempts by the Canadian military , any censorship of non-classified information is fraught with peril .
Both the British and U.S. military have at times done the same , leading to non-productive confrontations for everyone involved .
To whit , regarding American stonewalling : CENSORING IRAQ
Immediately after that dispatch , General Petraeus emailed to me .
When the matter was brought to his attention , the matter was solved .
The censorship stopped .
His openess with the media – good , bad , or ugly – has been incredibly productive for everyone .
Of course there are lumps involved .
Everyone gets lumps in this fight .
The upshot is that media overwhelmingly trusts General Petraeus , as do I .
Then came the British , to whit : BULLSHIT BOB
Many of the British officers know that censorship is counterproductive , but they ’ve still got too many monkeys in the cockpit to fly straight .
Many Americans are under British command in Afghanistan , and so British censorship in Afghanistan becomes American business , just as any censorship by us is rightfully British business .
Though I have been around British enough to trust and admire their fighting abilities and moral compass , censorship from MoD is steaming toward severe confrontations during 2010 .
The MoD is not of high IQ ; British soldiers are something to brag about .
British troops are national treasures and should be in the news every day , yet their MoD is dumbed - down and is not tough enough to handle the media .
According to my communications from inside the Canwest News Service camp , Canwest feels censored and realizes the Canadian military is covering up the situation in Kandahar .
Today , U.S. troops are under Canadian leadership , so any hint of Canadian censorship suddenly and jarringly makes Canadian business in Afghanistan into U.S. business .
With U.S. blood under Canadian command , the Canadian military is on limits .
U.S. families and citizens have a right to know who is leading their troops .
This is very serious .
In this war , especially in southern Afghanistan , the British have a right to know what ’s going on with the U.S. and Canadians .
The Canadians and U.S. have that same right , as do other partners .
Access is a two way street .
The Canadians can freely give access and gain a chance to tell their side of the unfolding stories , or they can deny access and access will be taken without terms .

A lot of interests are at stake after an 18 - wheeler wreck : the driver , the company he works for , the owner of the cargo and the insurance companies that cover all of them .
And since every big truck wreck ends up being a very expensive proposition , their side needs to have a fall guy .
The first one in line is the driver .
And most every time , the driver will try and pass the blame off to you in order to keep his job : usually the minute that the driver climbs out of the cab .
This is why it ’s never a good idea to trust the truck driver to tell the truth when he or she causes an expensive accident .
If truck drivers are found to be liable for an accident , not only will they be fired , it could become very difficult for them to land a new job after costing his or her previous employer enormous amounts of money in liability claims .
Sometimes trucking companies , especially if investigations determine they must share negligence liability , throw the driver “ under the rig ” and fire them outright : then work to distance themselves from their respondeat superior liability by sloughing all of it on the newly - dismissed driver .
And if this is n’t the driver ’s first wreck at the wheel of a big rig , he might lose either ( or both of ) his state trucking driver ’s license , or his DOT certification .
So now this poor miscreant has to find a new line of work .
And with the high unemployment in the U.S. , the temptation for that driver to lie , cheat or behave dishonestly to save their job is too great if he wants to keep taking care of his family .
After suffering an injury in a semi accident in which the driver of the truck claimed that our client was driving with his lights off at night , our investigators quickly examined the scene .
They discovered a security camera outside a convenience store that was pointed directly its parking lot and the accident scene behind it .
The video clearly showed our client ’s headlights shining brightly .
We proved that the truck driver boldly lied .

WingMakers
Changes to WingMakers Website
To access the entire original WingMakers website almost exactly as it once appeared , enter here .
The WingMakers website first appeared on the Internet in late 1998 .
I first came upon it through a good friend 's recommendation in November of 2000 .
Though I initially had serious questions and doubts about much of the mind - boggling information on the WingMakers site , I was immediately struck by the depth , clarity , and beauty of the two philosophical writings .
Tears welled up in my eyes as I had never in my life read anything which so opened my mind , heart , and spirit , and resonated so deeply in my soul .
As I found the WingMakers philosophical material to be so deeply moving , I decided to copy the information on the WingMakers website for future study .
But then within a few months , I saw the website gradually begin to change from it 's original form .
Where it once provided inspiration through poetry , paintings , philosophy , and music free of charge , the WingMakers website began to transform into a commercial endeavor , making some of the material there available for sale .
Names were changed and more .
Someone named James appeared on the changed website , claiming that he was responsible for it .
The incredible story around the discovery of the physical site where the WingMakers material was found was also changed and gradually given a very different spin .
The discovery date of the Lost Arrow site was changed from 1972 to 1996 .
Two additional philosophical writings were added to the original two ( which were both given on one webpage ) .
And when I carefully compared the changed WingMakers website with the original information I had copied , I discovered other most surprising and intriguing changes .
Before describing more changes , it is important to mention that the WingMakers story is quite unbelievable for most who first read it .
I originally suspected that the story might have been created to promote the inspiring philosophical teachings .
Only after I saw the website change in unusual ways , and then learned about the huge cover - up around UFOs , did I eventually come to believe the WingMakers story was likely true .
I invite you to be skeptical as well , as there is certainly no way I know of proving the story .
That said , I also invite you to keep an open mind .
The WantToKnow .info website clearly shows that many things are not what they seem .
Among the many significant changes , a 24th chamber was added to the 23 chambers ( the number of human chromosomes ) on the original WingMakers website .
In the interviews section of the changed website , the seven WingMakers sites around the planet are described as having a military objective , when the original website had no hint of anything military in all descriptions of the WingMakers .
Some key inspiring parts of the old interviews were completely deleted , others added , and star distances were changed .
The distance to the star system of the Corteum was changed from 15,000 light years on the old website to 15 million light years .
Why was that number changed ?
The story on the current WingMakers website has taken on an hierarchical flavor .
It talks of a superior Central Race ( of which the WingMakers are supposedly a part ) , of a Lyricus teaching order from this race , and of a mysterious " grand portal " leading to scientific proof of the soul .
None of these concepts were part of or even mentioned on the original WingMakers website .
Yet the insertion of these key concepts was among the first changes made to the website in 2001 .
These concepts are quite different from the original WingMakers writings , which were all about opening ever more to divine wisdom from within ourselves , and about moving beyond the teacher / student ordering of the hierarchical paradigm to recognize the divine equality of all beings .
It is most interesting that James , who claims he is responsible for both the original and new WingMakers material , mentions on the changed website in question nine at this link , " In my dominant reality , I am known as Mahu Nahi . "
Yet it is stated on both the original and changed website that " the leader of the Corteum mission to earth is called -- in English -- Mahunahi . "
This same webpage describes the extraterrestrial Corteum as beings which " stand nearly three meters high and have very elongated heads and bodies .
Their skin is very fair ... almost translucent . "
So if James is being honest here , he is claiming that he is a 10 - foot tall alien .
[ Note : Since this was written , the above " mistake " has been removed from the current website .
The " changed website " link above goes to an earlier version of the current website using archive.org . ]
It 's also interesting to note that for the first couple years , virtually no mention was made on the website of the gradual , yet significant changes being made .
It seems that the original WingMakers website was somehow taken over and that the original information was gradually distorted and diluted by very sophisticated powers that did not want this information going out .
Some highly intelligent group , which obviously had ample funds , appears to have taken control and gradually changed the orientation of the original website so that those seeking the deep WingMakers wisdom would be subtly led back towards more hierarchical ways of thinking .
To explore the sequence of these changes , you can find archived versions of the WingMakers website on the Internet Archive at this link .
The first version of the website should be listed as January 25 , 1999 , which is only months after the website first appeared on the Internet .
The website starts to change in the March 2001 version there .
For a detailed , revealing comparison of the original and changed versions of the WingMakers interviews , click here .
It is interesting to note that despite the many changes , the two philosophical writings from the original website have changed very little on the current site .
This may be because the original versions of this philosophy were written in language that is quite esoteric and difficult for most people to understand .
I have worked professionally as a language interpreter for many years , and was able to understand the originals and recognize the beauty of what I read .
Using my translation skills , I translated this esoteric language into common , everyday English , which is what you now read on our website at this link .
If you are interested in verifying and further exploring all of the information above , I recommend you start by reading the fascinating introduction to the original website and WingMakers material as I downloaded it here .
Compare this with the full introduction on the changed website at this link .
You can access the entire WingMakers website almost exactly as it once appeared by clicking here .
I also highly recommend reading reliable information on the UFO cover - up available here for more background understanding to all of this .
The original writings , poems , and paintings of the WingMakers were simply sharing powerful information and inspiration on the transformation currently taking place on our planet with no hint of fear for our future .
This transformation described by the WingMakers involved the shift to a new paradigm where an ever - increasing number of people realize that the deepest answers in life are found not by searching outside of ourselves in the way of the old hierarchical paradigm , but rather by searching within our own divine essence to find deeper connection with all around us .
The philosophy of the WingMakers states that the universe is always mirroring our own deepest beliefs back to us .
It is up to each one of us how we choose to see and interpret everything in our lives and everything that happens .
And the more we open to the WingMakers ' three principles of transformation ( seeing the Divine in all , nurturance of life , and gratitude ) , the more easy and fluid our lives may become .
It is our choice whether we choose to live in fear , or whether we choose to recognize fear as an invitation to growth , and work with it as a potential tool of transformation .
For a number of years I was concerned and even alarmed that the WingMakers materials were changed in ways that I believed diluted and even distorted the power of the original writings .
Yet eventually , as I examined my own role in creating this fear , I was able to find compassion and trust for all involved .
In recent years , I 've been quite encouraged and even excited that the current wingmakers.com website and the other websites it has spawned seem increasingly to be coming from a place of the heart , though I still find the original website to be far more profound and transformational for those who are ready to journey into their own inner wisdom .
I trust that the Divine ( God , Prime Creator , First Source ) is always acting in perfect time and perfect fashion through each one of us to create what is best for all beings in this universe .
The more we trust the Divine and align ourselves with what 's best for all beings , the more easy , fluid , and love - filled our lives become .
For me , this is an essential part of what the WingMakers are telling us .
I most highly recommend that you open to your own spiritual guidance in exploring these matters .
If they resonate for you , I also highly recommend reviewing the original WingMakers philosophical essays and poems from time to time , as they will very likely awaken ever more light and love inside of you .
I very much enjoy reading the philosophical essays once every few months , and invariably find myself inspired anew .
We are clearly in the middle of an incredible planetary shift , which is but a reflection of deep changes within each of us and within the collective consciousness of humanity .
I am happy to help with this collective shift in any way I can .
I am also very excited and thankful to have the profound wisdom of the WingMakers as a reminder to look within myself for the deepest answers .
I warmly welcome your thoughts or questions on any of this .
You can send me a message on this webpage .
Thanks for your interest in the profound WingMakers material , and may you have a great day !
With heartfelt love and warm wishes ,

A Harvard law grad surrendered to cops yesterday after allegedly setting fire to an East Side chapel that houses remains of 9/11 victims as part of a drunken dare , sources said .
Brian Schroeder , 26 , originally from Texas , walked into the 13th Precinct station house at about 7 p.m. in connection with the blaze at Memorial Park , on East 30th Street .
Charges were pending , police said .
None of the remains , which are destined for a memorial at the World Trade Center , were damaged but “ mementos and candles left by family members in honor of 9/11 victims were destroyed or possibly stolen , ” Mayor Bloomberg said earlier yesterday .
Police sources told The Post they believe Schroeder was acting on a drunken dare , but have no other motive for the offensive oddball act of arson .
“ How does someone walk into a place that ’s supposed to be secure and just light a fire ? ” asked FDNY Deputy Chief Jimmy Riches , who lost his son and fellow firefighter , Jimmy , in the Twin Towers .
“ It ’s beyond me . ”
The Fire Department was able to quickly extinguish the 9 a.m. fire inside the tent , which is operated by the Medical Examiner ’s Office .
It is not clear how Schroeder , a Duke University grad who had moved to New York recently to accept a position with a law firm , was able to get into the compound , but authorities got a report of a break - in about an hour before the fire .
“ I just heard about this and it ’s hard to grasp .
Clearly my prayers are with [ Brian ] , ” said a relative of the suspect .
“ With all my experiences with [ him ] , he did n’t have any radical agenda .
Nothing but a good person . ”
Schroeder has no radical political bent , his family said .
“ It ’s clearly out of his character and I ’m sure he feels for the victims ’ families , ” the relative added .
The ME did not respond to a call for comment .

UPDATES How ‘ The Hangover ’ Got Made
Burbank , CA , January 6 , 2010 – Warner Bros Pictures and Legendary Pictures ’
The Hangover has added another milestone to its record - breaking 2009 run .
Since its release on Blu-ray and DVD on December 15th 2009 , the film has become the # 1 comedy of all time on the DVD charts with combined consumer and rental sales topping 8.6 million units with 1.5 million units coming from Blu-ray purchases .
Strong sales are expected to continue bringing the six - month estimate to 9.5 million units .
The Hangover earned more than $ 467 million worldwide during its theatrical run , making it the highest - grossing R- rated comedy of all time .
In the wake of last Friday 's miracle job performance with unemployment dropping by .2 % ( see Jobs Contract 23rd Straight Month ; Unemployment Rate Drop to 10.0 % ) let 's take a look at unemployment scenarios offered by the Fed to see how realistic they are .
Dave Rosenberg mentioned those scenarios in Breakfast with Dave on November 30 , 2009 .
Range OF Macro Outcomes is Extremely Wide
All you need to do is go to the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) minutes and see the wide divergence of views over the macro outlook , and this is coming from 17 of the nation ’s top policymakers who also ostensibly keep in touch with each other .
The range on 2010 GDP estimates is : 2.0 % to 4.0 % ; for 2010 , 2.5 % to 4.6 % for 2011 , and 2.8 % to 5.0 % for 2012 .
These two percentage points are huge for a $ 14 trillion economy — we ’re talking about differences that amount to $ 300 billion !
The range on the unemployment rate forecast for 2010 is 8.6 % to 10.2 % ; for 2011 it is 7.2 % to 8.7 % ; and for 2012 , the band is 6.1 % to 7.6 % .
These ranges are massive .
And , for the inflation rate , the range for 2010 is 1.1 % to
So consider that at the Fed , there is one official that sees the potential for a return to full employment by 2012 ; and another that sees the prospect of deflation .
These views are worlds apart and attest to our assertion that the band around any particular forecast in a post - bubble credit collapse is huge .
Fed 's 2012 Forecast
2000 - 2009 Perspective
At the height of the internet bubble with a nonsensical Y2 K scare on top of that , the economy managed to gain 264,000 jobs a month .
At the height of the housing bubble in 2005 , the economy added 212,000 jobs a month .
At the height of the commercial real estate bubble with massive store expansion , the economy added somewhere between 96,000 and 178,000 jobs per month depending on where you mark the peak .
No Genuine Driver For Jobs .
The retail sector has massive overcapacity .
We do not need more Home Depots , WalMarts , Lowes , Sears , Pizza Huts , Targets , Safeways , etc etc .
Commercial real estate is flooded with vacant offices and plagued by falling rents .
Housing inventory is enormous .
Boomers will be looking to downsize their lifestyles .
There is not going to be another internet boom .
My Baseline Scenario
Extremely Generous Assumptions
I am assuming there will be job gains ( on average ) in 2010 even though history suggests otherwise .
I have the number of jobs gained per month increasing to 170,000 jobs per month for 2013 even though I think 150,000 is a more realistic maximum target for an entire year .
I have +150,000 jobs for 4 consecutive years through 2016 .
I have the Labor Pool decreasing dramatically as a result of boomer demographics starting in 2014 .
This acts to lower the unemployment rate .
I have the participation rate falling every year , accelerating rapidly starting in 2014 all the way through 2020 .

BEIJING : China has signaled it wants to go the US way and set up military bases in overseas locations that would possibly include Pakistan .
The obvious purpose would be to exert pressure on India as well as counter US influence in Pakistan and Afghanistan .
( Watch Video )
" ( So ) it is baseless to say that we will not set up any military bases in future because we have never sent troops abroad , " an article published on Thursday at a Chinese government website said .
" It is our right , " the article said and went on to suggest that it would be done in the neighborhood , possibly Pakistan .
" As for the military aspect , we should be able to conduct the retaliatory attack within the country or at the neighboring area of our potential enemies .
We should also be able to put pressure on the potential enemies ' overseas interests , " it said .
A military base in Pakistan will also help China keep a check on Muslim Uighur separatists fighting for an independent nation in its western region of Xingjian , which borders the North West Frontier Province of Pakistan .
Beijing recently signed an agreement with the local government of NWFP in order to keep a close watch on the movement of Uighur ultras .
" I have personally felt for sometime that China might one day build a military base in India 's neighborhood .
China built the Gadwar port in Pakistan and is now broadening the Karokoram highway .
These facilities can always be put to military use when the need arises , " Ramesh V Phadke , former Air Commodore and advisor to the Institute of Defense Studies told TNN .
Phadke said the article in very significant .
" The purpose may be to see how the international community reacts to it , " he said .
China , which has no military bases outside its territory , has often criticized the United States for operating such overseas bases .
It has not just changed its standpoint but also wants to enter the lucrative protection business .
" With further development , China will be in great demand of the military protection , " the article said .
Pakistan , which buys 70 % of its military hardware from China , is likely to be an eager buyer for such protection .
Beijing may also be able to pressurize Islamabad to accept its diktat using the threat of withholding military supplies .
A Pakistani expert on China - Pakistan relationship has a different view on the subject .
" The Americans had a base in the past and it caused a political stink .
I do n’t think it would be politically possible for the Pakistani government to openly allow China to set up a military base , " he said while requesting anonymity .
Pakistan might allow use of its military facilities without publicly announcing it , he said .
A Chinese military base can tackle several international relations issues , it said .
One of them is " the relationship between the base troops and the countries neighboring to the host country . "
This is another indication that Beijing is considering Pakistan as a possible base .
China ’s argument is that a foreign base would actually help regional stability .
" If the base troops can maintain the regional stability , it will be probably welcomed by all the countries in the region , " the article said .
Beijing is conscious that the move might result in opposition from the US , UK and France which has overseas military bases .
“ Thirdly , the relationship between the big countries in the world .
The establishment of the troop bases is sensitive to those big countries which have already set up the bases abroad , " the article said .
Do you think the relationship between China and Pakistan is dangerous for India ?
A third person has been charged with murder over the death of an Indian man in southern New South Wales last month .
Ranjodh Singh 's body was found on the side of the road in Willbriggie , near Griffith in late December .
It was badly burnt .
Yesterday , a man and woman , were arrested at San Souci in Sydney 's south and charged with murder .
Gurpreet Singh , 23 , and his 20 - year - old wife Harpreet Bhullar faced Sutherland Local Court separately today .
Gurpreet Singh seemed calm as he sat in the dock , but his wife was visibly upset .
The couple did not apply for bail and will remain behind bars until their next court appearance next month .
Their lawyer requested a Punjabi interpreter .
The third person , a 25 - year - old man , was arrested in Wagga Wagga this morning .
Wagga Local Court heard this afternoon that Harpreet Singh will make a bail application next week .
Police have so far not commented on the motive for the killing , but they say it was not racially motivated .
At the time of his death , Ranjodh Singh was harvesting pumpkins in Griffith .
He had been in Australia for a year .
“ That joke is kind of weird that way , ” Mr. Malow said .
“ We have that traditional image of an astronomer .
Astronomers should work at night , theoretically .
It ’s fun to say that . ”
Mr. Malow said that he expected the science comedy field to grow .
“ That wo n’t be a niche at all , ” he said .
“ That ’ll be too broad .
It ’ll be , ‘ I just do humor about the spleen . ’ ”
Still , linear regression and ocean acidification are rarely fodder for standup , as they were for Dr. Lee in his New York City debut at a small venue called the Monkey in Gramercy last Wednesday , seven years after walking into the Laundromat .
( He returns to New York this week for two more nights of shows at the Monkey . )
“ My act is a parody of a seminar , ” he said .
“ I think my audience is everyone from age 14 who is kind of nerdy to age 65 who is kind of nerdy . ”
He joked about linear regression ( a rumination about what kind of people post cat videos on YouTube ) , period doubling in chaos ( which he likens to the splitting of behaviors of people as they become more and more drunk ) and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle .
He explained this fundamental concept of quantum physics  that the more precisely the position of a particle is measured , the less is known about the particle ’s momentum , and vice versa  with a photograph of a men ’s room with television screens above the urinals .
The designer “ clearly did n’t understand the uncertainty principle , ” Dr. Lee said .
“ The problem is the more I know what ’s on TV , ” he went on , “ the less I know about where I ’m aiming . ”

Guillaume Latendresse a écoulé toutes ses chances à Montréal .
Tel que le rapportait RDS en fin d'après - midi lundi , le Canadien s'est départi du gros attaquant pour obtenir les services de Benoit Pouliot du Wild du Minnesota .
" Je savais que ça s'en venait , que je n'étais pas le préféré de Jacques Martin .
J'avais compris ça depuis un bon bout de temps .
Pour moi , c'était facile à voir " , a commenté un Latendresse relativement souriant après avoir appris la nouvelle de la bouche de Bob Gainey .
Latendresse n'était effectivement plus dans les bonnes grâces de l'entraîneur depuis un bon moment déjà .
Ce dernier l'avait rayé de l'alignement le 14 novembre contre les Predators de Nashville , mais avait finalement dû le faire jouer en raison d'une blessure à Brian Gionta .
Latendresse s'était alors retrouvé au coeur d'une mini-tempête lorsqu'il avait affirmé qu'il dormait à l'hôtel de l'équipe lorsqu'il a appris qu'il affronterait finalement les Preds , 30 minutes avant la rencontre .
" C'est difficile , mais je m'en attendais , a - t - il poursuivi .
C'était une question de temps .
Mon cerveau était déjà ailleurs et ça devenait plus difficile de faire mon travail . "
Le 84 a été l'un des attaquants les moins utilisés par Martin depuis quelques semaines et sa fiche offensive en a souffert : auteur de 46 buts à ses trois premières saisons dans la Ligue nationale , il n'en a marqué que deux en 23 parties en 2009 - 10 .
La question se pose : Latendresse a -t - il vraiment eu sa chance à Montréal ?
" Il y a des soirs où je me retrouvais sur le premier ou le deuxième trio , mais je savais que si je manquais une passe , je retournerais en bas , répond le principal intéressé .
La seule vraie chance que j'ai eue , c'est l'an passé avec Saku et Alex Kovalev .
Ça avait bien été et c'est avec ces souvenirs en tête que je vais partir pour le Minnesota . "
Un nouveau départ pour Pouliot
Pouliot , un Franco - Ontarien de 23 ans sélectionné juste avant Carey Price au repêchage de 2005 , n'a toujours pas joué à la hauteur des attentes placées en lui depuis le début de sa carrière .
Il n'a marqué que neuf buts en 65 parties dans la Ligue nationale et n'a jamais été reconnu pour son ardeur au travail .
Cette saison , il a marqué deux buts et récolté deux aides en 14 parties .
" Benoit Pouliot et Guillaume Latendresse sont deux joueurs du même âge qui cherchaient à faire leur place avec les équipes qui les ont sélectionnées .
Il arrive souvent qu'un nouvel environnement , de nouveaux coéquipiers et une
nouvelle situation s'avèrent bénéfiques pour un joueur .
Benoit Pouliot est un joueur de talent possédant un gros gabarit , il est rapide et nous entendons bien lui offrir la possibilité de s'imposer dans la LNH " , a expliqué Gainey .
Pouliot arrivera à Montréal mardi après-midi .
" Je ne viens pas de très loin de Montréal .
Dans mon coin , quand t'es jeune , tu regardes les matchs du Canadien .
Ma famille et mes amis doivent être contents pour moi en ce moment .
Je n'ai jamais été échangé dans ma carrière .
Ça va être nouveau , excitant . "
Pouliot se décrit comme un joueur offensif capable de tirer profit de son imposant gabarit .
" J'ai de la vitesse et un bon lancer .
Je suis aussi capable de frapper .
Ce n'est pas ma plus grande qualité , mais je suis capable de donner des mises en échec . "
Pouliot soigne présentement une blessure à une main .
" Ça fait une semaine et demie et je me sens beaucoup mieux .
Je ne peux pas dire exactement dans combien de temps je serai de retour , mais ça s'en vient bien .
Je verrai avec les médecins à mon arrivée à Montréal . "
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
The Federal Reserve should start tightening monetary policy -- spelling higher U.S. interest rates -- " sooner rather than later , " said Thomas Hoenig , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City , on Thursday .
" The Federal Reserve must curtail its emergency credit and financial market support programs , raise the federal - funds rate target from zero back to a more normal level , probably between 3.5 % and 4.5 % , and restore its balance sheet to pre-crisis size and configuration , " Hoenig said in a speech at the Central Exchange in Kansas City .

Hoenig will be a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , the panel charged with setting interest - rate policy , this year .
However , his views are likely to conflict with a majority of the central bankers , who reaffirmed only three weeks ago that economic conditions are likely to warrant keeing the fed funds rate at exceptionally low levels " for an extended period . "
See more on the FOMC's December policy meeting .
Hoenig did n't spell out either exactly when the Fed should begin the process of hiking rates or how fast it should proceed .
" I believe the process of returning policy to a more balanced weighing of short - run and longer - run economic and financial goals should occur sooner rather than later , " he said .
Moreover , it would be a clear a mistake to wait to unwind policy until a U.S. economic recovery is clearly in full force , Hoenig said .
This would be " short - sighted " and would risk creating conditions leading " to financial excess , economic volatility and even higher unemployment at some point in the future , " he said .
Hoenig also said he was more optimistic than most economists about the pace of economic growth he foresees in 2010 .
Specifically , he forecast that U.S. gross domestic product would exceed a 3 % rate this year .

Uskonto ei ole sama asia kuin henkinen elämä tai hengellisyys .
On olemassa muitakin eteenpäin auttajia , jotka eivät vaadi sinua sijoittamaan ja uhraamaan kaikkeasi avun vastineeksi .
Harkitse tarkkaan , kannattaako sinun sitoutua mihinkään yhteisöön .
Katso , että omat rationaaliset ajatuksesi ja tunteesi käyvät yhteen .
Tunteet ovat usein pettäviä .
Henkinen ja sosiaalinen tilanteesi voi tehdä sinusta heikon juuri sillä hetkellä , kun jonkun uskonnollisen yhteisön jäsen ottaa sinuun yhteyttä .
Tunnet ehkä hetken turvallisuutta ja että joku edes välittää .
Se ei kuitenkaan ole hyvä syy uhrata koko elämäänsä , aikaansa tai rahavarojaan tuon yhteisön hyväksi .
Joskus kysytään , eikö kannattaisi varmuuden vuoksi käydä kirkossa palvomassa Jumalaa siltä varalta , että hän onkin olemassa ?
Vastauksena sanon suoraan , että ei .
Mikä sellaisessa olisi vitsinä ?
Käyt kirkossa , otat osaa rituaaleihin ja rukouksiin ja teeskentelet uskovasi , ja höpläytät näin Jumalaa , joka sitten päästää sinut taivaaseen ?
Tuskinpa vain .
Hartaudenharjoituksesi saattaa rasvata rattaita elämässäsi , luultavasti olet tapa- tai tosiuskovaisten ympäröimä .
Mutta että sellainen teeskentely hankkisi sinulle taivaspaikan ?
Järjetöntä .
Sinulle , joka olet onnellinen uskossasi :
En halua riistää sinulta onnentunnettasi .
En ole tehnyt tätä sivua käännyttääkseni ketään .
Sinun on parasta etsiä muuta kiinnostavaa Internetissä ja unohtaa minun sivuni .
Jos aiot saarnata minulle helvettiin joutumista , älä vaivaudu .
En usko helvetin  enkä taivaankaan  olemassaoloon .
Monet kirjoittelevat minulle , että minun pitäisi lukea Raamattua " oikeassa hengessä " päästäkseni siihen sisälle  selkokielellä se sama kulunut " tajutaksesi Raamattua sinun on oltava typerä " - argumentti , joka sisältää kolme momenttia :
Sinulla täytyy olla Pyhä Henki voidaksesi ymmärtää Raamattua .
Et voi saada Pyhää Henkeä , ennen kuin uskot Raamattuun .
Eli Jumala antaa Pyhän Hengen ainoastaan niille , jotka ovat tarpeeksi typeriä uskoakseen johonkin , jota eivät kykene ymmärtämään .
Haluaisin vain huomauttaa , että olen kyllä kokeillut uskovaisena elämistä .
Olin lukenut Raamatun läpi jo ennestään , jolloin näin sen eräiden tiettyjen kansakuntien tai niiden osien erilaisina kirjallisina tuotteina .
Sitten lankesin lyhyeksi aikaa loveen , jolloin kävin Raamattua läpi vielä tarkemmin , ja luulin todellakin kokeneeni jotakin , jonka tulkitsin " Pyhäksi Hengeksi " .
Myöhemmin huomasin olleeni väärässä .
Mitään siitä ei lopultakaan jäänyt käteen : minulla ei henkilökohtaisessa elämässäni ollut Raamatusta mitään hyötyä .
Raamatun tahkoaminen ja jakeiden setviminen oli pelkkää ajantuhlausta .
Saan enemmän irti muusta kirjallisuudesta .
Raamattu on niin vanhentunutta ja sitä paitsi vierasta juttua , ettei siihen voi ripustautua nykymaailmassa .
Se , mikä siinä on hyvää , löytyy kyllä muualtakin .
Sitten on niitä , jotka eivät tahdo millään käsittää , että uskonnollisuuden ainoa vaihtoehto ei ole ahne ja itsekäs materialismi .
Eräs taannoinen kaappiuskovainen ( nuori mies , joka ei suostunut myöntämään olevansa itse asiassa fundis ) kysyi minulta , että mitä pitäisi sanoa kolmivuotiaalle , joka on kuullut jonkun sanovan , ettei Jumalaa ja taivasta olekaan , ja ainoaksi vaihtoehdoksi jää materialismi ?
No voihan --. Kukas arvostelukyvytön viattomalle pikkulapsoselle sitten on ensinnäkin mennyt tuputtamaan , että ne ovat olemassa ?
Ja että mitäkö vaihtoehtoja jää sitten tällaiselle lapsiraukalle muita kuin materialismi ?
Tuossa vaiheessa päästeleekin jo sitten muutaman ärräpään .
[ Edellisestä eräs toinen kirjoittaja tunnisti mukamas itsensä , vaikka teksti uskovaisilta ei ole mitenkään uniikkia .
Itse asiassa saan epäsäännöllisesti mutta toistuvasti näitä samoja juttuja .
Taisi muuten olla sama jeppe , joka kysyi olenko anarkisti !]
Ensinnäkään ateismi ei ole sama asia kuin materialismi .
Ateismi ei ole mikään erityinen oppirakennelma .
Ateistinen henkilö ei usko jumaliin , ja piste .
Ateistin ei tarvitse olla ahne ja itsekäs materialisti ( vaikka sellaisiakin ihmisiä varmasti on olemassa ) .
Ateisti voi olla vapaa - ajattelija , humanisti , tiedemies , taiteilija , kirjailija , muusikko , luonnonystävä ; hän voi osallistua lasten , nuorten , vanhusten , sairaiden aktivoimiseen ja auttamiseen , kehitysmaatyöhön ( ei ole pakko viedä evankeliumia pakanoille avittaakseen heidän jokapäiväistä elämäänsä korkeammalle tasolle )  tai mitä nyt on sattunut valitsemaan .
Ateisti voi elää todella rikasta henkistä elämää .
Kun kuolen , minusta jää jäljelle työni ja muistoni , ja ne atomit , joista ruumiini on muodostunut , levitetään toivoni mukaan tuhkan muodossa jollekin rakastamalleni paikalle .
Siellä ne joutuvat takaisin luonnon kiertokulkuun , ja ovat siinä mielessä " ikuisia " .
Minusta tämä on " tarpeeksi " kaunis ja lohduttava ajatus , sillä eihän oma kuolema muutoin ole mitään kiehtovaa tai miellyttävää .
Elämästä saa irti sen mitä siihen itse sijoittaa .
Elämä on itsessään kaunista ja ihmeellistä .
Ei sitä tarvitse ruveta parannella retostelemaan jollakin " tuonpuoleisella " taivaalla ja " ikuisella elämällä " .
Kertoisipa joku edes , että mitä siellä taivaassa sitten mukamas tehdään se iankaikkisuus ?
Näppäillään harppua pilvenlongalla vai ?
Seurustellaan vastenmielisten kiihkouskovaisten kanssa ?
Melko heppoinen , etten sanoisi synkkä , tulevaisuus .
Ei kiitos !
Miksi lapselle olisi opetettava , että hänen pitää käyttää kainalosauvoja , kun hän pystyy kävelemään ilmankin ?
Sivun tarkoitus on tuoda esille vaihtoehtoja järjestyneeseen uskonnolliseen elämään .
Uskonto on vallan väline
Miksi Suomessa ylipäänsä on " valtionkirkko " ?
Kansalaisia on vanhastaan verotettu ( rahaa , elintarvikkeita , miehiä sotiin ) ja kirkko on pitänyt heistä lukua niin että kukaan ei ole välttynyt suoneniskuilta .
Uskonto syyllistää tavallisen ihmisen ja tekee hänestä laumaeläimen .
Uskovaisia ei syyttä kutsuta lampaiksi .
Lammas kuuluu eläinmaailman tyhmimpiin eläimiin .
Miksi ihmisen pitäisi nykyäänkin vapaaehtoisesti alentua lampaan tasolle , kun ei kerran enää ole pakko ?
Kansan kuuliaisuus on ollut hallitseville välttämättömyys .
Omintakeinen ajattelu ei ole vallassaolijoiden mieleen .
Kirjat ovat tuhoamis - ja sensuurilistalla koska ne kehittävät ihmismieltä ja edistävät kriittistä , omintakeista ajattelua .
Uskonto aiheuttaa ennen kaikkea suvaitsemattomuutta sekä m.m. sotia , rasismia , etnistä puhdistusta , noitavainoja ja kirjanpolttamisia .
Uskontoa voi verrata fasismiin .
Yksilö häviää massoihin .
On uskottava sokeasti jos aikoo selviytyä hengisssä .
" Tottele johtajia .
Älä ajattele itse ! "
Voit elää onnellista elämää päättäen itse sen tyylistä ,
rajoista ja laadusta niin kauan kuin et aiheuta vahinkoa toisille .
On vaikeaa suvaita niitä , jotka itse ovat suvaitsemattomia .
Yritä kuitenkin !
Ehkä joku heidän suuresta laumastaan oppii sinulta jotakin ja muuttaa käytöstään vähitellen .
Yksi vaikutuskeino on aivan spontaanisti jossakin tilanteessa auttaa jotakuta  tuttua tai tuntematonta  vaikka hän ei apua odottaisikaan .
Avun ei tarvitse olla mitenkään suurenmoinen , joskus riittää pelkkä hymy tai pari ystävällistä ja kannustavaa sanaa .
Jos tuo henkilö kiittää sinua , niin pyydä häntä puolestaan auttamaan muita joskus tilaisuuden tullen .
Seuraukset voivat olla suuret .
Ehkäpä apusi saanut auttaa useita muita muistaessaan sinun epäitsekkään ja pyyteettömän tekosi tai sanasi .
Et varmastikaan saa koskaan tietää , miten on käynyt , mutta hyvässä lykyssä oma pieni tekosi poikii useita toisia , etkä taatusti ole ainakaan menettänyt mitään .

Mervyn King said that unless politicians act to create an international body with the authority to reform the monetary system , the world would be consigned to another crisis in a matter of years .
He warned that although much attention was being paid to efforts to overhaul the financial sector , in the meantime the global economic imbalances which fuelled the crisis were worsening .

The video blogger who confronted international war criminal and top - drawer minion of the New World Order , George Bush Senior , was visited by the Secret Service after posting a video of the incident on YouTube .
Earlier today he wrote an email to HoustonTruth.org :
Wanted to make you all aware that I was just visited by the Secret Service .
I stupidly opened the door , but then closed and locked it and told them I ’d be right back with them .
Then I put a tape in my camera and started to record .
They told me they ca n’t talk on camera and left .
Thought you all should know in case I go missing , etc .
No word as of this post if the Secret Service returned .
The video in question follows .

Use said when you report someone ’s words .
Newspaper and other style guides disagree over whether to use past tense ( said ) or present tense ( says ) .
It does n’t matter which .
Pick one and stick with it .
Although at times you may need to write someone says this now , but said something different in the past .
While you can use said even with written words – if you are quoting what someone wrote in a mail or in tweet – it is better to make it clear the person was n’t talking at the time .
Alternative verbs are mainly pompous or value - laden .
I once worked with a journalist who sprinkled his copy with words like averred or commented .
Neither adds useful information .
The pompous language may frighten off some readers .
To me it read like something from Edwardian times .
Not using said sews seeds of doubt
Readers may interpret other alternatives to said as suggesting the speaker is lying , misinformed or does n’t know what they are talking about .
Think of claimed or according to .
By the same token it is perfectly OK to used claimed or according to when you want readers to understand there may be some doubt .
One alternative I allow myself is the verb ask .
This only works when someone is clearly asking a question .
Fiction writer Elemore Leonard has another perspective on this .
In his excellent Ten rules of writing he says :
Never use a verb other than “ said ” to carry dialogue .
The line of dialogue belongs to the character ; the verb is the writer sticking his nose in .
But said is far less intrusive than grumbled , gasped , cautioned , lied .
I once noticed Mary McCarthy ending a line of dialogue with “ she asseverated , ” and had to stop reading to get the dictionary .
Leonard writes fast - paced fiction with terrific dialogue , if sticking with the one word is good enough for him , it is good enough for the rest of us .
You may have noticed I used says a few paragraphs ago .
The present tense often works better than the past tense unless you are writing history .

More than a decade ago , Lawrence K. Grossman , former president of both NBC News and PBS , and Newton N. Minow , the former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission , were asked by several foundations to explore how nonprofits like schools , libraries and museums could tap into emerging digital technologies .
Their bold recommendation in 2001 was to set up a multibillion dollar trust that would act as a “ venture capital fund ” to research learning technology .
After a tortuous journey 
“ It ’s been one ‘ starting all over again ’ after another after another after another , ” Mr. Minow said  their organization , what is now being called the National Center for Research in Advanced Information and Digital Technologies , finally has Congressional appropriation through the Education Department and will be introduced Monday .
It could be handing out grants by fall .
“ It ’s time that education had the equivalent of what the National Science Foundation does for science , Darpa does for the national defense and what N.I.H. does for health , ” Mr. Grossman said in an interview .
He and Mr. Minow , senior counsel at the law firm Sidley Austin , will be the co-chairmen of the nonprofit organization , along with Anne G. Murphy , former director of the American Arts Alliance .

A group of scientists in Japan have invented a lithium polymer battery that can be manufactured using only printing technologies .
The project is being carried out by the Advanced Materials Innovation Center ( AMIC ) , which belongs to an Incorporated Foundation called the Mie Industry and Enterprise Support Center ( MIESC ) .
The lithium - polymer battery developed by the group is flexible and designed for flexible solar batteries , flexible displays , or attachment to curved surfaces .
It is manufactured using printing technology , which means it can be thinner ( around 500 μm ) but have an increased surface area than other batteries .
It can be produced cheaply , is rechargeable , and can also be laminated .
During the development process the group produced two types of prototype , with output voltages of 2 V and 4 V at ambient temperature .
The battery is being developed as part of a three - year research project scheduled to end in March 2011 .
The group is continuing work on improving the manufacturing technologies to make them suitable for commercial production .
The researchers are also working on identifying further applications for the battery .
Lithium - polymer batteries evolved in the mid 1990s from lithium - ion batteries , which have a lithium electrolyte held within an organic solvent .
In the polymer batteries the electrolyte is contained within a polymer substrate such as polyethylene oxide .
The polymer batteries cost less to produce and resist damage better than the lithium - ion batteries .
The Japanese battery is not the first manufactured using printing technology .
In February last year a flexible battery developed in Germany by the Fraunhofer Research Institution for Electronic Nano Systems and made using printing technology was exhibited at the International Nanotechnology Exhibition and Conference , but this battery was a manganese and zinc type .
The Advanced Materials Innovation Center exists to bring together academics and researchers from the private sector together to encourage innovation .
The lithium - polymer battery project is funded by Japan 's Ministry of Education and Science Industry - Academia - government Cooperation Project .
Participants in the project include scientists from Kureha Elastomer Co. Ltd. , Toppan Printing Co. Ltd. , Mie University , and Suzuka National College of Technology , among others .

Daily Show And Colbert Report Going HD For 2010
When a major show announces they are making the switch to HD , I find myself thinking , " Finally ! "
If you have an HD TV you know how annoying it can be watching shows that are n't produced in hi-def .
The latest to get in on the treatment are Comedy Central 's The Daily Show and The Colbert Report .
They 'll begin broadcasting in HD on January 4 , 2010 .
The fact that Tosh.0 , on the same network , has broadcast an entire season ( granted it 's first ) in HD already , this is a bit of a travesty .
Daily and Colbert are two of Comedy Central 's three signature shows .
South Park is the third , but even they 've been HD for a while now .
I had the same reaction earlier this year when The Late Late Show made their own transition to HD .
It does n't make sense for one of a network 's major shows to be so far behind the times .
Is it that expensive with these " talk show " types of formats to transition them to high definition after producing them in regular definition ?
Were Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert worried that they would n't look as pretty if we could see all the lines on their faces ( remember Liz Lemon in hi-def on 30 Rock ! ) ?
The Daily Show and The Colbert Report air in a block on Comedy Central weeknights starting at 11 PM ET .
McAfee is releasing a list today that shows which international Web domains are the most perilous .
The anti-virus software developer analyzed more than 27 million country and generic Web domains for browser exploits , phishing , excessive pop-ups and malicious downloading .
The study found that Cameroon ( .cm ) has the riskiest Web domain , with 36.7 % of its sites posing security risks .
" Because the domain .cm is a common typo for .com , many cybercriminals set up fake typo - squatting sites that lead to malicious downloads , spyware , adware and other potentially unwanted programs , " McAfee says in a press release .
The next four most dangerous country domains are China ( .cn ) , Samoa ( .ws ) , the Philippines ( .ph ) and the former Soviet Union ( .su ) .
In 2008 , Hong Kong 's domain ( .hk ) topped the list , but this year it came in 34th after officials there took action .
McAfee senior research analyst Shane Keats said that bad guys look for low cost , ease of registration and lack of regulation when picking a domain to exploit .
He added that Hong Kong probably increased costs , demanded information ( such as proof of residency , a valid phone number and address ) from users and increased the take - down speed for dangerous websites .
The safest country domain , with only 0.1 % of its sites posing security threats , belongs to Japan ( . jp ) .
It was followed on McAfee 's list by Ireland ( .ie ) , Croatia ( .hr ) , Luxembourg ( .lu ) and Vanuatu ( , vu ) .
The safest non-country domain is .gov .
The most heavily trafficked domain , .com , is the second - most dangerous domain .
Malicious websites range in their capacity to devastate , Keats said .
Some just harass you with endless pop-ups , others can infect your computer with viruses and some can compromise your identity by emulating banking websites .

Patients would welcome an oral treatment , doctors say Oral drugs to treat multiple sclerosis could become available in 2011 after promising results in two trials .
Drug licences have been applied for and the MS Society said it was " great news " for people with MS - current treatments involve injections or infusions .
The trials of the drugs each involved 1,000 people in over 18 countries , the New England Journal of Medicine says .
Cladribine and fingolimod , which come as tablets , cut relapse rates by 50 - 60 % over two years compared with placebos .
Fingolimod was also tested against the widely used injection , beta interferon 1a .
The trial showed the new drug was twice as effective in reducing the number of relapses over a year .
The evidence is now there and we will be working with the relevant authorities to make sure those who will benefit can get access
Dr Doug Brown , Biomedical Research Manager at the MS Society Multiple sclerosis is the most common disabling neurological disorder affecting young adults .
It affects more than 100,000 people in the UK and 2.5 million worldwide .
Symptoms include mobility problems , lack of bladder and bowel control and and blurred vision .
The downside of current treatments is that they have to be injected or given by infusion .
MS sufferers have long hoped a pill would be developed .
Pharmaceutical companies have been competing to get there first .
More choice Dr Doug Brown , Biomedical Research Manager at the MS Society , said : " This is great news for people with MS and signifies a shifting tide in the treatment of the condition .
" Availability of oral therapies will give people greater choice and being able to take a tablet instead of unpleasant injections will come as welcome relief .
" The evidence is now there and we will be working with the relevant authorities to make sure those who will benefit can get access . "
Doctors have also welcomed the studies .
Dr Belinda Weller , a consultant neurologist based in Edinburgh who specialises in MS , said the findings are " very significant " and indicated " a big breakthrough " .
" This is the first major advance in MS therapy for a few years , " she said .
" I hope the drugs will soon be licensed . "
But she expressed concerns both about possible side effects - which the trials suggested could include an increased risk of herpes and cancer - and that the new drugs could push up the cost of treating MS .
" More patients are likely to want to use these new drugs , " she said .
" Some people shun the currently available treatments because of the need to inject .
This could put pressure on hospital budgets . "
The MS Society called on the drug companies to price the drugs reasonably .
" The evidence is now here and we hope to see the pharmaceutical companies price these drugs responsibly so they can be made available to people with MS . "

“ Canada Now Boasts North America ’s Freest Economy ”
I ’m guessing Wee Willie Wilkinson is even happier he ’s Canuck .
The new Index of Economic Freedom is out and the U.S. is falling off the charts :
The U.S. lost ground on many fronts .
Scores declined in seven of the 10 categories of economic freedom .
Losses were particularly significant in the areas of financial and monetary freedom and property rights .
Driving it all were the federal government ’s interventionist responses to the financial and economic crises of the last two years , which have included politically influenced regulatory changes , protectionist trade restrictions , massive stimulus spending and bailouts of financial and automotive firms deemed “ too big to fail . ”
These policies have resulted in job losses , discouraged entrepreneurship , and saddled America with unprecedented government deficits .
Here ’s the kicker :
for the first time in the Index ’s 16 - year history , the U.S. has fallen out of the elite group of countries identified as “ economically free ” by the objective measures of the Index .
So my old boss , Maria Cantwell , is joining forces with John McCain on legislation that would reinstate the Glass - Steagall Act which required banks to choose between operating as a commercial bank or as an investment bank before it was repealed in the late 90s .
Jason Linkins was following the news about the Cantwell - McCain effort and noticed that some random Treasury official was trying to push back on it .
Linkins ' counter - pushback was priceless :
The most cutting remark against McCain and Cantwell 's efforts comes courtesy of Unnamed Treasury Official , who , as you might imagine , is some kind of awesome prick : I think going back to Glass - Steagall would be like going back to the Walkman .
But hey , you 'd go back to your Walkman too , if everytime you put your iPod on shuffle , it blew up the goddamned planet .
Moral of the story : Reinstate Glass - Steagall , save the planet .
Of course , as Meteor Blades points out , given the way Congress deals with this kind of stuff , fat chance of it actually happening .
Would you trust men to take a ' male pill ' ?
That 's the question posed to 380 people in North East England by a team from Teesside University which questioned people about the male contraceptive pill currently undergoing trials .
The research led by Judith Eberhardt , from the University 's Social Futures Institute , involved interviews with 140 men and 240 women and cast doubt on whether Northern men can be trusted to take it .
The findings showed that while men said they would welcome it , women thought their partners could not be trusted to take the contraceptive pill regularly , leading to unplanned pregnancy .
" There 's been some work into the male pill , mainly in the US and Australia , " said Eberhardt .
" But nothing it seems has been done in the North East , which is perceived to be a male - dominated society .
" Men in the North do n't go to the doctors very often and we wanted to see if that approach to health care would influence their attitudes to the male pill .
Past research has shown a link between health awareness and attitudes towards the male pill .
" There were three findings to our research .
Firstly , both men and women had a positive attitude towards the male pill and thought it was a good idea .
" Secondly , women were more positive than men , but women did n't trust men to remember to take the pill every day .
This means that pharmaceutical companies need to look at developing options such as a monthly injection or an implant that could last three years .
" And finally , men in a stable sexual relationship had a better opinion of the male pill than men in casual sexual relationships . "
Writing in the Journal of Family Planning and Reproductive Health Care , Eberhardt said , " Once the male pill is widely available , promotional campaigns could target not only men but also their female partners , as women tend to come into contact with health services more frequently . "

Big pharmaceutical companies once tended to disregard rare diseases , preferring to develop blockbusters for common ailments like diabetes and high cholesterol .
But with sales growth slowing and older blockbusters losing patent protection , the companies have become more willing , even eager , to sell specialized drugs .
“ This is the first step in the pursuit of a formal strategy around orphan drugs and rare diseases , ” David Simmons , president of Pfizer ’s established products business unit , said in an interview .
While there might be few patients with each disease , he said , “ collectively , it ’s a very large patient population with a great unmet medical need . ”
Besides , Genzyme has proved that even a drug for a rare disease can generate big sales if the price of the drug is high enough .
Only about 5,700 people in the world are being treated with Cerezyme .
But since the drug costs about $ 200,000 a patient each year , sales exceeded $ 1 billion last year .
Pfizer is not alone in pursuing treatments for rare diseases .
In October , GlaxoSmithKline announced a deal with Prosensa , a Dutch company , to develop drugs for Duchenne muscular dystrophy .
And in June , Novartis won approval from the Food and Drug Administration to sell its drug Ilaris as a treatment for cryopyrin- associated periodic syndrome .
Only about 300 Americans suffer from that syndrome , an inflammatory condition caused by a gene mutation .
Philip Nadeau , an analyst at Cowen & Company , called the entrance of Pfizer as a competitor a “ modest negative ” for Genzyme .
However , Mr. Nadeau said , “ even Pfizer ’s marketing prowess is unlikely to relieve ” safety concerns some doctors have about the Protalix drug .
The main concern is that because it is produced in plant cells , taliglucerase may spur immune reactions in some patients .
Genzyme ’s stock rose a bit less than 1 percent , to $ 51.11 .
The company announced Monday that it had resumed shipping some newly manufactured Cerezyme .
Manufacturing had been shut down in June after a virus contaminated the company ’s factory in Boston .
When Google began soliciting feedback from users about what features they would most like to see in the next version of YouTube , the response was an overwhelmingly enthusiastic request for standards - based open video : users called for Google to support the HTML5 video element .
Google responded by rolling out an experimental HTML5 - based player on YouTube that allows users to watch videos without having to depend on Adobe 's Flash plugin .
Vimeo , another leading video hosting website , followed suit this afternoon and rolled out an HTML5 beta test of its own .
Of course , both of them are lagging behind DailyMotion , which launched its HTML5 beta last year .
The giants of the Web video are clearly responding to growing pressure from tech - savvy users to ditch Flash and adopt standards - based solutions that mesh better with the open Web .
The HTML5 video element integrates seamlessly with conventional HTML content and can be manipulated with JavaScript and CSS , making it possible for Web developers to make their video player user interfaces match the look and feel of their websites .
In a blog post written today , Vimeo identified some of the key advantages of its new HTML5 - based player .
The player loads faster , offers smoother playback , and allows users to jump to various points in the stream without having to wait for buffering .
In addition to fundamentally improving the user experience , HTML5 video will also enable content to reach platforms like the iPhone that are n't officially supported by Adobe .
Google first expressed public interest in adopting the HTML5 video element for YouTube last year when it presented an early mockup of a standards - based Web video player at the Google I /O conference .
As we explained at the time , Google and other Web content delivery companies have a lot to gain from standards - based video .
It will enable them to reduce their exposure to lock - in and avoid proprietary video client technologies that are controlled by single vendors .
Thanks to the standards process , the future of native Web video can be guided through an inclusive process in which stakeholders are allowed to participate .
It 's also a win for users who will finally have the ability to choose between multiple interoperable client implementations .
Although Adobe has taken some promising steps to open key parts of the Flash specification and has released the source code of some of the underlying components of the Flash player , independent developers contend that those moves have not been sufficient to enable the creation of a fully - functional third - party open source player .
Flash is often criticized by users who are frustrated with its poor performance and stability , high resource consumption , frequent security vulnerabilities , lack of conduciveness to accessibility , poor browser integration , and a multitude of other problems .
The quality of the plug - in is even worse on Mac OS X and Linux , reflecting Adobe 's lack of commitment to delivering a consistent user experience across platforms .
Adobe is seemingly oblivious to these problems and often responds dismissively when engaging with the public .
It 's likely that frustration with Flash 's flaws is one factor that is driving users to advocate standards - based solutions .
Challenges for standards - based video
Although HTML5 video has a whole lot of advantages , there are still some major challenges that need to be addressed before it can gain widespread adoption .
One of the most significant challenges is that Microsoft 's Internet Explorer Web browser has poor support for emerging standards and does not yet have an HTML5 video implementation .
Fortunately , even Microsoft is beginning to recognize the inevitability of standards - based video .
Microsoft began collaborating with the HTML5 working group last year and publicly endorsed the HTML5 video element .
It 's still not clear if Microsoft plans to add the feature to its browser in the near future , but it is starting to look very likely that the company will eventually do so .
Another problem that is impeding ubiquitous adoption of HTML5 video is an ongoing dispute about what multimedia codecs should be used on the Internet .
Google and Apple favor h.264 while Opera and Mozilla prefer Ogg Theora .
Although Theora does n't yet rival h.264 in performance and compression quality , its advantage is that it is thought to be unencumbered by software patents — meaning that it can be used royalty - free and distributed in open source software applications .
As we explained in our detailed examination of the codec debate last year , the future of h.264 licensing costs is somewhat ambiguous , making it a risky choice for the Web .
There are also unanswered questions about Ogg 's patent status , however , and some browser vendors are concerned about the risk of submarine patents .
Another problem is the limited out - of - the - box support for hardware - accelerated Ogg playback in the mobile and embedded space .
This debate is n't any closer to a resolution today .
Vimeo and YouTube are both using h.264 , which means that their new HTML5 video players do n't work at all in Firefox .
A seemingly obvious solution is for Firefox and other browsers that can't distribute patented codecs to simply expose platform - level video playback engines in the browser so that the HTML5 video player can leverage the codecs already installed on the user 's system .
Mozilla has resisted this solution for ideological reasons : the organization does n't want to encourage adoption of codecs that can't be used royalty - free , because they fear that doing so would put open source implementations at a disadvantage and potentially disenfranchise content creators who can't afford the patent licensing costs .
Conclusion
Although there are still a number of important problems to solve before open video can displace Flash - based video playback on the Web , it seems likely that we will see more progress now that the major players are all on board and the users are enthusiastically calling for better standards support .
An enterprising critic of Republican senators discovered a flaw in the Republican fundraising machine early Friday morning , delivering an unexpected invective to would - be GOP supporters .
The National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee website announces the name of each donor that makes a contribution .
The donor ’s name appears in a graphic mid-way down the page .

“ Help Elect Republicans to the Senate , ” it says .
“ Just like [ donor ’s name ] from [ donor ’s location ] who donated [ donation amount ] . ”
But instead of their name , the critic put “ F*** YOU . ”

WASHINGTON – President Barack Obama plans to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan over six months , an accelerated timetable — with an endgame built in — that would have the first Marines there as early as Christmas , a senior administration official told The Associated Press .
With the full complement of new troops expected to be in Afghanistan by next summer , the heightened pace of Obama ’s military deployment in the 8 - year - old war appears to mimic the 2007 troop surge in Iraq , a 20,000 - strong force addition under former President George W. Bush .
Similar in strategy to that mission , Obama ’s Afghan surge aims to reverse gains by Taliban insurgents and to secure population centers in the volatile south and east parts of the country .
In a prime - time speech to the nation Tuesday night from West Point that ends a 92 - day review , Obama will seek to help sell his much bigger , costlier war plan by tying the escalation to an exit strategy , said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity .
With U.S. casualties in Afghanistan sharply increasing and little sign of progress , the war Obama once liked to call one “ of necessity , ” not choice , has grown less popular with the public and within his own Democratic party .
In recent days , leading Democrats have talked of setting tough conditions on deeper U.S. involvement , or even staging outright opposition .
The 30,000 new U.S. troops will bring the total in Afghanistan to more than 100,000 U.S. forces by next summer .
New infusions of U.S. Marines will begin moving into Afghanistan almost as soon as Obama announces a redrawn battle strategy .
A shrimp that lives on southwest coast of Australia has a new name , thanks to an Australian graduate student , eBay and former NBA basketball player Luc Longley .
It all started when Anna McCallum , now a doctoral student at the University of Melbourne , discovered a previously unknown shrimp while working as an assistant on a research boat .
Instead of naming it herself , she decided to auction the right to name the shrimp on eBay and donate the proceeds to the Australian Marine Conservation Society .
The bidding got hot and heavy with sea-life lovers like Bob Rosenberry , publisher of Shrimp News International , bidding up to $ 2,000 .
Still , the winning bid of $ 2,900 came as a shock .
" It was a total surprise that a basketballer would be interested in this little deep - sea shrimp , " McCallum told The Scientist .
Longley , who had participated in marine conservation efforts before , named the shrimp Lebbeus clarehanna after his 15 - year - old daughter , Clare Hanna Longley .
The auction took place in March , and the description and name of the shrimp appeared in a recent issue of Zootaxa .
Surprisingly , the shrimp auction is not the first sale of a species naming right , nor the most lucrative .
In 2007 , a black - tie charity auction in Indonesia fielded the naming rights of 10 fish go for more than 2 million dollars .
Two years before , a Bolivian monkey 's naming rights were sold for $ 650,000 .
Now , it 's almost a common fundraising tactic for conservation groups and universities .
One thing you can't say for previous auctions , though :
Their winning bidders did not include any 7 - foot NBA champions of the tall white - guy variety that opposing fans love to hate .
Longley was part of three championship Chicago Bulls teams led by Michael Jordan .
And now he has a shrimp too ?
Hardly seems fair .

Medics at Southampton General Hospital could not get the man 's penis out of the stainless steel pipe because the restricted blood flow had caused it to become aroused .
More offshore wind turbines could soon be seen around the UK Successful bids for nine new offshore wind farm zone licences within UK waters have been announced .
A consortium including Npower and Norway 's Statkraft won the licence for the biggest zone , in Dogger Bank , which could produce nine gigawatts of energy .
Turbines in the nine zones could generate up to 32 gigawatts of power , a quarter of the UK 's electricity needs .
The winners have signed exclusive agreements with the Crown Estate , which owns the UK seabed .
' Delighted '
Proposals for the wind farms will now go through planning and consent stages .
It will create one of the biggest infrastructure projects for wind energy in the world , with construction beginning in 2014 at the earliest .
The second largest zone , with a potential yield of 7.2 gigawatts , is at Norfolk Bank .
The wind farm licence there has been won by a consortium of Scottish Power Renewables and Sweden 's Vattenfall Vindkraft .
Speaking on behalf of the joint venture , Keith Anderson said the companies were " delighted " to have been awarded the development rights .
" It will be a major engineering challenge , but the combined experience of both partners acquired over decades in the energy business will help us deliver a project that will deliver enough green power to meet the equivalent annual electricity demand of more than five million homes in the UK , " he said .
New jobs
This is the third time companies have had a chance to bid for zones .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the government 's policies to support offshore wind energy had put the UK ahead of other countries .
" This new round of licences provides a substantial new platform for investing in UK industrial capacity , " he added .
" The offshore wind industry is at the heart of the UK economy 's shift to low carbon and could be worth £ 75bn and support up to 70,000 jobs by 2020 , " he said .
However , the British Wind Energy Association ( BWEA ) warned that the UK would only truly benefit if the turbines were manufactured here .
" We need to ensure the UK benefits through a boost in manufacturing , engineering and skills : but this will only happen if additional action is taken by the government through working actively to create coastal manufacturing hubs , " said Maria McCaffery , BWEA chief executive .

Phil and Luciaetta Ivey Divorce
December 30 , 2009 Nicole Gordon
Phil Ivey and his wife Luciaetta ended their seven - year marriage this week , filing a joint divorce petition in a Nevada court on December 22 .
Their request was granted yesterday , December 29 , and the court records were sealed .
The Iveys were high school sweethearts who married in May 2002 .
They have no children together , and whether or not they signed a prenuptial agreement is unknown .
In addition to his seven World Series of Poker bracelets and a World Poker Tour title , Ivey has amassed more than $ 12 million in career tournament winnings .
He raked in more than $ 15.6 million online between 2007 and 2009 and has earned untold millions in live cash games .
Ivey 's divorce marks a bittersweet end to what was a spectacular year for him on the felt .
Ivey won two WSOP bracelets this summer and made the " November Nine , " finishing the Main Event in seventh place .
It 's no secret that " Avatar " has been stunningly successful on nearly every front .
The James Cameron - directed sci- fi epic is already the fourth - highest - grossing film of all time , having earned more than $ 1 billion around the globe in less than three weeks of theatrical release .
The film also has garnered effusive praise from critics , who 've been planting its flag on a variety of critics Top 10 lists ( it has earned an impressive 83 score on Rotten Tomatoes ) .
The 3 - D trip to Pandora is also viewed as a veritable shoo - in for a best picture Oscar nomination when the academy announces its nominees on Feb .

But amid this avalanche of praise and popularity , guess who hates the movie ?
America 's prickly cadre of political conservatives .
For years , pundits and bloggers on the right have ceaselessly attacked liberal Hollywood for being out of touch with rank and file moviegoers , complaining that executives and filmmakers continue to make films that have precious little resonance with Middle America .
They have reacted with scorn to such high - profile liberal political advocacy films as " Syriana , " " Milk , " " W. , " " Religulous , " " Lions for Lambs , " " Brokeback Mountain , " " In the Valley of Elah , " " Rendition " and " Good Night , and Good Luck , " saying that the movies ' poor performance at the box office was a clear sign of how thoroughly uninterested real people were in the pet causes of showbiz progressives .
Of course , " Avatar " totally turns this theory on its head .
As a host of critics have noted , the film offers a blatantly pro-environmental message ; it portrays U.S. military contractors in a decidedly negative light ; and it clearly evokes the can 't - we - all - get along vibe of the 1960s counterculture .
These are all messages guaranteed to alienate everyday moviegoers , so say the right - wing pundits -- and yet the film has been wholeheartedly embraced by audiences everywhere , from Mississippi to Manhattan .
To say that the film has evoked a storm of ire on the right would be an understatement .
Big Hollywood 's John Nolte , one of my favorite outspoken right - wing film essayists , blasted the film , calling it " a sanctimonious thud of a movie so infested with one - dimensional characters and PC cliches that not a single plot turn , large or small , surprises ....
Think of ' Avatar ' as ' Death Wish ' for leftists , a simplistic , revisionist revenge fantasy where if you freakin ' hate the bad guys ( America ) you 're able to forgive the by - the - numbers predictability of it all . "
John Podhoretz , the Weekly Standard 's film critic , called the film " blitheringly stupid ; indeed , it 's among the dumbest movies I 've ever seen . "
He goes on to say : " You 're going to hear a lot over the next couple of weeks about the movie 's politics -- about how it 's a Green epic about despoiling the environment , and an attack on the war in Iraq ....
The conclusion does ask the audience to root for the defeat of American soldiers at the hands of an insurgency .
So it is a deep expression of anti-Americanism -- kind of .
The thing is , one would be giving Jim Cameron too much credit to take ' Avatar ' -- with its ... hatred of the military and American institutions and the notion that to be human is just way uncool -- at all seriously as a political document .
It 's more interesting as an example of how deeply rooted these standard issue counterculture cliches in Hollywood have become by now . "
Ross Douthat , writing in the New York Times , took Cameron to task on another favorite conservative front , as yet another Hollywood filmmaker who refuses to acknowledge the power of religion .
Douthat calls " Avatar " the " Gospel according to James .
But not the Christian Gospel .
Instead , ' Avatar ' is Cameron 's long apologia for pantheism -- a faith that equates God with Nature , and calls humanity into religious communion with the natural world . "
Douthat contends that societies close to nature , like the Na'vi in " Avatar , " are n't shining Edens at all -- " they 're places where existence tends to be nasty , brutish and short . "
There are tons of other grumpy conservative broadsides against the film , but I 'll spare you the details , except to say that Cameron 's grand cinematic fantasy , with its mixture of social comment , mysticism and transcendent , fanboy - style video game animation , seems to have hit a very raw nerve with political conservatives , who view everything -- foreign affairs , global warming , the White House Christmas tree -- through the prism of partisan sloganeering .
But why is it doing so well with everyday moviegoers if it's so full of supposedly buzz - killing liberal messages ?
" It has the politics of the left , but it also has extraordinary spectacle , " says Govindini Murty , co-founder of the pioneering conservative blog Libertas and executive producer of the new conservative film " Kalifornistan . "
" Jim Cameron did n't come out nowhere .
He came on the heels of all the left - wing filmmakers who went before him , who knew that someone with their point of view would have the resources to finally make a breakthrough political film .
But even though ' Avatar ' has an incredibly disturbing anti-human , anti-military , anti-Western world view , it has incredible spectacle and technology and great filmmaking to capture people 's attention .
The politics are going right over people 's heads .
Its audience is n't reading the New York Times or the National Review . "
I suspect that 's a good explanation .
But if I were trying to get to the bottom of conservative complaints with " Avatar , " I 'd offer three more key reasons why the film has set the right 's hair on fire :
1 ) Glorifying soft - headed environmentalism :
If you had n't noticed , the conservative movement has become the leading focal point for skepticism about global warming .
The Wall Street Journal 's ardently right - wing editorial pages have been chock - full of stories ridiculing everything including government sponsorship of alternative energy , nutty Prius enthusiasts and scientists who allegedly suppressed climate change data that called into question their claims about global warming ( a flap the WSJ dubbed " Climategate " ) .
Ever since Al Gore took center stage with his documentary , " An Inconvenient Truth , " conservatives have been falling over each other in their attempts to mock liberal planet savers , taking special pleasure in slamming Hollywood environmentalists who fly private jets or live in huge houses .
( As soon as Climategate erupted , two Hollywood conservatives surfaced , asking the academy to take back Gore 's " Inconvenient Truth " Oscar , even though , inconveniently , the Oscar had actually gone to the film 's director , not Gore . )
So Cameron 's giddy embrace of a primitive people who live in harmony with their land -- and his scathing portrayal of a soulless corporation willing to do anything , including kill innocent natives , to steal and exploit their planet 's valuable natural resources -- is the kind of anti-technology , pro-environment dramaturgy that sets off fire alarms .
If " Avatar " had been a western that showed sympathy for the Indians ( many have in fact compared its storyline to Kevin Costner 's " Dances with Wolves " ) , conservatives would probably have been up in arms too .
As it is , they have been content to hoot at Cameron 's portrayal of the Na'vi 's one - ness with nature , with Podhoretz writing : " Like the Keebler elves , the Blue People all live in a big tree together and they go to church at another big tree , under which we learn lives Mother Earth , only since it is n't earth , she is n't called Mother Earth , but the Great Mother or something like that . "
2 ) Godless Hollywood triumphs again :
Conservatives have complained for years that Hollywood ignores , laughs at or disrespects religion .
And to be fair , they are not so wrong .
It 's almost as rare to see a film with a sympathetic portrayal of an openly religious character as it is to see a film with a leading role for an African American actress .
I think it 's a stretch to call Hollywood godless , but it would certainly be fair to call it an extremely secular world .
Conservatives are always quick to point out that when someone actually made an openly religious film -- and of course we 're talking about Mel Gibson 's " The Passion of the Christ " -- it made hundreds of millions of dollars .
Of course , they usually fail to mention that when Hollywood made 2005 's " The Nativity Story , " a sweet , very respectful religious drama , it earned $ 37 million in the U.S. , just about what it cost to make .
Ross Douthat is probably right .
Moviegoers are far more comfortable with a fuzzy , inspirational form of pantheism than they are with an openly biblical message .
3 ) Hollywood 's long history of anti-military sloganeering :
There is no doubt that " Avatar " portrays its military contractor characters as barbarous mercenaries , willing -- even eager -- to wipe out innocent natives in their pursuit of Pandora 's precious resources .
It almost feels as if Cameron is drawing parallels , not only to the Iraq war , but to Vietnam , where the military found itself in the nihilistic position of destroying villages just to save them .
Even the New Yorker 's David Denby , hardly a die - hard conservative , found himself in awe of the film 's " anti-imperialist spectacle . "
But while Hollywood often makes antiwar movies , " Avatar " is something different -- a peaceful warrior film , celebrating the newly aroused consciousness of a Marine turned defender of a higher faith .
What 's fascinating is that the American people , who have almost always shown strong support for our foreign wars , would happily embrace a film that portrays its military characters in such an unflattering light .
My guess is that audiences have seen past the obvious because the film is set in a faraway , interplanetary future , not in present - day America .
When Russian political dissidents wanted to criticize their oppressive regimes , they would often write stories or make films that were set in the past , inoculating themselves by using a 15th century czar as a stand - in for the tyrant of the day .
Cameron has done the same thing , but by moving forward into the future , creating a safe distance for his veiled ( and not - so - thinly veiled ) social messages .
" Avatar " has , of course , far more on its mind than its politics .
It 's a triumph of visual imagination and the world 's first great 3 - D movie .
But it is fascinating to see how today 's ideology - obsessed conservatives have managed to walk away from such a crowd - pleasing triumph and only see the film 's political subtext , not the groundbreaking artistry that 's staring them right in the face .

Technology develops at such an electrifying pace that sometimes it's hard to keep up – just ask batteries , the faceless bricks toiling under the bonnet of our 24 - hour , connect - anywhere society .
They do heroic work , keeping our touchscreens glowing , our laptops humming and our phones ringing , but in the race to keep up with the devices they power , batteries all too often fall flat .
" Hang on a minute , " you say , " my phone 's about to die . "
Ten years ago , when your old brick kept plugging away for a week between charges , phones did n't have the power to check the football scores , shoot video or play Scrabble against some guy in South Korea .
And not surprisingly , all those things squeeze more juice out of our batteries .
" We 're seeing huge improvements in technology – better processors , more memory and bigger disc drives , " says Adam Leach , a mobile phone expert at the technology analysts Ovum .
" But the one thing we 're seeing only incremental improvements in is batteries .
They 're one of the big inhibitors in technology . "
Next week , Apple is expected to unveil its newest baby – rumoured to be a tablet device .
Expect the big questions to be :
What does it do , how much does it cost – and what 's the battery life ?
With fleets of electric cars quietly revving their battery - powered engines , demands on our batteries will only grow .
So , two more questions :
Why is our power struggling to keep up ?
And what are the world 's white - coated battery boffins doing about it ?
Forty - five years ago , when , to most people at least , chips only ever came with fish , a man called Gordon Moore wrote a paper in which he said the number of transistors that could be squeezed on to an integrated circuit doubles about every two years .
Three years later , Moore co-founded Intel , whose computer chips have , to this day , developed almost exactly at the dizzying pace he predicted .
Today , an Intel microprocessor boasts more than a billion transistors packed so densely that you could fit two million of the things on the full - stop at the end of this sentence .
What became known as Moore 's Law has driven exponential growth in the digital revolution – the more transistors you can pack into a circuit , the faster and more powerful its chips can run while remaining cheap .
But the batteries keeping those circuits pinging are not digital and still work according to basic principles developed more than 200 years ago .
In the 1780s , Italian physicist Luigi Galvani discovered that a dead frog 's leg would spring to life when he applied two pieces of metal .
Galvani had created a crude circuit and the phenomenon was taken up by his friend , the aristocrat professor , Alessandro Volta .
His voltaic pile swapped frogs for brine - soaked paper and pieces of metal for a stack of alternating zinc and copper disks .
Volta had created the world 's first modern battery .
A battery remains , by its simplest definition , a device that turns stored chemical energy into electrical energy .
A chemical reaction takes place within a series of cells with negative and positive electrodes separated by conductive electrolyte .
When you hook up the battery , positively charged ions " swim " from the negative to the positive electrode , prompting negatively charged electrons to power the bulb of a torch or the screen of your iPhone .
It 's a chemical process and , up to a certain point , you can't shrink chemistry .
Peter Bruce , a professor of chemistry at the University of St Andrews , says that while computer performance has effectively doubled every two years , the energy density in batteries has increased five times in about 100 years .
" If you want to store more energy you really have to develop new materials and new concepts , " he says .
" It 's not just making the same things smaller . "
Bruce is among a host of scientists racing to get more out of the modern battery .
He owes a debt not only to Volta but also to the man whose work in the 1970s gave us the modern rechargeable battery that powers nearly all our gadgets .
Stan Whittingham , a British - born American chemist who studied at Oxford in the 1960s , was working at the research division of the oil giant , Exxon , when he realised that the excellent energy - storing properties of the element lithium made it an ideal material to be used in rechargeable batteries .
" A lithium - ion battery holds about five times as much energy as a lead one , " Whittingham says on the phone from Binghamton University in New York , where he 's a professor of chemistry .
" It got a lot of people excited because it was really a technology - changing idea .
Without lithium - ion batteries , you would n't have your iPod or your mobile phone .
They 've given us so much but of course people want more and more . "
Bruce is taking up that challenge with his " air - fuelled " rechargeable lithium battery .
Put very simply , the Stair cell ( St Andrews air cell ) uses nothing more complicated than air as a reagent in a battery instead of costly chemicals .
By freeing up space and exploiting one of the few elements that is free , Bruce 's cells can squeeze more power into a smaller space at a reduced cost .
" By using air in the cell we can get much higher energy storage up to a factor of 10 , " Bruce says .
" That 's exciting because it 's difficult to improve the lithium ion battery beyond a factor of two . "
A battery with 10 times the storage of the one powering your phone would see a return to the days of weekly phone charging .
Meanwhile , other scientists are working to solve that other great problem of the modern battery – the time it takes to recharge .
Gerbrand Ceder at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) has been looking at improving the way the lithium ions themselves move through batteries – the faster they " swim " , the more quickly they charge the battery .
Ceder and his team manipulated the materials inside batteries to make the ions ' passage smoother and watched as they travelled at incredible speeds .
Ceder estimates that a prototype battery made using the process could be charged not in hours or even minutes but seconds .
" If we could cut charging time from , say , two hours to one hour , you would probably still do it overnight , " he says .
" But if it 's one minute , you would stand by and wait – it would be like filling your car or getting a cup of coffee . "
Ceder has also worked with a team that has used genetically - engineered viruses to build the positively and negatively charged ends of a lithium - ion battery .
The new batteries would be more flexible and efficient than existing technology but , like MIT 's fast - charging battery and Bruce 's Stair cell , they are very much on the laboratory drawing board .
It 's a measure of both the greatness of the modern battery and the challenges faced by developers that , as Whittingham puts it ( perhaps with a degree of pride ) : " For the next five years at least it 's just lithium . "
In the meantime , manufacturers are racing to launch energy - efficient screens and hardware that place less demand on batteries .
But with so much riding on the next big breakthrough , it 's only a matter of time before we get batteries fit to power the next generation of gadgets and cars .
For those of us increasingly shackled to our phone chargers , that time can't come soon enough .
More jolt for your volt :
How to boost batteries
Keep it clean
Saving power is all about efficiency and if the cooling fan in your laptop has to work overtime because your air vents are clogged with dusty bits of biscuit , do n't be surprised if your battery conks out at that crucial moment .
App hazard
Being able to play games and find your nearest Pizza
Hut is what makes the modern mobile phone so great , but many applications are horrible drains on power .
The same applies to laptops .
Keep use to a minimum and activate any in - app settings that might save juice .
Airplane mode
Finding and locking on to a mobile phone network is hard work for a phone .
If you 're in a place with no or low coverage put your phone out of its off - the - grid misery and switch to airplane mode .
Turning off 3G in places with patchy data coverage helps , too .
Feeling sleepy
It 's no surprise that if your gadget is asleep it 's going to drain less power .
Get in the habit of hitting hibernate and , if you can , shorten the time it takes for your phone to switch to sleep mode .
Dim thinking
Even hi-tech batteries have their work cut out to power the increasingly large screens on our phones and laptops .
Some screens account for more than a third of power usage , so lowering your brightness levels a notch will increase battery life .
Defrag your drive
Hard drives quickly become inefficient when they become cluttered , demanding more power just to keep running .
Use a defragmentation application to clean things up , improving performance and battery life at a stroke .
Be invisible
It seems like nearly every smartphone application " would like to use your current location " .
Often it 's useful but the GPS receiver in your device needs a lot of power so consider hitting " no thanks " .
Try to minimise use of mapping apps , too .
Make it feel useful
The little electrons that swim up and down your battery like to be exercised so show them some love .
Keep using your device and go through at least one full charge cycle per month .
A battery shut up in a drawer is neither happy nor efficient .

The New York State Bar Association holds its Annual Meeting January 25 - 30 , 2010 in New York City .
The Committee on Women in the Law is sponsoring a program called “ Weathering Tough Times : Strategic Planning for Your Practice . ”
The agenda appears after the jump .
It includes an 11:00 a.m. panel entitled , “ Their Point of View : Tips From the Other Side , ” in which “ [ a ] distinguished panel of gentlemen from the legal field will discuss the strengths and weaknesses of women in the areas of communication , negotiation , mediation , arbitration , organization , and women ’s overall management of their legal work . ”
I call for all members of the NYSBA to boycott this panel discussion .
Yes , the speakers have a right to speak , but we do n’t have to go and listen .
Men have been telling us FOR YEARS how we do n’t measure up .
To have a panel of men , endorsed by the New York State Bar Association , discussing our “ strengths and weaknesses , ” is a regression and an insult to all women in the legal profession .

Gov. Bill Ritter is expected to announce Wednesday that he will withdraw from the race for governor , numerous sources close to Ritter confirmed Tuesday night .
Ritter began making calls to other prominent Colorado Democrats around 6 p.m. notifying them of his decision .
Sources said his office contacted key legislators asking them to be available for an 11 a.m. press conference where Ritter will make his announcement .
Ritter ’s decision , which was first reported by a blog affiliated with Congressional Quarterly , was confirmed by The Denver Post and others .
Repeated calls for comment to Ritter ’s staff and communications director were not returned tonight .
The governor was said to be making calls to other Democrats , informing them of the decision .
House Speaker Terrance Carroll however said he had not been contacted by the governor ’s office and had not been told of the governor ’s plan .
Polls have shown that Ritter is trailing Republican and former U.S. Rep. Scott McInnis in the race .
His departure would clear the way for popular Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar , U.S. Rep .
Ed Perlmutter or others to enter the race for governor .

The brothers tortured the pensioner for two years
Two men who " showed no mercy " to their own grandfather as they tortured him in south London have been jailed for life for his murder .
Paul Peters , 76 , was assaulted with fists , feet , bottles and furniture over a two - year spell by half - brothers Wayne Edwards , 33 , and Anton Sanderson , 24 .
Mr Peters ' half - naked body was found on the kitchen floor of his Battersea flat on 22 May 2009 , the Old Bailey heard .
Edwards and Sanderson were both jailed for a minimum of 20 years .
The court heard Mr Peters had complained to the social services and police a number of times , including days before his murder telling officers : " God knows what could happen to me . "
' Gratuitous violence '
Sentencing the brothers , Judge Martyn Zeidman said : " Throughout history , ordinary people have been moved to do great things to protect their family .
" But you have both murdered your own grandfather , and you have done so in a horrific manner , showing him no mercy . "
Edward Brown QC , prosecuting , had told the court : " It seems his killing was for no other reason than to satisfy the need of each of these two defendants for gratuitous violence , to be meted out to an elderly and frail man . "
Edwards , who lived with Mr Peters , and Sanderson , of Lower Edmonton , north London , both had convictions for violence .
In the month before his murder the pensioner twice contacted police about rows with Edwards , who was known to be a " menace " .
On 28 April Mr Peters made a statement saying : " I do not want Wayne living with me , this could escalate and God knows what could happen to me . "
Mr Peters had also been in contact with social services since January 2008 , reporting assaults by Edwards and his threats to kill .
Edwards was arrested but released by police who told social worker Carla Daly that the evidence against him was " weak " , the court heard .
She arranged to have the locks changed , but a day before his killing Mr Peters told her that he had let Edwards back in .

Researchers have new insight into the sex lives of the much - maligned mosquitoes that are responsible for the vast majority of malaria deaths , according to a report published online on December 31st in Current Biology , a Cell Press publication .
In finding a partner of the right species type , male and female mosquitoes depend on their ability to " sing " in perfect harmony .
Those tones are produced and varied based on the frequency of their wing beats in flight .
" Everyone must be familiar with the maddening whine a mosquito makes as it hones in for a bite , " said Gabriella Gibson of the University of Greenwich at Medway .
" There 's no doubt many of us have wondered why it makes its presence so obvious -- surely , after all of these centuries of blood - feeding , selection should have favored a more stealthy approach that would leave mosquitoes less vulnerable to the defensive attacks of its unsettled host .
Our findings suggest that mosquitoes rely on the sounds they make to attract a mate of the right species , a behavior that is far more vulnerable to selection than avoiding the risk of being squashed by the rare host that is still awake at feeding time . "
The Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes in fact include a considerable amount of genetic diversity , representing a complex of seven species and several chromosomal forms .
And that diversity comes with real consequences for humans , explained Gibson and Ian Russell of the University of Sussex .
The complexity of malaria epidemiology and control is due in part to the mosquito's remarkable genetic plasticity , enabling its adaptation to a widening range of human - influenced habitats .
The new results help to explain how those different mosquito forms manage to reproductively isolate themselves and maintain that genetic diversity , even while some , including the " M " and " S " forms found in Burkina Faso that were the subject of the current study , can be found traveling together in the very same swarms .
Gibson and Russell 's team first discovered that male and female mosquitoes harmonize with each other .
Gibson said that this is analogous to two partially deaf singers -- one alto and the other soprano -- who can hear low frequencies , but perhaps not their own or each other 's songs .
Instead , they listen to the terrible dissonance if one or the other goes a bit sharp or flat , which they can get rid of by adjusting their respective tones until the dissonance diminishes to nothing .
" They can do this even if they each sing a different note , say a ' middle C ' and a ' G ' four tones higher , " Russell said .
" By listening and subtly altering their pitch to minimize the dissonance , they achieve their goal of ' singing ' in a perfect harmony that we , but not they , can hear . "
The researchers have now shown that two mosquitoes do n't harmonize successfully if they are of the same sex or if they are not the same type of mosquito .
They might try for a while , Gibson explained , but they never find that harmony and eventually give up trying .
And that leads Gibson to another take - home of the study .
" Even the most ' lowly creatures , ' such as mosquitoes , have highly evolved neurosensory systems that can process relatively simple auditory inputs to produce motor outputs enabling them to distinguish between other types of mosquito that are so closely related we need to analyze their DNA to tell them apart . "

Dabire , Institut de Recherche en Science de la Sante / Centre Muraz , Burkina Faso ; I.J. Russell , University of Sussex , U.K. ; and G.

The Relevance of Anarcho- syndicalism
Noam Chomsky interviewed by Peter Jay
The Jay Interview , July 25 , 1976
QUESTION : Professor Chomsky , perhaps we should start by trying to define what is not meant by anarchism — the word anarchy is derived , after all , from the Greek , literally meaning “ no government . ”
Now , presumably people who talk about anarchy or anarchism as a system of political philosophy do n’t just mean that , as it were , as of January 1st next year , government as we now understand it will suddenly cease ; there would be no police , no rules of the road , no laws , no tax collectors , no post office , and so forth .
Presumably , it means something more complicated than that .
CHOMSKY : Well , yes to some of those questions , no to others .
They may very well mean no policemen , but I do n’t think they would mean no rules of the road .
In fact , I should say to begin with that the term anarchism is used to cover quite a range of political ideas , but I would prefer to think of it as the libertarian left , and from that point of view anarchism can be conceived as a kind of voluntary socialism , that is , as libertarian socialist or anarcho - syndicalist or communist anarchist , in the tradition of , say , Bakunin and Kropotkin and others .
They had in mind a highly organized form of society , but a society that was organized on the basis of organic units , organic communities .
And generally , they meant by that the workplace and the neighborhood , and from those two basic units there could derive through federal arrangements a highly integrated kind of social organization which might be national or even international in scope .
And these decisions could be made over a substantial range , but by delegates who are always part of the organic community from which they come , to which they return , and in which , in fact , they live .
QUESTION : So it does n’t mean a society in which there is , literally speaking , no government , so much as a society in which the primary source of authority comes , as it were , from the bottom up , and not the top down .
Whereas representative democracy , as we have it in the United States and in Britain , would be regarded as a from - the - top - down authority , even though ultimately the voters decide .

ESO has just released a stunning new image of the vast cloud known as the Cat 's Paw Nebula or NGC 6334 .
This complex region of gas and dust , where numerous massive stars are born , lies near the heart of the Milky Way galaxy , and is heavily obscured by intervening dust clouds .
Few objects in the sky have been as well named as the Cat's Paw Nebula , a glowing gas cloud resembling the gigantic pawprint of a celestial cat out on an errand across the Universe .
British astronomer John Herschel first recorded NGC 6334 in 1837 during his stay in South Africa .
Despite using one of the largest telescopes in the world at the time , Herschel seems to have only noted the brightest part of the cloud , seen here towards the lower left .
NGC 6334 lies about 5500 light - years away in the direction of the constellation Scorpius ( the Scorpion ) and covers an area on the sky slightly larger than the full Moon .
The whole gas cloud is about 50 light - years across .
The nebula appears red because its blue and green light are scattered and absorbed more efficiently by material between the nebula and Earth .
The red light comes predominantly from hydrogen gas glowing under the intense glare of hot young stars .
NGC 6334 is one of the most active nurseries of massive stars in our galaxy and has been extensively studied by astronomers .
The nebula conceals freshly minted brilliant blue stars -- each nearly ten times the mass of our Sun and born in the last few million years .
The region is also home to many baby stars that are buried deep in the dust , making them difficult to study .
In total , the Cat's Paw Nebula could contain several tens of thousands of stars .
Particularly striking is the red , intricate bubble in the lower right part of the image .
This is most likely either a star expelling large amount of matter at high speed as it nears the end of its life or the remnant of a star that already has exploded .
This new portrait of the Cat's Paw Nebula was created from images taken with the Wide Field Imager ( WFI ) instrument at the 2.2 - metre MPG / ESO telescope at the La Silla Observatory in Chile , combining images taken through blue , green and red filters , as well as a special filter designed to let through the light of glowing hydrogen .
There has been a lot of talk lately about the fact that organizers of the National Tea Party Convention were trying to keep the media from covering the event , especially the speeches that will be delivered by Sarah Palin and Rep. Michele Bachmann .
Well , apparently Palin has decided that her speech can be covered by the press , according to The Tennessean :
Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has decided to allow media coverage of her speech at next month ’s Tea Party Convention at Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center .
Palin ’s speech was initially announced as being closed to the media , but the former vice presidential candidate requested the press be allowed in after all , the event ’s organizer announced Wednesday .
The nation ’s first Tea Party convention will take place Feb. 4 - 6 at Gaylord Opryland .
Although the convention is sold out , according to the Tea Party Nation Web site , banquet tickets are still available .
Besides Palin , Republican Congresswomen Marsha Blackburn and Minnesota ’s Michele Bachmann will both be speaking at the convention .
UPDATE : According to a press release issued by the organizers , it looks like only right - wing news outlets will be allowed to cover the event :

It has spawned T - shirts , DVDs , a magazine and even a live world tour .
Now BBC2's Top Gear is seeking to extend its grip on the nation 's consciousness with a Pokemon - style trading card game aimed at children and young teenagers .
Top Gear Turbo Challenge features 276 cards to collect .
The cards include ratings of cars reviewed on the show based on " speed " , " toughness " and " coolness " and quotes from the presenters along with links to online games .
The game launches with a partwork magazine in 52 parts , Top Gear Turbo Challenge , with a cover - mounted pack of nine cards .
Trading cards will be available to buy separately – at £ 1.50 for a pack of nine – with the " ultimate " sub -Zero Stig card appearing in one in every 1,000 packs .
A gaming website , topgearturbo.com , features games based on challenges featured in the show , including a race against a French high - speed train and a mission to reach the North Pole in a 4x4 quicker than a dog sled .
Publisher Duncan Gray said : " Top Gear Turbo Challenge is tipped to be one of the biggest launches of the year and we 're confident boys and girls aged 7 - 14 will be clamouring to be part of this new craze .
Top Gear Turbo Challenge is not only a highly collectable magazine ; it 's also a brilliant new trading card collection and gaming website .
" As a business , BBC Magazines is very excited about the opportunity to bring this new product to market and we confidently expect it to drive significant retail sales value through all participating retail channels . "
Top Gear has become a global phenomenon since it was relaunched with presenter Jeremy Clarkson eight years ago , broadcast in more than 100 countries and claiming a global audience of 350 million .
As well as Top Gear magazine , the long - running BBC2 show , presented by Clarkson with Richard Hammond and James May , has spawned spin - off merchandising including DVDs , CDs , books , clothing , mugs , calendars and key rings .
Top Gear merchandise also includes a " V8 roaring vibrating engine pencil sharpener " , a " speaking bendy - limbed Stig doll " and a " Stig soap on a rope " .
But the show has also faced accusations that it is running out of steam , with producer Andy Wilman admitting recently that its current incarnation was " nearer the end than the beginning " .
Clarkson and Wilman have a stake in the Top Gear brand , through their company Bedder 6 , an unprecedented joint venture between the Top Gear presenter and producer and the BBC 's commercial arm , BBC Worldwide .
The first issue of Top Gear Turbo Challenge magazine will be on sale on Wednesday , at a reduced price of £ 1.50 .
Subsequent issues will cost £ 2.50 , with issues two and three including a free The Stig helmet card collection holder .

Square Enix has released the final version of the box art for Final Fantasy XIII , meaning that the box art Square Enix posted on it ’s website last month will not be used internationally , but will only be used for release in Japan .
Rather than just the logo , the final version for the United States and Europe also includes an image of the protagonist Lightning .
The new box arts can be found after the jump .
Furthermore , the Japanese magazine “ Shonen Jump ” has published an article on Final Fantasy XIII , revealing a new character .
Cid Raines , as this character is known , is supposedly a non-playable character wielding a weapon somewhat similar to the one used by Lightning .
Characters called ‘ Cid ’ have been a recurring theme within the Final Fantasy series , having been part of the series from the second installment onwards .

When the producer of the FoxNews program ‘ Freedom Watch with Judge Napolitano ‘ asked me to appear on air last week to discuss the issue of marijuana law reform , I was n’t sure exactly what to expect .
Fortunately it became clear from the host ’s opening monologue that Judge Andrew Napolitano is a powerful and articulate friend of cannabis liberalization .
“ The War on Drugs that the federal government has waged , and on which it has spent billions and billions of taxpayer dollars , has been a complete waste of time , money , and effort .
Take marijuana , for instance .
It ’s been grouped together and enforced by the Drug Enforcement Administration with real hardcore drugs like heroin , cocaine , and methamphetamine .
But states like California and soon New Jersey have pretty much legalized marijuana for medicinal purposes .
While the federal government contends that … marijuana has the potential to promote cancer , patients of cancer and other similar ailments actually use marijuana to fight these deadly diseases .
So would n’t the federal government be better off creating the incentive to empower people to make the right choice , to make their own free choice , rather than persecuting them and prosecuting them for what the feds consider to be the wrong choice ? ”

Could this be the next outpost in space ?

Whether Phobos is a chip off the old Martian block , or a captured asteroid is still up for debate ( Image : Detlev Van Ravenswaay / SPL )
Interactive graphic : Missions to Phobos
PHOBOS is a name you are going to hear a lot in the coming years .
It may be little more than an asteroid – just two - billionths of the mass of our planet , with no atmosphere and hardly any gravity – yet the largest of Mars ’s two moons is poised to become our next outpost in space , our second home .
Although our own moon is enticingly close , its gravity means that relatively large rockets are needed to get astronauts to and from the surface .
The same goes for Mars , making it expensive to launch missions there too – perhaps even prohibitively expensive if President Obama ’s review of NASA ’s human space exploration policy is to be believed .
Last October , a committee of independent experts chaired by industrialist Norman Augustine concluded that NASA faced a shortfall of around $ 3 billion a year if it still intends to send astronauts back to the moon – let alone Mars – by 2020 .
But that does n’t mean that humans have nowhere to go .
One option the Augustine report suggested would take NASA crews to nearby asteroids and to the moons of Mars .
“ The bulk of the cost of a Mars mission is getting people to the surface and back again , ” says Pascal Lee , chairman of the Mars Institute in Moffett Field , California .
“ If you wait for everything to be ready , it will be decades .

El proyecto para instalar 8 mil cámaras en el DF no tiene como único fin atacar la delincuencia , sino elevar la capacidad de respuesta en acciones de protección civil , seguridad , emergencias y control de masas , afirmó el gobierno capitalino .
Hoy entran en funcionamiento las primeras 2 mil 200 .
El coordinador general del Proyecto Bicentenario , Fausto García Lugo , dijo que se busca mejorar la actuación de las autoridades ante emergencias como sismos , inundaciones o movilizaciones masivas .
Explicó que las cámaras permitirán monitorear las zonas de riesgo en eventos y concentraciones multitudinarias , y permitirán contar el número de personas .

It seems to me that the decision , both as an individual and as a society , to either punish or rehabilitate criminals hinges on the degree to which the former believes in in free will vs. determinism .
In short , if you believe in free will , you believe that one can have all the disadvantages in the world heaped upon him or her , but that when it comes time to make a moral decision , this person will be expected–due to an innate and distinct free will –to make the right decision .
You can draw a line directly from this belief to that of belief in punishment .
And for good reason : if inputs into a decision , such as being severely beaten as a child , being raised by foster homes , having no education , etc. have no ultimate effect , i.e. if the individual still has complete control over their actions due to free will , then it makes sense to punish people who do bad things .
Let ’s take an example .
Let ’s say Chris is a bad guy .
He runs with the wrong crowd , gets in fights , carries a knife in case he has to stab someone , etc .
He ’s hanging out with his buddies at his favorite pool hall one night , and he ’s with a girl he ’s trying to get with .
All his buddies are thugs , basically , and honor and respect are the primary currency within the group .
Well , one guy in another group playing pool nearby decides to insult the girl he ’s trying to impress .
His whole crew sees it , and they start hooting and hollering to apply pressure .
Basically , he needs to react aggressively or he will lose both the respect of his group and of the girl he ’s trying to get with .
While he ’s trying to decide what to do , the other guy pushes him straight in the chest and spits in his face .
As he glances from side to side he sees one look on everyone ’s face : “ Are you going to take that ? ”
He is overwhelmed by the urge to attack him , and before he knows it he is drawing back his pool cue ( still in his hand from his last shot ) to strike .
Stop time .
What are the inputs here ?
Let ’s say he ’s genetically prone to violence .
He had no loving parents when he was a child .
He was beaten constantly by his father before he was abandoned by him .
He has a 6th grade education .
And he ’s into drugs and alcohol .
Add that to the dynamic of needing to maintain status within his only peer group–all of which are staring at him and waiting for him to act .
These are all truths .
They are realities that make up the variables leading to a decision of whether or not he will hit this other man with a pool cue , and ultimately go to jail .
The question I have for the free will group is , “ what is the strength of his free will in this situation , and how much does it matter ? ”
Does he have the same free will as a Harvard grad in the same scenario ?
In other words , if a Harvard grad is in the same situation , and he immediately grabs his girl and leaves while calling the cops , was he actually more moral or did he just not have the same pressures to commit the negative action ?
Remember , the Harvard grad has options .
His girl will still stay with him if he does n’t get in the fight , and his friends will tell him he did the right thing .
Plus , he knows all the implications of his actions .
He has much to lose if he gets something put on his police record .
None of these things apply to Chris .
In fact , they apply in the opposite direction .
Everything leans toward him attacking being the right thing to do–given his situation .
In other words , how much free will is needed to make a correct decision seems highly dependent on the pressures that exist already –most of which are products of variables outside the control of the decision - maker .
The Harvard grad did n’t make a difficult decision because he had so many options .
Chris , on the other hand , did n’t have any options .
From his genetics to his upbringing to his immediate surroundings –he basically had no option but to attack the guy .
To look at it another way , how much free will does a human exert when deciding not to eat ?
A lot .
How much free will does a human exert when deciding not to fly like a duck ?
None .
Why ?
Because there is no natural pressure to fly like a duck .
Along those same lines , how tempting would it be for a man to sleep with the hot blonde he just met if he had been castrated ?
Not at all .
The point is that will is tied directly to deterministic pressure to act .
And the more of that pressure you are facing , the less , your “ will ” is a factor in your decisions .
That is , unless you ’re highly religious .
Religion solves this science and nature problem by saying that all people have the same option to make the right choice , regardless of whether the cards are stacked against them or not .
That would explain why the religious enjoy seeing criminals suffer so much –because they believe they had THE OPTION to do the right thing .
And it really goes all the way back .
Let ’s take the Garden of Eden narrative .
Here you have God , controlling the entire environment .
The laws of physics , the desires of Adam and Eve , the desirability of the tree , the presence of the snake , etc .
So he creates a piece of fruit on a tree that ’s so dangerous it will kill him ( and everyone in the whole world after him ) .
Not only does he create the fruit , but he gives Adam both the eyes to see it with , as well as the desire to eat it .
Then , next to him , he creates two other beings –both of which try and convince him to eat it .
Keep in mind that Adam could have been created without ears , so he could n’t hear Eve and the snake , but that would be too easy .
So , when Adam is about to take a bite of the apple , what is the balance of natural pressure vs. free will at that moment ?
I ’d argue it ’s much the same as the balance of pressure on Chris when he ’s about to swing the pool cue .
In both cases the deck is completely stacked .
In Adam ’s case , the creator of the Universe just put a tasty fruit right next to him , along with two companions to convince him to eat it .
For Chris , he ’s facing a world of loneliness and rejection if he does n’t swing .
Anyway , enough analogies .
The idea of punishing criminals because “ they had a choice ” is , as the Hacker ’s quote goes , “ Universally stupid . ”
And the alternative narrative is simple : you do what the variables say you ’ll do .
That ’s why most rich people come from a world of advantage , while most poor and criminal types come from a world of disadvantage .
If you need more evidence , look at the data on common characteristics of serial killers ’ lives ( hint:abuse ) .
And some people get this .
The Scandinavian countries tend to rehabilitate rather than punish .
Why ?
Because they understand that negative inputs lead to negative outcomes , and that the concept of free will is little more than a practical necessity at this point in our development–and certainly not something to base a criminal justice system on .
So let ’s sum up with some oversimplifications :
Religion –> a belief in supernatural Free Will
Free Will –> the belief that criminals deserve suffering
Secular –> Less / No Religion
Less / No Religion –> Less / No belief in supernatural Free Will
Less / No belief in Free Will –> more belief in determinism
Belief in determinism –> belief that the prosperous are lucky instead of virtuous , and that the poor and criminal are unlucky instead of evil or lazy
This leads to a desire to elevate the variables for everyone , so that the better inputs will lead to better outputs
… which is progressivism / liberalism / socialism .
… which is why the Scandinavian countries are less into the idea of criminals being “ bad ” , and more into re-education and rehabilitation .
So , once again , the U.S. is being hamstrung by religious culture .
It is the belief in free will over determinism that leads to the entire concept of “ deserving ” something , e.g. riches or suffering .
And it has to end if we want to make any real progress . ::
Oddly enough , Mr Gordon Brown has had quite a good week .
He has held a Labour seat at a by - election , admittedly a safe one , but these days anything can happen .
He has proposed a new tax on undeserved gains in the City to virtually universal applause .
And he has been attacked in The Sun newspaper , so winning the sympathy of most of the audience .
It will not make the slightest difference .
Once trust goes , the Prime Minister – any prime minister – is finished .
That is the accepted wisdom of the moment , and in Mr Brown 's case it is probably right .
Even so , the convention deserves closer examination .
Harold Wilson lost the trust of the electorate with the devaluation of 1967 .
He was described as a " twister " whose words could not be relied on .
Wilson himself boasted that he had been more vilified than any prime minister since Lloyd George .
And yet , two - and - a - half years afterwards , Wilson was the overwhelming favourite to win the election .
It was a great surprise – at any rate , to the political classes – when Edward Heath entered No 10 .
John Major had a whole five years , not of being distrusted exactly , but of being thought not up to the job .
This was the consequence of our forced exit from the European Monetary System .
As things turned out , the expulsion , far from being a national humiliation , proved beneficial to the Tory government and the new chancellor , Mr Kenneth Clarke .
It made no difference , and the Tories were duly crushed .

Tony Blair lost trust at some point in 2003 or 2004 , chiefly on account of the Iraq war .
But the voters concluded that the Conservatives were still a hopeless lot , with what was then their third leader since 1997 in place .
Mr Blair came back with a reduced but perfectly healthy majority .
I do not think there will be much of a sympathy vote for Mr Brown .
At the same time , there is a long history of voters who are reluctant to accept the instructions of newspapers .
In the 1951 election the Daily Mirror asked the question " Whose Finger on the Trigger ? " in relation to Winston Churchill .
The Tories won .
More recently the same paper attacked " Tory toffs " on the basis that Mr David Cameron and his entourage were rich , had been to Eton or what - have - you .
It made no difference .
For a time the Labour Party 's propaganda machine , such as it is – a far cry from Lord Mandelson 's gleaming mechanism , which he supervised in his younger days – took up the slogan .
But it seems to have been dropped .
Lord Mandelson has become increasingly tetchy at the withdrawal of the support of Mr Rupert Murdoch .
Or , rather , it has been the support of The Sun , and not of his other newspapers , that has been withdrawn .
Perhaps the others , or some of them , will follow .
Who can tell ?
Who indeed !
These are deep waters , my old friend .
We are dealing with some desperate characters .
But it ill becomes Lord Mandelson to turn round and bite the several hands that nourished him – some of them , literally so – over a dozen or so years .
The Lord giveth , and the Lord , or Mr Murdoch , has taken away .
Mr Brown , for his part , is not complaining so strenuously , or indeed at all .
Mr Murdoch , as Mr Brown seems to be saying – it was a broadcast interview last Friday morning – has his job to do , while Mr Brown has his at No 10 .
If Mr Murdoch admires Mr Brown , Mr Brown has an even higher regard for Mr Murdoch .
The more worldly , even cynical ,
comment has been that Mr Murdoch was seeking favours from the incoming Conservative government .
The intermediary was Mr Cameron 's press- and - media adviser Mr Andy Coulson , a former editor of one of Mr Murdoch 's papers , the News of the World .
Some observers thought this a shrewd appointment by Mr Cameron ; others considered it disreputable .
What Mr Murdoch was seeking was the handicapping of the BBC and the continuing prosperity of Sky television and his other interests .
So the story goes .
It is much simpler all round to conclude that Mr Murdoch believes in backing winners .
The Sun arose from the ruins of the old Daily Herald , a paper jointly controlled by the Labour Party and the TUC .
Mr Murdoch acquired the paper in 1969 .
It was , first , a Labour paper , but transferred its allegiance to Margaret Thatcher .
It called her " Maggie " – she had hitherto been known as " Margaret " – and it made particular mock of Neil Kinnock .
Lord Kinnock himself was later to attribute Labour 's defeat in 1992 partly to the influence of The Sun .
The paper then turned on the new prime minister , John Major .
The new hero was Mr Blair .
This happy relationship continued until 2007 , when Mr Blair gave way to Mr Brown .
The paper ( together with another of Mr Murdoch 's productions , The Times ) said that Mr Blair had been a great prime minister and that he was departing voluntarily , in his own time .
This was only partially true , but that was what had been written at the time .
If Mr Blair had to deliver a speech to hard - pressed employees of Mr Murdoch 's empire in some far - flung outpost of the globe , Mr Brown would not be far behind in getting on to the next convenient aeroplane , though he does not greatly like travelling by air .
Moreover , Mr Murdoch admired Mr Brown , and still does , up to a point .
He has a high regard for the virtues associated with Scotland , including industry and thrift , and also with his native Australia , such as an absence of affectation .
Why , then , did the paper attack Mr Brown with such ferocity when he had taken the trouble to write a personal letter to a bereaved mother ?
There were one or two misspellings , true .
But even Evelyn
Waugh was not strong at spelling , as he himself would confess .
In any organisation , there are those subordinates who are anxious to please the boss , often before they have been asked .
Sometimes they guess wrong .
They may even do the opposite of what the boss wanted them to do .
This is particularly true of newspapers .
" But this was what we thought you wanted . "
That is the plaintive cry .
It is one thing to withdraw support from Mr Brown ; quite another to attack the Prime Minister so savagely and so needlessly ; worst of all to lose the support of the public .
The story goes ( and I am in no position to confirm or deny it ) that Mr Murdoch is displeased at the turn of last week 's events .
He would , it seems , have handled the story differently .
His minions were guilty of an excess of zeal .
My guess is that he will administer a rebuke at once earthy and lofty , if he has not already done so .
It must not be forgotten that persons of pomp and power tend to gang up together against the rest of the world .
Thus the editor - in - chief of the Daily Mail , Mr Paul Dacre , professes the warmest regard for Mr Brown , while Mr Brown has the highest admiration for Mr Dacre .
They have a chat together from time to time .
The paper in question does not attack Mr Brown personally but reserves its intemperate indignation for the Labour Party and the Labour government .
There was a period – in the dying years of the last Tory government and then the new Labour administration – when Mr Murdoch 's papers and even the Mail supported Mr Blair .
Those days are long gone .
And , some of us might say , not a moment too soon .
With all the regular anchors out for the holiday week , Ann Coulter is gleefully stepping up to help lead the parade of right - wingers bashing President Obama for his supposedly weak response to the threat of terrorism .
That 's been the primary subject of every single Fox prime - time show , in fact , and not a single defender of the president could be found on any of them .
But Coulter , guesting on the Glenn Beck show , went the extra mile by resurrecting the Obama - is - a - closet - Muslim smear that was so popular during the election :
Coulter : I think if you polled Americans after 9/11 , they would have said , ' Drop the political correctness when it comes to boarding airplanes . '
And , um , like I say , Obama can be doing more than Bush .
He is specially situated that way , as having gone to madrassas as a child .
Um , not being a white male , which is the height of political incorrectness .
Ah , yes , some lies are just too good to let die a normal death :
Was the Moon created by a nuclear explosion on Earth ?
How the Moon was created and came to orbit the Earth has long puzzled scientists .
The most commonly held theory is that when the solar system was first formed , an object collided with Earth , knocking off a chunk of rock that fell into orbit around it .
But now two scientists have come up with a new explanation .
They believe the Moon did not break away from the Earth because of an impact or an explosion in space , but because of a nuclear explosion on Earth itself .
Similarities : Lunar samples from moon landings have shown that the material of the moon is nearly identical to Earth's
Their idea is based on the fission theory which was first outlined in the 19th century .
The fission theory suggested that the Earth and Moon were both created out of the same blob of spinning molten rock - with a part becoming separated which later became the moon .
However , aside from an impact , scientists could n't explain how the blob which became the moon spun off .
Rob de Meijer at University of the Western Cape and Wim van Westrenen at VU University in Amsterdam believe the Moon was blasted out of the Earth by a nuclear explosion on our planet .
In their research paper , ' An alternative hypothesis for the origin of the Moon ' , they explain that if the moon had been separated from the Earth by an impacting external force , the moon would be composed of whatever knocked into it and the Earth .
' Models of solar system evolution show that it is highly unlikely for the chemical composition of the Earth and impactor to be identical , ' they state .
Yet recent lunar samples show that the moon is almost identical in chemical composition to the Earth - suggesting there was no impactor involved .
' A more likely possibility for the large degree of compositional similarity ... is that the moon derives directly from terrestrial material , ' the research paper states .
Full moon :
Look to the skies tonight for a lunar spectacle
They believe that the energy that caused the moon to break into orbit around Earth was
' supplied by a supercritical georeactor in Earth ’s core - mantle boundary producing sufficient heat to vaporize and eject part of the bulk silicate earth ' .
Clay Dillow from Popular Science supports the theory .
He states : ' According to their explanation , the centrifugal forces on Earth concentrated heavier elements like uranium and thorium near the surface around the equatorial plane .
' Enough of these elements in high enough concentrations could set off a runaway nuclear chain reaction , similar to the kind that cause nuke plant meltdowns .
' In this way , a natural - born nuclear georeactor was pushed to supercritical levels and : BOOM !
The moon was cleaved from the Earth and rocketed into orbit by a massive nuclear explosion .
' It ’s a tough theory to test , but we do know that nuclear georeactors existed , their legacy left behind in the uranium we mine from the Earth today . '
De Meijer and van Westrenan conclude that proving their theories will depend on future moon missions returning lunar samples from greater depths .
● MARS AND MOON PROVIDE SPECTACLE TONIGHT
The Red Planet will pair up with the full Moon in the night sky tonight to provide a grand celestial spectacle .
Sky watchers will be able to gaze on the biggest and brightest full Moon of the year tonight .
They will also be treated to a particularly dazzling Mars .
Our planetary neighbour , now 62 million miles from Earth , has been at its brightest for two years , this week .
This is because the Red Planet is in opposition , which means Mars and the Sun are on directly opposite sides of Earth .
Our moon is in opposition during the full moon .
Therefore the Sun 's light reflects off the whole surface of Mars instead of just part of it and it is particularly bright from our perspective .
As Earth is closer to the Sun is goes round its orbit faster than Mars .
It means around every two years they are in opposition
From our perspective , Mars rises in the east just as the sun sets in the west .
At around 9 pm , Mars will be above and to the left of the Moon , about the length of an outstretched fist away .
A standard SLR camera fitted with a telephoto lens is all you need to capture the scene , says Robin Scagell , from the Society for Popular Astronomy .
' Mars is looking really quite red and impressive at the moment , and the Moon will be full , ' he said .
' It 's going to be a great sight and rather fun to look for . '
The forecast for the UK tonight is mainly clear , although there could be cloud over North - East England and Northern Ireland .

The idea that a woman needs to " catch a man " is so incredibly sexist and insulting .
It also reminds me of a TV ad that ran quite a while ago .
The gist of it was a woman ( wife ) trying repeatedly to get out the stains on the collar of her husband 's shirts but alas , all to no avail .
Then along comes " Whisk " and voila - happy homemaker !
It used to make my so angry every time I saw it - as if said stains were a huge issue for her ( and thus for every woman ) .
I used to think " If it bothers him , let him get his own damn stains out " .
It 's a sad state of affairs when this ad shows not much has changed .

Home secretary says threat has increased , but no suggestion a terror attack is imminent
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
The threat to the UK from international terrorism was tonight raised from substantial to severe - meaning an attack is " highly likely " .
Home secretary Alan Johnson said although the threat had increased , there was no intelligence to suggest an attack was imminent .
He said : " The Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre has today raised the threat to the UK from international terrorism from substantial to severe .
" This means that a terrorist attack is highly likely , but I should stress that there is no intelligence to suggest than an attack is imminent .
" JTAC keeps the threat level under constant review and makes its judgments based on a broad range of factors , including the intent and capabilities of international terrorist groups in the UK and overseas . "
What the terror threat levels mean
• Low - an attack is unlikely
• Moderate - an attack is possible , but not likely
• Substantial - an attack is a strong possibility
• Severe - an attack is highly likely
• Critical - an attack is expected imminently
Amateurism as a fact must be older than civilization .
The cave paintings at Lascaux and many earlier artifacts give every sign of having been made to satisfy some urge for individual expression rather than with any object of gain .
Judged on this time scale , amateurism as a concept is very modern .
“ Amateurism is the curse of the nineteenth century ” — the first use of the word known to the compilers of the Oxford English Dictionary — is dated 1868 .
It was indeed a concept of that century .
The word amateur in the sense of “ one who cultivates anything for a pastime , as distinguished from one who prosecutes it professionally , ” came into being in 1803 .
Such a starting point for the discussion of an eminently serious subject is not pedantry .
H. L. Mencken — who once told me that if he ever had the good fortune to be sentenced to life imprisonment , he would ask only that he should be allowed to have permanently in his cell the thirteen volumes of the large Oxford English Dictionary — rightly held that the history of words could sometimes be more revealing than the history of events .
If both the earnestness and the materialism of the nineteenth century sought to establish a distinction between activity for pleasure and activity for gain — and I believe that it was a growing awareness of professionalism that brought the hitherto little - noticed idea of amateurism to the fore — the demarcation line between them soon began to grow blurred .
In some fields today it can no longer be established .
In sports one admired Avery Brundage ’s efforts to keep the Olympic Games simon - pure ; elsewhere the attempt has been abandoned altogether .
Golf and lawn tennis amateurs and professionals now compete with each other on equal terms .
English cricket no longer has Gentlemen or Players .
In many fields such evolution , or the lack of it , may be of interest only to the social historian .
It does not affect the well - being of society as a whole .
In the arts , and particularly in the art of writing , the issue of amateurism and professionalism — which in effect has become the battle to preserve amateurism — is of the greatest possible importance .
It is crucial because , while money may be the readiest indicator of the distinction between amateur and professional , it is by no means the sole , or even the paramount , criterion .
Remy de Gourmont , writing on Renan in the first of his Promenades litteraires , noted that the artist who painted for pleasure , “ to obey his genius , ” would outlast the artist who painted for gain .
He traced the reason back to the child ’s love of play , which he saw as an exercise in disinterested intelligence .
Those who preserved this “ childishness ” in later years were , he held , the true artists .
“ Genius almost always has in it a strong element of play ” — in other words an overpowering love of what it is doing .
The root of the word amateur is in the word love .
No one has illustrated this more fully than Ruskin , one of the greatest amateurs of the Victorian age .
Stones , leaves , twigs , mountains , buildings , paintings — through the years he brought a pure and undiluted joy to the contemplation of them all .
And when he shocked his contemporaries by moving in middle age to sociology and political economy , it was in the same unselfish spirit .
“ Every principle of painting which I have stated , ” he wrote , “ is traced to some vital or spiritual fact . ”
This was basically true of Ruskin in whatever sphere he wrote .
The tragedy of his having passed his last decade in a state of second childhood does not lessen the force of his example as an amateur , or of the truths he had uttered .
If any further proof is needed that amateurism is the irresistible play of the loving spirit wherever it listeth , it can be found in the Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci .
The effort at first to restrict , and eventually to obliterate , amateurism in writing has recently been seen in its crudest form in British journalism .
The Labour government favors “ closed shops ” ( firms and organizations in which every worker must belong to a trade union ) .
Many industries are perforce ready to accept closed shops ; British newspapers are not .
Assurances by the National Union of Journalists that they have no such absolute restrictions in mind have been belied by the actions of their members .
Some national newspapers have had to appear with blank spaces that should have been filled by reports or articles written by non-union members , some of them members of the rival Institute of Journalists .
Had they not done this , the members of the National Union of Journalists would not have brought out the paper .
While the struggle has now become intense , the desire of professional journalists to exclude amateurs from contributing to the newspapers on which they work is of many years ’ standing .
It is only the coming to power of a Labour government , after the opposition of the British trade union movement that had made the continuance of a Conservative government in office impossible , and the incoming Labour cabinet ’s awareness that it must placate the unions , that has brought matters to a head .
Whatever the ultimate outcome — and that will depend as much on practice as on legislation , and may not be clear for some years — the freedom of British editors henceforth is not likely to e as complete as it has been for a century and a half .
The demands of journalists to control their paper ’s policy , to veto an editor ’s appointment6s to his staff if they do not approve of them , and to run the editorial department by committee are growing not only in Britain , but also in France and elsewhere in Europe .
It must be admitted that some British editors have brought part of the trouble on themselves and their fellows .
In crime , in sport , and in other spheres of popular interest , they have paid great sums of money to people of fame or notoriety for matter written by journalists on their own paper ’s staff .
“ Ghosting ” reached unacceptable dimensions many years ago .
But this is no longer the issue .
Now it is the right of editors to use qualified outsiders writing under their own names .
Last spring the Times Literary Supplement printed on its front page a letter signed by more than sixty authors , declaring the proposed Act of British Minister of Labour Michael Foot , himself a distinguished writer and an ex-Fleet Street editor , to be “ one of the most serious potential threats to the liberty of expression that has arisen in this country in modern times . ”
The gravity and weight of the protest can be measured by naming some of the letter ’s signatories : Professor Alfred Jules Ayer , Sir Isaiah Berlin , Lord ( Kenneth ) Clark , Professor Roy Fuller , William Golding , Graham Hough , Arthur Koestler , Peter Medawar , Harold Pinter , J. H. Plumb , V. S. Pritchett , J. B. Priestley , Lord ( Alfred ) Robbins , Sir Steven Runciman , C. P. Snow , Christopher Sykes , Professor Hugh Trevor - Roper , C. V. Wedgwood , Rebecca West , Sir Mortimer Wheeler , and Angus Wilson .
In all my fifty years of broadcasting I cannot recall so impressive a protest .
The Times Literary Supplement published a feeble reply by Mr. Foot , which was effectively scuppered by resolutions voted by the National Union of Journalists at its Cardiff conference .
That the union ’s leaders were aware of the inadvisability of this and sought to get the resolutions reversed could not hid the fact that the restrictive urge was still there .
All this may seem to be of interest only on the European side of the Atlantic .
But history shows that international influence rarely stays entirely unilateral .
American ideas , American values , and some aspects of the American way of life have penetrated nations in both hemispheres .
Sinclair Lewis ’s
It Ca n’t Happen
Here is not an outdated warning .
Some unexpected things have happened in the United States since he wrote that fiction .
And if it can be said that none has been on the horrific scale he portrayed , or even on the level of the apprehensions we now have in Europe , it is relevant to remember the sudden mass arrests of the Opposition members to Mrs.
Gandhi ’s government and the temporary complete censorship that blackened democracy in India this past summer .
Who would have expected that ?
Whether or not American readers think these fears illusory , the question of the roles of the amateur and the professional in literature and its purlieus does have relevance for writers in all the so - called free countries .
It has many other aspects .
Geoffrey Grigson has raised one of them .
Writing to the editor of the Times Literary Supplement , Grigson said that , while he had signed the protest without too much misgiving , he was concerned that “ another class of persons is already driving writers by gift and profession out of a realm of comment over which they used to preside and over which they have a claim to preside . ”
He was referring to academics .
He pointed out that the reviewers in the issue containing the protest included at least sixteen dons .
He saw the same tendency in the review pages of the daily and Sunday newspapers and in the “ literary ” output of the BBC .
So far as the BBC is concerned , I think I must take some of what Mr. Grigson would call the blame , and what I still consider the credit .
When we created the Third Programme of the BBC in 1946 , we had a number of related objects in mind .
The first was that the BBC ’s postwar radio system should have three Programmes ( networks ) —
Light , Home , and Third , at differing levels of popularity , between them covering the whole spectrum of information , education , entertainment , and the arts .
It was also the intention that there should be some plan to lead listeners upward through the Programmes — the Light , say , playing the Rosenkavalier waltzes , the Home some days later broadcasting an act from the opera and the Third eventually giving the complete work .
I must confess this did not work out as well as I had hoped .
The Third Programme was the key to the whole idea .
It created a new set of essentials .
Paramount was the need to free at least one strand of British broadcasting from the tyranny of time .
Up to then program making had largely been a carpenter ’s job : finding material of specified lengths to fit into a daily time pattern and around fixed points .
To do this , even the greatest masterpieces of literature , and sometimes of music , had to suffer on the program planners ’
Procrustean beds .
So that this should not happen in the Third Programme , I decided that it should have no fixed points .
The governors of the BBC pleaded for at least one news bulletin in the program at a regular time .
I withstood this , and persuaded them that the series of news bulletins in the BBC ’s two other transmission systems would be fully adequate .
The compilers of the Third Programme were given a completely clean slate every day , and for an unlimited succession of days .
If they wanted four consecutive evenings to broadcast The Ring , or five for Back to Methuselah , they could have them .
Some remarkable programs were broadcast as a result , a mammoth series on The Ideas and Beliefs of the Victorians and a history of European music among them .
In return for this freedom , those in charge of the Third Programme had to accept two responsibilities .
One was to give every work they broadcast the full length of tie its creator had conceived for it .
The other was to ensure that every broadcast was the best that could be arranged .
Anything threatening to be second - rate must wait until the resources ( human and material ) were available to make it first - rate .
It was on this basis that for six years the Third Programme created a new dimension in radio , not only in Britain but throughout the world .
My second objective could be achieved only with this prerequisite .
One of the things that had struck me most forcibly when I became the first editor - in - chief , and then director - general , of the BBC was that , except for its news bulletins , no substantial proportion of the audiences for its other programs had been drawn from the classes that formed the readership of the Manchester Guardian and The Times .
This was markedly true in the academic world .
Oxford and Cambridge showed a general ignorance of , and a lack of interest in , the BBC ’s output as a whole .
As the BBC then had a monopoly , that meant in broadcasting as a whole .
It seemed to me that if the cultural range of the Third Programme was right , if its quality was high , and if the little - known but the worth - knowing , both in subjects for the spoken word and in music , could offer an alternative to the hackneyed , then the universities could listen and contribute as well .
Of course dons had broadcast in the days of Lord Reith ( Lowes Dickinson had been notable among them ) .
But their contributions had been few and spasmodic .
Nothing on this scale and as a deliberate act of policy had been attempted before .
The plan succeeded more quickly and far more widely than we had hoped .
Its effect spilled over into the periodicals and the newspapers .
Faced after the war with the threatened competition of television and radio , which they greatly overrated , the only defense the publishers of these journals seemed to be able to think of was to use those broadcasters whose names had become household words .
Book publishers followed suit .
Academics had written for them before , but now the scale was different .
The rewards open to these newcomers were many times those available in the past .
Many amateurs became professionals .
They remain so , to Mr. Grigson ’s chagrin .
Their experience had , moreover , given them an advantage over their predecessors : it had made them more lucid than they would otherwise have been .
Producers of BBC talks strive for lucidity far more assiduously than newspapers or publishers ’ sub-editors do .
They work with prospective speakers on the same broadcast again and again .
The speakers become more aware that they are no longer communicating to a specialist or selected audience but to the public at large .
It is true that oversimplification sometimes results , but more often the gain in comprehension is made without loss .
Academic and other amateurs became popular writers as well as broadcasters .
When Robert Oppenheimer gave the Reith Lectures on the BBC Home network ( more popular than the Third Programme ) in 1953 , the first five broadcasts of the series , which he had written in the United States before arriving in London on the eve of the transmissions , were well - night incomprehensible to the majority of listeners .
Only the final lecture , which he agreed to let the BBC work on with him , made any general impact .
He admitted that he had not realized such alchemy was possible .
If amateurs - turned - professionals can bring such advantages , it may be asked why must we be solicitous to save the permanent amateur from extinction ?
Is it in the public ’s interest ?
Is it in his own ?
Did not Dr. Johnson assert , “ None but a blockhead ever wrote , except for money ” ?
Johnson is the richest cornucopia of common sense in the English language , but , as both Hawkins and Walpole have told us , he was in this instance speaking of himself .
Sir Walter Scott started as an amateur .
It was a pity he could not have stayed one .
The greater his compulsion to write for money became , the greater grew the deterioration of his work , until both life and work ended in tragedy .
Was Trollope ever an amateur ?
Certainly not .
Although he was throughout his life a highly regarded civil servant , his novels were as professionally organized and written as if they had been his sole means of subsistence .
He kept his author ’s accounts most carefully .
He was merely a two - job man .
On the other hand , Sir Henry Taylor , an even more distinguished civil servant who was contemporary with Trollope , set out to be a professional — “ a literary adventurer ” — he termed it — and soon became an amateur .
Neither his masterpiece , The Statesman , nor , famous as it was in his day , his failure , Philip van Artevelde , was anything but a mental vacation from a highly successful public career .
His London Magazine and Quarterly essays soon fell away .
The time came when he shunned London society because it was too literary .
In all this , he showed the same sound judgment as he showed in his public life .
Was Disraeli an amateur ?
The answer must surely be yes .
Not all the twelve handsome columns of the Bradenham edition of his novels can persuade us that he was ever a professional .
Some of them are far better than many professional novelists have been able to write .
Some were , it is true , written for money .
The negotiations that obtained him £ 10,000 for Endymion — still worth every penny of that Victorian sterling values — are famous .
But they were the works of a genius who put his mind to creating them only when he did not have what he considered greater and better things to do .
History has agreed with him .
One can be reasonably sure that if he had been merely a professional writer he would never have written his three masterpieces .
Coningsby , Sybil , and Endymion could not have been conjured from an author ’s brain ; they had first to be lived .
Disraeli showed a sense of history also in making his farewell with Endymion rather than with any memoirs .
A professional in his position would not have shown the same restraint .
It may be easy to decide that Disraeli must be placed on the amateur side of the dividing line .
It is not so easy to give an exact definition of the line so that the status of every writer can be settled .
Sir Thomas Browne was clearly an amateur .
So was Dr. John Brown .
He was a practicing medical man all his life .
( It is regrettable that come collections of Horae subsecivae leave out the medical essays ; they are among the most entertaining . )
His writings came as the spirit moved him .
Vathek ’s Beckford was an amateur .
What were the Brontës ?
Charlotte can be deemed to have become a professional ; Anne and Emily , never .
Yet , as C. P. Sanger showed in his fascinating pamphlet , The Structure of Wuthering Heights , no novel of Jane Austen ’s was more meticulously constructed to an actual calendar .
Only two indications of date are given in the whole of Emily ’s Chinese puzzle of a novel , but every incident in it can be rearranged and chronologically placed , down to a change in the English game laws .
Still , this does not make Emily a professional .
It merely demonstrates that even a volcanic eruption can have a pattern .
Samuel Butler ( Erewhon , not Hudibras ) brings the problem on to new ground .
Even if one were to grant that he was a professional writer — which I am not prepared to do — he outraged the professionals by at least one amateur effort .
Readers of Sir Arthur Quiller - Couch ’s Adventures in criticism may recall the surprisingly severe opening to his essay “ Who Wrote the Odyssey ? ” ( for Q was usually a most mil - mannered and urbane man ) .
It may sound overweening , but I do not see how any man of ordinary common - sense can think of Samuel Butler without pity and impatience — pity that so rare a man should throughout his life have missed his market — pity again for the suffering his mistakes must have inflicted , and confessedly did inflict , upon a spirit so egotistical — impatience as one sees him inviting his punishment time after time by his ingrained habits of touchiness and offensiveness .
One goes back to Matthew Arnold ’s “ A Word About Spinoza ” to find an opening more damning .
What was Butler ’s offense ?
He had written a book , The Authoress of the Odyssey , and had translated Homer to prove that the Odyssey had been composed by a woman .
And the book had gone into a second edition !
Butler ’s offense was not in holding so heretical a view or even , in Quiller - Couch ’s words , in making “ not a plain translation at all , but a diabolically clever one , elastically worked to suit a theory . ”
The uproar was caused by his effrontery in daring to challenge the academics to a stand - up fight in their own exclusive domain .
In this case Butler was admittedly an amateur .
So was Goethe , with his complicated theory of colors .
So was Mill when he wrote on Coleridge .
In these and many other cases , the incursion of the amateur into the field of the professional was beneficial .
Q himself relented toward the end of the attack , and found some attraction to Butler ’s theory about Trapani .
Stagnant waters had been stirred .
The furor was gain .
One of the most remarkable cases of a writer invading alien territory was that of Morley Roberts .
Now that George Hissing is enjoying a revival , Roberts may also be resurrected .
He was the most understanding of Gissing ’s friends ; his book The Private Life of Henry Maitland is still the best portrayal of Gissing we have .
Roberts ’ Western Avernusm the story of his American experiences as a sheepherder in Texas , a navy in Minnesota , and a farm worker in California , is important in giving his background .
He returned to England penniless .
He wrote a score of novels , essays , and plays , all now forgotten .
The death of his daughter and then of his wife set this strange , poverty - stricken , literary man - of - all - work brooding on medical matters .
Storm Jackson , in her monograph “ Morley Roberts : The Last Eminent Victorian , ” has told the subsequent miracle : “ It was after his wife died that , to distract himself , he began the work , on the nature and cause of cancer , which more and more engrossed him , and drew from him three of his most remarkable books . ”
If there could be any strictly forbidden territory for the amateur , it would surely be cancer .
Had Roberts been a popular writer , and had his conclusions been wild , he could have done great harm .
This was territory upon which Keep
Out signs seemed not only permissible but obligatory .
Roberts persisted .
In 1934 five of the greatest medical authorities in Britain — the Regius Professor of Physic at Cambridge University , the Professor of Morbid Anatomy in the University of London , the senior Surgeon of the Middlesex Hospital , and Sir Arthur Keith , an ex-president of the British Association for the Advancement of Learning — wrote a long letter to The Times drawing attention to a new edition of Roberts ’s book , Malignancy and Evolution , and stressing the importance of his work from a practical point of view .
Never can an amateur — in a world completely unknown to his upbringing and experience — have been more authoritatively justified .
In case it is claimed that one is guilty of special pleading , and arguing from exceptional cases , I must add that during my editorship of The Times we devoted a column each day to contributors who mostly had never written before .
The supply was copious .
Much of the quality was high .
These amateur writing became one of the most appreciated features in the paper .
Some of the writers had books published subsequently .
I would not claim that any of these added to the sum of human knowledge , but if they did no more than give pleasure they helped to validate the principle .
In the last analysis , it is necessary to consider the survival of amateurism as a general principle .
In these difficult times it is even more necessary first to relate any principle to modern conditions .
The case for the amateur has to be restated because amateurism is in greater hazard than ever before .
This is an age not only of specialization but also of standardization .
John Gross ’s The Rise and Fall of the Man of Letters is both a fascinating and a melancholy book .
The slippered days of authordom are gone .
The adventurous days of amateurism are gone .
Rising costs are making the author ’s calling more and more regimented .
The pressures on writers , printers , and publishers to reduce costs to a minimum and to avoid any possible risk of failure lead the professionals into economical and safe ways .
Book prices are now so high that many new publications are beyond the purse of the ordinary reader ; it is left to the universities and other libraries and institutions to buy them .
Such buyers are rarely in the market for amateurism or experiment .
They too play safe .
Specialists are attracted to specialists .
In each field of publishing , and particularly in scholarly fields , there is an undeclared but generally recognized imprimatur .
License beyond this license is frowned upon .
Courage , sometimes to the point of foolhardiness , is necessary if completely new ground is to be broken .
Occasionally it may come from the rebel professional and be successful .
It will come more often valuably from the amateur .
In their own fields only geniuses among the professionals are completely exempt from logical progression .
The world at large is more ready to allow the amateur his brilliant wild guesses — and leave it to the professionals to refute them if they can .
When the professional moves out to territory not his own , his hazards are even greater .
The human ego has a subconscious resistance to professional polymaths .
The greater the authority a professional has in one field , the less ready we are to surrender to him in others .
Why is he on this new ground ?
Is he seeking to restore a fading reputation ?
Is he trying to make a new one ?
All publicity corrupts ; television publicity corrupts absolutely : is he just trying to keep in the public eye ?
The amateur faces far fewer obstacles .
He has nothing official at stake — no position to lose , no authority to maintain .
His pretensions are more acceptable because they are less pretentious .
We are ready to judge with a far more open mind the merits of what he has to say .
The same pressures are exerted at more popular levels .
Authors tend more and more to become typed according to the kinds of books they write .
Any breakaway that is a failure is a drain on small profit margins , if not an addition to losses .
After a study of the authors in the next season ’s publishing lists , the predictability of what is to come is high .
Since the professionals will stick to their lasts , new ground is more likely to be broken by the amateurs .
Sometimes they and their publishers are rewarded by having that ground prove fertile : a number of best sellers in the past decade have been off the beaten track .
If such virtue can bring such rewards , why worry ?
Unfortunately , it is almost an axiom of publishing today that the higher the public benefit pursued , the greater is the hostage given to fortune .
Scholarly journals , presses devoted to learning , serious publishing of all kinds cannot light - heartedly afford such risks .
To the intellectual arrogance of the specialists who would keep interlopers out is added the financial attraction of safety .
There is a duty to resist both conscientiously .
Mankind has benefited immeasurably from the cross-fertilization of ideas .
It is from amateurs , and these include specialists straying out of their own domain , that cross-fertilization comes .
Cross-fertilization is a desirable end .
It cannot adequately be established as a principle .
To find that , one can do no better than to fortify and extend John Stuart Mill ’s classic insistence on the right of the one man who is at odds with the rest of mankind .
Mill feared his lone dissenter ’s being silenced by the tyranny of the political majority .
That fear will never become groundless , but even if its abolition were possible , that would not free everybody .
Politics and affairs and even religion are not the sum of life .
There are cultural , scientific , ethical , artistic , imaginative , creative minorities of one .
The world of writing and publishing , whether consciously or subconsciously , whether because of custom , taboos , self - interest , or for any other reason , has no right to deny them expression .
The potential fullness of life if limited if they are denied expression .
They are bound to be amateurs to start with .
If their hearts remain pure , they will stay that way .
They are the leaven that the dull dough of society will always need .
“ In a civilized state , ” Gibbon wrote , “ every faculty of man is expanded and exercised ; and the great chain pf mutual dependence connects and embraces the several members of society . ”
The vital , renewing links in that chain will always be the amateurs . ”

Gingivitis , which may affect more than one - half of the U.S. adult population , is a condition commonly attributed to lapses in simple oral hygiene habits .
However , a new study shows that development and reversal of gingivitis at the molecular level is apparently much more complicated than its causes might indicate .
Research conducted jointly by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Procter & Gamble ( P&G ) Oral Care has found that more than 9,000 genes - nearly 30 percent of the genes found in the human body - are expressed differently during the onset and healing process associated with gingivitis .
Biological pathways associated with activation of the immune system were found to be the major pathways being activated and critical to controlling the body 's reaction to plaque build - up on the teeth .
Additionally , other gene expression pathways activated during plaque overgrowth include those involved in wound healing , neural processes and skin turnover .
Results of the study are published today in the December 2009 edition of the Journal of Periodontology .
This study is the first to successfully identify gene expression and biological pathways involved with the onset and healing process of gingivitis .
Gingivitis is characterized by gums that are red , swollen and tender and that bleed easily during brushing and flossing .
If untreated , gingivitis can lead to periodontal disease , which has been studied extensively for its possible relation to heart disease , diabetes and pre-term birth .
Researchers said that understanding how gingivitis develops and resolves on a molecular level can possibly provide critical insights into gum disease prevention , as well as new treatments .
" The study 's findings demonstrate that clinical symptoms of gingivitis reflect complicated changes in cellular and molecular processes within the body , " said Steven Offenbacher , D.D.S. , Ph.D. , the study 's lead author and director of the UNC School of Dentistry - based Center for Oral and Systemic Diseases .
" Understanding the thousands of individual genes and multiple systems involved in gingivitis will help explain exactly what is occurring in a person 's body at the onset of the disease and how it relates to their overall health . "
The build - up of plaque formed during the onset of gingivitis represents the overgrowth of bacteria as a biofilm on the teeth above and below the gum line .
Biofilms can form in other parts of the body and are known to be involved with health conditions , such as urinary tract infections , ear infections and chronic sinusitis .
Researchers believe learning about how the body interacts with bacteria overgrowth during gingivitis could provide insight into a variety of bio - film - associated diseases .
" Data generated by the study will be crucial in developing new approaches to treating gingivitis , " said Leslie Winston , D.D.S. , Ph.D. , co-author of the study and Director of Professional and Scientific Relations at P&G Oral Care ( makers of Crest and Oral - B ) .
" We plan to conduct additional research to identify biomarkers of gum disease in at risk individuals and hope that this will lead to new and more advanced treatment options and preventative measures . "
About the Study
The objective of this study was to understand gingivitis on a molecular level by identifying changes in gene expression taking place in the mouth during gingivitis onset and the healing process .
Fourteen healthy individuals with mild gingivitis participated in the study .
After baseline tooth cleanings , gingivitis was induced in each study participant , followed by the participants adhering to an oral hygiene regimen of twice - daily brushing and regular flossing .
Gum tissue was collected at baseline , four weeks after the induction of gingivitis and one week after resuming the oral hygiene regimen of brushing and flossing .
Gene expression data was analyzed using gene chip technology that enabled the investigators to detect changes in the expression of more than 30,000 genes .
By applying advanced genomics bioinformatics tools , the investigators were able to identify the biological pathways and gene expression patterns associated with gingivitis .
As part of the study findings , researchers identified several biological pathways triggered by the onset and healing of gingivitis , including those associated with immune response , energy metabolism , neural processes , vasculature , chemotaxis , wound healing and steroid metabolism .

Low - dose radiation from annual mammography screening may increase breast cancer risk in women with genetic or familial predisposition to breast cancer , according to a study presented at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America ( RSNA ) .
" For women at high risk for breast cancer , screening is very important , but a careful approach should be taken when considering mammography for screening young women , particularly under age 30 , " said Marijke C. Jansen - van der Weide , Ph.D. , epidemiologist in the Department of Epidemiology and Radiology at University Medical Center Groningen in the Netherlands .
" Further , repeated exposure to low - dose radiation should be avoided . "
Women who are at high risk for breast cancer need to begin screening at a younger age , because they often develop cancer earlier than women at average risk .
However , according to Dr. Jansen - van der Weide and colleagues , young women with familial or genetic predisposition to the disease may want to consider alternative screening methods to mammography , because the benefit of early tumor detection in this group of women may be offset by the potential risk of radiation - induced cancer .
According to the American Cancer Society , there is strong evidence supporting the benefits of mammography for women after age 40 .
However , there are conflicting reports regarding the benefits of mammography for women under 40 .
Alternative screening methods such as ultrasound and MRI may be made available to younger women , but are generally used as an adjunct to mammography .
The American Cancer Society recommends that some women at high risk ( greater than 20 percent lifetime risk ) should have MR imaging and mammography every year , typically beginning at age 30 .
The researchers conducted an analysis of peer - reviewed , published medical research to determine if low - dose radiation exposure affects breast cancer risk among high - risk women .
Out of 47 articles found on the topic , six were selected by the reviewers for inclusion in their analysis .
Four studies looked at the effect of exposure to low - dose radiation among breast cancer gene mutation carriers , and two studies researched the effect of radiation on women with a family history of breast cancer .
Using data from these studies , the researchers were able to calculate pooled odds ratios to estimate radiation - induced breast cancer risk .
The results showed that among all high - risk women in the study , average increased risk of breast cancer due to low - dose radiation exposure was 1.5 times greater than that of high - risk women not exposed to low - dose radiation .
High - risk women exposed before age 20 or with five or more exposures were 2.5 times more likely to develop breast cancer than high - risk women not exposed to low - dose radiation .
" Our findings suggest that low - dose radiation increases breast cancer risk among these young high - risk women , and a careful approach is warranted , " Dr. Jansen - van der Weide said .
She noted that this analysis is based on a small study sample and should be interpreted with caution .
Dr. Jansen - van der Weide also pointed out that these results apply only to specific high - risk groups of women .
Women at average risk were not assessed in this study .
In general , early detection with mammography and prompt treatment can significantly improve a woman 's chances of survival .
More than 90 percent of women whose breast cancer is found in an early stage will survive .
For young , high - risk women and their doctors , it is important to weigh the benefits against any potential risk when making a decision about annual breast cancer screening with mammography .

It came to my attention that some people have n't realized you can use the excellent Pocoo creation known as Flickzeug with a Django project .
Flickzeug lets you find memory leaks , generate profiling data , look at that same data and is pretty awesome in general .
Step one is to make a new manage .py .
Obviously , you wo n't be able to use that same name in a Django project , as Django already uses it .
Choose on of your liking .
I myself do n't use Django 's manage .py and so replace it .
from werkzeug import script if __name__ == " __main__ " : script . run ()
The above is a bare - bones skeleton of making your own management script using the Werkzeug helper system .
At this point , you 'll need to run a Django project as a mere mortal WSGI application .
Fortunately , this is relatively simple .
from werkzeug import script from django.core.handlers.wsgi import WSGIHandler application = WSGIHandler ( ) if __name__ == " __main__ " : script . run ()
An issue with this , however , is that Django requires you to set up your environment before importing anything non-trivial from within Django .
This is one of the ... " design choices " that convinced me of the backwardness of Django , but I digress .
So , to take this into account , we have to set the Django settings module environment variable first , and also make sure our project is importable .
import sys import os from werkzeug import script from django.core.handlers.wsgi import WSGIHandler sys .
path .
insert ( 0 , os .
path .
dirname ( __file__ ) ) os .
environ [ " DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE " ] = " foo.settings " application = WSGIHandler ( ) if __name__ == " __main__ " : script . run ()
There , now that we have our application , we can make a simple Werkzeug runserver — which , by the way , is much more light - weight and nicer to work with than Django's .
To do this , we define a variable called action_runserver , as Werkzeug 's script module looks for action_* variable names .
import sys import os from werkzeug import script from django.core.handlers.wsgi import WSGIHandler sys .
path .
insert ( 0 , os .
path .
dirname ( __file__ ) ) os .
environ [ " DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE " ] = " foo.settings " application = WSGIHandler ( ) action_runserver = script .
make_runserver ( lambda : application , use_reloader = True , use_debugger = True ) if __name__ == " __main__ " : script . run ()
There , we 've got our first management command .
Try it out !
python new - manage .py runserver should do the trick .
Pass -h for help .
On to the Flickzeug part then .
Flickzeug works as a WSGI middleware , that is to say , you wrap a WSGI application in Flickzeug , and the application gains the functionality desired .
import sys import os from werkzeug import script from django.core.handlers.wsgi import WSGIHandler sys .
path .
insert ( 0 , os .
path .
dirname ( __file__ ) ) os .
environ [ " DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE " ] = " foo.settings " application = WSGIHandler ( ) def make_leakfinder ( ) : from flickzeug import LeakFinder filter = lambda v : ( not v . startswith ( " foo . " ) and not v . startswith ( " bar. " ) ) return LeakFinder ( application , filter = filter ) action_runserver = script .
make_runserver ( lambda : application , use_reloader = True , use_debugger = True ) action_runserver_leakfinder = script .
make_runserver ( make_leakfinder , use_reloader = True , use_debugger = True ) if __name__ == " __main__ " : script . run ()
So what we did was pass a different callable to make_runserver , which returns a Flickzeug - wrapped version of our application instead .
The Flickzeug LeakFinder optionally takes a filter argument , which I find very useful indeed to filter out the noise made by Django and any other third - party component you might n't necessarily be interested in .
The same approach can be used for any other part of Flickzeug , or indeed any other WSGI middleware you might want to use .

( CNN ) --
A year ago , Maydellyn Lamourt watched her 16 - year - old son 's dreams fall apart .
The outgoing sophomore who enjoyed playing sports was charged and sentenced as an adult in Connecticut for third - degree assault .
The crime :
He and a friend stole a pack of gum from another teen .
Because he entered the adult penal system , the teen 's prospects of joining the Marines are dim .
His troubles have landed him in an alternative high school .
If Lamourt 's son had committed the crime this month , his situation would be different .
His record would have been sealed in the juvenile system .
Earlier this month , Connecticut raised from 16 to 17 the age at which a juvenile is automatically prosecuted as an adult .
The change comes at a time when the " adult time for adult crime " mentality is being re-examined in several states and challenged in the U.S. Supreme Court .
Connecticut child advocates say the juvenile system is better suited for teens because it offers more access to rehabilitative programs , schooling , community - based programming and supervision from juvenile probation officers .
In felony cases , judges can still decide on a case - by - case basis whether to transfer juveniles younger than 17 to the adult system .
" I was devastated that my son would be in corrections with grown men , " said Lamourt .
Her son spent a month at a adult facility that housed juveniles and young adults .
" He feels like from here on down , everything will go downhill , " she said .
This year , the Supreme Court will consider whether juvenile offenses merit adult punishment .
The justices could decide whether juveniles can be sentenced to life without parole for crimes other than murder .
One case involves a Florida inmate , who was convicted of rape at the age of 13 and given a sentence of life without parole .
Juvenile courts have always had the ability to transfer teens and children to the adult system , but a spike in youth crime during the 1980s and 1990s prompted states to implement mandatory sentencing policies for certain crimes and lower the age at which a child can be sentenced to adult court .
Until this year , Connecticut was one of three states , along with New York and North Carolina , to automatically place teen offenders 16 and older in the adult system .
Ten other states automatically transfer juveniles 17 and older to the adult system -- including South Carolina , Georgia and Texas .
The decision to raise the age of adult court jurisdiction in Connecticut was spurred by the 2005 suicide of David Burgos .
Burgos , a lanky 17 - year - old known to family for his sense of humor , suffered from mental illness when he was charged and sentenced as an adult for violating probation .
Burgo hung himself with a sheet in his cell at Manson Youth Institution , a corrections facility that also houses offenders between 18 and 21 .
His suicide galvanized Connecticut lawmakers to raise the age in which a juvenile can be moved into adult corrections system .
" When you teach someone to swim , you do n't just throw them in the deep end and hope they do great , " said Abby Anderson , executive director of the Connecticut Juvenile Justice Alliance , the nonprofit agency that spearheaded the campaign to change the law .
Originally , Connecticut child advocates pushed legislation that raised the age to 18 , but budget cuts forced the state to raise the age to 17 .
The policy shift in Connecticut , a state that once sent the highest number of juveniles to the adult system , is catching on in other states .
This month , Illinois stopped sending 17 - year - olds who commit misdemeanors to the adult system .
Instead , the offenders are sent to the juvenile system where drug treatment and counseling are often required .
In North Carolina , another state where the criminal justice system automatically views 16 - year - olds as adults , a bill was introduced last spring to raise the age a teen can be charged as an adult to 18 .
That measure in the bill was rejected , but lawmakers established a task force to study the proposal with a deadline of 2011 .
Meanwhile , lobbying efforts to raise the age continue in other states .
In Georgia and Wisconsin , where a 17 - year - old is considered an adult , lawmakers and juvenile advocates have been working toward change for the past year .
A precise number of how many children are tried in adult court is difficult to ascertain because states keep records differently , but some experts estimate about a quarter of juveniles are prosecuted in the adult court system .
On a single day in 2008 , more than 7,700 children younger than 18 were held in adult local jails and 3,600 in adult state prisons , according to a 2009 University of Texas - Austin report .
The juvenile system is based on a rehabilitative approach , compared to the punitive adult system , child advocates point out .
They argue that the adult system teaches juveniles to become adult criminals , which places the community at risk .
While some states are questioning their juvenile sentencing policies , sentencing experts say raising the ages or eliminating mandatory sentences remains politically risky .
Much of what states decide to do with their juvenile policies may depend upon Connecticut 's outcome .
Jeffrey Fagan , a Columbia University law professor who has studied juvenile crime , said he thinks reform will come in stages , such as Illinois ' new law , which addresses juveniles committing misdemeanors but not other crimes .
" It 's easier to sell to the public and implement , " Fagan said .
The policy changes in Connecticut occurred largely because of a growing body of brain research distinguishing the adolescent and adult minds .
In 2005 , the Supreme Court cited differences in the adolescent and adult brains as a reason for abolishing the death penalty for juveniles .
Up until the last decade , scientific research on the adolescent brain was largely nonexistent .
Led by professor Laurence Steinberg of Temple University and others in the psychology field , their research explained why juveniles lack control and understanding of long - term consequence and are more susceptible to peer pressure .
" The teenage brain is like a car with a good accelerator but a weak brake , " Steinberg wrote .
" With powerful impulses under poor control , the likely result is a crash . "
Critics argue that sending juveniles to the adult system can deter other teens .
They point out that juvenile crime has declined in recent years .
Maydellyn Lamourt says she warned her son about the dangers of a life of crime , citing mistakes she had made .
Lamourt spent eight months in prison after being convicted of larceny and drug possession in 2004 .
Like her son , the mother knows firsthand the consequences of having a criminal record .
" It follows you for life , " she said .
Is Da Vinci's Mona Lisa a Self - Portrait ?
Some say that the Mona Lisa may be a self - portrait , Leonardo da Vinci in drag .
LONDON , Jan. 26 , 2010  -- Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa is arguably the most famous portrait in the world , but now some are speculating that the woman with the inscrutable smile may not be a woman after all .
They are suggesting that the Mona Lisa may be a self - portrait , da Vinci in drag .
Italy 's National Committee for Cultural Heritage , a leading association of scientists and art historians , is undertaking the investigation .
They think the artist who died in 1519 is buried at a French castle and plan to dig up his skull .
Using CSI - style technology , they want to rebuild da Vinci 's face .
Will he resemble the mysterious Mona Lisa ?
Jason Rosenfeld , associate professor of Art History at Marymount Manhattan College , says , " This sounds like a 1970s caper movie .
Bring me the head of Lenny from Vinci ! "
" It puts on the level of the reason why we preserved Einstein 's brain , or Ted Williams ' head is frozen somewhere in Florida , or King Tut 's mummy is an obsession of people to understand how he died , " he says .
" Now we want to get the body of Leonardo .
We want to see what he died of , we want to see his DNA , we want to see the size of his head , what his facial features were like so we can see whether this was a self - portrait and it seems on the whole ridiculous . "
Mona Lisa was painted around 500 years ago .
Beyond that , we know almost nothing about the painting that is now on display at the Louvre in Paris .
A new documentary , " Mona Lisa Revealed , " suggests there 's a hidden love note on the canvas .
But the real mystery is and always has been : who is she ?
A merchant 's wife ?
Da Vinci 's mother ?
As Rosenfeld puts it , " The questions about who this woman is range from : she is related to Medici family , or she is the wife of a wealthy merchant in Florence ... no one really knows . "
" Or most outlandishly that she is actually a hidden self portrait of Leonardo himself [...] that 's a kind of theory that seems most outrageous but is still of interest , " he says .
Is the painting a joke then ?
A riddle conjured up by the mischievous artist ?
Da Vinci , the Renaissance Man ... and Cross - Dresser ?
We 're all familiar with da Vinci 's love of riddles from a rather successful succession of books and movies .
" He is interested in symbols , he is interested in puzzles , he is interested in keeping things kind of hidden and this idea about the picture sort of relates to that , that is part of this whole mythologizing of Leonardo as someone who is playing tricks , who is always a step ahead of a viewer , and someone who is making you think of his works in a very different way , " Rosenfeld says .
Indeed , Rosenfeld wonders , " If Leonardo is a Renaissance man ... why can't he be a transvestite as well , and a cross- dresser ? "
But will the exhumation uncover the truth behind the Mona Lisa ?
Not likely , according to Rosenfeld .
" If the French Government really wants to help find out what this is about , what they should do is allow restorers to clean the Mona Lisa .
We will learn much more from them allowing conservators to clean the painting and understand it better than digging up a body . "
If the Mona Lisa is in fact a riddle , a self - portrait in drag , somewhere out there , da Vinci would be smiling that it 's taken us 500 years to solve it .
Genetic algorithms have been used to find solution to a wide variety of problems , including compiler optimizations .
It was only a matter of time before somebody applied these techniques to fixing faults in source code .
When I first skimmed the paper “ A Genetic Programming Approach to Automated Software Repair ” I was surprised at how successful the genetic algorithm was , using as it did such a relatively small amount of cpu resources .
A more careful reading of the paper located one very useful technique for reducing the size of the search space ; the automated software repair system started by profiling the code to find out which parts of it were executed by the test cases and only considered statements that were executed by these tests for mutation operations ( they give a much higher weighting to statements only executed by the failing test case than to statements executed by the other tests ; I am a bit surprised that this weighting difference is worthwhile ) .
I hate to think of the amount of time I have wasted trying to fix a bug by looking at code that was not executed by the test case I was running .
I learned more about this very interesting system from one of the authors when he gave the keynote at a workshop organized by people associated with a source code analysis group I was a member of .
The search space was further constrained by only performing mutations at the statement level ( i.e. , expressions and declarations were not touched ) and restricting the set of candidate statements for insertion into the code to those statements already contained within the code , such as if ( x != NULL ) ( i.e. , new statements were not randomly created and existing statements were not modified in any way ) .
As measurements of existing code show most uses of a construct are covered by a few simple cases and most statements are constructed from a small number of commonly used constructs .
It is no surprise that restricting the candidate insertion set to existing code works so well .
Of course no fault fix that depends on using a statement not contained within the source will ever be found .
There is ongoing work looking at genetic modifications at the expression level .
This
work shares a problem with GA driven test coverage algorithms ; how to find ‘ magic numbers ’ ( in the case of test coverage the magic numbers are those that will cause a controlling expression to be true or false ) .
Literals in source code , like those on the web , tend to follow a power ’ish law but the fit to Benford ’s law is not good .
Once mutated source that correctly processes the previously failing test case , plus continuing to pass the other test cases , has been generated the code is passed to the final phase of the automated software repair system .
Many mutations have no effect on program behavior ( the DNA term intron is sometimes applied to them ) and the final phase removes any of the added statements that have no effect on test suite output ( Westley Weimer said that a reduction from 50 statements to 10 statements is common ) .
Might the ideas behind this very interesting research system end up being used in ‘ live ’ software ?
I think so .
There are systems that operate 24/7 where faults cost money .
One can imagine a fault being encountered late at night , a genetic based system fixing the fault which then updates the live system , the human developers being informed and deciding what to do later .
It does not take much imagination to see the cost advantages driving expensive human input out of the loop in some cases .
An on - going research topic is the extent to which a good quality test suite is needed to ensure that mutated fault fixes do n’t introduce new faults .
Human written software is known to often be remarkably tolerant to the presence of faults .
Perhaps ensuring that software has this characteristic is something that should be investigated .

The Ugly Truth About Marijuana
fjrigjwwe9r1Content_Articles:Tx
Disclaimer :
This is not an article about morals or whether I think marijuana should be legal or illegal .
As much as I do n't care for it , I 'm not saying it should be illegal for people to do what they want , if it does n't harm others .
And personally , I feel that what people choose to do to themselves in their private life is nobody 's business but their own , and certainly not the business of the government .
Since this is a health site , I wo n't go into that .
I 'm also not writing this to offend marijuana users , but to inform people of some important observations of my own .
Everything comes with a price
This article is n't anything like that ridiculous Reefer Madness movie they used to show kids in the 70's .
I 'm simply going to tell you what the average pot smoker wo n't tell you while sitting around the campfire with pipe in hand ... or sitting around the house watching television , which is far more likely .
Not everyone that smokes weed has a serious problem , but we just have to understand that everything comes at a price , therefore we should know what the price is beforehand .
Just like alcohol and fast food , marijuana does have many harmful effects .
I 'm not just talking about physical effects though .
Marijuana can kill your aspirations and motivation , and thus sabotage your entire life without you even realizing it .
I 'm sure that most people know at least one person , if not more , that is a chronic pot smoker .
These days , it seems like anyone could be doing it :
Your next door neighbor , your cousin , your uncle , your parents , your kid , anyone .
Some do it to relieve anxiety , and some do it to relieve pain .
But I 'm not referring to them , and I 'm also not talking about the guy who does it once a decade on his birthday and then forgets about it , nor am I referring to anyone who tried it a few times way back in their college days and claims that they did n't inhale .
I 'm talking about the guy who does it every day , every other day , or every week .
It 's part of his lifestyle .
It 's his daily or weekly ritual .
Marijuana is an easy way for anyone to sabotage their success .
It 's very rare that you see a successful and coherent marijuana user who really has his act together .
And I can guarantee you that the few smokers who are sharp , would be even sharper if they did n't smoke dope .
I get occasional angry emails ( mostly from college students ) who try and refute my claim that marijuana is mind - altering .
Much like anything else that you put in your body , it IS mind altering .
By the way , have you ever taken inventory of the characteristics of those who regularly smoke pot ?
I 'm not saying they 're bad people or anything like that , but have you noticed anything about their life ?
Their memory ?
How about their levels of motivation ?
Does anyone know anyone who regularly smokes pot and is successful ?
These people are far and few , with the exception of artists , celebrities , or the nutty rich guy who lives a completely different lifestyle than most people can afford .
Now I 'm going to address some common arguments that the dazed and confused crowd often uses to brainwash others into thinking that dope is a good thing .
" Marijuana is alright because it 's all natural ! "
This means nothing .
You 're still firing up a substance that turns into smoke , and sucking it into your lungs .
Last time I checked , the sucking of smoke into your lungs is not good for your lungs .
Does n't the burning feeling tell you something ?
The human body is not naturally designed to be smoking anything .
And what about the dizzying effect of being high ?
You can't tell me that is n't affecting your brain .
If being a ' natural substance ' was the only prerequisite for putting something in our body , we might as well go around eating turds , which are also very natural .
" Weed is harmless because you can't overdose and die from it ! "
Once again , this does n't say much .
Just because you can't overdose and die from something does n't mean it 's good for your brain .
You also can't overdose from cheeseburgers , but they 're not good for your health either .
" Marijuana users are peaceful people ! "
This is often a subject that is brought up which has absolutely nothing to do with the conversation at hand .
It only goes to show you that some pot smokers are often so clueless that they are n't able to stay on topic .
Sure , weed smokers are n't usually violent people .
" What 's that got to do with your memory loss though ?
Oh wait , did you forget already ? "
" But Alcohol is just as bad ! "
This article is n't about alcohol , but yes - alcohol is also mind - altering too , and can be very abusive to the body .
" Mr. Healthy , you 're a judgmental snob , and you have something against potheads ! "
Snob ?
Because I speak the truth about marijuana being a demotivator that affects memory ?
Give me a break .
I have nothing against potheads .
This is absolutely not true .
Some of my best friends have been doing it for years , and I see people doing it all the time who are some of the nicest people imaginable .
However I 'm not going to pretend that it 's harmless to your life when I know it is n't .
I 've been around it for a decades , which is plenty of time to realize what it does , who 's usually doing it , and what the long term results are .
" It 's all about moderation , dude .
Anything in moderation is alright . "
I suppose that if you hardly ever do it , you wo n't be affected like the ones that do it frequently .
That 's just common sense .
I can have a chocolate chip cookie once in a while , but if I were to live a " chocolate chip lifestyle " , then I could expect to get fat and develop diabetes some day .
Weed comes with a price as well .
Did you think that being high and feeling that good has no price tag ?
Who are we kidding here ?
As far as moderation goes , that 's just a gray area .
Look around for yourself .
I encourage you to look around at people who have smoked pot for a long time or do it on a regular basis .
Do you seem to notice that they typically do n't have much going on in their life ?
Why do you think this is ?
They 'll often admit to short - term memory loss , and the fact that weed causes them to lose motivation .
Instead of being productive and looking for a job , or doing something meaningful , I 'm sure that it 's left many people laying around on the couch all day eating potato chips in front of the television .
Yes , there are many exceptions , and I 'm NOT referring to college kids who are ' doing so well in school ' and that they smoke weed all the time .
I suppose if you 're retired and live on a beach somewhere , and do n't have any more goals in life , then smoking weed would be a great compliment to your relaxed lifestyle .
For most people who are still ambitious though , weed is just another obstacle in the path of success .
I once knew a 20 year old who had smoked so much pot in his teens , that he could no longer articulate himself and complete a sentence .
Sadly , he was fired from his deli job on the first day , because he could not memorize several items on the menu .
If you were an employer , do you think it 's riskier to hire a pot smoker to work for you ?
How dependable do you think he probably is , compared to someone else ?
If you lent money to a pothead , what is the likelihood that you 'll ever see that money again ?
If
Drug Overdoses Not Only Kill People ...
A drug overdose is n't always a simple matter of survival or death .
It can cause permanent , horrifying consequences .

Yale ’s Environment 360 has a new must - read report by Sonia Shah linking pesticides to the high - profile die - offs among amphibians , bees , and bats .
What makes this news timely is n’t necessarily the toxicity of the pesticides per se , it ’s the indirect effects on these animals of chronic , low - dose exposure to chemicals :
In the past dozen years , no fewer than three never - before - seen diseases have decimated populations of amphibians , bees , and — most recently — bats .
A growing body of evidence indicates that pesticide exposure may be playing an important role in the decline of the first two species , and scientists are investigating whether such exposures may be involved in the deaths of more than 1 million bats in the northeastern United States over the past several years .
…
The recent spate of widespread die - offs began in amphibians .
Scientists discovered the culprit — an aquatic fungus called Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis , of a class of fungi called “ chytrids ” — in 1998 .
Its devastation , says amphibian expert Kevin Zippel , is “ unlike anything we ’ve seen since the extinction of the dinosaurs . ”
Over 1,800 species of amphibians currently face extinction .
It may be , as many experts believe , that the chytrid fungus is a novel pathogen , decimating species that have no armor against it , much as Europe ’s smallpox and measles decimated Native Americans in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries .
But “ there is a really good plausible story of chemicals affecting the immune system and making animals more susceptible , ” as well , says San Francisco State University conservation biologist Carlos Davidson .
Shah goes on to explain a mechanism whereby pesticides applied to fields in California ’s Central Valley drift into the Sierra Nevada mountains “ where they settle in the air , snow , and surface waters , and inside the tissues of amphibians . ”
A scientist who studied the matter “ found a strong correlation between upwind pesticide use … and declining amphibian populations . ”
Meanwhile , bees and bats have suffered a similar fate — killed off by powerful pathogens that in theory could be novel but in practice seem to have taken advantage of animal populations immuno - compromised by pesticides .
One of the most interesting aspects of the piece was the description of an Italian scientist ’s unpublished research that suggests the “ missing link ” between neonicotinoids , a powerful pesticide already banned in Europe but still in use in the U.S. , and bee colony collapse .
It relates to the practices of using neonicotinoids - coated seeds planted by machines that kick up clouds of pesticide as they work :
… In as - yet - unpublished research , [ University of Padua entomologist Vincenzo ]
Girolami has found concentrations of insecticide in clouds above seeding machines 1,000 times the dose lethal to bees .
In the spring , when the seed machines are working , says Girolami , “ I think that 90 percent or more of deaths of bees is due to direct pesticide poisoning . ”
Girolami has also found lethal levels of neonicotinoids in other , unexpected — and usually untested — places , such as the drops of liquid that treated crops secrete along their leaf margins , which bees and other insects drink .
But Shah concludes by observing that this accumulating evidence comes with challenges and caveats that , I would point out , industry ruthlessly exploits :
Proving , with statistical certainty , that low - level pesticide exposure makes living things more vulnerable to disease is notoriously difficult .
There are too many different pesticides , lurking in too many complex , poorly understood habitats to build definitively damning indictments .
The evidence is subtle , suggestive .
Subtle and suggestive though it may be , it ’s extremely unlikely that these chemicals are n’t also acting on us .
This news plus the data surrounding the consequences to human health of low - dose exposure to chemicals like atrazine , BPA and phthalates should have us in a panic and our government in a regulatory frenzy .
Instead we get paralysis and promises of “ further study . ”
As we wait for a chemical “ smoking gun , ” I wonder what animal population will die off next .

THE effect of free money is remarkable .
A year ago investors were panicking and there was talk of another Depression .
Now the MSCI world index of global share prices is more than 70 % higher than its low in March 2009 .
That 's largely thanks to interest rates of 1 % or less in America , Japan , Britain and the euro zone , which have persuaded investors to take their money out of cash and to buy risky assets .
For all the panic last year , asset values never quite reached the lows that marked other bear - market bottoms , and now the rally has made several markets look pricey again .
In the American housing market , where the crisis started , homes are priced at around fair value on the basis of rental yields , but they are overvalued by almost 30 % in Britain and by 50 % in Australia , Hong Kong and Spain .
Stockmarkets are still shy of their record peaks in most countries .
The American market is around 25 % below the level it reached in 2007 .
But it is still nearly 50 % overvalued on the best long - term measure , which adjusts profits to allow for the economic cycle , and is on a par with two of the four great valuation peaks in the 20th century , in 1901 and 1966 .
Central banks see these market rallies as a welcome side - effect of their policies .
In 2008 , falling markets caused a vicious circle of debt defaults and fire sales by investors , pushing asset prices down even further .
The market rebound was necessary to stabilise economies last year , but now there is a danger that bubbles are being created ( see article ) .
Forever blowing bubbles ?
Aside from high asset valuations , the two classic symptoms of a bubble are rapid growth in private - sector credit and an outbreak of public enthusiasm for particular assets .
There 's no sign of either of those .
But the longer the world keeps its interest rates close to zero , the greater the danger that bubbles will appear — most likely in emerging markets , where growth keeps investors optimistic and currency pegs import loose monetary policy , and in commodities .
Central banks have a range of tools they can use to discourage the growth of bubbles .
Forcing banks to adopt higher capital ratios may curb speculative excesses .
As Ben Bernanke , chairman of the Federal Reserve , argued this week , the rise in American house prices could have been limited through better regulation of the banks .
The most powerful tool , of course , is the interest rate .
But central banks are wary of using it to pop bubbles because it risks crushing growth as well .
And , with the world economy in its current fragile state , they are rightly unwilling to jack up interest rates now .
But even if governments judge that the risks posed by raising rates now outweighs that of keeping them low , investors still have plenty of reasons to worry .
The problem for them is not just that valuations look high by historic standards .
It is also that the current combination of high asset prices , low interest rates and massive fiscal deficits is unsustainable .
Interest rates will stay low only if growth remains slow .
But if economies grow slowly , then profits will not rise fast enough to justify current share prices and incomes will not rise far enough to justify the prevailing level of house prices .
If , on the other hand , the markets are right about the prospects for economic growth , and the current recovery is sustained , then governments will react by cutting off the supply of cheap money later this year .
It does n't add up
But the more immediate risks may be posed by fiscal policy .
Many governments responded to the crisis by , in effect , taking the debt burden off the private sector 's balance - sheets and putting it on their own .
This caused a huge gap to open up in government finances .
Deficits in America and Britain , for instance , stand at more than 10 % of GDP .
Most developed - country governments have managed to finance these deficits fairly easily so far .
In the early stages of the crisis , investors were happy to opt for the safety of government bonds .
Then central banks resorted to quantitative easing ( QE ) , a polite term for the creation of money .
The Bank of England , for example , has bought the equivalent of one year 's entire fiscal deficit .
There are signs , however , that private - sector investors ' appetite for government debt may be just about sated , as they contemplate the vast amount of government bonds that are due to be issued this year and the ending of QE programmes .
The yields on ten - year Treasury bonds and British gilts have both risen by more than half a percentage point since late November .
Investors ( along with this newspaper ) would like to see governments unveil clear plans for reducing those deficits over the medium term , with the emphasis on spending cuts rather than tax increases .
But politicians are nervous about the likely reaction of electorates , not to mention the short - term economic impact of fiscal tightening , and are proving reluctant to specify where the cuts will be made .
Markets have already tested the ability of the weakest governments to bear the burden of their debt .
Dubai had to turn to its wealthy neighbour , Abu Dhabi , for help .
In the euro zone , doubts have been raised about the willingness of Greece to push through the required austerity measures .
Electorates are likely to chafe at the cost of bringing down government deficits , especially if the main result is to repay foreign creditors .
That will lead to currency crises and cross - border disputes like the current spat between Iceland , Britain and the Netherlands over the bill for compensating depositors in Icelandic banks ( see article ) .
Such disputes will lead to further outbreaks of market volatility .
Investors tempted to take comfort from the fact that asset prices are still below their peaks would do well to remember that they may yet fall back a very long way .
The Japanese stock market still trades at a quarter of the high it reached 20 years ago .
The NASDAQ trades at half the level it reached during dotcom mania .
Today the prices of many assets are being held up by unsustainable fiscal and monetary stimulus .
Something has to give .
WASHINGTON  Rebuffed this month by skeptical lawmakers when it sought finances to buy a prison in rural Illinois , the Obama administration is struggling to come up with the money to replace the Guantánamo Bay prison .
As a result , officials now believe that they are unlikely to close the prison at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , and transfer its population of terrorism suspects until 2011 at the earliest  a far slower timeline for achieving one of President Obama ’s signature national security policies than they had previously hinted .
While Mr. Obama has acknowledged that he would miss the Jan. 22 deadline for closing the prison that he set shortly after taking office , the administration appeared to take a major step forward last week when he directed subordinates to move “ as expeditiously as possible ” to acquire the Thomson Correctional Center , a nearly vacant maximum - security Illinois prison , and to retrofit it to receive Guantánamo detainees .
But in interviews this week , officials estimated that it could take 8 to 10 months to install new fencing , towers , cameras and other security upgrades before any transfers take place .
Such construction cannot begin until the federal government buys the prison from the State of Illinois .

The only interest groups that Obama seems to be catering to are the centrist assholes in the media , the disgusting Health Insurance Industry , venal Wall Street and the evil Military Industrial Complex .
Obama 's putative liberal base CAN'T be happy at this point , with all the shit he 's pulled .
At least Bushto cater to his conservative base -- although perhaps the hardcore conservatives did n't think so .

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger pledged to spare public schools , colleges and universities from the budget ax this year and proposed privatizing at least some of the state 's prisons in his final State of the State address .
In a 27 - minute speech , Schwarzenegger told a joint gathering of the Assembly and Senate that although the state faces a nearly $ 20 billion deficit , he was drawing a line with education .
" Because our future economic well - being is so dependent upon education , I will protect education funding in this budget .
And we can no longer afford to cut higher education either , " the governor said .
Schwarzenegger also called for a $ 500 million job - creation program , major changes in budgeting laws and in pension benefits for public employees , a push for more federal dollars and a constitutional amendment to guarantee that more money is spent on higher education than prisons .
No talk of deficit
But while setting an ambitious agenda , the governor did not talk about what probably will dominate his remaining time in office - deciding what state services will be scaled back or eliminated to make up the budget deficit .
Schwarzenegger said the deficit is $ 19.9 billion , slightly less than $ 20.7 billion deficit predicted by the Legislative Analyst 's Office .
That bleak news comes Friday , when the governor will unveil his spending plan .
He called the state 's budget and tax systems cruel , saying they force lawmakers to choose between poor and sick children when cutting services , and called for changes .
His nominee for lieutenant governor , Sen. Abel Maldonado , R - Santa Maria ( Santa Barbara County ) , said after the speech that social services indeed would take the hit .
" There 's going to be cuts .
They 're going to come from health and human services , " Maldonado said .
He added that the cuts would be deeper if the state is unable to collect $ 6.3 billion from the federal government that state leaders believe California is owed .
Democrats applauded the governor 's pledge not to cut education , but afterward leaders expressed skepticism about whether that is possible given the likely trade - offs .
Education spending made up $ 45.5 billion of $ 84.5 billion in general fund spending this year .
" We do n't support the notion that we 're going to have a firewall on education and eliminate everything else .
And , of course , what I 'm concerned about is health and human services and the safety net , because safety net programs are on life support as it is , " said Assembly Speaker Karen Bass , D - Baldwin Vista ( Los Angeles County ) .
She and state Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg , D - Sacramento , said they also have concerns about a constitutional amendment guaranteeing higher education spending because they said it would be a prime example of ballot - box budgeting that limits lawmakers ' control over spending .
" We need to begin setting the stage now to do no more harm , and begin thinking about how we reinvest in California , " Steinberg said .
Private prisons
The governor said privatizing prisons would save " billions of dollars a year " that could be used for higher education .
While that idea was praised by education leaders and advocates across the state , it appears to have little support in the Legislature as Democratic leaders roundly rejected it .
Assemblywoman Noreen Evans , D - Santa Rosa , said the idea simply does not make sense .
" He has a really good way of setting things up and saying ' We have no choice here , and this is what we must do , ' and it 's just not true , " Evans said .
Sen . Mark Leno , D - San Francisco , chairman of the Public Safety Committee , said the governor 's " rhetoric does not match his record . "
" The prison crisis has become a state of emergency on his watch , " Leno said .
" Our disinvestment in higher education and our ever greater investment in prisons has happened under his watch . "
' Jobs , jobs , jobs '
The governor also said a priority for the year would be " jobs , jobs , jobs , " which won praise from both parties , but more so from Republicans as he included easing some construction regulations - a move they long have sought .
He proposed a package of bills that he said would train up to 140,000 workers and create or retain up to 100,000 jobs .
That would be accomplished by providing reimbursement to employers for training new workers or retraining employees for new jobs .
Employers could recoup up to $ 4,400 for each worker .
Schwarzenegger proposed paying for the $ 500 million program by borrowing from the Unemployment Compensation Disability Fund , a state fund created to compensate those unemployed because of sickness or injury .
The governor said the fund has enough money to cover claims and provide the loan .
He also proposed exempting some construction projects from legal challenges once they have completed an environmental review and called for a limit on punitive damages in lawsuits .
The governor proposed extending the popular tax credit for first - time home buyers , and allowing the credit to apply to purchases of previously owned homes .
Assembly Minority Leader Sam Blakeslee , R - San Luis Obispo , praised the governor 's jobs proposal , noting that he is the author of a key piece of that plan - a bill that would exempt zero-emission vehicle manufacturers like Tesla Motors from sales tax on the purchase of new manufacturing equipment .
" We were very happy to see his emphasis on jobs - we can't afford to lose the Nummis , " he said , referring to the Fremont automobile plant that is due to close in March .
" These are huge employers in the state , and oftentimes a very small amount of seed money can make a huge difference to whether an employer leaves . "
Priorities Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger outlined these goals for 2010 : Higher education and prisons : Schwarzenegger wants to prohibit the state from spending more on prisons than on higher education , in part by allowing private prisons .
He wants 10 percent of the general fund to be spent on the University of California and California State University systems by 2014 - 15 , when 7 percent would be spent on prisons .
The changes would be made by a constitutional amendment , which requires voter approval , that would allow the state to contract with private firms to build , operate and manage prisons .
That means new and existing prisons could be managed by private companies .
Jobs and economic growth : Schwarzenegger wants to spend $ 500 million to create 100,000 jobs and train 140,000 people for better - paying work .
He also wants to expand a $ 10,000 home - buyer tax credit , eliminate sales taxes on the purchase of green technology manufacturing equipment and make it easier for developers to get permits for construction projects .
Tax and budget reform :
The governor wants to reduce most personal income taxes and eliminate the corporation tax , minimum franchise tax and sales tax ( except on gas and diesel fuels ) , and collect tax on business net receipts , with the exception of very small businesses .
He wants the budget to require only a simple majority vote , not the two - thirds majority it now needs .
( Tax increases would still need two - thirds approval . )
He would require any new state program or agency that costs more than $ 25 million a year to pay for itself and prohibit the Legislature from being paid if it does n't pass the budget on time .
Pension reform :
The governor said that pension costs for government employees have increased by 2,000 percent over the past decade while revenues rose 24 percent .
The fund 's $ 3 billion annual cost will eventually rise to $ 10 billion , he said .
Help for veterans : Schwarzenegger announced a statewide initiative aimed at connecting returning veterans with jobs , housing , mental and physical health care , federal benefits and other support .
It would establish nine regional centers and create the volunteer California Veteran Corps to serve as liaisons between the centers and combat veterans .

House to vote on Obama 's first veto
By Ben Pershing
On Dec. 30 , President Obama quietly issued his first veto .
On Wednesday , the House will vote on whether to override that veto .
Except Obama did n't really oppose the bill he vetoed , and the House does n't really want to override it .
Confused ?
Welcome to the murky world of the separation of powers , where the legislative and executive branches are still squabbling , more than 200 years after the adoption of the Constitution , over how exactly the president is empowered to reject a bill passed by Congress .
In this case , the issue is whether the president can issue a " pocket veto " when Congress is out of session by simply refusing to sign a bill .
The measure in question is a short - term spending bill or " continuing resolution " that passed the House Dec. 16 and the Senate Dec. 19 , and was written to keep the government funded through Dec. 23 , just in case it was necessary .
But then Obama signed the Defense spending measure , and so there was no need for the CR to become law .
What happens to a bill if it is passed by both chambers but the president does nothing ?
If Congress is in session , everyone agrees , the bill becomes law after 10 days .
If Congress is in " adjournment , " then the bill is pocket vetoed .
The complicating factor in this case is that neither the House or Senate really " adjourned " during the holiday break , though both did go into " recess . "
As CQ Today ( subscription required ) explains :
While the Constitution allows the president to kill a bill by not signing it and not returning it to Capitol Hill if Congress has adjourned , constitutional scholars are divided on whether such a pocket veto is valid when the House and Senate are in recess or during the period between the two sessions of a Congress if the chambers have made arrangements to receive official messages from the White House .
Because of that ambiguity , Obama decided to cover all his bases , as past presidents have in similar circumstances .
In the " Memorandum of Disapproval " he sent to Congress on Dec. 30 , the president said " I am withholding my approval from the bill ....
To leave no doubt that the bill is being vetoed as unnecessary legislation , in addition to withholding my signature , I am also returning H.J. Res. 64 to the Clerk of the House of Representatives , along with this Memorandum of Disapproval . "
In other words , Obama issued both a pocket veto and a traditional veto .
Bad move , an expert tells the Washington Times :
The Constitution " simply does n't give the president a multiple - choice option " on how to veto a bill , said Robert Spitzer , chairman of the political science department at State University of New York at Cortland and author of a noted book on the presidential veto .
The method used by Mr. Obama , Mr. Spitzer noted , has been a source of tension between the White House and Congress dating back to the Ford administration .
Since Congress does n't agree that Obama had the right to simply " withhold his approval " in this case , the House will vote on overriding the traditional veto to signal that it does n't recognize the pocket veto .
But leaders scheduled the vote for symbolic reasons -- they do n't actually want their members to override the veto .
" We will vote to sustain the veto because the CR is not necessary and is redundant , " says a House Democratic aide .
Assuming at least 146 members vote to sustain ( two - thirds being necessary to override a veto ) , the issue will be settled and the Senate wo n't have to bother with it when that chamber returns next week .
And no , there will not be a quiz on this later .

Java Scripting Programmer 's Guide
Who is the Java Scripting API For ?
Some useful characteristics of scripting languages are :
Convenience : Most scripting languages are dynamically typed .
You can usually create new variables without declaring the variable type , and you can reuse variables to store objects of different types .
Also , scripting languages tend to perform many type conversions automatically , for example , converting the number 10 to the text " 10 " as necessary .
Developing rapid prototypes :
You can avoid the edit - compile - run cycle and just use edit - run !
Application extension / customization : You can " externalize " parts of your application - like configuration scripts , business logic / rules and math expressions for financial applications .
" Command line " shells for applications - for debugging , runtime / deploy time configuration etc .
Most applications have a web - based GUI configuaration tool these days .
But sysadmins / deployers frequently prefer command line tools .
Instead of inventing ad - hoc scripting language for that purpose , a " standard " scripting language can be used .
The Java TM Scripting API is a scripting language indepedent framework for using script engines from Java code .
With the Java Scripting API , it is possible to write customizable / extendable applications in the Java language and leave the customization scripting language choice to the end user .
The Java application developer need not choose the extension language during development .
If you write your application with JSR - 223 API , then your users can use any JSR - 223 compliant scripting language .
Scripting Package
The Java Scripting functionality is in the javax . script package .
This is a relatively small , simple API .
The starting point of the scripting API is the ScriptEngineManager class .
A ScriptEngineManager object can discover script engines through the jar file service discovery mechanism .
It can also instantiate ScriptEngine objects that interpret scripts written in a specific scripting language .
The simplest way to use the scripting API is as follows :
Create a ScriptEngineManager object .
Get a ScriptEngine object from the manager .
Evaluate script using the ScriptEngine 's eval methods .
Now , it is time to look at some sample code .
While it is not mandatory , it may be useful to know a bit of JavaScript to read these examples .
Examples
" Hello , World "
From the ScriptEngineManager instance , we request a JavaScript engine instance using getEngineByName method .
On the script engine , the eval method is called to execute a given String as JavaScript code !
For brevity , in this as well as in subsequent examples , we have not shown exception handling .
There are checked and runtime exceptions thrown from javax .
script API .
Needless to say , you have to handle the exceptions appropriately .
import javax.script .* ; public class EvalScript { public static void main ( String [ ] args ) throws Exception { // create a script engine manager ScriptEngineManager factory = new ScriptEngineManager ( ) ; // create a JavaScript engine ScriptEngine engine = factory .
getEngineByName ( " JavaScript " ) ; // evaluate JavaScript code from String engine .
eval ( " print ( ' Hello , World ' ) " ) ; } }
Evaluating a Script File
In this example , we call the eval method that accepts java.io .
Reader for the input source .
The script read by the given reader is executed .
This way it is possible to execute scripts from files , URLs and resources by wrapping the relevant input stream objects as readers .
import javax.script .* ; public class EvalFile { public static void main ( String [ ] args ) throws Exception { // create a script engine manager ScriptEngineManager factory = new ScriptEngineManager ( ) ; // create JavaScript engine ScriptEngine engine = factory .
getEngineByName ( " JavaScript " ) ; // evaluate JavaScript code from given file - specified by first argument engine .
eval ( new java.io. FileReader ( args [ 0 ] ) ) ; } }
println ( " This is hello from test.js " ) ;
java EvalFile test.js
Script Variables
Let us assume that we have the file named " test.js " with the following text :
We can run the above Java as
When you embed script engines and scripts with your Java application , you may want to expose your application objects as global variables to scripts .
This example demonstrates how you can expose your application objects as global variables to a script .
We create a java.io .
File in the application and expose the same as a global variable with the name " file " .
The script can access the variable - for example , it can call public methods on it .
Note that the syntax to access Java objects , methods and fields is dependent on the scripting language .
JavaScript supports the most " natural " Java - like syntax .
public class ScriptVars { public static void main ( String [ ] args ) throws Exception { ScriptEngineManager manager = new ScriptEngineManager ( ) ; ScriptEngine engine = manager.getEngineByName( " JavaScript " ) ; File f = new File ( " test.txt " ) ; // expose File object as variable to script engine .
put ( " file " , f ) ; // evaluate a script string .
The script accesses " file " // variable and calls method on it engine.eval ( " print( file.getAbsolutePath ( ) ) " ) ; } }
Invoking Script Functions and Methods
Sometimes you may want to call a specific scripting function repeatedly - for example , your application menu functionality might be implemented by a script .
In your menu 's action event handler you may want to call a specific script function .
The following example demonstrates invoking a specific script function from Java code .
import javax.script .* ; public class InvokeScriptFunction { public static void main ( String [ ] args ) throws Exception { ScriptEngineManager manager = new ScriptEngineManager ( ) ; ScriptEngine engine = manager.getEngineByName( " JavaScript " ) ; // JavaScript code in a String String script = " function hell o( name ) { print ( ' Hello , ' + name ) ; } " ; // evaluate script engine.eval ( script ) ; // javax.script .
Invocable is an optional interface .
//
Check whether your script engine implements or not ! //
Note that the JavaScript engine implements Invocable interface .
Invocable inv = ( Invocable ) engine ; // invoke the global function named " hello " inv. invokeFunction ( " hello " , " Scripting ! ! " ) ; } }
If your scripting language is object based ( like JavaScript ) or object - oriented , then you can invoke a script method on a script object .
import javax.script .* ; public class InvokeScriptMethod { public static void main ( String [ ] args ) throws Exception { ScriptEngineManager manager = new ScriptEngineManager ( ) ; ScriptEngine engine = manager.getEngineByName( " JavaScript " ) ; // JavaScript code in a String .
This code defines a script object ' obj ' // with one method called ' hello ' .
String script = " var obj = new Object ( ) ; obj.hello = function ( name ) { print ( ' Hello , ' + name ) ; } " ; // evaluate script engine.eval ( script ) ; // javax.script .
Invocable is an optional interface .
//
Check whether your script engine implements or not ! //
Note that the JavaScript engine implements Invocable interface .
Invocable inv = ( Invocable ) engine ; // get script object on which we want to call the method Object obj = engine .
get ( " obj " ) ; // invoke the method named " hello " on the script object " obj " inv. invokeMethod ( obj , " hello " , " Script Method !! " ) ; } }
Implementing Java Interfaces by Scripts
Instead of calling specific script functions from Java , sometimes it is convenient to implement a Java interface by script functions or methods .
Also , by using interfaces we can avoid having to use the javax .
script API in many places .
We can get an interface implementor object and pass it to various Java APIs .
The following example demonstrates implementing the java.lang .
Runnable interface with a script .
import javax.script .* ; public class RunnableImpl { public static void main ( String [ ] args ) throws Exception { ScriptEngineManager manager = new ScriptEngineManager ( ) ; ScriptEngine engine = manager.getEngineByName( " JavaScript " ) ; // JavaScript code in a String String script = " function run ( ) { println ( ' run called ' ) ; } " ; // evaluate script engine.eval ( script ) ; Invocable inv = ( Invocable ) engine ; // get Runnable interface object from engine .
This interface methods // are implemented by script functions with the matching name .
Runnable r = inv. get Interface ( Runnable.class ) ; // start a new thread that runs the script implemented // runnable interface Thread th = new Thread ( r ) ; th.start ( ) ; } }
If your scripting language is object - based or object - oriented , it is possible to implement a Java interface by script methods on script objects .
This avoids having to call script global functions for interface methods .
The script object can store the " state " associated with the interface implementor .
import javax.script .* ; public class RunnableImplObject { public static void main ( String [ ] args ) throws Exception { ScriptEngineManager manager = new ScriptEngineManager ( ) ; ScriptEngine engine = manager.getEngineByName( " JavaScript " ) ; // JavaScript code in a String String script = " var obj = new Object ( ) ; obj.run = function ( ) { println ( ' run method called ' ) ; } " ; // evaluate script engine.eval ( script ) ; // get script object on which we want to implement the interface with Object obj = engine .
get ( " obj " ) ; Invocable inv = ( Invocable ) engine ; // get Runnable interface object from engine .
This interface methods // are implemented by script methods of object ' obj ' Runnable r = inv. get Interface ( obj , Runnable.class ) ; // start a new thread that runs the script implemented // runnable interface Thread th = new Thread ( r ) ; th.start ( ) ; } }
Multiple Scopes for Scripts
In the script variables example , we saw how to expose application objects as script global variables .
It is possible to expose multiple global " scopes " for scripts .
A single scope is an instance of javax . script .
Bindings .
This interface is derived from java.util .
Map < String , Object > .
A scope a set of name - value pairs where name is any non-empty , non-null String .
Multiple scopes are supported by javax .script .
ScriptContext interface .
A script context supports one or more scopes with associated Bindings for each scope .
By default , every script engine has a default script context .
The default script context has atleast one scope called " ENGINE_SCOPE " .
Various scopes supported by a script context are available through getScopes method .
import javax.script .* ; public class MultiScopes { public static void main ( String [ ] args ) throws Exception { ScriptEngineManager manager = new ScriptEngineManager ( ) ; ScriptEngine engine = manager.getEngineByName( " JavaScript " ) ; engine.put ( " x " , " hello " ) ; // print global variable " x " engine.eval ( " println ( x ) ; " ) ; // the above line prints " hello " // Now , pass a different script context ScriptContext newContext = new SimpleScriptContext ( ) ; Bindings engineScope = newContext .
getBindings ( ScriptContext.ENGINE_SCOPE ) ; // add new variable " x " to the new engineScope engineScope . put ( " x " , " world " ) ; // execute the same script - but this time pass a different script context engine.eval ( " println ( x ) ; " , newContext ) ; // the above line prints " world " } }
JavaScript Script Engine
Sun 's implementation of JDK 6 is co-bundled with the Mozilla Rhino based JavaScript script engine .
This is based on Mozilla Rhino version 1.6R2 .
Most of the Rhino implementation is included .
A few components have been excluded due to footprint and security reasons :
JavaScript - to - bytecode compilation ( also called " optimizer " ) .
This feature depends on a class generation library .
The removal of this feature means that JavaScript will always be interpreted .
The removal of this feature does not affect script execution because the optimizer is transparent .
Rhino's JavaAdapter has been removed .
JavaAdapter is the feature by which a Java class can be extended by JavaScript and Java interfaces may be implemented by JavaScript .
This feature also requires a class generation library .
We have replaced Rhino 's JavaAdapter with Sun 's implementation of the JavaAdapter .
In Sun implementation , only a single Java interface may be implemented by a JavaScript object .
For example , the following works as expected .
var v = new java.lang .
Runnable ( ) { run : function ( ) { print ( ' hello ' ) ; } } v.run ( ) ;
In most cases , JavaAdapter is used to implement aa single interface with Java anonymizer class - like syntax .
The uses of JavaAdapter to extend a Java class or to implement multiple interfaces are very rare .
E4X ( ECMAScript for XML - ECMA Standard 357 ) has been excluded .
Use of an XML literal in JavaScript code will result in a syntax error .
Note that E4X support is optional in the ECMAScript standard - a implementation can omit E4X support and still be a compliant ECMAScript implementation .
The Rhino command line tools ( Rhino shell , debugger etc. ) are not included .
But , you can use jrunscript instead .
JavaScript to Java Communication
For the most part , accessing Java classes , objects and methods is straightforward .
In particular field and method access from JavaScript is the same as it is from Java .
We highlight important aspects of JavaScript Java access here .
For more details , please refer to http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/scriptjava.html.
The following examples are JavaScript snippets accessing Java .
This section requires knowledge of JavaScript .
This section can be skipped if you are planning to use some other JSR - 223 scripting language rather than JavaScript .
Importing Java Packages , Classes
The built - in functions importPackage and importClass can be used to import Java packages and classes .
// Import Java packages and classes // like import package .* ; in Java importPackage ( java.awt ) ; // like import java .
awt .
Frame in Java importClass ( java.awt.Frame ) ; // Create Java Objects by " new ClassName " var frame = new java .
awt .
Frame ( " hello " ) ; // Call Java public methods from script frame.setVisible( true ) ; // Access " JavaBean " properties like " fields " print ( frame.title ) ;
The Packages global variable can be used to access Java packages .
Examples : Packages.java.util.Vector , Packages.javax.swing .JFrame .
Please note that " java " is a shortcut for " Packages . java " .
There are equivalent shortcuts for javax , org , edu , com , net prefixes , so pratically all JDK platform classes can be accessed without the " Packages " prefix .
Note that java.lang is not imported by default ( unlike Java ) because that would result in conflicts with JavaScript 's built - in Object , Boolean , Math and so on .
importPackage and importClass functions " pollute " the global variable scope of JavaScript .
To avoid that , you may use JavaImporter .
// create JavaImporter with specific packages and classes to import var SwingGui = new JavaImporter ( javax.swing , javax.swing.event , javax.swing.border , java.awt.event ) ; with ( SwingGui ) { // within this ' with ' statement , we can access Swing and AWT // classes by unqualified ( simple ) names .
var mybutton = new JButton ( " test " ) ; var myframe = new JFrame ( " test " ) ; }
Creating and Using Java Arrays
While creating a Java object is the same as in Java , to create Java arrays in JavaScript we need to use Java reflection explicitly .
But once created the element access or length access is the same as in Java .
Also , a script array can be used when a Java method expects a Java array ( auto conversion ) .
So in most cases we do n't have to create Java arrays explicitly .
// create Java String array of 5 elements var a = java.lang.reflect.Array.newInstance(java.lang.String , 5 ) ; // Accessing elements and length access is by usual Java syntax a [ 0 ] = " scripting is great ! " ; print ( a.length ) ;
Implementing Java Interfaces
A Java interface can be implemented in JavaScript by using a Java anonymous class - like syntax :
var r = new java.lang .
Runnable ( ) { run : function ( ) { print ( " running ...
" ) ; } } ; // " r " can be passed to Java methods that expect java.lang .
Runnable var th = new java.lang .
Thread ( r ) ; th.start ( ) ;
When an interface with a single method is expected , you can pass a script function directly .( auto conversion )
function func ( ) { print ( " I am func ! " ) ; } // pass script function for java.lang .
Runnable argument var th = new java.lang .
Thread ( func ) ; th.start ( ) ;
Overload Resolution
Java methods can be overloaded by argument types .
In Java , overload resolution occurs at compile time ( performed by javac ) .
When calling Java methods from a script , the script interpreter / compiler needs to select the appropriate method .
With the JavaScript engine , you do not need to do anything special - the correct Java method overload variant is selected based on the argument types .
But , sometimes you may want ( or have ) to explicitly select a particular overload variant .
var out = java.lang.System.out ; // select a particular println function out [ " println ( java.lang .
Object ) " ] ( " hello " ) ;
More details on JavaScript's Java method overload resolution is at http://www.mozilla.org/js/liveconnect/lc3_method_overloading.html
Implementing Your Own Script Engine
We will not cover implementation of JSR - 223 compliant script engines in detail .
Minimally , you need to implement the javax .
script .
ScriptEngine and javax.script.ScriptEngineFactory interfaces .
The abstract class javax .script .
AbstractScriptEngine provides useful defaults for a few methods of the ScriptEngine interface .
Before starting to implement a JSR - 223 engine , you may want to check http://scripting.dev.java.net project .
This project maintains JSR - 223 implementations for many popular open source scripting languages .

Please note that in the article that follows , I am not claiming that the U.S. Government knew Mutallab had a bomb or intended to hurt anyone on Flight 253 when the U.S. Government let him board .
Umar Farouk Abulutallab .
Since our flight landed on Christmas Day , Lori and I have been doing everything in our power to uncover the truth about why we were almost blown up in the air over Detroit .
The truth is now finally out after the publication of the following Detroit News article :
http://detnews.com/article/20100127/NATION/1270405/Terror-suspect-kept-visa-to-avoid-tipping-off-larger-investigation
Let me quote from the article :
“ Patrick F. Kennedy , an undersecretary for management at the State Department , said Abdulmutallab ’s visa was n’t taken away because intelligence officials asked his agency not to deny a visa to the suspected terrorist over concerns that a denial would ’ve foiled a larger investigation into al - Qaida threats against the United States .
“ Revocation action would ’ve disclosed what they were doing , ” Kennedy said in testimony before the House Committee on Homeland Security .
Allowing Adbulmutallab to keep the visa increased chances federal investigators would be able to get closer to apprehending the terror network he is accused of working with , “ rather than simply knocking out one solider in that effort . ” ‘
Now it all becomes apparent .
Let me detail everything we know about the “ Sharp Dressed Man ” ( SDM ) .
1 . While being held in Customs on Christmas Day , I first told the story of the SDM .
2 . My story has never changed .
3 . The FBI visited my office on December 29 , 2009 , and showed me a series of approximately 10 photographs .
None were of the SDM .
I asked the FBI if they brought the Amsterdam security video to help me identify the SDM , but they acted as though my request was ridiculous .
The FBI asked me what accent the SDM spoke in and I indicated that he had an American accent similar to my own .
I further indicated that he wore a tan suit without a tie , was Indian looking , around age 50 , 6 ’ 0 ″ tall and 250 - 260 lbs .
I further indicated that I did not believe that he was an airline employee and that he was not on our flight .
[ efoods ] 4 .
During the first week of January , 2010 , Dutch Military Police and the FBI indicated that over “ 200 Hours ” of Amsterdam airport security video had been reviewed and it “ Shows Nothing ” .
5 . The mainstream media picked up the “ Shows nothing ” story , which slanders my story .
After visiting my office twice for a flight 253 special , Dateline NBC and Chris Hanson indicated that my story was “ Unsubstantiated rumor dispelled as myth ” and our story did not air during the tv special .
6 . On January 2 , 2010 , I receive a call from a flight 253 passenger who indicated to me that it may be in my best interest to stop talking publicly about the SDM because he believes I am “ wrong ” in what I saw .
He did not make any claim that he saw the SDM boarding gate incident at all .
This call was made out of the blue after he made a “ revelation ” of this event on January 1 , 2010 .
I later discover that this caller has ties to the U.S. Government .
7. On January 20 , 2009 , current Director of the National Counterterrorism Center ( NCTC ) , Michael E. Leiter , made a startling admission .
Leiter indicated that : “ I will tell you , that when people come to the country and they are on the watch list , it is because we have generally made the choice that we want them here in the country for some reason or another . ”
8 . On January 22 , 2010 , CongressDaily reported that intelligence officials “ have acknowledged the government knowingly allows foreigners whose names are on terrorist watch lists to enter the country in order to track their movement and activities . ”
CongressDaily also reported , citing an unnamed “ intelligence official ” that Michael E. Leiter ’s statement on January 20 , 2010 , reflected government policy and told the publication , “ in certain situations it ’s to our advantage to be able to track individuals who might be on a terrorist watch list because you can learn something from their activities and their contacts . ”
9 . On Janury 22 , 2009 , ABC News published an article that shoed a change of position in the government ’s official story .
Please see the following blog post for more information :
http://haskellfamily.blogspot.com/2010/01/initially-discounted.html
The U.S. government provided no explanation for the reason my story was initially discounted .
10 . The SDM could not be from Al Qaeda .
When speaking at the counter in Amsterdam , the SDM said the following “ He is from Sudan , we do this all the time ” .
Who is “ we ” ?
If it is Al Qaeda , you surely do n’t make such a statement to an airposrt security official .
11 . The SDM could not be from airport security .
The SDM did not dress in any secuirty uniform and did not appear to have any security badge .
The SDM did not speak with a Dutch accent .
The SDM dressed in a suit coat and pants .
If the SDM was a higher up security official , he would not have to convince the ticket agent to let Mutallab on the plane without a valid passport .
Instead , he would just order her to do it .
12 . Could the SDM have been a U.S. Government official ?
He dressed in a suit and not a security uniform .
Check .
He indicated we do this all the time .
Could “ we ” be the U.S. Government ?
Check .
He spoke Enlish with an American accent .
Check .
Would he need to convice the ticket agent that this was a normal procedure to allow boarding without a passport ?
Check .
Would he have the ability to obtain such clearance ?
Check .
Could he enter this security area even though he was n’t a passenger ?
Check .
Would the ticket agent likely refer this request to a manager ?
Check .
Would the U.S. Government not want this information public and try to hide it ?
Check .
13 . The Amsterdam security video has not been released .
A much more minor airport security violation occurred at the Newark New Jersay airport several days after the flight 253 incident .
That video was released shortly thereafter .
14 . Senators Levin and Stabenow , as well as Congressman Dingle , all refuse to discuss the matter with me .
With the information we already knew and the admission from the above referenced Detroit News article , we have evidence and claims made by government officials that the U.S. Government wanted Mutallab to proceed into the U.S. in order to obtain information on other terrorists involved with him .
Once we take this statement and add it to my eyewitness account of a “ Sharp Dressed Man ” escorting Mutallab through the boarding process and allowing him to baord without a valid passport we can make the connection that the “ Sharp Dressed Man ” was a U.S. Government offical / agent .
The reasoning behind the following events now becomes very clear :
1 . The reason Mutallab got through security despite the numerous warnings for months before our flight .
2 . The reason why there have been so many lies from the U.S. Governemnt attempting to discredit my eyewitness account .
3 . The reason why the Amsterdam airport security video is being hidden from the public .
4 . The reason why the government is proposing a “ Failed to Connect the Dots ” account of the failure .
The truth is too damning .
5 . The reason why Mr. Wolf of the Obama administration indicated on the Keith Olberman Show that the White House was investigating a possible “ intentional act ” from within the U.S. Government as the reason for the Christmas Day attack .
6 . The explanation for the cameraman and why he has n’t been identified ( Obviously , he was another U.S. Government agent ) whose job was to film Mutallab for some governmental purpose .
7 . The reason for the lax security after landing , which can be attributed to foreknowledge of the possible suspects involved .
8 . The reason for the failure to search or secure the plane and passengers after landing , which can also be attributed to foreknowledge of the possible suspects involved .
9 . The corporate media ’s attempt to bury my eyewitness account .
10 . Carl Levin’s , Debbie Stabenow ’s and John Dingle ’s intentional avoidance of my story and failure to return my calls / emails .
11 . Janet Naploitano ’s statement that “ The System Worked ” .
From her point of view it probably did as this WAS PART OF THE SYSTEM !

I was hoping -- when I saw her in the video below -- that Michele Bachmann ( R - MN ) was finally going to confess she had gotten drunk at a congressional St. Patrick 's Day party a couple years ago , puked in the lady 's room and then snuck out without cleaning up , only to then cower in fear that her crazy colleague from southern Ohio , Mean Jean Schmidt , had slipped in the vomit and ruined her dress .
But no , it was just about persuading God to help Republicans keep people from getting healthcare .
I spent nearly the whole day yesterday , starting at 8:30 AM , in the Vatican .
It was wonderfully uplifting .
I 've been there several times before , but never with an art historian nor with any kind of a guide .
This time my docent , Sarah , took me through the vast art collection -- or at least a part of it ; it would take weeks to see it all -- and helped me understand that most of the popes had more to do with commissioning and collecting art -- and in the Baroque Period , primarily as propaganda -- than they did with anything remotely spiritual or even " religious . "
Glorifying their noble families ' names -- it was n't until 1978 , with the election of John Paul I as the 263rd pope , that a man not of aristocratic family ascended to the papacy ; he was murdered after 33 days -- was the name of the game for many ; temporal power was what it was about for even more .
Sarah went to Catholic school when she was a girl , which , I assume is where she lost her religion and became , I 'm guessing , an atheist .
She was happy to repeat all the phony baloney Vatican propaganda as we traipsed through the museums , the Sistene Chapel and St. Peter 's Basilica , assuring me , when I pressed her , that none of it was remotely true .
But the art was so inspiring and ... divine .
Look at that wonderful Pietà by the then 23 year old unknown Michelangelo above !
It 's breathtaking .

Somehow I doubt many people look at this sublime work , or the authorized copies , and think about how healthcare for American families must be derailed by God 's intervention .
But then I 've never met deranged religious fanatics like Jim DeMint ( an admitted member of the DC - based religio - fascist cult called The Family ) , Sam Brownback and Michele Bachmann .
The Founding Fathers had , though , which is why they took such pains to erect a wall between Church and State , a wall these fanatics are determined to tear down .
They very much want religion -- particularly their inauthentic religion to have a hand , to put it mildly , in public policy so it can be used the way authoritarians have used religious hocus pocus since the beginning of history .
Sometimes we lose track of how much less bad Democrats like Obama , and even Rahm Emanuel are than Republicans .
Now , please , watch Rachel Maddow put this all in context while I go tour the fabulous Colosseum , a place where a wall between church and state was never contemplated .
Sarah did n't bother to walk over herself but she encouraged me to take a peek at the glassed - in open casket of Pope John XXIII who died in 1963 .
Popes are usually buried downstairs but this one is supposed to be an example of incorruptibility so he 's hanging out upstairs where he 's hard to miss ( under the wax that encloses his body ) .
It 's macabre .
Yogandanda , who 's at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Glendale , California , was certified incorruptible before he was embalmed in 1952 .
Anyway , the current head of the Church announced today that he 's movin ' twopopes , John Paul II and Pius XII -- but not John XXIII -- along the road to sainthood .
Like the current head of Catholics , Inc. , the non-incorruptible Pius XII , was a detestable Nazi stooge .
By pairing the loathed Nazi pope with the loved JP II , Benedict probably hoped there would n't be as much of a stink .
Next stop for these two is beatification .
And ... the healthcare reform bill , now mutated into an unrecognizable form as one conservative lackey after another threw a tantrum and was placated , looks like it has the requisite 60 votes to overcome the GOP filibuster .
Nelson feels the ability for backward , racist states to opt out of abortion coverage for poor women is good enough for him .

Garry Wills is a formidable Pulitzer Prize - winning historian , one of America ’s leading public intellectuals and , over the last 50 years , our most important lay Catholic thinker and writer .
In his 28th book , “ Bomb Power : The Modern Presidency and the National Security State , ” he amplifies an idea he first raised a decade ago in “ A Necessary Evil : A History of American Distrust of Government ” -- that the dawn of the Atomic Age fundamentally changed our institutions of republican government .
Wills himself best condensed his thesis recently in the New York Review of Books :
“ George W. Bush left the White House unpopular and disgraced .
His successor promised change . . . [ but ] the momentum of accumulating powers in the executive is not easily reversed , checked , or even slowed .
. . .
The monopoly on use of nuclear weaponry , the cult of the commander in chief , the worldwide network of military bases to maintain nuclear alert and supremacy , the secret intelligence agencies , the entire National Security State , the classification and clearance systems , the expansion of state secrets , the withholding of evidence and information , the permanent emergency that has melded World War II with the Cold War and the Cold War with the ‘ war on terror ’ -- all these make a vast and intricate structure that may not yield to effort at dismantling it .
Sixty - eight straight years of war emergency powers ( 1941 -2009 ) have made the abnormal normal , and constitutional diminishment the settled order . ”
“ Bomb Power , ” in other words , is an ambitious work , and while Wills is incapable of being anything but provocative and erudite , his book is thought - provoking but not entirely persuasive .
As a one - time Jesuit seminarian , Wills , now 75 , is a reflexive Thomist :
That has made him very discerning of first causes and alive to the deeper meanings of texts , like the Constitution .
It ’s not an outlook , though , that copes well with the reality of historical contingency -- and that is where this book is least satisfying .
We did not build the bomb on a strategic whim :
We built it because some of the world ’s best physicists , including the instinctual pacifist Albert Einstein , told Franklin D. Roosevelt that if we did n’t , the Nazis would .
The Manhattan Project with all its attendant secrecy was a consequence of that reality .
And yet , Wills argues , “ only Congress can raise money .
It can not give to another branch what the Constitution limits to it .
Executive actions that raise money apart from Congress , that hide the money raised from Congress , that fail to report all expended moneys to Congress , are all violations of the Constitution .
The Manhattan Project was therefore a violation of the Constitution -- a thing perhaps understandable , or forgivable , as a onetime emergency measure in war .
But as a standing policy . . . this creates a steady erosion of the constitutional system .
The National Security State is in permanent constitutional crisis . ”
Or perhaps it ’s in a permanent state of tension -- between its republican ideals and the demands of a modern technological world .
Wills is skeptical , for example , about the creation of the Central Intelligence Agency and quotes President Harry S. Truman ’s anxiety over creating a “ Gestapo . ”
That ’s all fine , but America ’s lack of an active intelligence arm left it unprepared for World War II , and the reason why the CIA became the agency it did was largely because of the Soviet KGB , whose activities , we now know , were more extensive and effective than anyone realized at the time .
Wills similarly takes a jaundiced view of the Marshall Plan as an extension of U.S. power into Western Europe rather than merely an altruistic program of reconstruction .
The alternative , though , would have been to allow communist parties to take power in Greece , Italy and , perhaps , France -- parties that essentially were wholly owned subsidiaries of Moscow .
Wills is on much firmer ground when he decries the national security state ’s impact on open government .
“ Bomb power translates directly to information power , ” he writes .
“ Secrecy emanated from the Manhattan Project like a giant radiation emission .
Anything connected with the Bomb . . . was , as Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan said , ‘ born secret . ’
It was self - classifying .
. . .
And the power of secrecy that enveloped the Bomb became a model for the planning or execution of Anything Important , as guarded by Important People .
Because the government was the keeper of the great secret , it began to specialize in secret keeping .
. . . ”
It was Moynihan , in fact , who first pointed out that the government ’s classification of information , which should have decreased after the Cold War , actually grew by 62 % after the Soviet Union ’s implosion .
“ Accountability is the essence of democracy , ” Wills writes .
“ If people do not know what their government is doing , they can not be truly self - governing .
But the National Security State assumes that the government ’s secrets are too important to be shared . . . that only the President has all the facts , that we must simply trust that our rulers are acting in our interest . ”
There ’s a particularly interesting section on Dwight D. Eisenhower who , Wills argues , never would have given an OK to the Bay of Pigs invasion , though it was planned during his administration .
Unlike John F. Kennedy , Eisenhower insisted that a functioning Cuban government in exile be in place before any covert military action .
The author approvingly quotes Murray Kempton ’s appraisal of Ike ’s guiding rule : “ Do nothing unless you know exactly what you will do if it turns out to have been the wrong thing . ”
On the other hand , Wills takes Eisenhower to task for using the CIA to overthrow antagonistic governments in Iran and elsewhere and make unsuccessful attempts at regime change in Syria and Indonesia .
Perhaps this was a manifestation of what Wills calls Ike ’s “ ruthlessness ” or perhaps it was the wisdom of a one - time supreme commander of Western forces who believed covert operations were preferable to all - out conflict with a Soviet antagonist .
The author sums up his argument thus : “ Perhaps , in the nuclear era , the Constitution has become quaint and obsolete .
Few people even consider , anymore , Madison ’s lapidary pronouncement , ‘ in republican government the legislative authority necessarily , predominates .’ . . .
Nevertheless , some of us entertain a fondness for the quaint old Constitution .
It may be too late to return to its ideals , but the effort should be made .
As Cyrano said , ‘ One fights not only in the hope of winning . ’ ”
Though Wills ’ progress to that conclusion is n’t always as steady as one might wish , it remains a compelling one .

If you loved reading about Jane Austin ’s classic characters from “ Pride and Prejudice ” fending off brain - eating zombies , we have some good news for you .
The best - selling novel “ Pride and Prejudice and Zombies ” has been optioned to become a six - part television mini-series .
The announcement came via the novel ’s Twitter stream yesterday .
No word yet on when production will begin or when we will see the series hit tv screens .
You ’ve probably heard that the Fed has proposed a new program that will act like CDs for bank reserves .
The plan is to have the Fed issue the term deposits to banks , with maturities up to one year .
The hope is that these Fed CDs will encourage banks to park reserves at the Fed rather than lending them out , keeping the huge amounts of money locked up as excess reserves from entering the economy through loans and triggering inflation .
Give them credit for bold action .
Nothing like this has ever been tried before .
If it worked , it would take the Fed ’s control of bank lending to an entirely new level .
By raising and lowering the rates on the CDs , the Fed could potentially micro-manage bank lending behavior to an extent unimaginable before our crisis .
It ’s far from clear that the plan will work in the way the Fed hopes .
In the first place , the CD program is likely to be too small to matter .
The Fed is worried about over a trillion in excess reserves that it has built up inside of banks to keep the financial system afloat .
It seems likely that the CD program wo n’t be anywhere near large enough to handle this .
The plan could also run into trouble with politicians .
There is still a lot of criticism of the banks for not lending enough .
The entire point of this program is to keep money out of the lending stream .
As long as unemployment and small business bankruptcies are rising , fighting inflation by intentionally reducing bank lending will be a political lightning rod .
Indeed , the direct nature of this program seems likely to make it far more controversial than traditional Fed inflation fighting measures .
The program is also unlikely to be popular with banks .
It ’s not clear yet whether the CDs will be tradeable and , if they were , whether an effective secondary market would develop .
“ Without a secondary market , buyers of these instruments face huge reinvestment risk , ” James Bianco explained in a recent note .
“ The future course of short term interest rates is arguably to the most uncertain it has been in decades .
Will the Federal Reserve stay near zero until 2012 or will they be forced to raise rates in the first half of 2010 ?
Given all this uncertainty , who wants to lock up money in something that cannot be sold before maturity ? ”
It seems likely that the Fed would have to compensate banks heavily for this lock - up , which means it will be very costly for the Fed .
Worse , the interest paid on the CDs will actually be adding more money into the system — creating even more built - up inflationary pressure .
The plan might kick the inflation can down the road but it will be rattling louder than ever .
But if the CDs are n’t likely to work , what ’s really going on with the latest zany Fed scheme ?
The key issue is one we discussed on December 21st — the inflation bomb hiding on the Fed ’s balance sheet in the form of mortgage backed securities .
In 2008 , the Fed did something it had never done before — buying mortgage backed securities off the market .
It now has over $ 1 trillion of mortgage securities on its balance sheet .
This created a giant policy and financial risk for the Fed .
The Fed ’s purchases of mortgage securities increased the monetary base , creating a huge inflationary danger .
If the Fed were to the Fed to start sucking back these funds , it will have to sell these into the market .
Unlike the repo and lending programs , however , the Fed cannot simply order the banks to repurchase the mortgage backed securities .
It has to sell them at market prices .
The market ’s knowledge that the Fed has become a seller rather than a buyer for mortgage backed securities will likely result in the pricing of these securities falling .
In order to bring the yield of these securities up to a level acceptable to the market , they will have to be sold at a discount .
This discounting means that the Fed will not be able to withdraw as much liquidity as it added , leaving some portion of that $ 1 trillion ( plus its multiplier effect ) in the economy to create inflation .
Think of it this way .
If the Fed bought a mortgage backed security for $ 100 but can only sell it for $ 90 , there ’s a 10 % inflationary discount occurring .
It ’s leaving in the economy a portion of the excess liquidity equal to the discounted price of the mortgage backed security .
Which is to say , the Fed ’s MBS has inflation built right into it .
The Fed is also concerned about the effects on the housing market and mortgage rates of any attempt to sell its mortgage portfolio .
Fear of an additional $ 1 trillion of mortgage securities coming on to market could easily destroy any appetite for new issues , which would discourage mortgage lending and could snuff out a potential housing recovery .
The Fed also wants to communicate the idea that it is prepared to fight inflation without raising its target rates .
The idea is to quell fears of future rate hikes that could spark a premature market pullback and avoid a contractionary rate hike while the economy is still in shambles .
With all the evident defects in the Fed ’s plan , however , it ’s not clear that it can accomplish any of these goals .
It can not sop up excess reserves because it is too small .
It may actually add to the inflation problem , while merely delaying the inevitable .
It wo n’t dampen concern about a Fed - selling induced mortgage backed security glut or coming rate hikes because it lacks credibility as an inflation fighting vehicle .
In short , it ’s all foam and no beer .
“ With each passing day it looks like the Federal Reserve is adopting AIG Financial Product ’s business practices , ” Bianco wrote in his note .
“ That is , when faced with a financial problem , they create complicated tools ( like CDS ) .
When critics says these new products will not work , tell them they do not know what they are talking about and create even more complicated tools to dazzle everyone . ”
A delayed Y2 K bug has bitten hard at some 30 million holders of German debit and credit cards , making it impossible for them to use automatic teller machines and point - of - sale terminals since New Year 's Day .
Multiple news agencies said the outage stemmed from card chips that could n't recognize the year 2010 .
The DSGV , an association representing German banks , said engineers were working diligently to fix the problem , but a full resolution might not come until Monday .
The outage affected 20 million EC , or electronic cash , cards , which act as debit cards , and 3.5 million credit cards , according to the DSGV .
A separate bank association known as BDB said about 2.5 million of its cards suffered from the same problem and another 4 million cards issued by Germany 's cooperative banks were at least partially touched .
The reports are the latest to involve the inability of computers to properly handle the 2010 date .
Just after midnight on New Year 's Day , Symantec 's Endpoint Protection Manager stopped accepting updates after it was hit by its own 2010 date bug .
Soon after the first of the year , SpamAssassin began blocking huge amounts of legitimate email because they included the 2010 in their headers , a date so far off the spam filter assumed they had to be junk .
Kaspersky software also experienced massive update problems on December 30 , according to support forums , but it 's not clear the new year had anything to do with them .
The German payment card snafu hit a variety of banks , although customers of Deutsche Bank reportedly were not affected .

CAPE CORAL , FLA . —
After an improbable rise from the Bronx projects to a job selling Gulf Coast homes , Isabel Bermudez lost it all to an epic housing bust — the six - figure income , the house with the pool and the investment property .
Now , as she papers the county with résumés and girds herself for rejection , she is supporting two daughters on an income that inspires a double take : zero dollars in monthly cash and a few hundred dollars in food stamps .
With food - stamp use at a record high and surging by the day , Bermudez belongs to an overlooked subgroup that is growing especially fast : recipients with no cash income .
About 6 million Americans receiving food stamps report they have no other income , according to an analysis of state data collected by The New York Times .
In declarations that states verify and the federal government audits , they described themselves as unemployed and receiving no cash aid — no welfare no unemployment insurance , and no pensions , child support or disability pay .
Numbers are soaring
Their numbers were rising before the recession as tougher welfare laws made it harder for poor people to get cash aid , but they have soared by about 50 percent over the past two years .
About one in 50 Americans now lives in a household with a reported income that consists of nothing but a food - stamp card .
“ It 's the one thing I can count on every month — I know the children are going to have food , ” Bermudez , 42 , said with the forced good cheer she mastered selling rows of new stucco homes .
Members of this group range from displaced strivers such as Bermudez to weathered men who sleep in shelters and barter cigarettes .
Some draw on savings or sporadic under - the - table jobs .
Some move in with relatives .
Some get noncash help , such as subsidized apartments .
While some go without cash incomes only briefly before securing jobs or aid , others rely on food stamps alone for many months .
Trend unnoticed
The surge in this precarious way of life has been so swift that few policymakers have noticed .
But it attests to the growing role of food stamps within the safety net .
One in eight Americans now receives food stamps , including one in four children .
Here in Florida , the number of people with no income beyond food stamps has doubled in two years and has more than tripled along once - thriving parts of the southwest coast .
The building frenzy that lured Bermudez to Fort Myers and neighboring Cape Coral has left a wasteland of foreclosed homes and written new chapters in star - crossed indigence .
A skinny fellow in saggy clothes who spent his childhood in foster care , Rex Britton , 22 , hopped a bus from Syracuse two years ago for a job painting parking lots .
Now , with unemployment at nearly 14 percent and paving work scarce , he receives $ 200 a month in food stamps and stays with a girlfriend who survives on a rent subsidy and a government check to help her care for her disabled toddler .
“ Without food stamps we 'd probably be starving , ” Britton said .
A strapping man who once made a living throwing fastballs , William Trapani , 53 , left his dreams on the minor league mound and his front teeth in prison , where he spent nine years for selling cocaine .
Now he sleeps at a rescue mission , repairs bicycles for small change , and counts $ 200 in food stamps as his only secure support .
“ I 've been out looking for work every day — there 's absolutely nothing , ” he said .
‘ Climbing the walls '
A grandmother whose voice mail message urges callers to “ have a blessed good day , ” Wanda Debnam , 53 , once drove 18 - wheelers and dreamed of selling real estate .
But she lost her job at Starbucks this year and moved in with her son in nearby Lehigh Acres .
Now she sleeps with her 8 - year - old granddaughter under a poster of the Jonas Brothers and uses her food stamps to avoid her daughter - in - law 's cooking .
“ I 'm climbing the walls , ” Debnam said .
Florida officials have done a better job than most in monitoring the rise of people with no cash income .
They say the access to food stamps shows the safety net is working .
The Times collected income data on food - stamp recipients in 31 states , which account for about 60 percent of the national caseload .
On average , 18 percent listed cash income of zero in their most recent monthly filings .
Projected over the entire caseload , that suggests 6 million people in households with no income .
About 1.2 million are children .
The numbers have nearly tripled in Nevada over the past two years , doubled in Florida and New York , and grown nearly 90 percent in Minnesota and Utah .
In Wayne County , Mich. , which includes Detroit , one of every 25 residents reports an income of only food stamps .
In Yakima County , Wash. , the figure is about one of every 17 .
Experts caution that these numbers are estimates .
Still , there is little doubt that millions of people are relying on incomes of food stamps alone , and their numbers are rapidly growing .
With their condition mostly overlooked , there is little data on how long these households go without cash incomes or what other resources they have .
But they appear an eclectic lot .
Florida data shows the population about evenly split between families with children and households with just adults , with the latter group growing fastest during the recession .
They are racially mixed , as well — about 42 percent white , 32 percent black , and 22 percent Hispanic .
The expansion of the food - stamp program , which will spend more than $ 60 billion this year , has so far enjoyed bipartisan support .
But it does have conservative critics who worry about the costs and the rise in dependency .
“ This is craziness , ” said Rep. John Linder , a Georgia Republican who is the ranking minority member of a House panel on welfare policy .
“ We 're at risk of creating an entire class of people , a subset of people , just comfortable getting by living off the government . ”
A founder of the Tea Party movement said Wednesday he had a warning for Republican leaders : Back conservative candidates or else other states will suffer the same backlash that toppled Florida ’s Republican Party chairman this week .
“ We are turning our guns on anyone who does n’t support constitutional conservative candidates , ” said Dale Robertson , who operates TeaParty.org out of Houston and helped start the movement nearly two years ago .
He declined to say which states are next on the Tea Party ’s hit list .
He said party leaders in those states would be warned privately , but the movement ’s wrath “ will be very clear publicly ” if they do n’t listen .
“ If they continue to do things like they did in Florida , it ’s not going to be good for them , ” Mr. Robertson said .
“ If they do n’t get that and their party chairmen do n’t get that , they are going to be ostracized . ”
In Florida , a struggle between conservative activists and the Republican Party establishment forced state GOP Chairman Jim Greer to quit Tuesday .
He blamed his decision on activists who he said “ turned their guns on fellow Republicans instead of focusing our efforts on defeating Democrats . ”
Mr. Greer had been under fire for backing Gov. Charlie Crist , considered a moderate in the party who last year praised President Obama ’s $ 787 billion stimulus plan , in the race for the Republican nomination for Senate over former state House Speaker Marco Rubio , who is supported by the Tea Party movement .
The chairman ’s resignation headed off a party meeting Saturday where he expected to face fierce opposition from conservative activists .
Mr. Robertson planned to deliver the warning in a phone call Wednesday to National Republican Committee Chairman Michael S. Steele , who a day earlier said he supported the Tea Party activists and that he did n’t think their movement had caused a schism in the Republican Party .
Democrats say the tension between the Tea Party and mainstream Republicans is a “ civil war ” that will undermine Republicans ’ hopes for significant gains in the mid-term elections in November .

Baby Giraffe Born at Binder Park Zoo !
Battle Creek , MI August 19 , 2009 – Binder Park Zoo is ecstatic to announce not one , but two reticulated giraffe births !
The bouncing baby boys were born within 48 hours of each other , the first on Tuesday , August 11th at 9:38 a.m. to mother Jasiri , age 14 years , and the second on Wednesday , August 12th at 5:48 p.m. to mother Cece , age 12 .
Both calves were fathered by Gene , who is 12 years old .
These births are the first giraffe births at Binder Park Zoo and the first in Michigan in over 16 years !
“ For 13 years we have hopefully looked forward to having baby giraffe , ” remarks Greg Geise , Binder Park Zoo President and CEO .
“ Now all of a sudden we ’ve realized our dream two times over and we are delighted ! ”
Baby number one weighed 137 lbs at birth and stood 6 feet tall .
He was standing and nursing within an hour of his birth .
All signs are pointing to the calf being healthy and Jasiri is doing well as a first time mother .
“ It ’s great to see Jasiri taking excellent care of her new baby , ” says Andi Kornak , Curator of Collections .
“ She ’s a great first time mom . ”
Baby number two weighed 116 lbs at birth and stood a bit shorter than his half brother at 5 feet 6 inches .
“ Cece was not displaying signs of proper care of the baby , and a decision was made to hand raise the calf , ” says Kornak .
“ It is not uncommon for giraffes to be hand raised in zoos . ”
These are the first giraffe births at Binder Park Zoo and a perfect way to celebrate the tenth anniversary of Wild Africa , the Zoo ’s award winning African exhibit .
“ Hand feeding our giraffes is one of the opportunities that make this place special , ” says Stacey Lawson , Chief Operating Officer .
“ Having newcomers to the giraffe herd is going to offer yet another spectacular experience for families to enjoy at Binder Park Zoo . ”
A timetable for the youngsters to appear on exhibit has not been set , but starting Friday , August 21 , guests will be able to see a video of the birth and footage from their young lives at a special exhibit in Wild Africa courtesy of Best Buy .
“ Before they go out on exhibit , we need to introduce them to the rest of the giraffe herd and then acclimate them to the exhibit , ” says Jenny Barnett , Director of Wildlife .
“ The safety of our animals comes first , though we want to get them out on savannah to share with our guests as soon as possible . ”
The gestation period for giraffes is 14 to 15 months and calves can be up to 6 feet tall at birth .
Giraffe babies start off their lives with a 6 - foot drop into the world , as their mothers give birth standing up .
These brand new additions increase the size of Binder Park Zoo ’s reticulated giraffe herd to nine , which is one of the largest herds in the Midwest and the largest herd in Michigan .
Currently there are 5 females and 4 males residing at Binder Park Zoo .
For more information about Binder Park Zoo and the new giraffe go to www.binderparkzoo.org.

SACRAMENTO — California lawmakers took a first step toward legalizing marijuana when an Assembly committee approved legislation that would put the drug on the open market as a regulated and taxed product .
But it may have been more of a symbolic victory in a battle that will likely be next waged on the ballot .
Assemblyman Tom Ammiano , D - San Francisco , is considering either reintroducing the bill later this month , or waiting to see how a ballot measure to legalize marijuana fares in November .
He was unable to move his bill , Assembly Bill 390 , to the Health Committee , where it had to be heard before reaching the Assembly floor , in time to meet a Friday deadline for all 2009 - introduced bills .
It is the first time in U.S. history that a bill that would legalize marijuana has passed a legislative committee , Ammiano said .
“ This is a significant vote because it legitimizes the quest for debate , legitimizes the quest for discussion , ” Ammiano said .
“ This is far from over .
Not only did we get it out of ( the ) public safety ( committee ) , but members are now willing to say , yes , this is worthy of discussion . ”
Advocates hailed the narrow passage of the bill — it was approved by the Assembly Public Safety Committee on a 4 - 3 vote — as a major breakthrough that will lead to a national legalization movement .
Bay Area lawmakers were instrumental in getting the bill out of committee : Voting for it were Ammiano , Assemblywoman Nancy Skinner , D- Berkeley ; and Assemblymen Jared Huffman , D - San Rafael , and Jerry Hill , D - San Mateo .
Opposing it were Assemblyman Curt Hagman , R- Chino Hills , Danny Gilmore , R- Hanford , and Warren Furutani , D - Long Beach .
“ This is the formal beginning of the end of marijuana prohibition in the United States , ” said Stephen Gutwillig , director of the Drug Policy Alliance Network .
The legislation drew fierce opposition from law enforcement groups and anti-drug advocates , who said it would empower drug cartels , make it marijuana more available to youths and send the wrong message about drug tolerance .
The bill would place a $ 50 fee on each ounce of marijuana sold to pay for drug education and treatment .
Board of Equalization Chairwoman Betty
Yee , who has endorsed the bill , said legalization would raise $ 1.4 billion in state revenues .
“ We ’re going to legalize marijuana and tax it and then educate our kids about the harms of drugs ?
You got to be kidding me , ” said Assemblyman Danny Gilmore , R - Hanford , a retired 30 - year CHP officer .
“ This is a classic example of the slippery slope .
What ’s next ?
Are we going to legalize methamphetamines or cocaine ? ”
Ammiano dismissed what he described as opponents ’ “ alarmist ” views , saying the state should take heed of the growing movement in California toward legalization .
A group backing a measure called the Tax and Regulate Initiative has collected enough signatures to place legalization on the November ballot , and Ammiano and others said it was important that lawmakers control the details of the policy .
Ammiano ’s bill would remove all penalties in California law on cultivation , transportation , sale , purchase , possession and use of marijuana , natural THC , or paraphernalia for anyone older than 21 .
Creating a legal , regulated market — which the bill ’s proponents estimate to be $ 14 billion statewide — would severely cut into the violent underground drug market that controls marijuana sales today , said Aaron Smith , California policy director for the Marijuana Policy Project .
“ Prohibition ( of marijuana ) has failed to stop or curb marijuana use or availability , ” Smith said .
“ This legislation would end this insane policy of allowing this huge market to go completely unregulated and free of taxes . ”
To think that legalizing marijuana would wipe out criminal trafficking is “ not only naive but patently dangerous , ” said Susan Manheimer , the San Mateo chief of police and acting president of the California Police Chiefs Association .
“ Do we think they ’re merely going to go away because it ’s now been legalized or decriminalized ? ” Manheimer said .
“ No , they will be strengthened and will find ways to use fronts to become legal cultivators . ”
But one group of police officers , judges and prosecutors — Law Enforcement Against Prohibition — said the benefits outweigh the negatives .
“ This will decrease the money coming into the hands of the Mexican drug cartels , ” said Jim Gray , a retired Orange County judge .
“ Marijuana will be less available to kids .
It ’s easier now to get marijuana than a six - pack of beer because all the drug dealers are n’t asking for their ID . ”

A new study may have discovered one of the reasons why a bulging belly is a greater health risk than a fat backside .
Researchers have known for some time that fat stored on the thighs , hips and buttocks is healthier than that stored around the abdomen , but they have not known why .
But now scientists from Oxford University , who have been studying the two different types of fat , think lower - body fat produces hormones that help fight disease , like diabetes .
Their work is published in the International Journal of Obesity .
A clinical research fellow at the University of Oxford 's Centre for Diabetes , Endocrinology And Metabolism , Dr Konstantinos Manolopoulos , says although we might think all the fat on our body is the same , there are some important differences .
" The fat around the tummy is what we call a metabolically active tissue , which means that it takes up fatty acids from meals quite avidly and releases them in times of exercise , again quite avidly , while the thigh fat is basically long - term storage , so it 's much more sluggish in its metabolism , " he said .
" Ideally we'd have very flat tummies and very large hips .
" It 's a bit difficult to sell , obviously , this way of , let 's say , promoting health .
" The saying ' one minute on the lips , forever on the hips ' ... there is certainly something true on that . "
But despite it being harder to shift , Dr Manolopoulos says the fat on the thighs and hips actually protects the body from diseases related to obesity .
" It is the thigh fat that is the source of some beneficial hormones which are called leptin and adiponectin , " he said .
" They help the body metabolise sugars and fats in a better way .
In contrast , tummy fat , it 's actually known and proven that it secretes a series of deleterious hormones that promotes exactly the opposite . "
But he says even then , it is not an excuse for people to develop unhealthy habits .
" Do n't get me wrong , I 'm not promoting to say to people gain weight , " he said .
" Obviously someone who is overweight and who would say ' I have loads of weight around my hips ' , but probably the same people would have loads of fat around the tummy .
Well obviously the [ non -] beneficial properties of the tummy fat overrides the beneficial properties of the leg fat .
" The take - home message is not just gain fat but it 's important where it 's stored . "
Dr Manolopoulos says there is certainly a genetic background to this but he says he and his team are trying to find out how the body decides where to store its fat , then they can eventually develop ways of manipulating the body into storing the fat in safer areas .
" The general idea of redistributing fat in our body is a valid one but one should and could explore certainly in the future , " he said .

Is it all just a Ponzi scheme ?
By : Eric Sprott & David Franklin
In our May / June Markets at a Glance , " The Solution … is the Problem " , we discussed how much debt the US government would need to issue in order to balance the budget for fiscal 2009 .
We calculated they would need to sell $ 2.041 trillion in new debt - or almost three times the new debt that was issued in fiscal 2008 .
As a thought experiment , we separated all the various US Treas ury owners and asked our readers whether each group could afford to increase their 2009 treasury purchases by 200 % .
In the end , we surmised that most groups could n’t , and prepared our readers for the worst .
Almost seven months later , however , nothing particularly bad has happened on the U S debt front .
There have been no failed auctions , no sovereign defaults , no downgrades of debt and no significant increase in rates … not so much as a hiccup in the treasur y market .
Knowing what we discussed this past June , we have to ask how it all went so smoothly .
After all – it was pretty obvious there was n’t enough buying powe r to satisfy the auctions under ‘ normal ’ circumstances .
In the latest Treasury Bulletin published in December 2009 , ownership data reveals that the United States increased the public debt by $ 1.885 trillion dollars in fiscal 2009 .
1
So who bought all the new Treasury securities to finance the massive increase in expenditures ?
According to the same report , there were three distinct groups that bought more than they did in 2008 .
The first was " Foreign and Internation al Bu yers " , who purchased $ 697.5 billion worth of Treasury securities in fiscal 2009 – representing about 23 % more than their respective purchases in fiscal 2008 .
The second group was the Federal Reserve itself .
According to its published balance sheet , it increased its treasury holdings by $ 286 billion in 2009 , represent ing a 60 % increase year - over - year .

I just finished reading the latest edition of Psychology Today and came across a very interesting experiment .
The results showed that students who were told that nervousness would improve performance ended up scoring better on their Graduate Record Exam ( GRE ) than students who were told nothing at all .
The study was done by several researchers at the Emotion , Health , And Psychophysiology Laboratory at Harvard University .
It is further evidence on the power of positive appraisal on physiology and performance .
One of the researchers , Wendy Berry Mendes , says this effect may even be stronger for athletes , “ because physical exertion drives up adrenaline levels , they ’ve got even more nervous energy to channel . ”
I one time read that the adrenaline rush we feel from something like a roller - coaster or an exciting movie is very biochemically similar to the stress response we experience before something like a job interview or a hard day at work .
The raw energy in itself is never necessarily a bad thing ; it all depends on where we direct it .
If we are wasting it all on concerns , worries , and negative thoughts , then we have less energy to concentrate on doing a good job .
The same is true no matter what environment you are in , whether it is in the office , at home , or on a football field .
But when students in the experiment were told that their nervousness was positive , they were probably no longer thinking , “ Oh no !
I am so worried that my mind might go blank ! ” and instead their inner voice began saying , “ Aha , I feel the energy and I am pumped ! ”
The meaning behind the emotion makes all the difference .
It is the arrow telling us where to focus our attention ; and where attention goes , energy flows .
With practice I believe we could all do better at transforming our negative energies – like anxiety , frustration and depression – into a more focused and positive form of concentrated energy , like that which I describe in my recent article on flow .
The power of belief and meaning
The only difference between the two groups of students was that one believed their nervousness was good ; so when they became more aroused during the exam it meant something positive and beneficial was occurring .
How we interpret the meaning of our internal experiences can have a world of difference in how we behave and act .
Two individuals can have very similar pasts and memories , but one may look back at those memories and feel crippled , while another looks back and is inspired by all the things they have learned .
While we may not always choose what we experience , it is always the individual who chooses what to take away from that experience – and that is part of what makes humans so self - empowering ( and at the same time so self - defeating ) .
When something negative is happening to us we often feel helpless , as if it is out of our control ; but if we take our experience and put a positive frame around it , then it becomes an ability and not a crutch .
Click here to read a more recent article I wrote about beliefs : Beliefs and Your Map of Reality .
Letting the energy build
The students who were told that nervousness was a good thing also showed greater signs of stress through a saliva test .
This may imply that because students found their nervousness to be positive , they were less willing to fight or resist it , and more willing to let it build up .
The more , the better – right ?
And maybe they are right , because the more energy that builds up , the more focus they can apply towards answering questions correctly .
Perhaps it was even this difference that allowed these students to score better on the GRE in the first place – they let the energy flow through them .
Too idealistic or a path towards a better self ?
I admit these findings and suggestion can sometimes sound a bit too fanciful or idealistic .
At the very least channeling our energy in such a way is “ easier said than done . ”
But certainly this is something worth practicing .
If through the power of our beliefs we can shape our reality in subtle but effective ways , then this is something worth our effort and attention .
Hopefully future studies will reveal more about these psychophysiological mechanisms and how we can use them to build both a better self and a better world .

World Trembles As US Prepares New Quake Test
By : Sorcha Faal , and as reported to her Western Subscribers
A most grim report from Russian Space Forces ( VKS ) monitoring the United States High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program ( HAARP ) is warning today that the Americans are preparing for another potentially devastating earthquake test on a scale comparable to the one that destroyed the Caribbean island Nation of Haiti , and which we had previously reported on in our January 14th report titled “ US Quake Test Goes “ Horribly Wrong ” , Leaves 500,000 Dead In Haiti ”
The reason for this new American quake test , these reports say , is due to the ‘ catastrophic failure ’ of their previous ones that have so destabilized our Earth ’s inner magnetosphere that more earthquakes have been reported in the past 30 - days then in the first 90 - days of 2009 ( including over 600 alone at the potentially catastrophic Yellowstone volcanic caldron ) and that have caused more loss of life than in the previous 5 - years all put together .
For the purposes of the Americans conducting these most dangerous of quake tests , these reports continue , is for their use against the Persian Nation of Iran which the United States Military has concluded can only be destroyed by a ‘ severe disruption ’ to their society caused by a massive earthquake which would leave the Iranians with ‘ no excuse ’ to retaliate against the West .
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez , so far , has been the only World leader calling on the United States to immediately stop the testing of these catastrophic earthquake weapons and has accused the Americans of “ playing God ” , and as we can read as reported by the Russia Today News Service :
“ Chavez is blaming the US for causing the 7.0 magnitude earthquake in Haiti as part of testing a “ tectonic weapon ” that can cause eco - type disasters , according to Russia Today .
The Latin American leader added that the US should “ stop playing God . ”
Chavez said these “ weapon earthquakes ” would eventually be used against Iran and be taken over by the US military .
Chavez says these weapons can alter the climate and set off earthquakes and volcanoes remotely through the use of electromagnetic waves . ”
Important to note about Chavez ’s warning of the United States testing of these earthquake weapons was its quick denunciation by the Western propaganda media , including Spain ’s SDP News Service which even went so far as accusing the Venezuelan leader of basing his information on the Sorcha Faal ’s original report , and which completely ignored the fact that Chavez would have access to the same Russian reports we had used for our reporting on this matter .
Though not known to the vast majority of Americans the development and use of earthquake weapons have long been known , and as evidenced by a US Department of Defense press briefing on April 28 , 1997 when then Defense Secretary William Cohen in talking of the dangers future wars would bring surprised reporters by mentioning them , and as we can read :
“ Alvin Toeffler has written about this in terms of some scientists in their laboratories trying to devise certain types of pathogens that would be ethnic specific so that they could just eliminate certain ethnic groups and races ; and others are designing some sort of engineering , some sort of insects that can destroy specific crops .
Others are engaging even in an eco- type of terrorism whereby they can alter the climate , set off earthquakes , volcanoes remotely through the use of electromagnetic waves . ”
The use by the Americans of these new HAARP geophysical weapons has , also , caused Russia to issue a warning that they could lead to a Global catastrophe , and as we can further read :
“ A lot of specialists and scientists believe that unpredictable natural disasters and several man-caused catastrophes that struck Europe and Asia in the summer of the year 2002 say that there might be certain global reasons that caused them all .
First and foremost , it goes about a possibility of secret geophysical weapon tests .
Those tests were either secret or unauthorized .
The Russian Federation State Duma spent almost a year , considering the global threat of the HAARP program .
The Duma finally prepared two addresses : to President Putin and to the UN , international organizations , parliaments and governments of all countries , to the scientific community of the world , as well as to mass media .
The Russian parliament suggested the global banning of HAARP tests .
In September of the year 2002 the State Duma of Russia discussed this question and conducted the voting in order to send the mentioned addresses to the adequate addressees .
One hundred and eighty - eight deputies voted for the address to President Vladimir Putin , whereas the same subject for the UN returned 220 votes .
This proved that Russian parliamentarians were rather concerned about the development and possible use of geophysical weapons . ”
Also to note is that in while in our previous report we had stated that Northern Fleet Officials did not believe the US intended to fully destroy Haiti with their quake test , new information is showing the Americans were preparing for it , and as we can read :
“ A Haiti disaster relief scenario had been envisaged at the headquarters of US Southern Command ( SOUTHCOM ) in Miami one day prior to the earthquake .
The holding of pre-disaster simulations pertained to the impacts of a hurricane in Haiti .
They were held on January 11 . ”
Other Western reports are stating that a British naval flotilla was pulled out of the waters around Haiti just days before the earthquake , the first such gap in British naval coverage in the Caribbean since the 1700’s .
Note : The West has long used Military ‘ drills ’ such as these as a cover to conceal the real events , such as those conducted prior and during the September 11 , 2001 attacks upon America and the July 7 , 2005 ‘ mock bombing ’ of London ’s subway system that ( coincidentally ) coincided with an actual attack .
To the location of this new earthquake weapons test the United States is preparing for these reports further warn the entire Western coastal areas of the Americans are in danger and could ‘ very well ’ expect to see a catastrophic event within the fortnight .
Most unfortunately in all of these events are the American peoples continued denial of what is being done in their names by their war leaders , and who , like Chavez had warned , are ‘ playing God ’ .
But not to a heaven are these ‘ gods ’ creating , but rather a ‘ hell on Earth ’ these peoples should begin preparing for , and as the evidence in Haiti shows , beyond all doubt , that when catastrophe strikes , everyone will have to fend for themselves .

[ Ed . Note : Western governments and their intelligence services actively campaign against the information found in these reports so as not to alarm their citizens about the many catastrophic Earth changes and events to come , a stance that the Sisters of Sorcha Faal strongly disagrees with in believing that it is every human beings right to know the truth .
Due to our missions conflicts with that of those governments , the responses of their ‘ agents ’ against us has been a longstanding misinformation / misdirection campaign designed to discredit and which is addressed in the report “ Who Is Sorcha Faal ? ” . ]

The Federal Government 's controversial My School website crashed on its first day of operation today .
Have your say
At 9.30 am the site was operating slowly after being completely inaccessible between about 6.30 am and 8.30 am .
It went live at 1am .
A spokesman for the Australian Curriculum , Assessment and Reporting Authority , which developed the My Schools website , blamed the problem on an " overwhelming volume of traffic " .
NATO members ’ reluctance to assume a larger role in Afghanistan is partly the legacy of U.S. military protection , which allowed Europeans to stress social programs over defense for decades , the Greek ambassador to the United States said .
“ For 40 years , you have a system [ of ] not bothering about military , security and stability expenses , ” Vassilis Kaskarelis told editors and reporters of The Washington Times .
“ Because these issues were handled by the United States after World War II … everybody was happy . ”
Mr. Kaskarelis , 60 , served as Greece ’s ambassador to NATO from 2000 to 2003 , before a five - year stint as his country ’s top envoy to the European Union .
The Obama administration is weighing whether to send thousands of additional American troops to augment the 68,000 already in Afghanistan .
Other NATO members are contributing about 40,000 troops .
Only Britain has agreed to send more .
The Netherlands and other nations have announced that they intend to withdraw troops in the next two years .
European nations have been watching with concern the Obama administration ’s prolonged deliberations over Afghanistan strategy and have been waiting for Washington to make up its mind before announcing their own troops decisions .
U.S. commanders , meanwhile , have complained that some European forces have rules of engagement so restrictive that it makes it difficult for them to conduct combat missions .
Mr. Kaskarelis said during the interview on Friday that most European governments support the war in Afghanistan but lack the military infrastructure to contribute as equal partners .
“ They do n’t have the capabilities , because in the last 50 years , the U.S. offered an umbrella in terms of military , security and stability , ” he said .
“ You had the phenomenon [ in which ] most of the successful European economies — countries like France , Germany , the Scandinavians — channeled all the funds they had on social issues , health care , pensions , you name it . ”
Mr. Kaskarelis noted that this system grew out of the wreckage of World War II and that without U.S. aid , his own country “ would n’t exist today ” as an independent , democratic state .
But to readjust is difficult , he said .
“ Can you imagine how a government can sell such … an idea to its general public without having a revolution ?
They cover the expense of the hospital , but to say , ‘ We wo n’t cover 100 percent of your medical expenses , we will start covering 80 percent , because the other 20 percent [ will be used ] to upgrade our military capabilities to be used in NATO and Afghanistan .
Can you imagine this ? ”
Robert Kagan , a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the author of “ The Return of History and the End of Dreams , ” agreed with the ambassador ’s analysis .
“ The Europeans have lived in a very benevolent situation for decades in which the United States provided a security umbrella under which a very happy lifestyle — including high government expenditures on domestic health and welfare programs — were made possible , ” he said .
“ It ’s difficult to imagine that European publics could be persuaded to give up this deal , and few European politicians are urging them to do so . ”
Mr. Kaskarelis faulted the George W. Bush administration for giving the impression that it could wage war and peace in both Iraq and Afghanistan without much assistance from other nations .
He was particularly critical of the U.S. decision to offer contracts for Iraq reconstruction only to U.S. firms after the 2003 invasion .
“ I am not going to criticize the initial decision [ to topple Saddam Hussein ] , but this idea was not helpful , ” he said .
He said he personally had offered to provide plans for the Baghdad sewage system , which was built decades ago by a Greek company .
He said a senior Bush administration official rebuffed the offer .
The ambassador would not identify the official .
Mr. Kaskarelis also said tense U.S. ties with Russia during the Bush administration hurt U.S. efforts in both Iraq and Afghanistan and that he strongly supported the Obama administration ’s decision to change plans for a missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic .
“ I strongly believe you cannot do business in the Caucasus and in Central Asia without the Russians , because they are there , ” he said .
“ This is the reality . ”
He praised the Obama administration ’s willingness to consult foreign countries on key policy issues and said Greece wanted to offer help on matters such as Arab - Israeli peace that go beyond the traditional Greek portfolio of Cyprus , Turkey and the Balkans .
Mr. Kaskarelis also said he was optimistic about improved relations between the Eastern and Western branches of Christianity .
In 1054 , in what is known as the Great Schism , the Orthodox Church , based in what is now Istanbul , broke away from the Vatican in Rome .
“ I believe the situation is more than good , ” the ambassador said .
“ The two churches and the patriarch in Istanbul and the Vatican have established close relations for the past 10 or 15 years .
There is a dialogue going on .
There are results that are not spectacular , but positive .
“ I am optimistic at a certain point , it would take some time , we could talk about a reunification of the two churches : Eastern Rome and Western Rome . ”

" [ line ] ( if - let [ [ _ hit ] ( re - find re line ) ] {hit 1} {} ) ) ( defn my - find - widely " Return a map of pages to hit counts in filename . " [ filename ] ( apply merge - with + ( pmap count - line ( line - seq ( reader filename ) ) ) ) )
I grabbed that but for some reason could n’t get it to run against the actual Wide Finder dataset .
I pinged John and he provided me with this revised version :
( ns batch - pmap - wide - finder " A basic map / reduce approach to the wide finder using agents .
Optimized for being idiomatic and readable rather than speed .
Updated to deal with batches of lines instead of individual lines .
" ( : use [ clojure.contrib.duck - streams : only [ reader ] ] [ clojure.contrib.seq -utils : only [ partition - all ] ] ) ) ( def * batch - size * 50 ) ( def re #" GET / ongoing / When / \d\d\dx /( \d\d\d\d/\d\d/\d\d/[^ . ]+ ) " ) ( defn tally [ line ] ( if - let [ [ _ hit ] ( re - find re line ) ] {hit 1} {} ) ) ( defn count - lines [ lines ] ( apply merge - with + ( map tally lines ) ) ) ( defn find - widely " Return a map of pages to hit counts in filename . " [ filename ] ( apply merge - with + ( pmap count - lines ( partition - all * batch - size * ( line - seq ( reader filename ) ) ) ) ) )
Processing the big dataset , it ran in 1h28 m , while burning about 7h25 m of CPU .
On impulse , I changed his * batch - size * to 100 and this had no effect on the elapsed time but cranked the CPU to just over 8h .
Concurrency is weird .
Once again , if you ’re not already a Lisper , take a minute to look at and think about this code .
I Look At This Code ·
And what do I see ?
First , these guys have internalized the APIs and libraries , and in particular the list - and sequence - processing functions , just like a seasoned Perlmonger or Java - head have internalized those languages ’ key APIs .
And you ’re not really a Clojure programmer until you ’ve done that .
It ’s remarkable the degree to which you can push all your boring arithmetic and book - keeping down into the guts of declarative / functional calls like partition - all and merge - with .
In particular you have to admire the elegance of how John ’s tally function flows into merge - with .
The compactness of this code compared to , for example , mine , is remarkable .
Is It Expressive and Readable ? ·
Which is to say , maintainable ?
Until there are some measurements in a controlled - experiment kind of setting , the answer to that has to be personal and anecdotal .
So I ’m not going to offer mine right now ; I ’d like to hear others ’ opinions .
Rise in population is causing housing shortage , and now this problem is waiting for Queensland .
The shortage of houses will be presenting the state with a very significant problem , with the demand outracing the supply , and first - time home buyers facing the increasing risk of being priced out of the market .
The Urban Development Institute of Australia says that the state would face shortage of 50000 houses with this heavy rise in population by next middle year .
Some figures show that housing approvals dropped 25 per cent on average for the decade while net overseas migration - the big mover - is running at six times the rate of
1990 levels .
The problem is being blamed by developers on the authorities ' " go - slow " when it comes to approving land releases , but the local governments have been quick to defend themselves by insisting that there is enough land available to meet all the housing demand .
" Population growth , driven by overseas migration , is creating a demand for housing that is nowhere being matched by constrained dwelling production " , the report said .
UDIA chief executive Brian Stewart says that developers are also facing difficulties as the land prices are much higher than ever and the availability of finance is also hindering the process .
Gegen Ende des letzten Jahrtausends kaufte eine Getränkefirma die Rechte an der Marke Afri-Cola , einer alten deutschen Marke , die immer noch eine gewisse Beliebtheit hatte .
Und weil Marken in den Augen mancher ( Fach - ) Leute heute wichtiger sind als der Inhalt , wurde der Geschmack des Getränks an den Mainstream angepasst – mit mehr Zucker und weniger Koffein .
Kunden wurden dazu nicht gefragt .
Es wurde ihnen nicht einmal mitgeteilt .
Einige Leute machte das ziemlich sauer :
Sie gründeten eine eigene Cola - Marke , die weitestgehend nach dem Originalrezept unter dem Namen Premium - Cola inzwischen mehr als 300.000 Flaschen pro Jahr verkauft ( was nicht viel ist , aber es ist was ) .
Aber das ist nicht alles .
Wenn man ein kleines Erfrischungsgetränke - Unternehmen vor allem deshalb aufbaut , weil man sich von seinem angestammten Händler betrogen fühlt , dann muss das eigentlich Konsequenzen haben .
Bei Premium - Cola hatte es die .
Bei Premium - Cola will man alle mit Respekt behandeln und so , dass am Ende alle zufrieden sind mit dem , was sie kriegen : Kunden , Händler , Großhändler , Spediteure , Mitarbeiter – die Stakeholder würde man sagen , wenn man so etwas gerne sagt .
Warum etwas machen , und es dann nicht perfekt machen ?
Ohne Tricks und Rabatte , ohne irgendjemanden auszuquetschen oder zu drängen ?
Wenn man im Gegenteil , alles genau so machen würde , dass alle Beteiligten mit jedem einzelnen Schritt gut leben können ?
Weil außerdem nur solche Menschen mitmachen , die es auch wollen ?
Wie wäre denn die Produktion in einer , wie es einer der Premium - Cola - Beteiligten nennt , „ arschlochfreien Kette ? “
Seit gestern ist der überarbeitete Focus auf dem Markt .
Er ist das Ergebnis von einem Dreivierteljahr Arbeit in drei verschiedenen Teams , aus deren Ergebnissen angeblich ein Best - Of - Potpurri gemischt wurde .
Und aus meiner
Sicht ist es so :
Wenn dies die besten Ideen von drei verschiedenen Teams zusammenführt , die neun Monate Zeit hatten , sich Gedanken zu machen , dann ist das Ende der Zeitschriften in diesem Land besiegelt .
Zumindest die erste Ausgabe ist eine unvorstellbar preiswert billig anmutende Mischung aus Designelementen der Mitbewerber – aber nicht einmal gut geklaut .
Den Umgang mit Fotografie muss man noch einmal gesondert herausheben , weil er den absoluten Tiefpunkt von allem markiert , das ich je gesehen habe .
Es ist bodenlos : langweilig und schlecht , und wenn im ganzen Heft zwei Fotos auch nur entfernt in ihrer Aussage die Geschichte stützen , die sie illustrieren sollen , dann ist das wahrscheinlich Zufall .
Im Regelfall ist auf einem Focus - Foto einfach nur eine lächelnde Person zu sehen , egal worum es geht , und dementsprechend absurd und handwerklich abenteurlich sehen die Seiten aus .
Eine lächelnde Familienministerin neben der Headline „ Züge eines Kulturkampfes “ .
Ein lächelnder Weißhaariger unter der Head „ Von wegen Märtyrer “ .
Ein lächelnder Guido Knopp unter der Headline „ Mit dem Zweiten reist man besser “ .
Um den Focus überhaupt verstehen zu können muss man alles , was in ihm steht , bereits wissen ( um Guido Knopp wird gerade ein Skandälchen um zu teure Dienstreisen konstruiert ) .
Bis hin zur vom Spiegel abgeguckten Personalien - Seite , auf der dann allerdings statt echter oder gar exklusiver Anekdoten auch zusammenhanglose Interviewschnipsel der Schauspielerin Kristin Scott Thomas verarbeitet werden : Focus wirkt inzwischen wie ein Nachrichtenmagazin , dessen Redakteure als einzigen Informationsquellen die selben Medien zur Verfügung stehen wie den Lesern auch .
Vielleicht liegt es an der Fallhöhe des Genres Nachrichtenmagazin , aber ich habe noch nie erlebt , dass irgendein Produkt so sehr „ Sparkurs “ geschrien hat wie dieser Focus .
Was auch immer zwischen den stuhlklebenden und stuhlschiebenden Chefredakteuren dort los ist – dem
Heft hat es nicht gut getan .
Ausgehend von dem Ergebnis der langen Entwicklungsarbeit bleibt eigentlich nur die Frage : Will man dort in München tatsächlich ein Nachrichtenmagazin machen ?
Ich möchte keinen Vergleich ziehen , sondern ein systemisches Problem aufzeigen , deshalb schlage ich noch einmal den Bogen zu der konsensdemokratischen Premium - Cola , bei der mehr als 170 Menschen sich einig sein müssen über jeden Händler , der sie ausschenken darf ( der erste war Harry Schulz von Harrys Lütt ’n Grill , und der ist immer noch begeistert ) , was auf dem Etikett steht und welche Zeitschrift über sie berichten darf ( bei anderen bittet man höflich darum , ignoriert zu werden ) .
Man gibt Anti-Mengenrabatte , subventioniert also kleine Händler , für die die Transportkosten sonst im Verhältnis zu hoch wären .
Nachhaltig und CO2 - neutral ist die Produktion natürlich nebenbei auch , und seitdem man neuerdings auch ein Premium - Bier braut , investiert man auch einen festen Prozentsatz der Erlöse in die Alkoholismus - Prävention .
Das klingt wie ein linker Gutmenschen - Traum oder eine naive Utopie , die sich mit Marktgesetzen nicht verträgt .
Auf den zweiten Blick ist es das allerdings nicht .
Es ist einfach ein auf die absolute Spitze ( der Etikettenleim ist vegan ) getriebenes , altes – und in Hamburg heiliges – Prinzip : das des ehrbaren Kaufmanns .
Es ist das Prinzip , dass es am Ende eines echten , den Namen verdienenden Geschäftes nur Gewinner geben darf .
Wenn ein Teilnehmer in einem Geschäft mehr verliert als gewinnt , dann ist er entweder ein Idiot oder betrogen worden – im schlimmsten Fall beides .
In jedem Fall macht man so keine Geschäfte .
Dabei geht es natürlich immer auch um Profit , aber das Prinzip unterstellt nicht , der Profit sei das eine Merkmal eines Produktes oder einer Dienstleistung , das alle anderen überflüssig macht .
Focus war einmal , das geben selbst die Kritiker zu , ein gigantischer Erfolg auf dem Anzeigenmarkt .
Einen bleibenden publizistischen Eindruck im Land hat er nicht hinterlassen .
Von Anfang an war das Focus - Gefühl weniger durch die Inhalte des Focus selbst getrieben als durch den Unterschied zu den anderen , gefühlt linkeren Zeitschriften im Segment .
Er war eben gerade nicht der Spiegel , das haben offensichtlich viele genossen .
Aber schon auf mittlere
Sicht reicht es nie , irgendetwas nicht zu sein , wenn man dabei nichts anderes ist – nur das Vehikel für kaufmännischen Erfolg .
Jetzt schreiben Helmut Markwort und Uli Baur im gemeinsamen „ Tagebuch der Chefredakteure “ , die Redaktion hätte mit großem Enthusiasmus daran gearbeitet , „ unser Nachrichtenmagazin noch attraktiver und vielseitiger zu gestalten . “
Das oberste Ziel sei immer „ der gut informierte und aufgeklärte Leser . “
Es ist die allerletzte Bankrotterklärung , weil sie sich in so wenigen Worten selbst erledigt .
Die Auflage des Focus ist im freien Fall .
Es liegen inzwischen mehr Hefte in Flugzeugen als am Kiosk verkauft werden ( im letzten Quartal 133.000 zu knapp 100.000 ) .
Wenn ein aufgeklärter Leser das Ziel des Focus wäre , dann hätte man im Tagebuch sagen müssen : „ Die Redaktion hat in großer Panik monatelang nach Wegen gesucht , Ihnen irgendeinen Grund zu geben , dieses Heft noch zu kaufen . “
Vielleicht in feineren Worten .
Aber ganz offensichtlich glaubt man inzwischen nicht mehr , dass hinter den großen Worten möglicherweise eine Erfolgsformel steht .
Inzwischen ist jeder Trick recht , wenn er Leser , Auflage und letztlich Profit bringt .
Wenn ein Unternehmen , das Aufklärung und Information zu seinem erklärten Ziel macht , an der einfachsten aller Hürden scheitert , nämlich die eigene Situation mit offenen Augen zu sehen , dann ist sie natürlich nicht nur am Geschäftsmodell gescheitert .
Aber auch daran .
Das Bemerkenswerte an dem System des ehrbaren Kaufmanns ist seine Beständigkeit .
Die Profite mögen nicht maximiert sein , aber dadurch , dass sich jeder Stakeholder in der Situation wohl fühlt und als Gewinner sieht , bleibt er lange dabei .
Warum sollte er auch nicht .
Die Profite sind so nachhaltiger und sicherer .
Es ist die arschlochfreie Kette , die schützt .
Nicht immer und vor allem möglichen , aber doch spürbar .
Aber um eine arschlochfreie Kette aufbauen zu können , darf man zuallererst einmal selbst kein Arschloch sein .
Wenn man Cola verkauft , dann muss Cola drin sein .
Und wenn man ein Nachrichtenmagazin anbietet , dann macht es einen Unterschied , ob man einen publizistischen Erfolg haben will oder nur Profit .
Der Focus ist nach einem Dreivierteljahr Entwicklung für den Leser nicht besser geworden , weil er immer noch gar nichts selbst ist .
„ Gründlich informierte und aufgeklärte Leser “ , die im Jahr 2010 die Geschichte von Steve Jobs und Apple noch nie gelesen haben , wird es wohl nur noch vereinzelt und zufällig geben ( und , bitte : Wenn fünf Autoren an einer Geschichte schreiben , dann stellt nicht einfach deren Absätze hintereinander , sondern seht zu , dass diese etwas miteinander zu tun haben .
So , wie es da steht , ergeben ganze Absätze für die Geschichte keinen Sinn .
Ich erfahre zum Beispiel , dass es einen Mann gibt , der Hendrik Halkow heißt , ein iPhone und mehrere Apple - Computer besitzt .
Aber dann taucht er nie wieder auf .
Was soll das ? ) .
Für mich sieht das alles so aus , als wollte man beim Focus gar kein Nachrichtenmagazin machen .
Man will nur so tun als ob .
Und dann ein paar Dumme finden , denen das reicht , um es zu kaufen oder Anzeigen zu schalten .
So war es wohl einmal profitabel .
Aber ein Geschäft war es nie .
Former IPR writer Peter Orvetti posted this article at LibertyForAll.net .
Although the article discusses the larger libertarian movement , which encompasses independents , members of a variety of large and small political parties and non-voters , the issues he discusses here are directly applicable to the Libertarian Party – and by more general implication , to all alternative parties and alternative political movements .
Reposted by Paulie with permission of the author .
Is there room inside the libertarian movement for a moderate ?
Is there such a thing as a libertarian moderate ?
Any small but passionate cause runs the risk of creating an echo chamber .
The libertarian movement is experiencing remarkable growth online — a happy by - product of the simultaneous rise of Ron Paul and social networking — which means activists can communicate and organize across great distances with ease .
But it also means the members of the small group can come to interact entirely with others in that same small group , creating the misimpression that all the world shares its views .
The American far left has long used the echo chamber effect as a salve against its own irrelevance , with members of scads of indistinguishably didactic communist parties fighting one another for domination of the red hearts and minds of a few hundred adherents .
Though the libertarian movement is much broader , the echo chamber is there .
Many libertarians would sooner be accused of doing lewd things with their own mothers than be called “ statists ” — yet most people do not even know what that word means , let alone know why it is supposedly so awful .
The echo chamber produces cult - like reverence for names obscure to the masses , like Mises and Rothbard and Browne : all great men indeed , but of little interest to folks outside the movement looking for solutions to the nation ’s ever - worsening woes .
A “ moderate ” libertarian could easily feel like a reactionary in such a closed circle .
But in the harsh light of the non-libertarian political arena , that “ moderate ” will quickly be reminded how out of the mainstream even vaguely libertarian notions like drug legalization , the abolition of victimless crimes , and a non-aggressive foreign policy really are .
This breed of libertarian does not seek the abolition of government , but believes that local government is best , as it is closest to the people impacted , and carries the fewest layers of bureaucracy .
He believes there is a difference between the notion that a goal is a good one , and the insistence that the government must assert responsibility for achieving that goal .
He concedes that government can and has been a positive factor in the lives of many , but insists on examining whether a non-governmental solution could work better .
He believes any government effort , no matter how well - intended , must be considered in light of the unwilling person forced to fund it .
But while this libertarian is a republican , she is no Republican .
She believes in the absolute right of the individual to do with his life and his body whatever he pleases , so long as he does not expect to compel others to aid him should his choices turn out to be bad ones .
If a man wants to spend his life shooting up heroin , he has every right to do so — so long as he does not expect the rest of us to pay for his rehab .
If a woman wants to cut through the hypocrisy of sexual politics that permit 89 - year - old billionaires to marry 26 - year - old aspiring models , but that toss people in jail for more directly exchanging funds for fun , she has that right as well .
This libertarian is not an isolationist but is a peaceful internationalist , believing that the best way to stop wars is to break down the economic and social barriers between nations .
He knows that the best way to end wars is to keep them from starting , by declining to meddle in the affairs of other sovereign nations .
He knows the next generation of terrorists is being created by today ’s wars , just as those who strike against America today were created by America in the proxy wars against the Soviet Union .
But this libertarian differs from her purist peers .
She accepts that government , like the poor , we will always have with us .
She has no practical objection to things like government roads and parks , and is concerned by what would happen to the desperate if the “ safety net ” should completely disappear .
It is her goal to make libertarian ideals achievable within the realities of the present day , by working to keep government as uninvasive and as local as possible , and prefers to focus on the expansion of freedoms rather than the contraction of the state — while bearing in mind that the two go hand - in - hand .
Do you see room for this breed of libertarian in your movement ?

The news on Rush Limbaugh , right wing Neocon radio talk show host , is that he may have had a heart attack but he is resting comfortably .
Rush gets to rest comfortably knowing that his millions of dollars has likely bought him adequate healthcare .
Or maybe his healthcare is provided by the syndicaiton firm that he works for and he does n't have to spend too much of his fabulous fortune for adequate care .
But for the rest of the 100 million Americans that have inadequate or no health insurance getting sick means that they wo n't be resting comfortably .
Instead the uninsured and underinsured not only have to deal with the pain and suffering of being sick , they also have to worry about whether they will receive adequate and perhaps life saving treatment .
On top of that , they also have to worry about the cost of that treatment , inadequate or not .
Now normally I would n't take the time to contrast a super wealthy person getting adequate care in the hospital with the rest of the 100 million Americans that have to worry about their healthcare , or lack of care , and the fact they can't afford it .
But Rush Limbaugh condemns socialized medicine and ' Obama Care ' and for that he needs to take some time in the hospital and consider his care and contrast it with that of the 100 million without decent healthcare .
But Rush Limbaugh wo n't let a heart attack change his lack of an informed or a compassionate opinion .
Rush Limbaugh gets paid too much not to care about the healthcare of Americans .
After all , he is paid mucho dinero to be America 's clown of the right wing .
Rush wo n't be dissuaded from his inhumanity or his ignorance on healthcare , just like he was n't dissuaded about those that are thrown in jail for drugs while he received the most elaborate treatment for his own illegal addiction .
Among counselors and psychologists it is known that emotional turmoil will often find its outlet in bodily dysfunction or pain .
Perhaps Rush Limbaugh 's lack of a heart has somehow had an effect on his own heart .
Well , you might think this conjecture is all psychological nonsense .
Good hearted people have heart attacks every day .
It is true that the good hearts and the dark hearts of the world all get heart attacks .
But it is possible that havinglittle or no compassion really does have a deleterious effect on a person 's heart .
Moving beyond the irony of Rush having a heart attack while lacking a heart , is the horrendous situation of 100 million uninsured and underinsured AmericansI do n't wish Rush anything bad .
As a matter of fact , I am glad that he is resting comfortably and is well taken care of .
But I feel great sadness for the 100 million Americans that are likely going to get shafted in America 's so called healthcare ' reform ' because they will not be given a public ' medicare ' style healthcare program .
It is precisely because of people like Rush Limbaugh that 100 million Americans will not have the option to rest comfortably when getting sick .
So my hope is that as Rush gets feeling better and as he mends his physical heart , he actually begins to develop a heart for others .
I am glad Rush gets to rest comfortably as he mends , but I do wish the rest of uninsured and underinsured America would also be allowed to have that option .
But given the fact that Rush , and people like him , are directly responsible for Americans not being given real healthcare reform , I do hope Rush does n't lose any sleep as he rests comfortably .
This year sees the 100th anniversary of the first published infrared photograph .
Though there had been infrared spectrograms produced before 1910 , as far as we know the first infrared images in print were taken by Professor Robert Williams Wood and published in the October 1910 Photographic Journal of the Royal Photographic Society ( RPS ) .
Wood 's pictures later appeared in the Illustrated London News in June 1911 , as shown at the top of this page .
Infrared radiation was discovered in 1800 and today has a multitude of applications including the laser in your CD player and those remote controls for your TV that always vanish down the back of the sofa .
Infrared imaging is widely used , though primarily in other fields away from artistic photography such as forensics , medical and scientific imaging and astronomy .
Infrared photography shows us a world we can recognise , and yet it has an alien quality to it , something like Mars in early science fiction films .
Flash Gordon would be well at home .
Infrared is part of the spectrum beyond that which the eye can see , yet photographic devices are capable of recording it .
But this is not a how - to guide ; if you are interested in one , Infrared Photography Buzz is a good place to start .
One reason , I have to confess , is my near - ignorance of all things infrared .
It 's not something I can claim to have shot - at least not successfully !
So I asked Andy Finney , an expert in this field , to explain a little of the history and what draws him to this alien world .
He said :
" Why does infrared photography fascinate me ?
Partly it is because I like the way it emphasises inanimate objects in the landscape , crosses in graveyards overgrown with foliage for example .
I love the way trees can look like rivers of fire dancing around obsidian branches and boughs .
" Another reason is that no - one can say that it should n't look like that - any flavour is equally valid .
" Near - infrared behaves like visible light , whereas the longer - wavelength thermal infrared plays tricks , and will go through a bin liner but not glass , and can make a ball of hot air seem to be a solid object .
" Near - infrared can be imaged using appropriately sensitised film and conventional digital imaging chips , whereas thermal imaging requires more specialised equipment , so it 's the near infrared spectrum we are interested in as photographers .
" The colour which a visible object appears is a result of the amount of red , green and blue light that it reflects .
The same is true with near - infrared , and with a few exceptions , the big one being foliage , most things have the same tone in infrared as they do in a normal mono photo .
" The scattered light we see in the sky is made up of shorter wavelengths , which makes it look blue .
The light is scattered by tiny particles in the air , which only affects shorter wavelengths .
You can make the sky darker in a black and white photo by using a red filter .
With infrared , the sky goes darker still .
The clouds , however , are reflecting all the light and are as bright in infrared as they are in visible light .
Since shadows are lit by open sky , and the open sky is dark in infrared , shadows are darker too .
" Open water , such as a river or lake , reflects the sky , and so the water will also look dark .
This is nothing to do with water absorbing infrared .
" As film - based photographers knew back at the end of the 19th Century , it was actually difficult to get film to record red light and so it took some serious effort to sensitise photographic plates to infrared .
When Professor Wood gave his RPS lecture in 1910 , he had sensitised his own plates , since infrared film did not become commercially available until the 1930s .
" Once available , though , it seems to have been popular in the mid- to - late - 30s ; even Ansel Adams is reported to have shot a few infrared photographs - but he was , sadly , not enthusiastic .
Logie Baird even designed and built an infrared TV system called the Noctovisor .
Hollywood used infrared film for special effects , such as shooting night scenes during daylight .
" At that time , there were a number of films available from various companies including Kodak , Ilford and Agfa , and there are still infrared films available today .
" But it was n't until the arrival of digital photography that infrared enthusiasm really took off since it is relatively easy to take infrared shots with a digital camera - that is if you can overcome the infrared filtering built into your camera .
" When I started my infrared photography website in the mid-1990s , there were very few of us about and the film was difficult to buy and fiddly to use .
In recent years , it has spread and the web is brimming with fantastic infrared views of the world .
" Since the 1930s a number of notable photographers have dabbled and even specialised in infrared photography .
Minor
White , for example , saw infrared as an extension of his exploration of tone in photographs .
" The legendary Weegee took iconic photos of cinema audiences using infrared and Elliott Landy took some great colour infrared photos of Ornette Coleman , Bob Dylan ( see above ) and The Band in the late '60s .
More recently , Simon Marsden has produced a series of books on ruined and haunted buildings and Anton Corbijn used infrared film to shoot the cover of U2's album The Unforgettable Fire .
Infrared cameras have also shown us the goings - on in the Big Brother bedrooms and in the darkness of night on the African plains . "
So there you have it , an alien world ready to be captured on your doorstep .
The RPS is planning an exhibition of infrared photography in Bath and a two - day symposium in London in October 2010 .
The website Infrared100 , which Andy runs , is encouraging enthusiasts to get together and show their work .
I 'd also love to see your infrared pictures .
Please send them to viewfinder@bbc.co.uk and I 'll publish a selection in the coming weeks .
You can see some of Andy 's infrared pictures on his Invisible Light web site and on Flickr .
If you use any version of Internet Explorer to surf Twitter or other Web 2.0 sites , Jorge Luis Alvarez Medina can probably read the entire contents of your primary hard drive .
The security consultant at Core Security said his attack works by clicking on a single link that exploits a chain of weaknesses in IE and Windows .
Once an IE user visits the booby - trapped site , the webmaster has complete access to the machine 's C drive , including files , authentication cookies - even empty hashes of passwords .
This is n't the first time security researchers at Core have identified security weaknesses in IE .
The company issued this advisory in 2008 and this one in 2009 , each identifying specific links in the chain that could potentially be abused by an attacker .
" Every time we reported this to Microsoft , they were fixing just one of the features , " Medina said in a telephone interview from Bueno Aires .
" Every time they [ fixed ] it , we managed another way to build the attack again . "
Medina said he has fully briefed Microsoft on his latest attack , which he plans to demonstrate at next month 's Black Hat security conference in Washington , DC .
Microsoft's " rapid response team " did n't reply to an email , but a statement sent to other news outlets said the company is investigating the vulnerability and is n't aware of it being exploited in the wild .
The hole is difficult to close because the attack exploits an array of features IE users have come to rely on to make web application work seamlessly .
Simply removing the features could neuter functions such as online file sharing and active scripting , underscoring the age - old tradeoff between a system 's functionality and its security .
Based on Medina 's characterization , it appears that fixing the weakness will require changes in a Windows network sharing technology known as SMB , or server message block , as well as the way Windows makes file caches available to a wide variety of applications .
" The things we are reporting are not bugs , they are features , " Medina said .
" They are needed for many applications to work , so [ Microsoft ] can't simply remove or truncate " them .
IE suffers from at least one other long - standing security bug that can enable attacks against people browsing websites that are otherwise safe to view .
It can be exploited to introduce XSS , or cross - site scripting , exploits on webpages , allowing attackers to inject malicious content and code .
Microsoft has said it 's unaware of this vulnerability being exploited .
Core 's previous advisories contain a number of workarounds , including setting the security level for the internet and intranet zones to high to prevent IE from running scripts or ActiveX controls . ®
Today a comic appears despite the fact that Wes grew a huge beard in a single day and Tony curled up on the sidewalk and passed out because his batteries died .
Part of the appeal of the simple life for me is enjoying the basic things that we often take for granted .
Bodily functions , like toileting , have a way of impacting ones life in a most profound way .
I am not alone in thinking this ... saying it , maybe , but you know exactly what I mean , do n't you ?
A sore hoop can ruin your whole day , regardless of how much money you have .
Toilet paper under a microscope .
When a friend was in nursing school one nugget of information she shared was , " If you do n't poo or pee you die . "
That makes a lot of sense .
If you do n't take care of basic bodily functions you are going to be one unhappy camper .
Just ask the guy in post - op that has n't had a movement in a week .
This reminded me of one of the most useful things I read last year .
The practical tip was in a book about caring for the human body , something I am increasingly interested in as I begin to see evidence of mine wearing down .
The book advised , in the chapter on the digestive tract , to wet your toilet paper before wiping .
Now there is piece of advice that can have an immediate impact on your quality of life .
While I was traveling , the lack of toilet paper in many places turned out to be a blessing in disguise .
Soon I tapped into the wisdom of using water to clean the backside , instead of using paper to wipe everything around .
Like a friend said , " If you got some poop on your face would you wipe it off with toilet paper , or would you wash it with water ?
" I wonder what the frictional difference is between water and toilet paper ?
It 's like comparing silk and sand .
Even the very best pillowy soft , triple - ply , 100 % virgin forest toilet paper is made of scratchy cellulose fibre .
Wetting it decreases the friction considerably , reducing the damage to your delicate parts .
I like to make sure to get 100 % post - consumer TP ( made from recycled paper ) , which has come a long way since the original brown stuff with wood chips in it .
We are n't set up for using water to wash with as in several places I have visited , but now I have fused two toileting technologies , and I swear by wet sand paper .
I mean , toilet paper .
Who knows , this could help me make the switch back to water only .
Trees would be left standing , my hoop would be happier , and money would be saved .
I wonder what I should do with my share of the $ 2.5 billion dollars that Americans spend on TP every year ?
Celebrate the healthy functioning of your body .
Be thankful if it is squeaky clean and happily working as it should .
I came across an interesting Wikipedia page today as I read about the devastation in Haiti .
It details the international response to the quake by the governments of the world .
According to the article , the governments of over 50 countries so far have pledged various forms of assistance .
The list so far includes : Argentina , Australia , Belgium , Bermuda , Brazil , Canada , Chile , China , Colombia , Costa Rica , Cuba , Czech Republic , Denmark , Dominican Republic , El Salvador , Estonia , European Union , Finland , France , Germany , Greece , Guyana , Iceland , Indonesia , Ireland , Israel , Italy , Japan , Macedonia , Mexico , Netherlands , New Zealand , Norway , Pakistan , Panama , Peru , Phillipines , Poland , Portugal , Puerto Rico , Russia , Spain , Sweden , Switzerland , Republic of China ( Taiwan ) , Trinidad and Tobago , Turkey , United Kingdom , United States , Vatican City , and Venezuela .
What 's missing from the article ?
Any reference to private assistance .
I 'll be watching it to see if this problem is rectified in the days and weeks ahead .
I did see a Reuters article which supplied a small , initial list of private donors .
The list includes : UPS , Wal - Mart , Bank of America , UNICEF , Lowe's , Home Depot , National Bank of Canada , Bank of Nova Scotia , Abbott Laboratories , GoDaddy , Wells Fargo , Federal Express , Kraft Foods , American Red Cross , the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility , 3 M , the Florida Panthers hockey team , Rogers Communications , and Walt Disney company .
I fully expect that second list will grow dramatically in the next few days .
There are also reports that individuals are “ tweeting ” their own small donations in large numbers .
Undoubtedly , human generosity will continue to jump to the fore in the face of tragedy .
The other thing I 'll be watching is how well the international governments response gets coordinated , and how quickly it happens .
One of the biggest complaints about the handling of Katrina is that the U.S. , state , and local government responses were very poorly managed .
What happens when 50 governments get involved in the same crisis ?
Of course , the biggest question is : how many initial survivors can be rescued , and how quickly ?
That must be everyone 's goal : to insure that the survivors really do survive .

I had some interesting conversations at FUDcon Toronto [ 1 ] about python 's memory footprint , and about ways of reducing the whole - system memory pressure of a collection of Python processes , by sharing more pages of memory between them .
We discussed sharing memory between python processes .
One approach to doing this would be to write some kind of support for starting python as a " zygote process " , where we keep a started - up python process around , forking from it , so that the freshly forked process ( in theory ) uses only memory for the pages that become different ( copy - on - write ) .
As I understand it , this is how Chromium implements its tabs Bernie Innocenti apparently tried this for OLPC 's activities ( each a PyGTK process ) but only got 10 - 20 % sharing .
The problem is that every python object embeds a reference count , and constantly increments / decrements those ob_refcnt fields , leading to unsharing of the pages .
One way of improving this might be to invent a magic refcount value ( e.g. 0 ) that means " do n't refcount this " , so that pages can be shared ( stuff that 's been created at vm startup will probably be long - lived ) .
( do we need the ability to " seal " an object , to optimize for the common case where nothing 's been monkeypatched ? )
( Or we could completely scrap refcounting and go to a full gc model , but I 'm looking for easy wins here ) A similar approach that does n't require us to have a zygote process is to use KSM ( Kernel SamePage Merging ) .
This is a feature added in recent versions of the Linux kernel , where a program can mark regions of its address space .
The kernel can try to hash these pages , and pages that are bit - for - bit identical will be shared in RAM across the various processes .
KSM was developed by Qumranet hackers ( now at Red Hat ) for use in KVM .
Perhaps Python could use it ?
Unfortunately I do n't think this approach will work either : all of the various PyObject * pointers cross-referencing the data in memory will be non-equal , and that will kill the sharing ; the pages are unlikely to be bit - for - bit identical .
One idea for achieving equality of pages was to mimic how we build emacs : as I understand it , we build emacs as a process , then take a core - dump of it .
On starting up emacs we bring the coredump back to life .
( I may be horribly mischaracterizing this - it seems very fragile to me ) .
An approach that sounded promising was to try to consolidate the representation of the immutable blobs of data in the loaded python modules : the docstrings , the constant strings and unicode representations ; the bytecode blobs ( actually these are PyStringObjects ) .
The idea was a new variant of .pyc /. pyo .
A .pyc file is a hierarchical representation of a parsed python module , containing everything needed at runtime ( e.g. optimized bytecodes blobs rather than source strings , with links to the constants needed in the code ) serialized to disk using the " marshal " module .
It 's analogous to pickle , except that the marshal format only caters to strict hierarchies of objects , whereas pickle supports cross-references , and this the marshal code can be simpler ( and hopefully more efficient ) .
So in our proposed variant of .pyc , we would split the data into two streams :- control data for building the hierarchy of objects , to be thrown away after the module is loaded - " large " data to be mmap-ed , to persist in the process ' address space after the module is loaded , with the kernel sharing all instances of this data in RAM between all python processes .
This would require hooks in PyStringObject ( need PyBytesObject to do it for py3 k ) e.g. a new ob_sstate : SSTATE_INTERNED_MMAPPED , which places the bytes in a pointer elsewhere in the address space .
Some approaches to doing this :- use the .pyc format as is .
Unfortunately I do n't think this works : currently they 're written to disk as ( size , bytes ) without a nul terminator , whereas PyStringObject assumes that ob_sval is nul - terminated .- come up with a simple variant of .pyc that splits the marshalled data into two streams ( as above ) , storing offsets into the second stream within the first whenever writing out e.g. a PyStringObject - use the ELF format directly : ELF is a binary format supporting multiple chunks / streams of data , with room for expansion , and a library and command - line tools for manipulating them .
We could invent some new types of section .
However I suspect that tools for dealing with ELF files are only readily - available on Linux ( it happens to be the native format for executables and shared libraries ) ( we came up with the name " .pye " to refer to these ELF - based bytecode files ) Another idea was linkage : to try to link together all of the .pyc files per RPM into one big file , linking together the large sections as far as possible , or perhaps a big sqlite db mapping dotted path to .pyc files for standard modules .
The idea here was to try to reduce the number of syscalls needed to locate the .py files .
As it turned out , this seems to have been a classic case of optimizing without measuring .
Looking at the " stat " case , starting up the python interpreter 100 times :... so the bulk of the time taken is in user - space , rather than waiting on the kernel .
( We tried this on the OLPC " boot animation " workload , and I believe the real slowdown is an accidental syncronous call that should have been asyncronous , that 's stalling on waiting for a socket to close ) .
On my return from the conference I spent some time trying to capture real measurements to justify a possible pyc rewrite .
To look at the memory usage of all of those shared docstrings , I wrote some systemtap scripts .
You can see the latest version here : http://dmalcolm.fedorapeople.org/systemtap/marshal.stp
I trieds various approaches to instrumentation .
The one I 've settled on is to instrument returns from the r_object ( ) call in Python / marshal.c , and to record PyObject * instances returned from that function that are of ob_type " str " ( i.e. are PyStringObject instances ) and have ob_refcnt == 1 ( i.e. they are shared with anything , and have n't been interned ) .
Assuming I 've instrumented things correctly , a simple startup of the interpreter under systemtap : $ stap - v marshal.stp - c" python - c ' pass ' " has this usage of unique strings ( the " value " is the length of the string ) ; note that this includes docstrings , constant strings , and bytecode blobs : ( snipped , full output here : http://dmalcolm.fedorapeople.org/systemtap/output-of-marshal.stp-on-python-pass.txt so ( assuming my method is correct ) we 'd save 192K of mmap-ed data per python process .
For the OLPC case , each " activity " on the laptop is a python process that typically imports the GTK and DBus modules .
This shows a larger saving : 431 K per python process :( output snipped ; full output here : http://dmalcolm.fedorapeople.org/systemtap/output-of-marshal.stp-on-python-import-gtk-and-dbus.txt
Similarly , I suspect that there may be savings if you have numerous python web apps on one box ( mod_wsgi daemon mode ? ) , or via KSM savings as above if dealing with multiple guest VMs running python on one host .
Worth pursuing ?
I also started looking at " yum " 's memory usage ; see http://dmalcolm.fedorapeople.org/systemtap/output-of-marshal.stp-on-yum-whatprovides-python.txt .
I wrote a systemtap script to try to instrument the various levels of memory allocation inside the python runtime ; see http://dmalcolm.fedorapeople.org/systemtap/python-mem.stp
; unfortunately this script does n't work yet , owing to a systemtap bug .
Hopefully when that 's fixed we can get some real insight into this .

Baroness Ashton grilled over CND past and says : ' I am not ashamed '
Britain's new EU foreign policy chief Baroness Ashton defended her past as a campaigner against nuclear weapons in a three - hour grilling by Euro MPs yesterday .
The Labour peer told the Brussels hearing of her membership of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament , saying : ' I am not ashamed of what I am , and who I have been . '
The session , to confirm her in the job of High Representative for Foreign Affairs , saw her come under fire from Tory and UKIP MEPs .
Grilled : Baroness Ashton was questioned strenuously today about her past as a campaigner for nuclear disarmament
Lady Ashton was mostly asked about her foreign policy plans and how she would tackle key issues such as the Middle East , Iran , Iraq , Afghanistan .
But her role in CND nearly 30 years ago cropped up when Conservative MEP Charles Tannock asked if she was still in favour of unilateral nuclear disarmament .
' The situation then is not relevant now , ' she replied .
' Not least because the European Union did not exist in the way it does now . '
She told Mr Tannock : ' You may disagree with what I did but do n't try and label what I did in the 1970s as something more than what it was . '
Lady Ashton , 53 , joined CND in 1977 and is alleged to have been spied on by the security services .
Later , UKIP MEP Lord Dartmouth claimed that , on the basis of her views at the time , Eastern Europe would still be under Communist rule : ' Your judgment has been hopelessly and demonstrably wrong .
Are you the Edith Piaf of the commission - " I regret nothing " - or are you going to recant these views and apologise to the people you misled ? '
Lady Ashton responded : ' I have never hidden what I did .
When I was a young person I marched because I wanted to abolish nuclear weapons .
I never visited Eastern Europe .
' We wanted to see a Europe that was free and here we have it . '
After the hearing Labour MEP Richard Howitt defended the peer .
He said : ' Tired and wholly false allegations about CND and the former Soviet Union were a thinly disguised attempt to associate Cathy Ashton with anti-Russian sentiment in the Parliament , and it fell totally flat . '
Mr Howitt said there had been ' sour grapes ' when Lady Ashton was unexpectedly named by EU leaders in November as their choice for the second most senior political job in Brussels .
But the life peer , who will earn £ 239,000 a year as well as a raft of allowances and perks in her role , suffered another difficult moment when she was forced to admit to gaps in her knowledge .
When asked what she thought of calls for the EU to replace the UK and France in the United Nations Security Council , she replied : ' I do n't know . '
The issue had ' not even crossed over into my thinking , ' she said , adding : ' You 've caught me out . '
Lady Ashton is one of 26 EU Commissioners who each face a similar three - hour ' job interview ' before MEPs vote to confirm their roles on January 26 .
PUPPY LOVE : Chihuahua cross
Shyla takes over mothering duties for seven abandoned kittens at the workplace of her owner , veterinarian Angela McFall , in Christchurch .
A cat - loving chihuahua cross has become a surrogate mother , suckling seven abandoned kittens .
Two - year - old Shyla had never had puppies , but her Christchurch owner , veterinarian Angela McFall , said the dog had always been a cat fancier .
" She gets a bit bossy with dogs , whereas she loves cats , " McFall said .
Two weeks ago , when another veterinary clinic found a litter of stray kittens , Shyla was brought in as a foster mother .
A chihuahua - fox terrier cross , she nursed a ginger kitten brought home by McFall last year .
McFall said dogs that had had a season on heat sometimes experienced a false pregnancy .
" They start producing milk and they get quite hormonal .
Shyla started nursing [ the ginger kitten ] , which was quite sweet but unusual . "
Shyla has now taken on the same role for the three - week - old orphans .
" Shyla cleans their bottoms and lays with them all the time , " McFall said .
" They are growing really strong and healthy . "
Shyla is not the only canine surrogate in the country .
A three - year - old Dunedin chihuahua , Anna , is nursing three two - week - old Persian kittens .
As revised in 1975 , Senate Rule 22 seemed to be an improvement : it required 60 senators , not 67 , to stop floor debate .
But there also came a significant change in de facto Senate practice : to maintain a filibuster , senators no longer had to keep talking .
Nowadays , they do n’t even have to start ; they just say they will , and that ’s enough .
Senators need not be on the floor at all .
They can be at home watching Jimmy Stewart on cable .
Senate Rule 22 now exists to cut off what are ghost filibusters , disembodied debates .
As a result , the supermajority vote no longer deserves any protection under Article I , Section 5  if it ever did at all .
It is instead a revision of Article I itself : not used to cut off debate , but to decide in effect whether to enact a law .
The filibuster votes , which once occurred perhaps seven or eight times a whole Congressional session , now happen more than 100 times a term .
But this routine use of supermajority voting is , at worst , unconstitutional and , at best , at odds with the founders ’ intent .
Here ’s why .
First , the Constitution explicitly requires supermajorities only in a few special cases : ratifying treaties and constitutional amendments , overriding presidential vetoes , expelling members and for impeachments .
With so many lawyers among them , the founders knew and operated under the maxim “ expressio unius est exclusio alterius ”  the express mention of one thing excludes all others .
But one need not leave it at a maxim .
In the Federalist Papers , every time Alexander Hamilton or John Jay defends a particular supermajority rule , he does so at length and with an obvious sense of guilt over his departure from majority rule .
Second , Article I , Section 3 , expressly says that the vice president as the presiding officer of the Senate should cast the deciding vote when senators are “ equally divided . ”
The procedural filibuster does an end run around this constitutional requirement , which presumed that on the truly contested bills there would be ties .
With supermajority voting , the Senate is never “ equally divided ” on the big , contested issues of our day , so that it is a rogue senator , and not the vice president , who casts the deciding vote .

The procedural filibuster effectively disenfranchises the vice president , eliminating as it does one of the office ’s only two constitutional functions .
Yet the founders very consciously intended for the vice president , as part of the checks and balances system , to play this tie - breaking role  that is why Federalist No. 68 so specifically argued against a sitting member of the Senate being the presiding officer in place of the vice president .
Nicolas Sarkozy écrit que " le sentiment de perdre son identité peut ê tre une cause de souffrance profonde " ( Le Monde du 9 décembre ) .
Il ne croit pas si bien dire .
L'histoire que j'ai vécue n'a rien d'exceptionnel .
Depuis environ quatre ans , elle a touché des dizaines de milliers de nos concitoyens .
Le mécanisme est simple .
Vous êtes français de naissance .
Votre passeport délivré avant 2005 arrive à échéance , vous l'avez perdu , abîmé ou encore vous vous l'êtes fait dérober .
Muni du titre d'identité périmé ou de la déclaration de perte , vous allez à la mairie ou à l'antenne de police de votre arrondissement .
Vous remplissez un formulaire .
Il vous faut indiquer l'état civil et le lieu de naissance de vos deux parents .
Un fonctionnaire vérifie qu'ils sont bien nés en France .
Si c'est le cas , il applique la procédure susceptible de vous faire obtenir , après vérifications , un nouveau passeport dit " sécurisé " .
Dans le cas contraire , il la bloque .
Il y est obligé par le décret n° 2005 - 1726 relatif aux passeports : vous avez beau être français , né en France , y avoir toujours vécu , travaillé et voté , vous y être marié , y avoir eu des enfants , avoir régulièrement reçu des papiers d'identité , cela ne vous autorise en rien à obtenir un nouveau titre " sécurisé " .
Si l'un de vos deux parents au moins est né à l'étranger , une nouvelle contrainte vous incombe : fournir la preuve qu'il est ( ou était ) bien français .
Mais ne croyez pas que , si vos parents se sont mariés en France , qu'on leur y a délivré un livret de famille et des cartes d'identité , cela suffise .
Selon les nouvelles règles , cela ne préjuge en rien de leur nationalité ni , à plus forte raison , de la vôtre .
Peut - être les administrations anciennes ont - elles fait une erreur ...
Il vous appartient donc de produire un acte d'état civil établissant la source de leur nationalité .
Sinon , vous n'obtiendrez pas de " certificat de nationalité française " , le seul acte permettant la délivrance d'un titre d'identité " sécurisé " .
Telle est la situation faite aux Français dont un parent est né à l'étranger : on les met en demeure de prouver par leurs propres moyens que l'administration française ne s'est pas trompée en conférant la nationalité française à ce parent .
Sinon , interdit de quitter le pays .
Et ce , en vertu du décret d'application d'une loi que le gouvernement Villepin , dont Nicolas Sarkozy était le ministre de l'intérieur , a fait voter en 2005 par l'Assemblée nationale .
Une loi grâce à laquelle les responsables de l'administration ont enfin la possibilité de remettre droit ce que leurs prédécesseurs , depuis un siècle , voire plus , avaient laissé tordu .
Je ne vais pas m'étendre sur mon cas .
Du côté de mon père , ma famille est française depuis Bonaparte .
Ma mère était une réfugiée hongroise originaire de Szolnok , petite ville dont le grand - père paternel de Nicolas Sarkozy , fut l'adjoint au maire .
On m'a envoyé au " pôle de la nationalité française " .
Une employée m'a demandé , sans rire : " Comment êtes - vous français , monsieur ? "
J'ai failli répondre : " Comme vous . "
Elle sous - entendait : " Par naissance ou par acquisition ? " , mais l'effet est néanmoins étrange .
Renvoyé à la préfecture de police de Paris , j'ai produit mon acte de naissance établissant que j'étais né à Paris .
Une employée l'a examiné et me l'a rendu en me disant :
" Il y a rien , là-dedans ... "
Mon cas était urgent .
France Musique , pour qui je produis une émission , avait prévu de m'envoyer à Berlin .
Avec une carte d'identité périmée et un passeport égaré , impossible de partir .
J'ai prévenu ma direction .
Le service de presse de la radio a pris pour moi un rendez - vous d'urgence à la préfecture de police .
Le jour et l'heure dits , j'ai apporté tous les papiers que j'ai pu .
Le résultat fut mitigé : on m'accorda un passeport d'urgence , valable pour un an seulement .
Ce document provisoire ne peut me permettre , notamment , de me rendre aux Etats - Unis sans visa .
Le responsable de la préfecture m'informa qu'on m'accordait ce document à titre exceptionnel , qu'on le ferait une fois , mais pas deux , et que j'avais intérêt à réunir au plus vite les bons papiers pour récupérer un passeport normal .
Ce qu'à l'heure actuelle je suis dans l'impossibilité d'obtenir .
Mon cas est loin d'être le pire .
Des dizaines de milliers de Français ont été mis en demeure de prouver qu'ils étaient français .
Des témoignages comme le mien abondent depuis deux ans dans les journaux ou sur Internet : retraitées de l'éducation nationale à qui l'on interdit de rendre visite à des frères et soeurs malades à l'étranger , militaires risquant leur vie pour la France , dont les parents ont eu la mauvaise idée de naître en garnison à l'étranger , considérés comme apatrides , employés d'entreprise que l'on empêche de partir pour l'étranger où un travail les appelle , étudiants qui ne peuvent se présenter à des examens , avocats qui ne peuvent prêter serment .
A tous , tous les jours , on refuse des papiers .
On leur interdit de circuler , de travailler , en un mot de vivre , comme tous les Français .
Certains voient leur situation débloquée au bout de six mois ou un an , d'autres jamais .
Face à une telle situation , on peut rire ou se mettre en rage .
On peut s'exclamer : " C'est Gogol ! " ( ou Courteline , ou Kafka ) , on peut hausser les épaules et dire : voilà bien l'administration française et sa mécanique baroque , qui produit de l'absurdité au nom de l'application scrupuleuse de règles strictes .
Ce n'est pas mon point de vue .
Une telle situation est inacceptable .
Elle résulte de l'application neutre d'une loi qui elle aussi se veut neutre .
C'est bien le pire .
Car , en fait et en droit , cette loi n'a rien de neutre .
Elle est moralement , politiquement et juridiquement inadmissible .
Je ne suis pas juriste .
Cela ne m'empêche pas de savoir lire le code civil : selon son article 2 , " la loi ne dispose que pour l'avenir ; elle n'a point d'effet rétroactif " .
Or l'application de cette loi , dont le décret n° 2005 - 1726 est l'expression , est , de fait , rétroactive .
Vous êtes né français , vous l'avez toujours été et , un jour , crac : un service administratif vous notifie que vous ne l'êtes plus , et que , donc , vous l'avez été à tort , et vos parents aussi .
Alors que vous n'avez commis aucun crime ou délit .
Ce n'est peut - être pas l'esprit de la loi , mais c'est un effet mécanique de son application .
Ce déni d'un principe ancestral du droit français ne semble pas troubler certains fonctionnaires .
Jointe au téléphone par une juriste s'occupant de mon cas , une personne responsable au " pôle de la nationalité française " n'a pas hésité à déclarer qu'" on a accordé un peu trop facilement la nationalité française ces dernières décennies " .
Quant à l'effet politique de cette loi , comment ne pas voir qu'il est destructeur ?
Attendant mon tour à la préfecture , j'ai eu le loisir de parler avec mon voisin , français comme moi .
Cet homme d'une trentaine d'années , né d'un père marocain , avait eu le malheur de renverser du café sur son passeport , qui ne passait plus au scanner des contrôles aux aéroports .
Il revenait pour la troisième fois à la préfecture .
Quand ce fut son tour , le ton monta vite entre lui et l'employée :
" Non , monsieur , ce n'est pas à cause de votre nom , c'est la même chose pour tous les Français ! " , se mit à crier celle - ci .
L'homme dut repartir bredouille , abasourdi .
Comment ne pas voir que l'application mécanique de cette loi , dans les faits , remet en cause , chez certains , leur appartenance à la nation dans ce que celle - ci a de plus viscéral ?
Comment ne pas voir qu'elle a pour effet de créer une discrimination artificielle entre des Français qui seraient de première catégorie , à deux parents nés en France , et d'autres de seconde catégorie , qui se trouvent frappés de suspicion , et auxquels il appartient d'apporter la preuve qu'ils sont bien français ?
En droit pénal , il existe une présomption d'innocence .
Pourquoi , en droit civil , existe - t - il depuis 2005 une présomption d'usurpation de nationalité envers certains Français ?
Si l'Etat conteste votre nationalité , c'est à lui d'apporter la preuve qu'il s'est trompé en vous la décernant , et non l'inverse .
Dernière question : la loi de 2005 prévoit des exceptions .
C'est ce qu'on appelle " la preuve par la possession d'état de Français " .
En clair , s'il est avéré que votre père ou votre mère ont été français " de façon constante " , la loi permet à l'administration de vous délivrer , à titre exceptionnel , un titre d'identité " sécurisé " .
Interrogé par des députés de l'opposition comme de la majorité sur cette question , le ministère de l'intérieur semble encourager ces exceptions et des circulaires rappellent aux fonctionnaires qu'ils peuvent user d'un droit d'appréciation personnel et faire preuve de souplesse et de compréhension .
Dans les faits , les administrations n'appliquent pas ces recommandations .
Elles se montrent d'une rigidité inflexible .
Cela mène à une impasse injustifiable .
Que cette impasse résulte de la répugnance de tout fonctionnaire à prendre une décision qui le singularise et risque de créer des remous n'est en rien une circonstance atténuante .
Je la trouve même aggravante .
Pourquoi ce double langage hypocrite ?
Je n'ai pas la réponse .
Mais je ne peux tolérer de vivre dans un pays où l'on pratique , vis -à - vis d'une certaine catégorie de citoyens , arbitrairement désignée , une forme de suspicion .
Dans les faits , cela équivaut à une forme inédite de ségrégation .
Il ne reste donc qu'une solution : faire amender cette loi .
Je ne peux pas croire qu'un seul des députés et sénateurs , de tous bords politiques , qui ont voté ce texte ait souhaité instaurer une situation aussi inique au seul nom de la " sécurisation " des passeports .
Je ne doute pas qu'ils auront à coeur de la corriger .

The ancient text shown in this drawing was discovered on a shard of pottery in Israel , and turned out to be the earliest known example of Hebrew writing .
Scientists have discovered the earliest known Hebrew writing — an inscription dating from the 10th century B.C. , during the period of King David 's reign .
The breakthrough could mean that portions of the Bible were written centuries earlier than previously thought .
( The Bible 's Old Testament is thought to have been first written down in an ancient form of Hebrew . )
Until now , many scholars have held that the Hebrew Bible originated in the 6th century B.C. , because Hebrew writing was thought to stretch back no further .
But the newly deciphered Hebrew text is about four centuries older , scientists announced this month .
" It indicates that the Kingdom of Israel already existed in the 10th century BCE and that at least some of the biblical texts were written hundreds of years before the dates presented in current research , " said Gershon Galil , a professor of Biblical Studies at the University of Haifa in Israel , who deciphered the ancient text .
BCE stands for " before common era , " and is equivalent to B.C. , or before Christ .
The writing was discovered more than a year ago on a pottery shard dug up during excavations at Khirbet Qeiyafa , near Israel 's Elah valley .
The excavations were carried out by archaeologist Yosef Garfinkel of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem .
At first , scientists could not tell if the writing was Hebrew or some other local language .
Finally , Galil was able to decipher the text .
He identified words particular to the Hebrew language and content specific to Hebrew culture to prove that the writing was , in fact , Hebrew .
" It uses verbs that were characteristic of Hebrew , such as asah ( ' did ' ) and avad ( ' worked ' ) , which were rarely used in other regional languages , " Galil said .
" Particular words that appear in the text , such as almanah ( ' widow ' ) are specific to Hebrew and are written differently in other local languages . "
The ancient text is written in ink on a trapezoid - shaped piece of pottery about 6 inches by 6.5 inches ( 15 cm by 16.5 cm ) .
It appears to be a social statement about how people should treat slaves , widows and orphans .
In English , it reads ( by numbered line ) :
1 ' you shall not do [ it ] , but worship the [ Lord ] .
2 ' Judge the sla[ve ] and the wid[ow ] / Judge the orph [ an ] 3 ' [ and ] the stranger .
[ Pl ] ead for the infant / plead for the po[or and ] 4 ' the widow .
Rehabilitate [ the poor ] at the hands of the king .
5 ' Protect the po[or and ] the slave / [ supp ] ort the stranger .
The content , which has some missing letters , is similar to some Biblical scriptures , such as Isaiah 1:17 , Psalms 72:3 , and Exodus 23:3 , but does not appear to be copied from any Biblical text .

The electric vehicle market is growing rapidly .
2018 saw record numbers of new registrations in December alone , with over 65,000 EV ’s purchased .
We normally associate electric vehicles with mid-range manufacturers such as Nissan , but luxury manufacturers are now entering the market themselves .
Grange vehicles , who offer the stunning Jaguar E - Pace , are taking a look at five of the best luxury electric cars on the market today .
1 ) Tesla Model S
Tesla is a household name when it comes to EV ’s and the Model S is world famous .
According to Tesla ’s official site , the company is ‘ accelerating the world ’s transition to sustainable energy .
The Model S offers a hugely impressive 370 - miles range and its Dual Motor All - Wheel Drive makes it a perfect drive in all weather conditions .
Filled with an abundance of cutting - edge technology and an extremely spacious seating plan , this vehicle is the epitome of luxury .
2 ) Jaguar I - Pace
The Jaguar logo is instantly recognizable all over the world .
Synonymous with great design , Jaguar is a brand that commands respect .
Known for its power , the Jaguar may not be the first to roll off the tongue when you think about electric vehicles .
However , the Jaguar I - Pace offers a superb 0 - 60 mph in 4.5 seconds and offers up to 292 miles WLTP cycle .
With amazing weight distribution , its electric motors deliver 696 Nm of instant torque and sports car agility .
The multi-award - winning model was named 2019 World Green Car and 2019 World Car Design of the Year at this year ’s World Car Awards .
You can build the car to your own spec , or if you want a more budget - friendly model , a used Jaguar may be the better option .
3 ) Aston Martin Rapide E
The battery - powered Aston Martin Rapide E is perfect ( if you have a spare £ 250,000 ) !
Replacing the 552 bhp 6.0 - litre , V12 found in the engine bay of the Rapide S is a battery packing 800 volts and a 65 khw capacity which will allow the equivalent of 602 bhp .
With a range of up to 310 miles , this car wo n’t see you stuck as is so often the presumption ( albeit it an archaic presumption ) .
It will feature two electric motors which will drive a rear wheel each via an Xtract - developed transmission .
4 ) Range Rover P400e
Although the P400e is n’t fully electric , the hybrid offers all of the benefits of an EV combined with the off - road abilities of Range Rover .
It was first unveiled at the Los Angeles Auto Show last year .
It can be driven in parallel hybrid mode , which combines both petrol and electric and is the default driving mode , or EV mode , which is perfect for zero emission journeys .
It symbolizes the shift from petrol and diesel vehicles to electric , with Jaguar Land Rover to offer an electrified option by next year .
5 ) Porsche Taycan
In 2015 , Porsche revealed it ’s first electric car concept , the Mission E but now the full production version has hit the dealerships .
The Taycan is set to be a highly premium electric car that ’s set to rival Tesla ’s Model S.
It ’s set to be unveiled at this year ’s Frankfurt Motor Show and is to lead the way for Porsche ’s attack on the electric vehicle sector , with the likes of the Macan to be transformed into a fully electric offering .
The Taycan ’s capabilities will see it able to reach 62 mph in under 3.5 seconds and reach a maximum speed of 155 m ph .
The move wo n’t allow Porsche to lose its roots however , according to Oliver Blume , chairman of the Porsche executive board .
He said : “ We are resolutely taking on the challenge of electric mobility .
Even with solely battery - powered sports cars , Porsche is remaining true to its philosophy and offering our customers the sportiest and technologically most sophisticated model in this market segment . ”
The success of the electric vehicle market will undoubtedly revolutionize the automotive industry as a whole .
Additionally , an increase in related services such as EV charging from suppliers such as Northern Powergrid has meant that the market can continue to grow .
It ’s clear that all car manufacturers , no matter what their status , have electric vehicles firmly in their sights .
As the concept becomes more popular , prices will likely decrease and technology will continue to improve .
Just as regulators , lawmakers and all forms of financial oversight boards are talking about new regulations to guard against mortgage fraud and another mortgage meltdown , there appears to be yet a new mortgage fraud out there today , allegedly perpetuated by agents of , yes , the big banks .
I was first alerted to this by Jeremy Brandt , the CEO of several companies that bring short sale agents , investors and sellers together .
His companies include 1800 CashOffer , HomeFlux.com and FastHomeOffer.com .
Brandt has a huge network of short sale real estate agents , and over the past several months he 's been receiving all kinds of questions and complaints about trouble with second lien holders .
As we all know , during the housing boom , millions of Americans pulled cash out of their homes in the form of home equity loans and lines of credit .
They also used " piggy back " loans in order to get even lower interest rates on their primary mortgages .
Now , many of the borrowers in trouble , and many who are so far underwater on their loans that they do n't qualify for any refi or modification , are choosing short sales as a way out .
( Short sales are when the lender allows the home to be sold for less than the value of the loan ) .
About 12 percent of all home sales by the end of 2009 were short sales , according to the National Association of Realtors .
In order for a short sale with two loans to happen , the second lien holder has to drop the lien .
If they do n't , and there 's no short sale , the home goes to foreclosure and the first lien holder gets the house because second liens are subordinated debt to the primary loan .
In short , the second lien holder gets nothing .
In order to get the second lien holder to drop the lien , the first lien holder generally negotiates some partial payment to the second lien holder .
The second lien holder does n't have to agree , but more and more are doing so .
That 's all legal .
But here 's what 's not legal and what 's apparently happening quite often recently .
Since many second lien holders are getting very little , they are now allegedly requesting money on the side from either real estate agents or the buyers in the short sale .
When I say " on the side , " I mean in cash , off the HUD settlement statements , so the first lien holder does n't see it .
The Danish Parliament has agreed to ditch some Microsoft - based software in favour of the ODF standard from April next year .
According to version2.dk and courtesy of politken.dk , parliamentary parties decided - after four years of deliberation - to use the Open Document Format in all Danish state office documents .
“ My ambition is that in the future we will only communicate using open standards , ” Science Minister Helge Sander of moderate right wing party Venstre told Denmark ’s Parliament .
The decision to axe Microsoft ’s Office document formats won cross -party support .
“ We believe that open source is the way forward and should replace the patent attitudes that we currently have , ” said the Unity List ’s Per Clausen .
For the time being , only national institutions will make the switch to ODF .
Regional bodies will make the shift at a later , yet to be announced , date .
In February 2008 a Danish Unix user group - DKUUG - lashed out at Microsoft 's Office 2007 file format , by filing a formal complaint to the European Union .
It claimed MS was in breach of the EC Treaty article 81 on unfair competition over the Danish state mandatory regulation of ECMA - approved OOXML .
“ DKUUG asks the commission to make a decision to make void the part on OOXML of the Danish regulation on mandatory standards [ ECMA - 376 or ISO / IEC DIS 29500 ] OOXML , so that other products can participate in the competition on office software for the Danish state , " it demanded at the time .
“ This is in line with regulations in other countries , for example in the federal Belgium , or Norway , where only the ISO standard ODF is specified for the subject . ”
DKUUG vice chair Keld Simonsen claimed that the Danish state was allowing Redmond to maintain a private monopoly in Denmark , even though OOXML did n’t fulfill the “ requirements on openness ” that Parliament agreed upon in its decision B103 in 2006 .
“ A document standards decision may not matter to you today , but as someone who relies on constant access to editable documents , spreadsheets and presentations , it may matter immensely in the near future , ” said Bhorat .
Of course , those comments came at a time when Microsoft was still battling to gain ISO approval of the OOXML format .
By April that year , MS finally sealed a deal to get OOXML recognised as an international standard alongside ODF .
Nearly two years on , and Denmark 's parliamentary members have blown a big fat raspberry in Microsoft 's " we 're interoperable " face . ®
A team of scientists at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences and the National Institutes of Health has piloted psychotherapy treatment to prevent excessive weight gain in teenager girls deemed ' at risk ' for obesity .
The study , published in the International Journal of Eating Disorders , found that girls who participated in Interpersonal Psychotherapy may be better able to prevent their BMI from increasing over the course of a year compared to girls who took traditional health education classes .
The research team , led by Dr. Marian Tanofsky - Kraff , aimed to target youth considered at high - risk of obesity because they were already above average weight and because they reported episodes of loss of control eating or binge eating .
Both higher weight and loss of control eating are linked to excessive weight gain in children and young people .
Interpersonal Psychotherapy ( IPT ) focuses on improving interpersonal relationships by targeting the underlying social and interpersonal difficulties that influence individuals to engage in loss of control eating .
The therapy has been shown to help both depressed adults and youth and , also to help tackle binge eating in adults .
In adult studies , decreases in binge eating may lead to modest weight loss and less regain over time compared with those who continue to binge eat .
Thus , decreasing binge eating is an attractive target for preventing obesity in at - risk youth .
" We conducted this study to address the dramatically increased rates of obesity in children and adolescents , " said Tanofsky - Kraff .
" ' IPT for Binge Eating Disorder is based on the assumption that binge eating occurs in response to poor social functioning and the consequent negative moods . "
Thirty - eight girls , some with and others without loss of control eating , were selected for the trial , and were randomly designated to attend either IPT sessions or standard health education classes currently taught to teenagers .
All the girls completed their courses and received follow up visits for the next year .
Girls who undertook IPT were more likely to stabilize or reduce their BMI than those who received the health education classes .
BMI is a measure of body weight corrected for height , and is used to determine appropriate weight gain in growing children and teens .
" This pilot study has demonstrated that IPT is both feasible and acceptable to adolescent girls at risk of adult obesity and suggests that it may prevent excess weight gain , " concludes Tanofsky - Kraff .
" If IPT proves to be effective , we may be able to prevent not only excessive weight gain , but the development of related adverse health conditions in a subset of susceptible youth . "
GEORGETOWN — Charlie Toups is Colorado ’s ultimate ski bum and a relic of a fading era .
Since 1976 , the 63 - year - old has skied 120 days a season , shoveling snow and doing other odd jobs for a few bucks and skiing every day .
What affirms his title as ski bum supreme is the fact that at night he retired to his car , parked close to the lifts .
But now Toups ’ brawny 6 - foot frame is wedged in a jail cell in Georgetown , imprisoned for the past 57 days on misdemeanor federal charges of camping on public land , possessing marijuana and assaulting a Forest Service officer .
He could walk free with time served if he admitted his guilt .
But Toups wo n’t do that .
“ I ’ve lived this life for 33 years and now all the sudden I ’m supposed to admit I ’m guilty ?
I ca n’t do that , ” he said from jail last week .
“ I do n’t know what changed after the Forest Service tolerated me for all these years .
I thought we were just respecting each other .
Let me ask you , is it snowing ? ”
Toups ’ tale is the embodiment of ski bumdom .
Since the 1970s , he has bummed at Mammoth in California , Snowbird in Utah , Oregon ’s Mount Hood , Aspen Highlands and all the ski areas in Summit County .
His home — for nearly a decade — was a Volks wagen Beetle , the passenger seat torn out so he could sleep .
“ He had a little tunnel down to it like a snow cave , ” said Halsted Morris , a longtime Loveland skier .
“ He was the real deal ”
After a few years at Loveland , where Toups worked in the ski area ’s kitchen , he moved on to Aspen Highlands , where every morning he stomped steep snow as part of the ski patrol ’s avalanche mitigation .
A few hours bootpacking earned him a day ’s lift ticket .
He haunted the mid-mountain cafeteria , munching food from abandoned trays .
He stocked shelves at the local grocery at night .
“ He was the epitome of ski bums .
He was the real deal , ” said Mike Tierney , a veteran ski patroller at Highlands .
“ He was just a totally eccentric individual who was here to ski .
We do n’t see those kinds of ski bums anymore .
And that ’s kind of sad . ”
Mac Smith , the longtime director of the Highlands patrol , spent a few seasons in the 1970s camping at the base of the ski hill .
He remembers Toups with fondness , as a “ gentle giant . ”
“ He was a really intelligent person , ” Smith said .
“ He just had a different drum beat , and he followed it . ”
Toups first ran afoul of the Forest Service , which prohibits living on public land , in 2007 when he was back living in Loveland in the ski area parking lot .
So , he fired up his most recent home — a tired Ford , its hood and doors closed with ropes , its bed topped with a dilapidated camper .
He rattled over Loveland Pass , towing a trailer full of old skis and a rusting Honda motorcycle .
He landed in the Colorado Department of Transportation utility lot on Forest Service land next to Arapahoe Basin ski area .
On Nov. 14 , five months after a Forest Service cop issued Toups a ticket for camping on public land in the CDOT lot , they came for him with a warrant for his arrest .
Toups had missed two mailed summonses , sent to an Aspen - area post office box he never visited .
Forest Service law enforcement officer Jill Wick and a Summit County sheriff ’s deputy found him , naturally , skiing .
He grew irate when told he was under arrest .
At a Nov. 20 detention hearing in federal court in Grand Junction , Forest Service special agent Travis Lunders testified that Toups “ became actively resistant in the sense that he tensed up . ”
“ Officer Wick described Mr. Toups as shrugging his shoulders , bending his arms , flexing and putting his knuckles together near his stomach , at which time both officers took Mr. Toups to the ground , the snow covered ground , and placed him face - first down , ” Lunders testified , according to court transcripts .
Toups said he was trying to make a call on his cellphone before he was taken away .
He said he was under the impression he had a “ gentleman ’s agreement ” to stay near the CDOT utility shed , based upon his camaraderie with CDOT employees .
When officers searched his pockets , according to Lunders ’ testimony , they found “ misdemeanor level paraphernalia and marijuana . ”
The day after Toups ’ arrest , Lunders testified that Wick suffered a “ post traumatic condition or disorder . . . that caused her heart to enlarge after the arrest . ”
Doctors later told her , Lunders testified , “ she did not suffer a heart attack and her arteries were in fact good . ”
Lunders wrote in his report detailing the arrest : “ At no time was she ( Wick ) struck by Toups , nor did he attempt to kick , punch or strike either officer . ”
Still ,
Toups is facing charges that he “ did forcibly assault , resist , oppose , impede , intimidate and interfere with an officer . ”
Add the illegal camping and marijuana charge , and Toups is facing more than two years in federal prison and $ 250,000 in fines .
Toups is scheduled for a jury trial in Denver District Court this month .
Toups ’ attorney declined to comment , but Jeff Dorschner , spokesman for the Colorado U.S. attorney , said the charges are appropriate , “ given his conduct . ”
“ Danger to this community ”
U.S. Attorney Michelle Heldmyer is prosecuting the case against Toups .
At his November detention hearing , she argued successfully that Toups be held without bail on three misdemeanor counts .
“ This defendant has shown he is dangerous , that he has no place to go , ” she said .
“ Being that he — all he wants to do is apparently ski and not work and live this alternative lifestyle , makes him a prime candidate for flight , not to mention he has exhibited himself now as a danger to this community , openly hostile to the government . ”
Calling Toups “ hostile ” and “ dangerous ” dismays Toups ’ friends .
“ Charlie has been harassed most of his life , but even though he can be a bit of a curmudgeon , he ’s a really sweet guy , ” said Michael Cleveland , who has known Toups for 30 years and paid $ 1,700 to get his friend ’s truck out of impoundment .
“ He ’s just a ski bum who never grew up . ”
Toups proudly explains that in all his years of homelessness , he has never collected any public money .
In the past three years , he ’s earned about $ 20,000 , mostly from shoveling snow and moving furniture .
Still , he admits he has struggled to keep jobs .
“ I guess I have a personality that conflicts with some tenets of management , ” he said .
Decades of negotiating ( or violating , say the feds ) federal , state , county and municipal boundaries and rules has taken its toll on Toups .
When he parked near A Basin in 2007 , he was at the end of his rope .
He needed to be close to his work shoveling — where his boss , Bob Towne , said he never missed a day in two winters .
He could no longer keep his truck running to move it daily .
And he needed to be close to his beloved ski hill .
“ I ski because it is a portal , a gateway to health , ” he said , noting that in all his years on skis he has never been injured .
“ But when I moved into that lot , I was desperate .
Sure , I may live like a bum , but I do not behave like one . ”

Glenn Greenwald has this to say about the Senate healthcare bill now that the public option and the Medicare buy - in have been stripped out :
In essence , this reinforces all of the worst dynamics of Washington .
The insurance industry gets the biggest bonanza imaginable in the form of tens of millions of coerced new customers without any competition or other price controls .
Progressive opinion - makers , as always , signaled that they can and should be ignored [… ]
Most of this was negotiated and effectuated in complete secrecy , in the sleazy sewers populated by lobbyists , industry insiders , and their wholly - owned pawns in the Congress .
And highly unpopular , industry - serving legislation is passed off as “ centrist , ” the noblest Beltway value .
This is pretty much correct .
The individual mandate was a way of getting support from the insurance industry .
The backroom deal with Big Pharma was a way of getting support from the drug industry .
The change in Medicare reimbursement rates was a way of getting support from doctors .
The gutting of the Medicare commission was a way of getting support from hospitals .
Provisions related to biologics , home healthcare , and the prescription drug doughnut hole were a way of getting the support of AARP .
Any honest observer has to concede that all this makes it hard to defend the final product .
Except for one thing : in 1994 Bill Clinton failed to get the support of these groups and healthcare reform died .
If Obama had done the same , it would have died this year too .
There ’s really just no question about this .
It ’s ugly , but that ’s the real world .
Which brings me to the place where I think Glenn is wrong :
Looked at from the narrow lens of health care policy , there is a reasonable debate to be had among reform advocates over whether this bill is a net benefit or a net harm .
From any kind of progressive point of view it ’s hard to see how you could seriously argue that the current bill is a net harm .
Sure , it makes compromises to powerful interests that are hard to swallow .
But that ’s why they ’re called powerful interests : because they can kill your legislative priorities if you do n’t assuage them .
In return , though , the Senate bill brings down insurance rates , expands Medicaid , offers the prospect of moderately priced insurance to tens of millions of the uninsured , forces insurers to take you on even if you have a chronic pre-existing condition , mandates minimum levels of coverage , and takes several small but important steps toward reducing the future growth of healthcare costs .
That ’s an enormous advance for the progressive agenda .
There ’s an alternate universe out there in which you could get all this stuff without compromise based on the sheer force of progressive arguments .
Sadly , it ’s not this universe .
I sure hope we do n’t have to learn this the hard way yet again .
However many thousands of dollars Conan paid lawyers to negotiate his " Tonight Show " deal , it was n't enough .
Or it was way too much .
Depending on how you want to look at it .
Conan 's lawyers apparently forgot to specify a time slot for " The Tonight Show , " never imagining , perhaps , that NBC would be so boneheaded as to move a show that has been in the same slot for decades .
Thus , Conan can't bolt for another network without voiding his contract and passing on the tens of millions of dollars he would otherwise be owed :
[ Conan 's ] contract , NBC is arguing , guaranteed Mr. O’Brien would be installed as host of “ The Tonight Show ” — and unlike many other deals for late - night stars , Mr. O’Brien ’s contract contains no specific language about the time period the show would occupy , NBC executives said .
( Bill Carter , NYT )
In other words , NBC could move " The Tonight Show " to the Twilight Zone and Conan would n't be able to argue breach of contract .
So that means that Conan can't storm off the set and go to FOX unless he wants to forgo the $ 45 million NBC otherwise owes him ( or whatever portion of it still applies ) .
So what should Conan do ?
Stay put until the end of the contract .
Make the " Tonight Show " whatever he wants it to be .
Aim to rule the DVR and online video world like Jon Stewart .
Ignore Leno , Jeff Zucker , and the brass at NBC .
Get paid $ 10 + million a year to do exactly what he wants to do for two years and THEN go to FOX .
This is wrong on so many levels it 's really hard to know where to start .
News has reached us that the UK regional heats are now open for the Miss Earth Girls 2010 beauty pageant .
I kid you not .
Try not to retch as you read through this press release :
Applications are now invited from beautiful , passionate eco-warring young women across the UK to enter the 2010 Miss Earth Girls contest .
Between January and April as many girls aged between 18 - 26 who combine a love for the planet with beauty , poise and grace , are encouraged to enter their regional heats online ...
Modernising the traditional focus of the " beauty pageant " and bringing beauty contests firmly into the 21st century , the main focus of the event is to empower the entrants to focus on and promote environmental awareness .
During their participation , the girls plant trees , raise funds for their own chosen charities , attend environmental activities , act as spokeswomen for environmental thoughts and educate people on green issues , in particular the three Rs ( reduce , reuse and recycle ) .
There 's more to this , but I 'm thinking of your health .
The regional grand finalists – who will be " intelligent , forward - thinking women proud to ' Be The Change ' Gandhi spoke about " - will be announced on June 5 , World Environment Day , and four Miss Earth winners representing England , Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland will be revealed in August .
All four will then go on to compete in the international final in the Philippines at an " ecovillage beach resort " in November to have the chance to be crowned the " ultimate Miss Earth 2010 " .
If you have taken leave of your senses and are , in fact , tempted to apply , then you must first consider the rather demanding " eligibility requirements " .
First , you must have " NEVER BEEN MARRIED " .
( The organiser Carousel Productions 's block capitals , not mine . )
You must also be single , have been " born female " and must have " NEVER " given birth before .
But wait , that 's not all .
You must also be " between the ages of 18 and 26 " - although there is a separate " teen contest " for 13 - 17 year olds .
There is a minimum height of 5 feet 5 inches .
Finally , you must possess a " good character " .
Congratulations , if you tick all those boxes .
But please do be aware of the stiff competition .
Last year , Kayleigh O'Reilly , our representative from Northern Ireland , made it to the final 16 , but the ultimate crown went to Larissa Ramos , 20 - year - old biology student from Brazil .
There are some special prizes , though , for those that do n't manage to win the title .
Here 's a short selection : Best in National Costume , Best in Swimsuit , Best in Long Gown , Best in Eco - Bag Design Wear , and Best in Use of Indigenous Products Wear .
There 's also the rather mysterious " Placenta Award " , but it 's probably best if we leave it at that .
So , how exactly does a beauty pageant help to protect the environment ?
The organisers say that by " setting a legacy of beauty and responsibility , the candidates and the reigning beauty queen of Miss Earth uphold the preservation of our environment and continue to campaign for the protection of Mother Earth " .
Hmmmm .
I 'm not aware of a rival Mr Earth contest , but doubt I would be eligible anyway given the exacting criteria demanded of the " girls " .
For a start , I have always found it a challenge " combining a love for the planet with beauty , poise and grace " .
Alas , that probably rules me out straight away .
Seriously , though , they may well be staging Miss Earth , but are the organisers of this " eco beauty pageant " really of this planet ?
Privacy campaigners are continuing a legal challenge against random laptop border searches by US customs amid concerns there may be a racial bias in those delayed and inconvenienced by stop and search powers introduced as part of the war on terror .
The ACLU also argues that searches of mobile phones by US border agents in the absence of any reason to be suspicious also pose a unwarranted invasion of privacy while delivering few tangible benefits .
Customs and Border Protection agents searched over 1,500 electronic devices at the US border over a period of nine months between October 2008 and June 2009 , according to documents obtained by the ACLU as part of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit and published on Thursday .
The documents also show that customs ( CBP ) agents forwarded electronic files found on travelers ' devices to other agencies almost 300 times .
Some of the travelers inconvenienced by these searches complained that they ceaselessly accused of wrongdoing or otherwise embarrassed or inconvenienced by the searches , which agents are not obliged to justify under tightened regulations in force since July 2008 .
The policy was started by the Bush administration and continued by the Obama government .
THE ACLU is concerned that travelers have been left unable to carry medical records , financial information , and photos when they travel without the possibility of government inspection for no good reason .
" The CBP 's ability to take and view the personal files of anyone passing through U.S. borders without any suspicion not only presents an inconvenience to travelers , but also fails to protect sensitive personal information that is commonly stored in laptops and cell phones , " said Catherine Crump , staff attorney with the ACLU First Amendment Working Group .
" Fundamental constitutional problems with this policy exist , and must be addressed . "
" The government has a legitimate interest in searching electronic devices where there is individualized suspicion of wrongdoing , but CBP 's policy allows officials to exercise their power arbitrarily , " she added .
The ACLU is concerned there may be an element of racial profiling in those selected for data searches .
CBP promised to issue a civil liberties assessment of the policy within six months but failed to make that deadline and is yet to issue a report . ®
An Aggregation of Nincompoops
In 1939 , Joseph Kennedy , then serving as U.S. ambassador to Britain , petitioned President Franklin D. Roosevelt to restrict foreign screenings of Frank Capra ’s Mr. Smith Goes to Washington on the grounds that the film was " an indictment of our government " that " will cause our allies to view us in an unfavorable light . "
Capra ’s depiction of a Washington dominated by special interests and toadying political hacks also angered Senate Majority Leader Alben Barkley , a Democrat from Kentucky , who complained that the movie presented a " grotesque distortion " of Washington politics that suggested that the Senate was nothing more than an " aggregation of nincompoops . "
So not much has changed in the last 70 years .
These days , mind you , there ’s no need for a latterday Capra to come to Washington — not when the Senate ’s tragicomedy is broadcast to the world daily by CNN and the Internet .
International observers of Washington politics gaze with wonder at a system that produces so much drama from so little legislation and a republic in which even winning a contest by a landslide can’t guarantee success .
American elections used to have consequences .
Now , they merely determine which party the public wants to hate next .
That ’s one explanation for the present sorry state of affairs , in which the party occupying the White House and controlling both houses of Congress cannot figure out how to pass a health - care bill that has been the progressive Holy Grail since the time of Harry Truman .
Of course , the other obvious conclusion to be drawn is that the Democratic Party simply is n’t very good at politics .
If it ’s too easy to pass legislation in many countries ( including Britain ) , it seems too difficult to get anything done in Washington , with the 60 - vote hurdle now the rule rather than the exception .
Excepting the Democrats ’ rare , tenuous , and wasted supermajority , power generally resides , however improbably or quixotically , with the minority party , which attempts and often succeeds in stymieing every majority initiative .
Minority obstructionism , of course , can be principled .
But its chief attraction is that it absolves the opposition of responsibility for anything while making the majority look , well , stupid .
As former British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin once said of the press , this kind of " power without responsibility " has been " the prerogative of the harlot throughout the ages . "
And Democratic complaints that " It ’s the system , stupid " are n’t likely to impress too many voters — who , rather rightfully , despise Congress no matter who runs it — even if , by any reasonable measure , the system is dysfunctional and perverse .
So what a difference a single vote makes !
The lamentations that followed Martha Coakley ’s stunning defeat in Massachusetts were heard on the far side of the Atlantic as well , as health care and cap - and - trade legislation disappeared with a 2 percent drift in the Senate tides .
All of a sudden it seems as though " Yes We Can " actually means " Well , All Things Being Equal , We ’d Like to Have a Go , but , Actually , It ’s Terribly Complicated and Difficult .
So We Won’t . "
This has consequences that extend beyond the useful reminder that , despite the promise of his rhetoric , the U.S. president is constrained by both the constitution and the feebleness , even the ineptitude , of his Democratic colleagues .
President Barack Obama deliberately pitched himself as a leader for the post - globalization age .
So many promises were made on so many fronts that , inevitably , many of them would be broken or ignored or , as now seems increasingly probable , chewed up by the legislative process .
No wonder Europeans are unimpressed by this president and his inability to deliver upon the promises he made , not merely to American voters , but to the entire planet .
Campaign aspirations are always snuffed out by brutal political reality .
But rarely has the contrast between campaign poetry and governing prose been quite so clear .
Nowhere has this been more the case than on climate change and the fate of the prison at Guantánamo Bay .
European leaders had hoped for more from Obama at the Copenhagen conference on climate change .
Hamstrung by a skeptical Congress , Obama did his best .
But it was a best that satisfied few people and , once more , reminded Europeans that the U.S. president is less powerful , in terms of domestic politics , than any prime minister .
It was a reminder of the Yankee separation of powers .
Only the most cockeyed optimist would bet on cap - and - trade legislation passing this year .
Something similar might be said of Guantánamo .
Obama ’s promise to close the camp was the clearest possible signal that the new administration would break with its predecessor .
Yet a year has passed and Gitmo remains open .
Again , political realities — dictated by hysterical , bed - wetting congressmen who argue , with straight faces and empty minds , that the United States cannot safely imprison the Guantánamo inmates on American soil proper — have stalled progress .
But at some point one begins to wonder what the point of having a majority is if it is n’t used for anything .
Because , more than anything else , it was the promise to close Gitmo that earned the president his Nobel Peace Prize , the failure to solve the detainee problem now makes that award seem even more preposterously premature .
Much worse than making the president seem weak , it risks making him seem ridiculous .
While politicians can survive and even , on rare occasions , embrace disapproval , mockery and ridicule are much more poisonous .
Another irritant , imposed upon the rest of the international community by the world ’s most ridiculous deliberative body , is the lack of U.S. diplomatic representation in key spots .
Brazil went nearly a year without an ambassador because of a senatorial hold , while important positions at the World Trade Organization and other bodies still remain unfilled .
It ’s a measure , mind you , of how Washington has changed .
In the Capra film , Jefferson Smith used the filibuster to heroically resist the system .
Today , the mere threat of a filibuster is enough to persuade the majority party to run screaming for the hills .
Right now , however , the Democrats might want to take a cue from Smith ’s epic speech in the movie : " You think I ’m licked .
You all think I ’m licked .
Well , I ’m not licked .
And I ’m going to stay right here and fight for this lost cause .
Even if the room gets filled with lies like these , and the Taylors and all their armies come marching into this place . "
Unless they do show some spine , it ’s hard to see what they ’re for — and far less why voters should bother endorsing Democratic candidates in November .
The system may be ridiculous , but it is what it is — and when managed correctly , things can be changed and done .
The game remains the game .
Unless the Democratic Party realizes that , then it can hardly complain if voters — and the international community — decide it ’s a lost cause .
How New Jersey ’s Gays Get F’d When They Try to Divorce
It ’s not just that New Jersey ’s gays want full marriage rights .
It ’s that they also want full divorce rights .
Because as if ending a marriage were n’t difficult enough with all that squabbling over stock portfolios , child custody , and the house on Martha ’s Vineyard , splitting up a “ civil union ” adds a whole new level of legal grey areas .
That ’s because judges , who are charged with mitigating the “ dissolution ” ( and not “ divorce ” ) of civil unions , do n’t always agree on whether common divorce laws should be applied , or whether a different standard should .
But do n’t ( necessarily ) blame judges ; it ’s not like they ’ve got much precedent to go on , with just three years of legal civil unions in New Jersey .
Relays the Star - Ledger :
Lawyers familiar with the issue also say it ’s harder to divvy up assets or assign alimony because there ’s virtually no case precedent for ending civil unions and divorce precedents are not always applied to dissolutions .
Sorting out the unions then can take longer and cost clients more than it would if they were ending a traditional marriage .
“ If there ’s some question , for example , about equitable distribution or alimony or some other aspect of getting a divorce , the cases that have determined these types of things in New Jersey , in which the judges rely on and the attorneys rely on for making these arguments , appear to apply only to marriage , ” Hyland said .
“ But they really apply to marriage and civil unions . ”
In the absence of legal gay marriage in New Jersey , Hyland said , civil unions were supposed to be the same as marriage without calling them that .
Which means even the attorneys handling the cases sometimes do n’t know what strategy to take up .
Lawyers say the legal confusion surrounding civil unions — and how to end them — has not abated in the nearly three years since the law was established .
Some say the mix - up comes from the fact that different language is used to describe marriages / divorces and civil unions / dissolutions .
Hyland says some lawyers are not aware that divorce law is supposed to apply to civil unions , and he sometimes receives calls from family lawyers asking him for advice on how to litigate civil union breakups .
Civil union law is further complicated in New Jersey because federal laws do not recognize them .
Lawyers say they sometimes have to hire accountants because couples file their tax returns jointly in the state but separately at the federal level .
Under a federal exemption , divorced heterosexual couples can split pension benefits without tax repercussions , but gay couples cannot .
And if you ’re looking for alimony ?
Yeah , good luck with that .
“ Were you on the train ? ”
Hedy Mayer , Devora Spira , Peska Friedman and Berta Rubinsztejn felt no need to ask : which train ?
Only one train was on everyone ’s lips on Tuesday night at a Manhattan gathering of Hungarian Jews who had escaped the Holocaust .
There had been many trains to Auschwitz .
There had been only one train to life , and the four women , now all in their 80s , had been on it , along with about 1,680 others .
It was a train from Budapest that stopped for several months at the Bergen - Belsen concentration camp and finally made its way to Switzerland and salvation .
The trip was arranged in 1944 during the darkest days of the Nazi genocide by Rezso Kasztner , also known as Rudolf or Israel Kastner , a Jew who was to rescue more Jews than Oskar Schindler .
He had done this by negotiating face to face with Adolf Eichmann , the administrator of Hitler ’s Final Solution , and paying $ 1,000 a head while concealing , enemies later said , the full measure of the peril that was to claim an estimated 550,000 of Hungary ’s 825,000 Jews , and vouching at the Nuremberg trials for an SS colonel , Kurt Becher .
For this , Mr. Kasztner was shot to death in 1957 at age 51 in Tel Aviv .

For years his name was anathema .
Reviled as a Nazi collaborator whom an Israeli judge said had “ sold his soul to the devil , ” Mr. Kasztner , a journalist and official in Israel ’s ruling leftist workers party , Mapai , was denounced in court , demonized in print and spat upon on the street .
Rage against him brought down the Israeli government in 1955 and all but ignited a civil war .
His three right - wing killers were pardoned seven years into their life sentences .
Israel ’s Supreme Court later cleared him of all charges , but the stigma stuck .
His name graced no memorial walls , even at Yad Vashem , Israel ’s shrine to victims of the Shoah , although in 2007 it accepted some of his papers .
Few animals on Earth evoke more emotion or fear than the wolf .
We have been told tales of their savagery and ...
The first year of the Obama Administration is almost over , yet many mysteries surrounding the so - called “ dark side ” of the “ war on terror ” remain unsolved .
Here are ten :
Did former Vice - President Cheney know the full , clinical details of the Bush Administration ’s interrogation and detention program for terror suspects ?
Did he have a supervisory role ?
How much did President Bush know about the alleged abuse ?
Cheney has said that the former President “ knew a great deal about the program ” and “ basically authorized it . ”
Did he know , for instance , that one suspect was waterboarded a hundred and eighty - three times ?
Did he know that another died in C.I.A. custody after having been left to freeze overnight ?
If he did know , what was his reaction ?
The C.I.A. destroyed ninety - two videotapes of interrogation sessions .
What exactly was on the tapes , and why were they destroyed ?
Are there written transcripts describing what was on the tapes ?
Did the tapes document potential evidence of a crime ?
If so , did their destruction constitute obstruction of justice ?
And if so , which officials authorized the tapes ’ destruction ?
Have all the former C.I.A. prisoners been accounted for ?
Some seem not to have been sent to Guantánamo when the C.I.A. ’s black - site prisons were closed , in 2006 .
Instead , it appears they may have been sent to other countries , including Egypt , Jordan , and Libya .
If so , who were these prisoners , and where are they now ?
Who provided the “ muscle ” in the C.I.A. interrogation and detention program ?
Were the notional global “ hit squads ” authorized , or made operational ?
Were their activities fully briefed to Congress ?
Were they staffed by C.I.A. officers , Special Operations officers , private contractors , or others ?
If there were abuses , will anyone face any consequences ?
Vice - President Cheney and other defenders of “ enhanced interrogation ” techniques have insisted that coercion produced intelligence and saved lives .
Many other experts have argued that the same information or better could have been obtained by less controversial methods .
Will the public ever be able to access the record , in order to judge this on its own ?
A small handful of politically appointed lawyers during the Bush years approved many forms of prisoner abuse that would previously have been judged criminal .
Those lawyers have fanned out to teach , practice law , and , in one case , sit on the federal bench .
Will there be professional consequences for any of these lawyers ?
A report on them by the Justice Department has been pending release for the entire last year .
Why has it been so delayed ?
Several contract psychologists designed and helped to implement the C.I.A. ’s program of “ enhanced ” interrogation techniques .
Will these psychologists face professional consequences ?
They have indicated they would like to tell their story — will they ?
Who forged the “ yellowcake ” Niger documents that helped spur the U.S. into the war in Iraq ?
Who are the chief financiers of terror , and do any of them have state sponsors ?
Bonus question :
Where is Osama bin Laden ?
True to their promise , Time magazine continues to crank out stories designed to shine an informative little light on our beloved city , exposing to the world all the relevant matters that affect this embattled community .
Thanks to Time , the world will now know our full and complete story .
The world will know why we matter .
The world will know The Real Detroit .
For example …
Did you know that Sheila Cockrel , now a former Detroit City Council member , was actually “ Detroit ’s Last White City Council Member ” ?
No , seriously .
It ’s true .
I was just checking Time ’s “ Assignment Detroit ” portion of their website where all their stories about Detroit are stored , and this was the headline piece at the top of the page .
I periodically check the site just to see what the magazine ’s year - long journalistic commitment to our city is turning up so that I can be better informed about my town , and sometimes I will confess I do find some interesting pieces .
And then there are times like today when I find myself , well , simply shocked and shaken at the depth of coverage this extraordinary commitment of resources by one of America ’s leading news magazines is providing to news - starved citizens everywhere .
I mean , I had no idea .
Really ?
You mean to tell me that when Sheila Cockrel stepped down at the end of last year we lost our last white person ?
On the Council ?
But how did that happen exactly ?
Do you mean to tell me that Cockrel ’s seat was not The White Seat ?
You mean to tell me that this seat was not reserved on the Council for white folks only ?
But how in the name of God did we let this happen ?
What the hell are quotas good for ?
Granted , the list of critical issues currently confronting Detroit , if you unfolded them today , stretch from my humble little office all the way beyond the horizon of some unforeseen point in the future , but let it be said that the unforeseen extinction of the white race ( on City Council ) is without question the single most terrifying issue to threaten this city since the disappearance of the urban squirrel population .
At least I ’m pretty sure urban squirrels have disappeared .
Right ?
I mean I do n’t see them around much anymore and …
Anyway .
This is BIG NEWS folks .
BIG NEWS .
And I do n’t know about you but I am making plans as we speak to keep tabs on this historic development as it , well , develops .
Who knows , if this trend keeps up Detroit could possibly be the first city to experience a negative white population , man .
Would n’t that be deep ?
To have so few white people that the Census actually registers Detroit as having a white population of minus 10 percent ?
Wow .
I mean , who cares if the city is broke ?
Let ’s all keep our eyes on stories like this .
It ’s about Time , right ?

If you 've ever had one too many drinks during a night out , you 're probably familiar with the dreaded aftermath : the hangover .
Turns out , your liquor of choice could influence your morning headache .
A new study finds that , compared with vodka , if you down too much bourbon , you 're likely to have a worse hangover .
But when it comes to your next - day activities , it does n't matter which of the two beverages you drink , your performance is likely to be the same .
The study involved 95 participants ages 21 to 33 who were heavy drinkers , but had no history of alcohol abuse .
Their arduous task : Get drunk .
And they got paid — $ 450 , to boot !
The authors were n't simply looking at the effects of alcohol , however .
They were specifically interested in the levels of toxic substances called congeners in the alcohol .
These compounds are byproducts of alcohol fermentation , and they are partly responsible for the alcohol 's color .
Darker liquors and wines have more congeners than lighter ones — for instance , the amount of congeners in bourbon is 37 times the amount in vodka , according to the study .
" While the alcohol alone is enough to make many people feel sick the next day , these toxic natural substances can add to the ill effects as our body reacts to them , " Damaris Rohsenow , a professor at the Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies at Brown University , said in a statement .
Rohsenow and her colleagues wanted to investigate whether or not congener levels had any effect on hangover symptoms the following day , or the ability of people to perform certain tasks .
Participants consumed either vodka or bourbon mixed with caffeine - free cola on one night , until until they had drunk about the minimum amount required to induce a hangover , the researchers say .
On a separate night , the participants unknowingly drank a placebo , in this case , cola with tonic and a few drops of either bourbon or vodka in order to avoid serious suspicions that the beverage was in fact a placebo .
Once the subjects ' breath alcohol levels had reached about zero , they were asked to fill out questionnaires regarding how they felt .
They also performed tasks to measure their cognitive function , which tested the subjects ' ability to pay close attention to a task while also making rapid choices .
Not surprisingly , alcoholic drinks made people feel more hung - over than the placebo , but bourbon made people feel even worse than vodka , Rohsenow said .
And while alcohol also impaired the subjects ' performance on the cognitive tasks , " they did no worse after bourbon than after vodka , " Rohsenow said .
The study also looked at the effects of alcohol on sleep , and found that although alcohol did disrupt sleep , people who drank bourbon slept just as well as those who drank vodka .
" This means that bourbon 's greater effects on hangover are not due to it having greater effects on sleep , " Rohsenow said .
The results will be published in the March 2010 issue of the journal Alcoholism : Clinical & Experimental Research .
The study was funded by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism , and the National Center for Research Resources , among others .
A seam of coal formed 250 million years ago during the worst extinction event on record appears to be responsible for the anomalously high lung cancer death rates among women in the rural Chinese county of Xuan Wei in Yunnan Province .
It 's long been known that the lung cancer mortality rates in the region were the worst in the world among female nonsmokers and some anomaly in the coal had been suspected .
Lung cancer mortality in the region is up to 20 times the Chinese average .
But it 's only in recent years that scientists have focused in on silica in the form of very fine quartz as the mineral that makes burning the stuff so deadly .
Now , in a paper published in December in Environmental Science and Technology , Chinese , British and American researchers have proposed a link between the silica in the coal and the massive event that nearly wiped out life at the Permian - Triassic boundary .
" What we 're saying is that the geologic and climatic events that nearly extinguished life 250 million years ago is still having an impact because its imprint is in the coals that the people are using , " said Bob Finkelman , a geologist at the University of Texas , Dallas .
" They are inhaling this material with nanoquartz that was precipitated 250 million years ago and in a sense it 's extinguishing life in the community . "
Throughout the early 20th century , the inefficient combustion of soft , bituminous coals smoked up the emerging industrial cities of the world .
Similar problems now plague the developing world , both in cities and the hinterlands , where the coal is often used for heating and cooking .
The inhalation of the particulates , trace minerals and other substances contained in smoke can lead to a variety of health complications :
The World Health Organization estimates that 1.6 million people die each year as a result of indoor air pollution .
The new study underscores the variability between coals in the world .
Some coals are particularly smoky , sooty or otherwise undesirable , while others burn cleaner .
Coals formed at different times in the earth 's history , so even though the dominant component is carbon , each seam has a very particular chemistry .
" Even when you look at coal from a small region , there 's enough variation in the properties that you can't just call it all coal and expect it to have the same health effects when you burn it , " said Donald Lucas , a physical chemist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory .
Lucas co-authored a paper on the nanoquartz in Xuan Wei's coal with geologist Linwei Tian of Chinese University of Hong Kong who did pioneering work on the subject .
What Finkelman 's work provides is a plausible account of why this particular coal may be enriched with silica .
While there are several hypotheses for what caused the mass die - off at the Permian - Triassic boundary 250 million years ago , a major volcanic episode is likely to have contributed to the phenomenon .
Massive amounts of gases leaving Siberian basalts are believed to have radically altered the geochemistry of the atmosphere .
" It lead to highly acidic rain which denuded life on the surface of the earth and acidified the rivers and the oceans , " Finkelman explained .
" It was so intense that they believe it actually dissolved a lot of the rocks on the surface , mobilizing the silica . "
That silica was carried by groundwater into peat that over geological time became the coal the Chinese residents in the region use as a fuel source for cooking .
Coal from this time period is not known to be used for indoor cooking elsewhere .
In Xuan Wei , the direct combustion of coal for cooking has waned in recent years , but basic cookstoves , sometimes without ventilation , have long been employed .
Epidemiological studies as far back as 1991 found that the more time you spent cooking , the more likely you were to get lung cancer ( .pdf ) .
Now , residents have been getting better stoves or moving into apartments , where they have electricity , Finkelman said , but the local coal still presents a problem for thousands .
Public health biologist Joseph Bunnell of the U.S. Geological Survey , who was not involved with the work , said the next step will be to try to determine exactly how the tiny silica particles could combine with other carcinogens in coal smoke to be so deadly .
" What needs to be done from an epidemiological point of view is to establish biological plausibility , " Bunnell said .

... why do Americans care if taxes are raised at all ?
And why should Americans care about tax cuts also ?
As you guys know , I watch the mind numbingly sophomoric Fox Saturday block of Stock Shows that goes by the name of " The Cost of Freedom . "
They consist of four 30 - minute shows , and every single week there 's an idiot on who says the only people that pay taxes are the richest members of our society .
OK , let 's say I agree .
Then why should 290,000,000 Americans more or less give a rip about the ramifications of raising taxes ?
They make the argument for us that taxes should be raised since only the very rich pay them .
Dave Neiwert wrote about this in one of his earlier posts : Populism :
It 's all the right - wing rage these days
The Tea Parties , in every incarnation -- from the Tax Day protests to the health - care town halls to the " Tea Party Express " and the " 912 March on Washington " to Michele Bachmann 's lame " Super Bowl of Freedom " -- has been all about populism , and it is distinctly right - wing populism .

Do n't you feel sorry for these poor rich bastards ?
If this is their argument , then I say President Obama should impose immediate tax increases like a war tax , a health - insurance tax and a jobs creation tax on the top tier of Americans .
Make it a payroll tax and take it right out of their checks every pay period .
That would immediately satisfy the deficit scolds .
After all , who will care if it's only the Fox Noise demographic ?

Abstract
Climate change is altering geographical ranges , population dynamics and phenologies of many organisms .
For ectotherms , increased ambient temperatures frequently have direct consequences for metabolic rates , activity patterns and developmental rates .
Consequently , in many insect species both an earlier beginning and prolongation of seasonal duration occurred in parallel with recent global warming .
However , from an ecological and evolutionary perspective , the number of generations ( voltinism ) and investment into each generation may be even more important than seasonality , since an additional generation per unit time may accelerate population growth or adaptation .
Using a dataset extending back to the mid-nineteenth century , I report changes in the voltinism of butterfly and moth species of Central Europe .
A significant proportion of 263 multi-voltine species showed augmented frequency of second and subsequent generations relative to the first generation in a warm period since 1980 , and 44 species even increased the number of generations after 1980 .
Expected ecological consequences are diverse .
Since multi-voltinism has been linked to insect outbreaks they include an increase in the abundance of herbivorous pests of agriculture and forestry .
However , disruption of the developmental synchrony associated with multi-voltinism and host plant phenology may also reduce fitness , potentially having unexpected consequences for species of conservation concern .
The ability of species to adapt evolutionarily to a changing environment may be facilitated by increased voltinism .
So much of left - wing thought is a kind of playing with fire by people who do n't even know that fire is hot .

KALEHE , Congo
Sometimes I wish eastern Congo could suffer an earthquake or a tsunami , so that it might finally get the attention it needs .
The barbaric civil war being waged here is the most lethal conflict since World War II and has claimed at least 30 times as many lives as the Haiti earthquake .
Yet no humanitarian crisis generates so little attention per million corpses , or such a pathetic international response .
That ’s why I ’m here in the lovely , lush and threatening hills west of Lake Kivu , where militias rape , mutilate and kill civilians with a savagery that is almost incomprehensible .
I ’m talking to a 9 - year - old girl , Chance Tombola , an orphan whose eyes are luminous with fear .
For Chance , the war arrived one evening last May when armed soldiers from an extremist Hutu militia  remnants of those who committed the Rwandan genocide  burst into her home .
They killed her parents in front of her .
Chance ran away , but the soldiers seized her two sisters , ages 6 and 12 , and carried them away into the forest , presumably to be turned into “ wives ” of soldiers .
No one has seen Chance ’s sisters since .
Iceland is a place that is very different than you would have imagined it to be .
Glaciers , geysers , solfataras , waterfalls , volcanoes , raging rivers , whales and other surprises await you on your tour to Iceland .
If you are planning for a trip to Iceland , then you have to visit the following places without fail .
The Blue Lagoon
The geothermal pool of Iceland is one of the popular destinations for the tourists .
Although it is crowded , it is worth to visit this place .
Mineral rich seawater is fed to the Blue Lagoon from the nearby geothermal plant .
This place looks like a twilight zone with people covered in white mud and the steam rolling .
Northern Lights
The Northern Lights are one of the natural wonders of the world and it is seen from September to April in Iceland .
It is a must to see this wonder if you are in this region during this period .
Gullfoss
This is one of the popular waterfalls in Iceland that flows from 105 ft into a canyon .
It is very beautiful to see this wonder on sunny days when you can see the rainbow shimmering on the wall of spray kicking up .
Jokulsarlon
A beautiful lagoon was created after the retreat of Breioamerkurijokull glacier between 1920 and 1965 .
There are currently many much smaller cebergs floating in it and you may be lucky enough to witness ice crashing into this lagoon when you visit .
Trekking the Glaciers
The glaciers of Iceland get sturdy during the winter months .
All you have to do is to just walk through the glacier and bring out the explorer in you .
You do n’t have to be a hardy adventurer as plenty of tour companies assist tourists in trekking through the glaciers in Iceland .
For more breathtaking Icelandic scenery , check out this mini documentary filmed by Klara Harden during her 25 day solo hike through the country :

Not for the squeamish .
At first glance , it seems improbable and downright impossible , but inmates are actually attempting to stand out from the crowd by having ink injected into the whites of their eyes .
DamnCoolPics has a bit more information on the procedure :
Because the we had trouble getting the ink under the surface ( and were able to “ wash ” it out of the small needle incisions ) , we tried the second procedure , on Josh using a 29 ga needle and syringe , thinning down the ink very slightly with an antibiotic eyewash .
Since the goal was simply to blanket the white of the eye in color , there was n’t a need for fine detail .
The first injection was shallow and appeared to dissipate on the surface , but the second injection was at the perfect level and formed a dark bubble of ink just over the sclera ( in the third picture you can see some of the ink running back out of the injection hole ) .
An ATM has been stolen in a burglary at a shop in county Armagh .
The free - standing machine was stolen by two men who broke into the premises on Main Street in Forkhill .
The pair are believed to have escaped in a Volkswagen car .
The theft was reported to the police at about 02:40 GMT on Sunday morning .
Since March 2009 , 11 ATMs have been stolen in various raids across Northern Ireland .
There have also been nine attempts to steal machines .
Last month Link , which runs an ATM network , said its machines would store less money because of the spate of thefts .
The company has also offered a reward of £ 25,000 for information leading to the prosecution of those responsible .
And today , it got even more Portlandy .
You see , with AboutUs announcing the acquisition of JanRain ’s Jyte , Portland products are being acquired by Portland companies .

Portland has gone acquisition crazy .
Why ?
After surviving a lean year , there ’s lots of good affordable technology out there .
And that means that Portland - based businesses are snapping it up or other businesses are looking to Portland products to augment their own offerings .
And today , it got even more Portlandy .
You see , with AboutUs announcing the acquisition of JanRain ’s Jyte , Portland products are being acquired by Portland companies .
Talk about shopping local .
Jyte is n’t a product I ’ve covered much here .
( In fact , I only found one mention in an OpenID roundup . )
It was in JanRain ’s portfolio of products but it was n’t heavily promoted .
In essence , it provided an interesting service — allowing users to make claims which others could refute or support — but it always seemed like it was more of a demo for JanRain ’s identity credential capabilities .
Wait a second .
What ’s that look on your face ?
Oh .
I ’m sorry .
What is Jyte ?
Well , according to Ray King , CEO of AboutUs :
On Jyte anyone can toss out a claim , and the Jyte community opines with votes , comments and related claims .
It ’s a great way to validate — or invalidate ! — your thoughts , and get unabashed feedback from both people you know and total strangers .
Now with AboutUs picking Jyte up , things get a little more interesting .
Why ?
Because the kind of reputation and ranking that Jyte handles is very much in the vein of the lists and rankings that AboutUs offers .
“ JanRain has developed some interesting technology on Jyte that ’s adjacent to our technology , ” said Ray in a press release .
“ We believe it will be useful to us in future product development . ”
I , for one , ca n’t wait to see how they incorporate Jyte into the AboutUs world .
It could be really interesting .
And if you feel the same way , maybe you ’d like to work on that whole integration thing ?
I mean , AboutUs is looking to hire someone with some Ruby and Rails chops .
Oh .
And on a tangential note , there ’s some other business taking place between JanRain and AboutUs , as well .
Seems that AboutUs is going to be implementing JanRain RPX to make creating accounts and using the AboutUs site even easier , too .
And that ’s good news for all of us .
For more information , see the AboutUs blog post on the Jyte acquisition .
For on more on the functionality AboutUs is gaining , visit Jyte .

Nicking the watch off the hand that fed you
The banking industry is just impossibly shameless :
[ T ]he banks that received the biggest taxpayer bailouts are seeking to reap trading profits from securities rescued by the government .
Only months after it was started , the U.S. program designed to purge debts of no immediate discernable value from the balance sheets of troubled banks has helped transform the frozen debt into a money - maker as the bonds have rallied .
Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. , who received 22 percent of the $ 418.7 billion American taxpayers loaned to troubled financial institutions , boosted holdings on their trading books of home - loan bonds that lack government guarantees while investors were raising cash for the program , according to Federal Reserve data .
To make this a bit clearer : Treasury gave the banks a bunch of money to save the financial system .
Shortly thereafter , it proposed giving a handful of investors a bunch of money so they could buy the worst of the securities off of bank balance sheets .
The banks responded to this news by buying up toxic securities quick as they could so they could sell them at inflated prices to the government - subsidized investors .
It 's like a kid trying to boost his allowance by ripping up his clothes so you 'll buy him nicer , newer ones .
As I remember from the unveiling of the PPIP program , though , this was predicted almost instantly .
It 's the obvious reaction to the government promising to buy securities at inflated prices .
The fact that it was so widely predicted made it seem like the government was going to make sure it did n't happen .
Guess not .

“ Let ’s just put it down to bushido . ”
The notion that baby - making is the principal purpose of marriage in 21st century America is plain absurd .
Let ’s just say that upfront .
Arguably it never has been the main reason for matrimony .
Of course , for some people it has been and still is .
But that does n’t make it a universally accepted concept .
Not being a psychologist , anthropologist , cleric or attorney , I ’m a little out of my league here .
I ’m merely a hack columnist , a California native who writes about state government and politics .
And admittedly I did n’t pay much attention to the Proposition 8 campaign in 2008 when voters reinstated the ban on same - sex marriage , six months after the California Supreme Court had ruled that a previous ban approved in 2000 violated the state Constitution .
I figured it was a gut vote for most people .
They were n’t looking for a lot of pundit analysis .

For the record , I voted against Prop .
8 . I finally concluded a few years ago -- and wrote about it then -- that we had much more important things to worry about than what two people living together in a loving relationship were called : “ partners ” or “ married . ”
Many opponents of same - sex marriage argue that it violates God ’s will .
Maybe theirs .
My God does n’t fret about homosexuality .
And I figure if gays and lesbians can gain some comfort and happiness from formal marriage , then let them .
Congratulations and good luck .
In the heated Prop. 8 campaign , I do n’t recall proponents pushing the idea that gay people do n’t qualify for marriage licenses because the main purpose of wedlock is child production .
If they had , I suspect some straight voters would have been offended -- as I was while reading their attorneys ’ contention at the start of a federal court trial Monday to determine whether Prop. 8 violates U.S. constitutional rights of equal protection and due process .
The closest the Prop. 8 side came in the official voter guide argument was that “ the best situation for a child is to be raised by a married mother and father . ”
That ’s a legitimate debate .
But it ’s far different from what attorney Charles J. Cooper asserted in court : that procreation is the “ central or defining purpose ” of marriage .

The ballot argument focused heavily on “ the outrageous decision of four activist Supreme Court judges who ignored the will of the people ” in overturning the original 2000 ban on gay marriage .
What the electorate has joined together , let no court put asunder ?
Nonsense .
The voters sometimes get it wrong .
One example :
In 1964 , Californians voted to continue racial discrimination in the sale and rental of housing .
They passed Prop. 14 , an initiative that repealed legislation banning the bigotry .
Fortunately , the Supreme Court overturned the voters ’ will .
Today , no sane person would think of advocating racial discrimination in real estate .
The idea that marriages are first and foremost about baby - making - and - rearing was expressed by Cooper in October in an unsuccessful attempt to dismiss the suit filed by two same - sex couples against Prop .
8 .

“ We say that the central and defining purpose of marriage is to channel naturally procreative sexual activity between men and women into stable , enduring unions for the sake of begetting , nurturing and raising the next generation , ” Cooper told U.S. Chief District Judge Vaughn R. Walker in San Francisco .
“ Well , ” the judge replied , “ the last marriage that I performed , Mr. Cooper , involved a groom who was 95 and the bride was 83 .
I did not demand that they prove that they intended to engage in procreative activity .
Now , was I missing something ? ”
“ No , your honor . ”
Cooper continued : “ It ’s simple biological reality that same - sex couples do not naturally procreate . ”

“ Well , fair enough , ” the judge said .
“ But procreation does n’t require marriage . ”
Harvard professor Nancy Cott , who has written a book on the history of marriage , offered the court this insight Tuesday :
“ It ’s a surprise to many people to learn that George Washington , who is often called the father of our country , was sterile .
. . .
This was an advantage in many people ’s minds because he could n’t establish a hereditary monarchy when he became president . ”
Yes , we all know happily married , childless couples who benefit society without ever propagating .
Some ca n’t produce children .
Some choose not to .
Some adopt .
Some bring cats or dogs into the family .
Whatever works .
It ’s really nobody ’s business -- least of all the government’s .

They get married for many reasons : companionship , physical attraction , financial protection , to make a commitment .
. . .
Many even get married , and stay married , because of love .
I called a UCLA history professor , Ruth Bloch , who says she was n’t involved in the Prop.
8 campaign and is not a member of a gay rights groups , but did vote against the initiative .
I asked whether marriage is fundamentally about procreation .
That idea “ is certainly out of date , ” she said .
“ Even back in the time of the Puritans , they did n’t only marry for procreation , they married for companionship . ”
Marriage began in prehistoric times , Bloch says , as a way for men to acquire exclusive sexual access to a woman so they could guarantee that her children were his .

In colonial America , she continues , “ when men talked about how to choose a wife , it would be for economic reasons .
They wanted someone industrious and frugal . . . .
One of the key functions of marriage has had to do with transmission of property to successors . ”
The idea of “ love - based marriage , ” Bloch adds , did n’t emerge until the late 18th century , “ stoked ” by the birth of the romance novel .
“ A lot of people think that romantic love is what led to the evolution of divorce , ” she says .
“ People did n’t like each other anymore , so their marriage was no good .
Divorces only accelerated tremendously in the 20th century . ”
So love leads to divorce .

Just what is a “ traditional marriage ” anyway ?
All I know is that if the inability to procreate “ naturally ” is the best argument for denying same - sex couples the right to marry , it does n’t track logically .
Judges will decide whether it does legally .

Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC is on a tear .
This year alone , the company has released five Android handsets .
Its next phone , the HTC Nexus One , aka the Googlephone , is among the most anticipated devices of 2010 .
Just about a decade old , HTC looks like it is poised to pull ahead of much older and larger rivals such as Samsung and LG in worldwide phone market share .
While the older companies ' strength lies in now - declining " feature phones , " or inexpensive , less - capable handsets , HTC's bet on the booming smartphone business is giving it a major boost .
It has also acquired a powerful godfather in Google , the Goliath whose attention is now captivated by the mobile phone business and whose chosen partner is HTC .
" We have covered a distance in the last three years that many other companies have n't in ten , " says John Wang , chief marketing officer for HTC .
About one in six smartphones in the United States in 2008 was a HTC phone , according to Nielsen Mobile .
And with a slew of new handsets and a clever bet on Android , HTC is now the fourth biggest smartphone maker , after Nokia , Research In Motion and Apple .
HTC's Android portfolio now includes the original G1 and MyTouch on T - Mobile , the Hero on Sprint , and the Tattoo and Droid Eris on Verizon .
And while Nokia is struggling to get a grip on the U.S. market , HTC is gaining ground .
" HTC got into bed very , very early with Google and that has helped them , " says Avi Greengart , research director for mobile devices at Current Analysis .
HTC has risen to prominence rapidly because it is young , ambitious and unencumbered by the legacy technology and old business that slow down its peers .
Founded in 1997 , HTC has always focused on designing and manufacturing smartphones – multifunctional devices with powerful processors – rather than inexpensive flip phones .
Its first product in 2000 was the the Compaq iPaq , a PDA that ran Microsoft 's Windows CE operating system .
PDAs were a hot product then , but HTC CEO Peter Chou realized mobile phones would be a bigger market .
Chou started courting telecom operators in Europe with an offer to create customized handsets for them .
By 2002 , HTC had two phones out , for O2 in the UK and Orange in France .
Soon HTC was cranking out handsets for T - Mobile and other European carriers .
Placing the right bets — — — — —— —-
But it 's Android , the Google - designed open source operating system , that turned HTC from a boutique OEM ( original equipment manufacturer , or contract manufacturer ) into a mobile powerhouse .
Over the last decade , HTC's CEO Peter Chou has quietly networked to build a fat Rolodex and strong relationships with some of the most powerful names in the industry .
Android creator Andy Rubin was one of them .
Rubin 's company Danger had created the Sidekick , an extremely popular phone on the T - Mobile network .
Chou 's HTC would later produce a similar phone called the MDA for T - Mobile .
In 2003 , Rubin founded Android , a stealth startup whose mission was little known beyond the fact that it would create software for mobile phones .
But Chou and Rubin were already talking .
In 2005 , Google acquired Android .
As the new operating system began to take shape , HTC seemed like a good partner for the hardware .
HTC at a Glance
Employees : 9,353 ( at the end of 2008 , up 45.5 percent from previous year )
Headquarters : Taiwan
Founder and chairman : Cher Wang
CEO : Peter Chou
Revenue : $ 1.05 billion at the end of the third quarter 2009 , a 10 percent decline from a year ago .
Revenue grew 28.7 percent in 2008 to $ 4.2 billion .
R&D Expenses : $ 643 million ( 2009 )
" Google 's OS required a pretty sophisticated handset and HTC knows how to do that , " says a former HTC executive who worked with the company for two years but did n't want to be identified because he still works in the wireless industry .
" HTC is aggressive and they have the speed of development to get a product to market early . "
For HTC it was an interesting opportunity , though not without its risks .
" When we started to work with Google , we had no visibility at all , " says Wang .
" The ( Android ) platform probably would not even materialize and even if it did , it could be just another one in the market .
But we shared the excitement . "
So for three years before the first Android phone would hit the market , HTC poured engineers and researchers into a project aimed to create a phone that would run a brand - new operating system .
" We made the first Google phone that Google engineers used to develop Android , " says Wang .
" We had about 50 HTC people roaming around Google campus then , wearing the Google badge and eating the wonderful Google food .
That was how deeply the two companies collaborated . "
It also speaks to HTC 's business model , says Greengart .
" HTC likes to let someone else build the underpinnings for the phone and for them to work on higher - level stuff , " says Greengart .
Focus on design — — — ——
Unlike Nokia , HTC has been quick to adapt to fast - changing consumer tastes in mobile phones .
When slider phones were all the rage , HTC created the MDA for T - Mobile .
Slim phones , touchscreens , Android devices – HTC has them all .
HTC 's ambitious expansion continues .
Last year , HTC acquired One & Co. , a San Francisco - based industrial design firm that has created products for Nike , Apple and Dell , among others .
Over the next three years , it will spend $ 1 billion to create a new R&D facility near a Taipei suburb .
" We are the second or the third best design house in the world when it comes to mobile phones , " says Horace Luke , chief innovation officer at HTC .
" The trick of design is it is not just styling but also great engineering . "
HTC has also been quick to understand that when it comes to mobile phones , looks alone do n't cut it .
" They have done a lot of innovation on software in terms of the user interface , " says Greengart .
" HTC shipped a touch phone with a 3 - D cube interface before most other handset makers . "
In June , HTC announced Sense , a UI skin that would sit on top of the Android OS .
Sense offers widgets for adding new features , brings together contacts from different sources , and allows users to set different profiles for work and home .
" With a lot of smartphones out there you have to go to four different locations – your Gmail , Flickr , Facebook or Twitter – to find what 's up with one person , " says Luke .
" But content is content .
It does n't matter where its comes from . "
Personalization will be another big trend , says Luke .
" I firmly believe that the phone you have should never look like the phone I have , " he says .
"
If you love stocks and financial news that 's what your phone should show .
But if I am interested in Hello Kitty and manga then my phone should reflect that . "
It 's an idea Palm first offered up with the Pre .
But since HTC 's announcement , a Sense - like interface has become an important part of new smartphones such as rival Motorola 's Cliq .
Creating a brand — — — — —-
Apple 's iPhone or Research In Motion 's BlackBerry have become cultural icons .
But when was the last time you heard someone say they wanted a " HTC phone ? "
Even when the first Android phone was launched last October , it was called the ' Googlephone ' or T - Mobile G1 ; the new Googlephone is called the Nexus One .
Most customers forget the HTC brand in that context .
That 's what Wang says he wants to change next .
" For many years , HTC has been the company behind the scenes , " he says .
" In the earlier days , we did not post our brand on the phones .
But three years ago we made a decision within the company to build the HTC brand . "
It 's not just vanity .
Smartphones are an intensely competitive market .
At the top , Apple and Research In Motion both have strong brand recognition and a growing base of users .
In the middle , producers such as Samsung and LG own a huge share of the feature - phone market , but are hungry to sell more smartphones .
And at the bottom , contract manufacturers such as Acer and Asus are looking to crawl up the chain .
For now , HTC still occupies the lower tiers of brand recognition .
A stronger brand would translate to more clout , fatter margins and bigger revenues .
Branding is even more important in the smartphone world , where consumer tastes can shift quickly , crowning new winners and losers every few months .
Having a powerful brand can shield a handset maker against some of these shifting winds .
" In my time at HTC , they went from $ 200 million in revenue to $ 1 billion , " says the former HTC executive .
" But you can't continue that unless you have a brand . "
" It was becoming harder to innovate from one generation to another without a brand , " admits Wang .
" If you create a phone that sells well on one carrier it 's not enough .
The next version resets everything . "
But , so far , HTC has not shown its commitment by allocating a hefty marketing budget for branding , says the former HTC executive .
Throwing money around wo n't help , says Wang .
" Brand value is like respect , you have to earn it , " he says .
" You ca n't buy respect .
You can spend all the money you want to build the recognition but that does n't mean anything .
I want the HTC brand to stand for a great experience . "
Creating a global culture — — — — — —— —-
HTC does n't want to be just another Taiwanese handset manufacturer .
Despite its strong Asian roots , the company has tried to build an international business culture .
Almost all of HTC 's senior management is of Asian origin .
The company has its headquarters in Taiwan and is listed only on the Taiwanese stock exchange .
Yet the company 's primary language is English .
User documentation , technical papers and even all e-mails and staff meetings at HTC 's office in Taiwan are done in English .
" When Peter started at this company , he demanded everyone take an English test before they come in , " says Luke .
" He always had a vision that the company would go global . "
Many of HTC 's executives , including company founder Cher Wang , went to graduate school in the United States .
But Wang , who belongs to one of Taiwan 's richest families ( her father , a plastics tycoon , was named the second - richest man in Taiwan by Forbes magazine last year ) , rarely grants media interviews .
HTC has also imbibed one of the greatest ideas of American business :
It 's okay to fail .
HTC 's R&D division has a " target failure rate " of 95 percent , says Luke .
" A research lab has to come up with enough ideas that fail fast and fail early so you can learn and harvest the right ones , " he says .
" That 's very different from the culture at Taiwan , where you have to be successful all the time . "
While HTC is unmistakably aligning its future with Android , the company is n't willing to give up on Windows Mobile – at least publicly .
" Our commitment to Windows Mobile platform is unwavering , " says Wang .
" Both platforms are important .
They match different people . "
For HTC , the last 10 years have been a rocket - like rise .
But the battle to stay ahead of the game has just begun .
" It 's no longer a mystery what it takes to create a differentiated handset , " says Greengart .
Handset makers can either build their own operating system and hardware to control the user experience completely , as Apple and Palm have done .
Or they can build on top of someone else 's operating system , such as Windows Mobile , Symbian or Android .
The danger with the second path is that if you can do it , others can too .
" As LG and Samsung create phones over and over again , they will soon come up with something that can beat HTC's , " Greengart says .
" When you are building on top of someone else 's OS , other people can do that too . "

Riding the Wave ... Nigel Tao .
His other brother , Trevor , is the subject of an upcoming book on autistic savants and has a double degree in maths and music .
Nigel , who has an IQ of 180 , is also a maths whiz but went down a different path after leaving university in 2001 to follow his honours supervisor to a coding gig at a dotcom company in the US .
He has been working at Google Australia since 2006 .
" It might have been genetics , it might have been upbringing , but part of it is [ that ] as kids we enjoyed reading about maths and ... messing around making programs , " he said .
" I do n't have a trophy cabinet like Terry does but I think I 've done some good stuff . "
A case in point : Google Wave .
The product seeks to introduce a completely new way of communicating online by combining elements from email , instant messaging , wikis and social networks with the ability to share documents , maps , images and video - all rolled up into a single new web - based tool .
Head Google engineer Lars Rasmussen said the company planned to open
Wave up to everyone early next year but first wanted to make sure all of the bugs were ironed out and that Google 's servers could handle the load .
" It is a new type of communication - email is the way most people still communicate , which is remarkable because the technology was invented 40 years ago , " he said .
" If you look at a picture of the first computer that sent an email , it looks sort of like a cockpit in an old airplane . "
Some enterprising bloggers have tried to sell their sought - after Wave invitations on eBay , even though it breaches the site 's terms of service .
One blogger claimed he was offered several thousand dollars for his invitation before eBay told him to remove the auction .
Rasmussen describes a Wave as a shared object that sits in between a conversation and a document .
Everything inside
Wave happens in real time and groups of friends can use it to chat , collaborate on documents , play games and share files .
Rasmussen admits he still does not know exactly how people will end up using it , which is why Google has opened up the platform with an Application Programming Interface ( API ) so that third parties can extend Wave 's functionality - in a similar way to " extensions " for the Firefox browser .
" We think our API is good enough that integration can be done with Twitter , Facebook , email , instant messaging , Orkut , " he said .
" The idea is you could sit inside Wave and manage all your communication on those other systems - or not . "
Some of the extensions developed so far include Sudoku , teleconference tool Ribbit , Lonely Planet travel guides , Google Maps , AccuWeather and video chat .
Rasmussen and his team have coined the term " wave moments " to describe something in Wave that would have been much more difficult to accomplish using existing communications tools .
They now use
Wave for most of their internal communications and find it is a more efficient way of conducting meetings , as text from each participant appears live as they are typing .
Revisions of the tool will allow users to turn the live typing function off , Rasmussen said .

" When you have everyone in a room , only one person can talk at a time but in a Wave you can have five people talking at the same time , " he said .
Google co-founder Sergey Brin has said he thought
Wave sounded " kind of crazy " when it was first proposed in 2007 but now believes it will herald " a form of interaction that you would not have previously imagined " .
WASHINGTON , Jan. 13 , 2010  --
Fresh from her book tour , former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin is trying out a new role as a Fox News pundit .
The newest employee of Fox News channel made her debut Tuesday night on the network 's flagship show , " The O'Reilly Factor . "
" I 'm grinning today , and I 'm so appreciative of the opportunity to get to work with you and the team members here at Fox News to provide the fair and the balanced reporting and analysis voters in this country deserve , " Palin told host Bill O'Reilly .
Experts say Palin's new role could be a hit or miss for her , depending on how she crafts it .
" I think she 's got to lose just being a victim , " said Tina Brown , founder and editor - in - chief of The Daily Beast .
" If that 's the only brand , it 's going to tire off after a while . "
" On the face of it , it seems like a great role , " Brown said on " Good Morning America . "
" But at the same time , she might also discover what she sort of discovered as a candidate .
...
It 's actually harder than it looks to be a good pundit on the air .
You 've got to have stuff to say . "
Larry Hackett , managing editor at People Magazine , said Palin would likely attract a large audience in the beginning , but it's what she does over time that will determine whether she can keep that fan base .
" She has to metamorphosize it into something else , otherwise people might get bored , " he said on " GMA . "
The former GOP vice presidential candidate did n't waste any time in attacking her detractors , and taking issue with what she said were " lies " about her .
She fired back at critics of her performance as Sen.
John McCain 's running mate in the 2008 presidential campaign and kept up her ongoing attacks on the Obama administration .
Palin 's critics sniped at her new role as consultant even before her appearance on air .
" Not since Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag has there been a couple so well suited for one another , " Hari Sevugan , the Democratic National Committee 's press secretary .
When O'Reilly asked Palin why , in his view , so many " pinheads " seemed threatened by her , she said , " Obviously , it 's not about me , it 's not about me , personally .
They do n't like the message .
They do n't like the commonsense conservative solution that I think that I represent and you articulate .
They do n't like to hear it . "
Palin may have a strong fan base , as evident by the turnout for the book tour , but three recent polls show more Americans disapprove of her than approve of her , and a vast majority says she 's unqualified to be president .
In an ABC News / Washington Post poll in November , three out of five Americans said they thought Palin was unqualified to be president .
Fifty - two percent said they viewed her unfavorably , 34 percent said they " strongly " shared that sentiment , while 43 percent had a favorable opinion .
Fifty - three percent said they definitely would not vote for Palin if she were to run for president in 2012 .
Palin's new gig on Fox News is unlikely to change that view and break the perception that she 's ill - prepared for the presidency .
Her attacks on President Obama and the administration are also unlikely to help her .
Sarah Palin Makes Fox News Debut
Palin took issue Tuesday night with a " 60 Minutes " interview with former McCain - Palin campaign manager Steve Schmidt , who said Palin thought Saddam Hussein was behind the 9/11 attacks , did n't know the difference between North and South Korea and did n't know who her son would be fighting in Iraq .
" Yes , that surprised me , " Palin told O'Reilly .
" I had n't seen the ' 60 Minutes ' thing .
I had been warned , you know , do n't watch .
It 's a bunch of BS from Schmidt and from some of those ... "
She denied Schmidt 's claim that she was " in chaos preparing for the debate " with Sen .
Joe Biden during the presidential campaign in 2008 .
" That is not true .
And Steve Schmidt told us how overjoyed he was after the debate , so pleased with the way everything turned out , as he was after the convention , " Palin said .
Palin also spoke about the recent controversy surrounding Sen .
Harry Reid 's remarks that were published in a new book on the 2008 presidential campaign , " Game Change . "
The Nevada senator called then - Sen. Barack Obama a " light - skinned " African - American who did not have a " negro dialect unless he wanted to have one , " according to the book .
Palin called Reid 's comments " perplexing " and " unfortunate . "
" You can't defend those comments .
That way of thinking is quite foreign to , I think , most Americans today , " Palin said , adding that she comes from a diverse state and that she is married to an Alaska native .
" I do n't believe that he 's a racist , " Palin said of Reid .
" But I do n't believe that Trent Lott was a racist , either . "
Republicans have called for Reid 's resignation , citing the Democratic outcry in 2002 that led Sen. Trent Lott , R - Miss. , to resign from his position as Senate majority leader , after he praised former senator and segregationist Strom Thurmond .
" That hypocrisy is another reason why so many Americans are quite disgusted with the political games that are played , really on both sides of the aisle , but in this case , on the left - wing , " Palin said .
" That they are playing with this game of racism and kind of letting Harry Reid 's comments slide , but having crucified Trent Lott for having essentially , along the same lines , saying the same . "
Sarah Palin Goes Back to her Roots
The career change takes Palin back to her roots .
She majored in journalism with a focus on broadcasting at the University of Idaho .
This is also her first job after stepping down as Alaska governor in July , and publishing her memoir , " Going Rogue . "
Palin 's resignation as governor fueled speculation at the time that she was being offered a TV deal , but she dismissed that claim .
Palin has signed a multi - year deal with Fox , where she will offer political commentary and analysis on its cable news and business channels , Web site and its radio network .
She also will host a new series about inspirational stories about Americans who have overcome adversity .
But Fox did n't just hire Palin for inspiration .
" You know , there 's always that ; that controversy that seems surrounding whatever it is that I announce that I do , " she said .
Palin will appear next month at the first convention of the tea party group , a movement she has called " beautiful . "

On this day in 1935 , Elvis Presley was born .
The man who changed rock and roll forever would have turned 75 years old today had he not passed away in 1977 ( unless you ’re a conspiracy theorist who thinks the King is still alive , in which case we hope he ’s having cake somewhere ) .
Elvis Presley biography :
Elvis Aaron Presley , in the humblest of circumstances , was born to Vernon and Gladys Presley in a two - room house in Tupelo , Mississippi on January 8 , 1935 .
His twin brother , Jessie Garon , was stillborn , leaving Elvis to grow up as an only child .
He and his parents moved to Memphis , Tennessee in 1948 , and Elvis graduated from Humes High School there in 1953 .
Biography Elvis ’ musical influences were the pop and country music of the time , the gospel music he heard in church and at the all - night gospel sings he frequently attended , and the black R&B he absorbed on historic Beale Street as a Memphis teenager .
In 1954 , he began his singing career with the legendary Sun Records label in Memphis .
In late 1955 , his recording contract was sold to RCA Victor .
By 1956 , he was an international sensation .
With a sound and style that uniquely combined his diverse musical influences and blurred and challenged the social and racial barriers of the time , he ushered in a whole new era of American music and popular culture .
He starred in 33 successful films , made history with his television appearances and specials , and knew great acclaim through his many , often record - breaking , live concert performances on tour and in Las Vegas .
Globally , he has sold over one billion records , more than any other artist .
His American sales have earned him gold , platinum or multi-platinum awards for 150 different albums and singles , far more than any other artist .
Among his many awards and accolades were 14 Grammy nominations ( 3 wins ) from the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences , the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award , which he received at age 36 , and his being named One of the Ten Outstanding Young Men of the Nation for 1970 by the United States Jaycees .
Without any of the special privileges his celebrity status might have afforded him , he honorably served his country in the U.S. Army .
His talent , good looks , sensuality , charisma , and good humor endeared him to millions , as did the humility and human kindness he demonstrated throughout his life .
Known the world over by his first name , he is regarded as one of the most important figures of twentieth century popular culture .
Elvis died at his Memphis home , Graceland , on August 16 , 1977 .
Elvis had 18 chart - topping singles , and his worldwide album sales are estimated at over one billion units ( yep , that ’s billion ) .
He made peanut butter and banana sandwiches cool .
He wore awesome jumpsuits ( and capes ! ) .

Many who died had already been vaccinated
61 million injections add up to bad public health policy
The one question the CDC does not want you to ask
Crunching the numbers :
Why vaccines just do n't add up
Where are all the real journalists ?

( Natural News )
The CDC is engaged in a very clever , statistically devious spin campaign , and nearly every journalist in the mainstream media has fallen for its ploy .
No one has yet reported what I 'm about to reveal here .
It all started with the CDC 's recent release of new statistics about swine flu fatalities , infection rates and vaccination rates .
According to the CDC :• 61 million Americans were vaccinated against swine flu ( about 20 % of the U.S. population ) .
The CDC calls this a " success " even though it means 4 out of 5 people rejected the vaccines . • 55 million people " became ill " from swine flu infections . •
246,000 Americans were hospitalized due to swine flu infections . •
11,160 Americans died from the swine flu .
Base on these statistics , the CDC is now desperately urging people to get vaccinated because they claim the pandemic might come back and vaccines are the best defense .
The CDC statistics lie by omission .
They do not reveal the single most important piece of information about H1N1 vaccines :
The CDC is intentionally .
They want you ( and mainstream media journalists ) to mistakenly believe that ZERO deaths occurred in those who were vaccinated .
But this is blatantly false .
Being vaccinated against H1N1 swine flu offers absolutelyfrom swine flu infections .
And that means roughly 20 % of the 11,160 Americans who died from the swine flu were probably already vaccinated against swine flu .
That comes to around 2,200 deaths in people who were vaccinated !
How do I know that swine flu vaccines do n't reduce infection mortality ?
Because I 've looked through all the randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled clinical trials that have ever been conducted on H1N1 vaccines .
It did n't take me very long , because the number of such clinical trials is ZERO .
That 's right :
There is not a single shred of evidence in existence today that scientifically supports the myth that H1N1 vaccines reduce mortality from H1N1 infections .
The best evidence I can find on vaccines that targetindicates a maximum mortality reduction effect of somewhere around 1 % of those who are vaccinated .
The other 99 % have the same mortality rate as people who were not vaccinated .
So let 's give the recent H1N1 vaccines the benefit of the doubt and let 's imagine that they work just as well as other flu vaccines .
That means they would reduce the mortality rate by 1 % .
So out of the 2,200 deaths that took place in 2009 in people who were already vaccinated , the vaccine potentially may have savedSo let 's see : 61 million people are injected with a potentially dangerous vaccine , and the actual number " saved " from the pandemic is conceivably just 22 .
Meanwhile , the number of peopleby the vaccine is almost certainly much , much higher than 22 .
These vaccines contain nervous system disruptors and inflammatory chemicals that can cause serious health problems .
Some of those problems wo n't be evident for years to come ... future Alzheimer 's victims , for example , will almost certainly those who received regular vaccines , I predict .
Injecting 61 million people with a chemical that threatens the nervous system in order to avoid 22 deaths -- and that 's the best case ! -- is an idiotic public health stance .
rather than hyping up a pandemic in order to sell more vaccines to people who do n't need them .
Better yet , what the USA could have done that would have been more effective is .
At no more cost than the vaccines , the bottles of vitamin D supplements would have saved thousands of lives and offered tremendously importantly additional benefits such as preventing cancer and depression , too .
Through its release of misleading statistics , the CDC wants everyone to believe that .
That 's themythology behind the release of their statistics .
And yet they never come right out and say it , do they ?
They never say , " None of these deaths occurred in patients who had been vaccinated against H1N1 .
" They can't say that because it 's simply not true .
It would be a lie .
And if that lie were exposed , people might begin to ask questions like , " Well gee , if some of the people who were killed by the swine flu were already vaccinated against swine flu , then does n't that mean the vaccine does n't protect us from dying ?
" That 's the number one question that the CDC absolutely , positively does not want people to start asking .
So they just gloss over the point andthat vaccines offer absolute protection against H1N1 infections .
But even the CDC 's own scientists know that 's complete bunk .
Outright quackery .
No vaccine is 100 % effective .
In fact , when it comes to influenza , no vaccine is even 10 % effective at reducing mortality .
There 's not even a vaccine that 's 5 % effective .
And there 's never been a single shred of credible scientific information that says a flu vaccine is even 1 % effective .
So how effective are these vaccines , really ?
There are a couple thousand vaccinated dead people whose own deaths help answer that question :
They may not be effective at all .
Think about this : against swine flu .
That 's roughly 240 million people .
Most of those 240 million people were probably exposed to the H1N1 virus at some point over the last six months because the virus was so widespread .
How many of those 240 million people were actually killed by H1N1 ?
Given the CDC 's claimed total of deaths at 11,160 , if you take 80 % of that ( because that 's the percentage who refused to be vaccinated ) , you arrive at 8,928 .
So roughly 8,900 people died out of 240 million .
That 's a death rate among theof .0000372 With a death rate of .0000372 , the swine flu killed roughly 1 out of every 26,700 people who were NOT vaccinated .
So even if you skipped the vaccine , you had a 26,699 out of 26,700 chance of surviving .
Those are pretty good odds .
Ridiculously good .
You have a 700 % greater chance of being struck by lightning in your lifetime , by the way .
What it all means is that NOT getting vaccinated against the swine flu is actually a very reasonable , intelligent strategy for protecting your health .
Mathematically , it is the smarter play .
Because , remember :.
In fact , I personally challenge the CDC to release statistics detailing what percentage of the dead people had previously received such vaccines .
The headline to this article , " Thousands of Americans died from H1N1 even after receiving vaccine shots " is a direct challenge to the CDC , actually .
If the CDC believes this headline is wrong -- and that the number of vaccinated Americans who died from H1N1 is zero -- then why do n't they say so on the record ?
The answer ?
Because they'd be laughed right out of the room .
Everybody who has been following this with any degree of intelligence knows that the H1N1 vaccine was a medical joke from the start .
There is no doubt that many of those who died from H1N1 were previously vaccinated .
The CDC just does n't want you to know how many ( and they hope you 'll assume it 's zero ) .
I find it especially fascinating that the simple question of " How many of the dead were previously vaccinated ? " hasbeen asked in print by a single journalist in any mainstream newspaper or media outline across the country .
Not the NY Times , not WashingtonPost.com , not the WSJ , LA Times or USA Today .
( At least , not that I 'm aware of .
If you find one that does , let me know and I 'll link to their article ! )
Is n't there a single journalist in the entire industry that has the journalistic courage to ask this simple question of the CDC ?
Why do these mainstream journalists just reprint the CDC 's statistics
Why is all the intelligent , skeptical reporting about H1N1 found only in the alternative press or independent media sites ?
You already know the answer , but I 'll say it anyway :
Because most mainstream media journalists are just part of the propaganda machine , blindly reprinting distorted statistics from " authorities " without ever stopping to question those authorities .
The MSM today , in other words , is often quite pathetic .
Far from the independent media mindset that used to break big stories like Watergate , today 's mainstream media is little more than a mouthpiece for the corporatocracy that runs our nation .
The MSM serves the financial interests of the corporations , just as the CDC and WHO do .
That 's why they 're all spouting the same propaganda with their distorted stories about H1N1 swine flu .
But those who are intelligent enough to ask skeptical questions about H1N1 already realize what an enormous con the pandemic was .
In the end , it turned out to be a near - harmless virus that was hyped up by the CDC , WHO and drug companies in order to sell hundreds of millions of doses of vaccines that are now about to be dumped down the drain as useless .

di , da piovonorane « Conosco bene il modo con cui Berlusconi chiede ai suoi legali di fare le leggi ad personam , perché fino a pochi anni fa lo chiedeva a me .
E , contrariamente a quello che sostiene in pubblico , con i suoi avvocati non ha alcun problema a dire che sono leggi per lui .
Per questo oggi lo affermo con piena cognizione di causa : quelle che stanno facendo sono norme ad personam » .
Carlo Taormina , 70 anni , è stato uno dei legali di punta del Cavaliere fino al 2008 , quando ha mollato il premier e il suo giro – uscendo anche dal Parlamento – a seguito di quella che lui ora chiama « una crisi morale » .
Ormai libero da vincoli politici , in questa intervista a Piovonorane dice quello che pensa e che sa su Berlusconi e le sue leggi .
« La correggo : le norme che gli servono per completare il suo disegno sono tre .
Lei ha dimenticato il Lodo Alfano Bis , da approvare come legge costituzionale , che è fondamentale » .
« Iniziamo dal processo breve : si tratta solo di un ballon d’essai , di una minaccia che Berlusconi usa per ottenere il legittimo impedimento .
Il processo breve è stato approvato al Senato ma scommetterei che alla Camera non lo calendarizzeranno neanche , insomma finirà in un cassetto » .
« Perché il processo breve gli serve solo per alzare il prezzo della trattativa .
A un certo punto rinuncerà al processo breve per avere in cambio il legittimo impedimento , cioè la possibilità di non presentarsi alle udienze dei suoi processi e di ottenere continui rinvii .
Guardi , la trattativa è già in corso e l’Udc , ad esempio , ha detto che se lui rinuncia al processo breve , vota a favore del legittimo impedimentoı » .
« Vede , la legge sul legittimo impedimento è palesemente incostituzionale , e quindi la Consulta la boccerà .
Però intanto resterà in vigore per almeno un anno e mezzo : appunto fino alla bocciatura della Corte Costituzionale .
E Berlusconi nel frattempo farà passare il Lodo Alfano bis , come legge costituzionale , quindi intoccabile dalla Consulta » .
« Esatto .
Non può essere costituzionale una legge in cui il presupposto dell ’impedimento è una carica , in questo caso quella di presidente del consiglio .
Non esiste proprio .
L’impedimento per cui si può rinviare un ’udienza è un impegno di quel giorno o di quei giorni , non una carica .
Ad esempio , quando io avevo incarichi di governo , molte udienze a cui dovevo partecipare si facevano di sabato , che problema c’è ?
E si possono tenere udienze anche di domenica .
Chiunque , quale che sia la sua carica , ha almeno un pomeriggio libero a settimana .
Invece di andare a vedere il Milan , Berlusconi potrebbe andare alle sue udienze .
E poi , seguendo la logica di questa legge , la pratica di ottenere rinvii potrebbe estendersi quasi all ’infinito .
Perché mai un sindaco , ad esempio , dovrebbe accettare di essere processato ?
Forse che per la sua città i suoi impegni istituzionali sono meno importanti ?
E così via .
Insomma questa legge non sta in piedi , è destinata a una bocciatura alla Consulta .
E Berlusconi lo sa , ma intanto la fa passare e la usa per un po ’ di tempo , fino a che appunto non passa il Lodo Alfano bis , con cui si sistema definitivamente » .
« Ho lavorato per anni per Berlusconi , conosco le sue strategie .
Quando ero il suo consulente legale e mi chiedeva di scrivergli delle leggi che lo proteggessero dai magistrati , non faceva certo mistero del loro scopo ad personam .
E io gliele scrivevo anche meglio di quanto facciano adesso Ghedini e Pecorella » .
« Quella sulla legittima suspicione , mi pare fossimo nel 2002 .
Gli serviva per spostare i suoi processi da Milano a Roma .
Lui ce la chiese apertamente e noi , fedeli esecutori della volontà del principe , ci siamo messi a scriverla .
E abbiamo anche fatto un bel lavoretto , devo dire : sembrava tutto a posto .
Poi una sera di fine ottobre , verso le 11 , arrivò una telefonata di Ciampi » . « Esatto .
E Ciampi chiese una modifica » .
« Quindi io dissi a Berlusconi che con quella modifica non sarebbe servita più a niente .
Lui ci pensò un po ’ e poi rispose : “ Intanto facciamola così , poi si vede ” .
Avevo ragione io : infatti la legge passò con quelle modifiche e non gli servì a niente » .
« Guardi , la mia esperienza al Parlamento e al governo è stata interessantissima , direi quasi dal punto di vista scientifico .
Ma molte cose che ho fatto in quel periodo non le rifarei più .
Non ho imbarazzo a dire che ho vissuto una crisi morale , culminata quando ho visto come si stava strutturando l’entourage più ristretto del Cavaliere .
«A Cicchitto , a Bondi , a Denis Verdini , ma anche a Ghedini e Pecorella .
Personaggi che hanno preso il sopravvento e che condizionano pesantemente il premier .
E l’hanno portato a marginalizzare – a far fuori politicamente – persone come Martino , Pisanu e Pera .
E adesso stanno lavorando su Schifani » .
« Sì , il prossimo che faranno fuori è Schifani .
Al termine della legislatura farà la fine di Pera e Pisanu » .
« Non credo proprio .
Penso che appena sistemate le sue questioni personali , diciamo nel 2011 , Berlusconi andrà alle elezioni anticipate » .
« Perché gli conviene farlo finché l’opposizione è così debole , se non inesistente .
Così vince un’altra volta e può aspettare serenamente che scada il mandato di Napolitano , fra tre anni , e prendere il suo posto » .
« E’ quello a cui punta .
E in assenza di un’opposizione forte può arrivarci tranquillamente .
L’unica variabile che può intralciare questo disegno , più che il Pd , mi pare che sia il centro , cioè il lavorio tra Casini e Rutelli .
Ma se questo lavorio funzionerà o no , lo vedremo solo dopo le regionali ».( 31 gennaio 2010 )

ReporterA visiting top executive of Saudi Arabia 's state - run oil company said Wednesday that fossil fuels would still play the biggest role in global energy use and it was important to try to make the best of them .
" Alternative energy sources hold promise in the long - term , and we should pursue their development in a rational fashion .
But in the immediate future , the prudent course is to sustain global economic development by making the best use of proven sources of energy , " Khalid A. Al - Falih , president and CEO of Saudi Aramco , said during a speech at Seoul National University ( SNU ) .
" Fossil fuels will continue to dominate the world 's energy mix , with most analysts agreeing that oil , gas and coal will continue to account for more than an 80 - percent share among all energy sources .
Petroleum will remain indispensible to the world economy , and especially for fast - growing nations .
"
In spite of the unchanged significance of petroleum , Saudi Aramco and other Saudi institutions are ready to partner with Korean firms to help achieve the high end of the range of feasible achievement for renewable energy sources , Al - Falih said , adding that his company shares Korea 's emphasis on achieving ever cleaner and more efficient uses of energy .
Al - Falih also praised Korea 's efforts for developing eco-friendly technologies , as well as the country 's human resources .
" I was impressed with my visit to SNU 's Advanced Automotive Research Center , which shares the ' Low Carbon , Green Growth ' strategies for Korea , ' " he said .
" This visit to Seoul makes me even more confident that Korea 's current and future advances in energy efficiency and in environmental stewardship will benefit the wider world , including Saudi Arabia .
"
Although we are grateful for these God - given resources , we must acknowledge that truly the greatest natural resource here in Korea , in Saudi Arabia , or anywhere else in the world , is the human resource .
Human wisdom , after all , is what enables us to leverage energy for the service of humankind .
" Sworn in as the Saudi Aramco president in January , Al - Falih paid his second visit to Korea following his first one last year .
Since his arrival last weekend , the Saudi executive met with Knowledge Economy Minister Choi Kyung - hwan and CEOs of local refiners and construction firms to discuss ways to cooperate on energy supply and related development projects in Saudi Arabia .
Al Falih will leave Korea , Thursday .
Saudi Aramco , the largest oil corporation in the world with the largest proven crude oil reserves and production , accounts for more than 30 percent of total oil production in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries .
It also provides over 30 percent of the crude oil Korea imports .
The True Cause Of Depression
About two years ago a patient of mine committed suicide .
When his wife , who was also my patient , told me the news at one of her visits , I was shocked .
Fully aware that 40 % of older patients who are suicidal visit their primary care doctors within one week of killing themselves , I found myself ruminating over and over how I ’d missed recognizing the severity of his distress .
I ’d known he ’d been suffering from depression but had thought it mild .
WHAT IS DEPRESSION ?
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM - IV ) classifies depression into the following types ( there are even more , but these cover the basics ) :
Dysthymia .
In essence , having a depressed mood on most days for at least two years .
Major Depressive Disorder .
In addition to feeling “ down ” as in dysthymia , other characteristics may include excessive feelings of guilt and suicidal ideation , as well as various physical symptoms like loss of hunger and fatigue .
It can be mild , moderate , or severe .
Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood .
This is grief due to a loss of some kind ( which itself can be classified as normal or complicated ) .
Depression NOS ( not otherwise specified ) .
Includes things like premenstrual depression and seasonal depression ( SAD ) .
Secondary depression .
Depression due to an underlying medical disorder like Cushing ’s disease or hypothyroidism .
Though not in DSM - IV , some practitioners further classify depression into two broad types :
Endogenous depression to denote depression that arises without an obvious identifiable cause , thought to reflect some kind of “ chemical imbalance ” in the brain .
to denote depression that arises without an obvious identifiable cause , thought to reflect some kind of “ chemical imbalance ” in the brain .
Exogenous depression which is thought to arise from a specific , identifiable external cause .
Given this confusing and non-parallel classification scheme , it ’s astonishing doctors do n’t become depressed themselves as they try to figure out into which bucket their patient ’s depression fits .
How can we make sense of all this and , more importantly , understand the real causes of depression in order to augment the effectiveness of currently available therapies ?
MIND VERSUS BRAIN
First , we need to recognize the distinction between chemical and external depression is becoming outdated .
Neuroscientists have good evidence that the mind arises from , and is actually caused by , the physical brain , meaning chemical and electrical reactions somehow give rise to thoughts and emotions .
Evidence in support of this theory can be found in numerous studies that show altering brain chemistry with antidepressant drugs ( chemicals ) can make depressed people feel better emotionally .
The same is true for anxiolytics ( like Valium ) and their effect on anxiety .
But recently , with the advent of functional MRI scans ( fMRI ) , we now have proof the opposite is equally true , that changes in thinking cause significant , measurable changes in brain chemistry and functioning .
In one study , patients suffering from spider phobia underwent fMRI scanning before and after receiving cognitive behavioral therapy aimed at eliminating their fear of spiders .
Scans were then compared to normal subjects without spider phobia .
Results showed that brain function in patients with spider phobia before receiving cognitive behavioral therapy were abnormal compared to subjects without spider phobia but then changed to match normal brain patterns after cognitive behavioral therapy .
This may represent the best evidence to date that changes made at the mind level are able to functionally “ rewire ” the brain , and that the brain and the mind are in reality merely two sides of the same coin , or different ways of viewing the same single thing .
DEPRESSION ALWAYS HAS SOME CAUSE
Where , then , does the true cause of depression lie ?
In the context of the critically important caveat that clinical depression is almost certainly more than one disease with more than one proximate cause , I would hypothesize that in most cases depression arises at its core from a belief that we ’re powerless to solve our problems .
This is clearly true with people who know why they ’re depressed : invariably , once they figure out how to solve their particular problem , their depression lifts .
But I would also argue this often — though by no means always — holds true for people who are depressed for no reason they know as well .
Why ?
Because thoughts can trigger feelings that remain stirred up long after the thoughts themselves have been forgotten .
Some studies have suggested people think upwards of 12,000 thoughts per day .
How could we ever remember them all ?
Yet a fleeting thought we might have had this morning about the possibility of losing our job can and often does leave an emotional residue that lasts hours , days , weeks , or even longer .
I would argue , therefore , any depression that appears to be “ chemical ” may in fact be caused by a thought that simply is n’t remembered — a thought about a problem we do n’t believe we can solve .
( On the other hand , many psychiatrists describe have depressed patients who tell them their lives are “ just fine ” but that they ’re depressed anyway .
To tell if such people are depressed because of unrecognized cognitive distress or because of some non-cognitive abnormality is extremely difficult .
If such patients never successfully identify a cognitive distortion as the true cause of their depression does that mean it never existed or they just never found it ? )
Further , sometimes what appears to be a “ chemical ” depression is caused by a thought that is n’t directly or consciously recognized .
These thoughts are often about problems that seem so unbearably awful and unsolvable we literally do n’t want , and often refuse , to think about them ( such as our becoming jobless or the prospect of our own death ) .
HOW CAN WE HELP OURSELVES ?
None of this is by any means to say we can simply decide to believe we can solve a particular problem when no solution is obvious or forthcoming .
Changing any belief , whether consciously recognized or not , is one of the hardest things to do in life .
But armed with a hypothesis of the true cause of depression we can consider the following steps to help ourselves :
Find a way to raise your life - condition .
Your inner life state has more to do with your ability to believe you can solve your problems than anything that may be actually going on in your life .
If your thoughts are swirling in despair , take action to break free of them and attain a fresh perspective .
Become immersed in a great book that moves you or watch a movie that transports you .
Exercise .
Go where it ’s warm .
Meditate .
In short , do what you know from experience bounces your thinking to a more optimistic place .
Identify the problem or problems you do n’t think you can solve .
It ’s amazing how often you do n’t know why you ’re depressed and how helpful it can be to figure it out .
Making a list of everything that ’s bothering you — a sort of stream - of - consciousness rant on paper — can be a fantastically helpful exercise .
Or if you do know why you ’re depressed , recognizing the cause is n’t that you have a problem per se but rather that you have a problem you do n’t believe you can solve can be remarkably empowering .
Also , sometimes we become depressed not because we have one problem we believe we can’t solve but because we have multiple problems we believe we ca n’t solve .
Handling challenges can be likened to balancing a “ plate ” of a certain size : if we pile too many problems onto it , not only do we risk having it topple over , we often find ourselves wanting to pitch the whole thing on purpose .
When this is the case , allow yourself to only worry about and focus on solving one problem at a time .
Identify the reason a problem seems unsolvable .
As I pointed out in a previous post , Changing Poison Into Medicine , many things erroneously cause us to conclude we ’re deadlocked , chief among them our inability to identify a solution to our problem right now .
Recognize that your thoughts are profoundly influenced by your mood .
Once depression has established itself , it takes on an insidious life of its own , further diminishing your belief in your ability to solve problems , your ability to plan , and your ability to have hope for the future .
In this way the cause of any depression always reinforces itself .
Remember that your depressed self is not your true self .
Whatever life - condition you find yourself in at any one moment always feels like the only life - condition you ’ve ever had or will have .
But your life - condition can and often does change literally from moment to moment .
Understand that antidepressants only treat the symptoms of depression .
None of the foregoing has been intended as a denial that antidepressant medication plays a significant role in the treatment of depression .
In the right patient , antidepressants reduce the symptoms of suffering exceptionally well and can be literally life - saving .
Research is especially clear that combining antidepressant medication with cognitive therapy is more effective than either alone .
But antidepressants can’t make anyone actually happy because happiness is n’t merely the absence of suffering .
The best approach might be to treat the symptoms of depression with antidepressants ( or cognitive therapy or even electroconvulsive therapy ) when symptoms are severe enough to warrant it while at the same time attempting to address the underlying cause of the depression itself .
I fully recognize that as a means to battle depression — especially a deep , all - consuming depression — these suggestions are inadequate .
The point in making them , however , is to emphasize that the single most effective means to resolve a depression is to find a way to tap into our immense power to solve problems .

Shanghai China - Foreign Teachers in Trouble Options

I know this is a forum for speakers of the English Language – not for a group of stranded English teachers in deep trouble in Shanghai , China .
But desperate situations sometimes require desperate means .
I got the idea from the thread on the spelling of the word “ dilemma ” ( yep .
That ’s what I was taught ! ) .
That thread seems to have directed people looking up that word to itself from all over the world – so maybe people looking up “ Shanghai ” “ China ” “ Shanghai Construction Group ” , ” KaiEn ” or “ Foreigners Being Shafted ” might see this thread ?
A week before Christmas on payday , December 17th – a group of “ foreign ” teachers walked into their office at KaiEn English School in Shanghai , China to find it empty of all local staff and the main office locked .
Milling about the echoing halls and classrooms were a collection of suspicious - looking men muscling their way around in suits , a few bewildered students and interested neighbours from other floors in the building .
A couple of phone calls solicited the fact that the Companies Bosses – Super - shafters BrianMcCloskey , Ken Carroll and a dodgy little character called Alex Wee , had all fled the country and KaiEn bank accounts were empty .
The offices were soon thronging with Police , Press and irate students and parents .
I want to make it absolutely clear that events since then have nothing WHATSOEVER to do with any fault on the part of the Chinese Government .
As in most countries in the world , legislation is in the place , the law is clear and we destitute and displaced teachers know there are laws in place to protect us .
But no Government can legislate greed , ignorance or a propensity for the Big Guys to exploit the Little Guys , out of individuals .
Every foreign business in China must have a Chinese partner .
KaiEn ’s was run to ground within 24 hours .
But , once the Chinese staff had been paid AND given compensation under their Labour Laws , this company seems to have decided that a handful of American , British and Australian nationals are not in a position to make waves ; know nothing of Chinese law ; and should just mosey on back to their two cars , double storey mansions , fat bank accounts and the lives of luxury that urban legend holds is the background of every Foreigner in China .
We are hurting , people .
Its now a full month later .
We are owed over two month ’s wages .
Overtime .
Benefits .
Compensation .
Travel Bonuses .
We have no money to live on , let alone buy airoplane tickets outta here with .
One or two of us can afford lawyers but the majority can’t .
Our papers are being withheld from many of us .
We ca n’t get other jobs without papers .
Its damned cold in Shanghai in January and we are trying to save money on heating , facing eviction , living on noodles , crowded into other people ’s places existing on their charity , and abandoned by a media who , quite naturally , do n’t find Foreigners problems stack up against the problems of their own Nationals .
Our respective Embassies have provided nothing but the advice to retain lawyers .
For many , Shanghai is home .
We LIVE here .
Many are married / engaged to Chinese people .
Where would we go ?
How could we exist once we got there ?
Can we get a dialogue going here which will help to bring pressure on these people ?
I ’ll be happy to answer questions and hey , throw in the odd English lesson in my replies !

Romany , all I can think of is my non-negotiable faith that " all things work together for good for those that love God and are the called according to His purpose . " ( Romans 8:28 )
I sympathise with all those suffering as described , and offer my encouragement to trust God since trusting " man " has n't worked out too well .

Dreamy - thanks for your comments .
We know people can't give us any concrete help .
But hope that , by alerting as many people as we can to this situation , and getting some dialogue going wherever we can , Shanghai Construction Group will realise that we are not just a helpless group of abandoned teachers - but that we have the support and the eyes and ears of people from all over .
The lawyers one of our number engaged advised that media attention and pressure be brought to bear .
However conventional media are n't interested .
So I 'm hoping that the Internet community - which has proved in the past to carry a lot of weight in China - can help us to show that we do not stand alone .

I do n't know how the Brits or Ozzies can contact their government , but perhaps the Yankees can contact their Representatives and Senators for assistance in this matter .
Good luck .

That thread seems to have directed people looking up that word to itself from all over the world – so maybe people looking up “ Shanghai ” “ China ” “ Shanghai Construction Group ” , ” KaiEn ” or “ Foreigners Being Shafted ” might see this thread ?
A week before Christmas on payday , December 17th – a group of “ foreign ” teachers walked into their office at KaiEn English School in Shanghai , China to find it empty of all local staff and the main office locked .
Milling about the echoing halls and classrooms were a collection of suspicious - looking men muscling their way around in suits , a few bewildered students and interested neighbours from other floors in the building .
A couple of phone calls solicited the fact that the Companies Bosses – Super - shafters BrianMcCloskey , Ken Carroll and a dodgy little character called Alex Wee , had all fled the country and KaiEn bank accounts were empty .
The offices were soon thronging with Police , Press and irate students and parents .
I want to make it absolutely clear that events since then have nothing WHATSOEVER to do with any fault on the part of the Chinese Government .
As in most countries in the world , legislation is in the place , the law is clear and we destitute and displaced teachers know there are laws in place to protect us .
But no Government can legislate greed , ignorance or a propensity for the Big Guys to exploit the Little Guys , out of individuals .
Every foreign business in China must have a Chinese partner .
KaiEn ’s was run to ground within 24 hours .
But , once the Chinese staff had been paid AND given compensation under their Labour Laws , this company seems to have decided that a handful of American , British and Australian nationals are not in a position to make waves ; know nothing of Chinese law ; and should just mosey on back to their two cars , double storey mansions , fat bank accounts and the lives of luxury that urban legend holds is the background of every Foreigner in China .
We are hurting , people .
Its now a full month later .
We are owed over two month ’s wages .
Overtime .
Benefits .
Compensation .
Travel Bonuses .
We have no money to live on , let alone buy airoplane tickets outta here with .
One or two of us can afford lawyers but the majority can’t .
Our papers are being withheld from many of us .
We ca n’t get other jobs without papers .
Its damned cold in Shanghai in January and we are trying to save money on heating , facing eviction , living on noodles , crowded into other people ’s places existing on their charity , and abandoned by a media who , quite naturally , do n’t find Foreigners problems stack up against the problems of their own Nationals .
Our respective Embassies have provided nothing but the advice to retain lawyers .
For many , Shanghai is home .
We LIVE here .
Many are married / engaged to Chinese people .
Where would we go ?
How could we exist once we got there ?
Can we get a dialogue going here which will help to bring pressure on these people ?
I ’ll be happy to answer questions and hey , throw in the odd English lesson in my replies !
Romany :
I 'm sorry to hear that .
Do you think you may all come together and retain one good lawyer for all of you ?
After all it is the one same case , is n't it ?
I thought your embassies would care more .
Anyway , I think you may still go and talk to them .
Anything they do will help get attention .
Those are what I would do if I were you .
And I think you are right .
You need more people to at least know about what is going on .
So let 's do that .
I must say , I am surprised that the local workers all got paid this time .

Romany , I truly wish I could do something , and , as you say , something concrete , something physical .
The only advice I can offer is get it on facebook and twitter , and in neither place am I active .
The massive outpouring for support for the Haiti survivors from Twitter alone was massive .
A family in the US somewhere ( out west , somewhere ?
Nevada ? Montana ? ) starting a net campaign to help find a missing mother and wife with huge participation .
I know China has a lockdown on a lot of the net , but that would seem to be my best advice .
Get this info to go viral and there will be results of some sort .
It 's a shitty thing to do , but all too often , the little guys get caught in the mechanisms of big business and government is nothing if not big business .
As far as the physical goes , I can crochet ... I can send a blanket , maybe ?
( Though I 'm not sure how fast I can start and finish one . )
Would be happy to put together a care package for you guys . :)
That I am sure we could do here , on this forum , without too much hassle .

I hope all of you teachers out there in China are able to make it through this ordeal .
I 'm not super sharp on getting things to go viral , but if there is some specific way that I can get this attention directly to you and the other teachers so that you can answer the questions ( since I 'm ignorant outside of the content of this thread ) , I will do what I can .
If there is an address that I can send physical goods or money to , please let me know .
EDIT : I meant ordeal , not ideal .
I apologize , especially since they are WAY on the opposite end of the spectrum .

Yeah , if only we could still scale that Great Fire Wall .
The two proxy servers I used are all down .
The new ones I have tried since have never worked .
But I wo n't give up .

Yeah - trying to scale the wall is just about impossible .
Both my blogs and , of course , Face Book are inaccessable .
I know quite a few people on here have blogs - can anybody get some of this story out on theirs ?
( btw - Jack , I tried to register with QQ so at least I could let all my former University students in Ningbo know .
But , although it let me register , as yet I have n't been able to log in ! ) .
Thanks to all who have so far replied .
My problems are made worse by the fact that - unlike those people reparee mentioned , I have n't got a central space to direct people to .
I am just hoping that as many people as possible can post things about this with the words " China " , " Shanghai " , " SCG " or " Shanghai Construction Group " - even the evil trio " Brian McCluskey " , " Ken Carroll " and " Alex Wee " .
( The more those words are hit upon , the better it is for us ) .
Those last two are the Irishmen who , 13 years ago , started off the company that soon became a household name in Shanghai - KaiEn .
Trouble was , they got seduced by the glitzy life styles on offer here .
Not content with just being teachers they started drooling after the cachet of the Fortune 500 companies who were sending staff for tuition .
Got ideas above their station as an earlier generation would have phrased it .
But , despite the imitation life - styles they really were just a coupla bog - trotting school teachers at heart ... so they blew the whole deal .
Alex was a so - called " Investor " who was brought in from Singapore - it was him The Mob were after when the whole thing collapsed .
( Well , we presume it was mainly him ) .
Trouble is , he incriminated an innocent office worker - and her mum - as targets .
What a weasel !.
Thing is , while many Chinese honestly believe that Westerners have no worries , these two knew EXACTLY what they were causing when they sneaked themselves and families out of the country ... to live off our money .
Someone elsewhere I think , mentioned the fact that 80 % of China are still rural workers .
They see movies in which even the lifestyles of Urban Chinese are way beyond them .
As to people from Outside - we are almost like fabled creatures ... no - one has ever seen one !
The 20 % that live in the cities ( and please remember that 20 % when one is talking about an overall population over a BILLION is not a negligible number )
Are part of the new and ever - rising Middle Class .
The upper echelons of which live life - styles which would leave ordinary folk in Usa , Australia , UK , Canada , Europe , absolutely gasping .
Now , the contention is that Foreigners are the Favoured Ones ( in terms of life - style ) so many people assume that we all live over and above anything they can see here .
For the past four years I 've had students congratulating me on learning to ride a bicycle so quickly - they thought all foreigners were two and three car families and do n't even know what a bicycle was .
( They also , despite my enlightenment , still firmly believe it was a Chinese invention ! )
I nearly lost the respect and friendship of another group of students when I told them that , in 2002 I was painting houses in order to feed my kids when I was at University .
First they thought I was lying and could n't understand why .
Then they were shocked and disapointed I had worked " like a peasant " ... and was admitting it .
When our story first hit the Chinese Internet I and another teacher , were labelled a pair of " schmucks " for depending upon our pay checks to live .
The fact that we did n't have bank accounts behind us was regarded as stupidity .
Even if I were to describe the events leading up to this in my case , it is doubtfull they would believe or comprehend .
Even amongst my Chinese friends , the idea that one could have no home to go back to ( two storied mansion or not ) or some kind of access to a bank account somewhere is difficult for them to believe .
It is no wonder , therefore , that Shanghai Construction Group do n't think our problems worth fixing .

reiki - thank you for that .
Unfortunately , this is China .
There is no such thing as a free lunch here .
Or a free lawyer .
The charges quoted to us , btw , are PER HEAD - you do n't get a group discount !

Quote :
While constitutional enforcement is evolving and developing , victims of illegal discrimination might have a chance to succeed in bringing litigation based on anti-discrimination clauses provided in specific laws , supported by constitutional principles .
For example , in addition to banning most forms of discrimination , the Employment Promotion Law examined above provides that workers can file a lawsuit in the People ’s court .
Litigation based on specific laws should be considered as the best means to fight discrimination , mainly because it appears to be more easily enforceable and because the constitutional right of equality is also enshrined in laws like the Labor Law and the Employment Promotion Law .
Nonetheless , three key remaining issues create a significant barrier for discrimination litigation : the limited scope of possible judicial review , the lack of any clear definition of discrimination and the troubles of enforceability at the local level .

Hello Romany , I am very sorry to hear of your situation .
These are the type of folks for whom tarring and feathering seem , not at all a bad punishment .
I 'm sorry I can't be of much help , I 've never been very good at litigation matters .
I hope this thread gets someone 's attention that can help .
Good luck .

In your situation , I can only think of 3 anecdotes that I felt might help to initiate some kind of action on your part :
1. During early 2000 ( I2 K ) there was a need in USA for I.T ( Information Technology ) experts , both in private and Government
sectors .
Govt. expanded the quota for H1B ( skilled workers ) Visa , which spurred the growth of some Employment brokers .
A friend of mine brought 100s of I.T graduates and contracted with Govt. and private upstart software companies like Oracle .
He took a lion share of the revenue and left these graduates holding the bag when contract ended .
Some , who left my friend are now the pillars of Silicon Valley .
2 . Another entrepreneur , under the same visa brought about 20 welders and journeymen of Indian origin from Dubai to work on
shipyards in Louisiana .
Same fate for these workers after the contract with shipping companies ended and the Visa expired for the workers .
Instead of arranging their return , he thought he should feed and find them jobs by housing them in a make - shift building in squalid conditions .
The word got around and the Authorities cracked down on both the employer and the workers .
The workers appealed their deportation order by sitting - in in front of the White House for few days and finally got removed by Police and were cited for trespass .
To their luck , an aspiring attorney did pro bono work and got them Green Card on some ground .
All these guys are now either independent contractors or working directly to employers .
3. Yesterday , I read in the news that the Haitian born Rapper , Wyclef Jean , collected 5 dollars a person by twittering his fans with deposit details and was able to collect more than a million dollars for the victims of earthquake in Haiti .
You have lots of friends in this forum who , including me , may help you tide over in interim , if you care to resort to this method .
These are some moments in life America redeems itself from capitalistic woes by letting freedom to play its part .
May be communism has a way of redeeming itself from situations like this .
Please explore the avenues there , as well .
Good Luck .
We love you .

I read all three entries ( the one you linked to and the two that were linked from that article ) on the status of the KaiEn fiasco .
The most recent one was posted almost an entire month ago ( December 19th ) , and Romany still has n't gotten any aid from the sound of it .
I hope that that Praxis is actually following through with that instead of just making it sound like there 's nothing to worry about , but I 'm skeptical .
How long does it seriously take to begin administering aid to the teachers ?

I read your first post last night , brooded over and was ready to post mine this morning , but when I noticed the message boards are filling rapidly , I hurried to post mine before reading your subsequent posts .
Upon reading , I thought they also deserve my reply .
My posts may appear slanted towards — in favor of China .
I do not mind being called China - lover like some Whites , who are
called Nigger - lovers when they try to balance race relations .
I knew of brown and black skinned people , excellent in grammar and phonetics were turned down to teach English in China by these middle men under the pretext of : Chinese desiring native speakers of English than others .
An insinuation propagated by the employers like your own .
It is the truth and you know the culprits , — who scapegoated China for their inability to cull English teachers from other hues .
When United States lodged a complaint to China about its food shipments being contaminated and caused illness to Americans , China gave the culprit death sentence ; giving the guilt ridden food manufacturers in the U.S embarrassment at best , and callousness at worst .
Some outliers like yourself , unsuspectingly , based on hearsay 's and knee jerk reactions ; calibrate China 's virtues with your imputed mythical standards .
Chinese know the power of Internet ( example , your post ) and the swaying power it has .
They also know that it makes them vulnerable and susceptible for false propaganda .
They see Google a traitor who betrayed their trust .
I am sure your problem will be addressed individually or even collectively if you file it with appropriate authorities without appearing antagonistic with foregone conclusions and refrains .
It is natural for bureaucrats everywhere — to appear fair to avoid negative publicity to protect the image of their country , as sworn officers .
We do it here even for a criminal illegal person .
I am holding out for you to see the light of the day without tinted glasses .

Thanks people who are reading and following this thread : - as you can see , all the entries concerning this lot on local chat threads are from over a month ago - and some were incorrect then anyway .
The one that was written about foreign teachers being sorted while locals were n't , is completely wrong , of course .
The local teachers were PAID IN FULL and WITH COMPENSATION and given all their paper within the week , contrary to what is written above .
The message from Ken Carroll is the one and only thing anyone has heard from him .
As his bio .
photo etc. STILL appear on KaiEn correspondance , sites etc. it was somewhat disingenuous of him to try to distance himself , we consider !
Ginny , I thank you heaps .
We are going this morning for one last ditch ( for me , anyway ) attempt to meet with SCG .
If they refuse once again to talk to us , we will have to go to some other dreary Government office , where we will be given conflicting information by a multitude of people , given copious amounts of papers in CHinese to fill in , told that nothing can be done for at least another 60 days , and sniggered at from behind the counter .
It is a regular routine by now .
I appreciate your offer and will definitely get something to you when I get back later today from this humiliating round .

I forwarded this to a group of " gifted " teachers in U.S.D. 259 system .
We will forward it to the state house tomorrow and if nothing else my daughters next globe report will be on Shanghai China .
I often type one handed depending on what my body feels like doing and you never know who may read something when it is sent to a few hundred people .
I mean after all , there are still " people " ( P.C. ) sending money to Nigeria .
Welcome to the information age .
stranger meets stranger ,
I would make you folks some Chinese food but it is a little out of the way .
The Mexican food in my neighbor hood is superior though .

HelloI forwarded this to a group of " gifted " teachers in U.S.D. 259 system .
We will forward it to the state house tomorrow and if nothing else my daughters next globe report will be on Shanghai China .
I often type one handed depending on what my body feels like doingand you never knowwho may read something when it is sent to a few hundred people .
I mean after all , there are still " people " ( P.C. ) sending money to Nigeria .
Welcome to the information age .
stranger meets stranger , I would make you folks some Chinese food but it is a little out of the way .
The Mexican food in my neighbor hood is superior though .

How are you doing with QQ , Romany ?
Logging in yet ?
I use MSN but I used QQ before .
I can't think of anything that may be wrong .
Can you give me some specifics ?
All my friends use QQ , I 'm sure we can figure it out .

JACK - no luck with QQ but a group of students have a site on there .
They have posted the fact that on Thursday the ex-students of KaiEn and the teachers are all going to SCG together to try to get some answers .
They have invited the Chinese press but another student says that , although its been printed in English speaking press a coupla times , the Chinese Press have been warned off .
We spent all Monday morning at SCG office but they NOW tell us they severed their connection with KIaiEn over a year ago and KaiEn has been operating without a Business Licence for a year .
As many of us got Visa 's during this time that is , of course , simply not true .
We spent the afternoon at the Department of Education but , from 1.30 till 4.30 , never made it past Security .
WICHITARICK - thank you for your actions .
If nothing else , perhaps this will serve as a warning to any teachers lured by the thought of going to China to teach ?
ISAAC - I was a little puzzled by your last response if you do n't mind , may I respond to it privately ?
EVERYONE ELSE - thank you for your support and kind wishes .
Unfortunately , I have run out of time and will have to leave China by next week .
Where I will go and what I will do is still in the lap of the gods .
However , wherever I end up ( and providing I do n't have to sell my lap - top , of course ! ) I will keep on going at this matter .
To complicate matters I have become ill so I apologise for not updating or responding to you all before this .

Romany , I really hope things turn around for you .
I wish you the best of luck in overcoming this situation and hope it leads you to a better opportunity .
Hope you get better , too .
What an awful time to get sick . :(

The school has reopened .
SCG and its subsidiary University JianGong reopened the Xujiahui branch on Feb 2nd .
8 teachers including myself were given our jobs back and I as some kind of spokesperson tried my best to secure more jobs for other teachers but it was impossible at that time .
I was however able to negotiate full back pay up to the date the classes resumed starting from the time we were last paind ( aprox - 3 months ) .
This was a really incredibly thing and to say we are lucky is an understatement .
Sadly , I believe Romany , if I can guess his / her identity , didnt have the time in her / his visa to stay until that date .
And there was also one other complicating factor which meant : he / she got nothing .
I am sorry Romany .
If you know who I am ( and if I am correct in assuming who you are ) then know this : I did my best .
I really did .
And I am so sorry .
The school is not Kaien anymore .
But we are still KaiEn teachers and our students are happy to be back , as are we to be teaching them .
Nice to be able to pay my rent , and my bills , and know that I have a job for at least the next year .
The Chinese partners have been extraordinarily helpful these days .
There is nothing in the way of resentment , given how hard we pushed them , and how deep I stuck my heels in regarding the terms of going back to work , we are working hard as are they .
I feel that they have really felt the pressure to do this , and finally ( albiet much too late for some of us ) things are back to normal .
This isnt my thread , but thanks to the students , to a small group of teachers who pulled together , to some of the local staff who helped us , to my gf for doing an enormous ammount of translating in Shanghainese .
thanks not to the media who turned their backs on us , or to the staff at the Edu Commish who seemed to think we werent worth their time , and refused to meet with us , thanks not to the local boys in blue who as usual did nothing but waste our time and lied to us ,
thanks not to Brian McCloskey the biggest prick and scumbag I ever had the misfortune to work for , and whose Taiwanese Wife I have heard is still in touch with members of her Church here in Shanghai , and who apparently believes : " They lost a lot of money , the business was going under , so the logical thing to do was to leave before they both fell into the big hole "
Nice .
Yes , how logical .
And then you go to jail .
Logically .
Hope I meet you Brian .
So I can stomp a " Big Hole " into your face .
Happy Chinese new year everyone

omg !
Yeah , thanx G - though gotta say I feel absolutely sick to hear how narrowly I escaped coming right .
Yep - had to go : visa ran out on January 27th so flew out that day .
I read how you say that SC have been good to you guys , but hell , if only they had thought to let us know that , finally , they were actually going to stick to what they said , I would not be in the continued mess in which I find myself now .
After 4 years in China - which I regarded as my home - I had to go with the regulation 20 k of luggage - which meant had to abandon most of my clothes , shoes , kitchen appliances , furniture , artifacts , : - all the products of a life one had thought was going to continue in Shanghai .
Not to mention the absolutely ENORMOUS debts now accrued for people who helped to support me , ( not forgetting the 100RMB you slipped me that day , mate ) get me out the country , feed me , pay my rent .... actually , as I write this I am in danger of reverting back to being the " Crying Lady of Shanghai " .
SO :- after stopping in Indonesia to see elder son for a while ( and having him and his gf provide me with every cent I needed ) am in Australia .
Ironic and sad that they have given in their notice and everything is now in train for them to go back to live in China " so they could be closer " to me !!
Anyway , I am being a sad sack here and have n't said how thrilled I am that you all are over that horrible hump we all went through together .
I sincerely hope that from now on everything gets better and better and , in fact , this episode may turn out to have been one that benifitted you after all - increased responsibilities , demonstrable loyalty ,
... and perhaps a certain loss of naievety ?
Also , I think it was a bonding experience for all who went through it , yeah ?
Also , I was blown away by the kind comments and good wishes from all on this forum - what a nice mob of people you all are .
While some said they wished there was something they could do , I need to tell you that you did it :- you let me know there were some total strangers out there who had me wrapped up in their minds ... what a wonderful experience .
So thanx guys .
And , the ways things are panning out , I may very much need to continue to hold that thought in my head .
Btw G , tell C to answer my bloody emails !!!

Dang , that sounds pretty rough .
Having to downsize your belongings is a tough thing to do , and it especially sucks when you 've had to spend hard - earned money to acquire them .
I 've had to downsize my belongings on many occasions , mostly because I have no other home than the apartment I am living in , which has little space .
That is really unfortunate that you had to leave China just as your son and his girlfriend are moving there to be able to see you more often . :(
I wish the best for you Romany .
I hope things start looking better for you and that you are able to enjoy your stay in Australia .

I 'm so glad things are all right !
Well , mostly anyway , but most importantly , that you are okay . :)
I have a few friends in Australia and loved my very , very brief visit there .
If you need anything desperately , please let me know .
I can probably find some things stored away that are no longer needed here .
I know we have kitchen stuff that has never been unpacked from the previous move .
Alas , furniture would be much harder to ship . ;)

Hi Romany , I am very sorry what happen to all of you .. ya ya .
I am now at the final stage of getting online TEFL certificate and I am very looking forward to go to teach in Changsha ( also because I am going to meet a beautiful girl who I am pen pal more then a year ) .. I am also in not good financial situation despite living in London .. and despite living even in a good area!lol .
I am in fact unemployed and because I made a very stupid and fatal innocent mistake of changing the Friday for a Thursday in my head so I did not sign on in Job center and subsequently was penalized by taking benefits for all month ..
But I think you are in much worse situation ..
I have very little money but I would like to help you at least little bit because I know it really sucks your circumstances ..
Can you give me you contact details so we can further discuss I can transfer you some petty money ..
I know I wo n't make a big difference but every little helps and I think that if everyone gives you a little here on this forum it may in total give a lot ( or at least a bit ) .
If you do n't mind I would also later ask for some advise as I see you are experienced English teacher ?
Best wishes ,
Albert

I 'm so sorry all of you are in so bad circumstances .
there are some sites online to set up petitions for help .
Suscribed people may state their support to your cause and spread all around the news of your situation .
publicity may be your best ally .
Good luck !
and if your are christian God bless and help you all .
I f not I hope

zonbi ( zombie ) .
The ancestors are propitiated when their dead bones are resurrected and put on display for veneration , like a( zombie ) .
Pardon me if I fail to squeeze out a tear for Conan O’Brien .
It ’s not just the fact that nearly everyone in the world has larger problems than whether to walk away from a job that pays more than $ 10 million a year because you feel your employer has treated you unfairly .
Though that ’s a perfectly sufficient reason .
It ’s that , amid all the public vilification of Jay Leno and the NBC Universal chief executive Jeff Zucker , no one seems to want to trace this slap fight back to where it began : the 2004 deal in which Mr. Leno agreed to step aside as “ Tonight Show ” host in five years .
That arrangement was a huge concession to Mr. O’Brien , negotiated by NBC out of fear that he would leave for another network .
No one tied him down and forced him to sign it , even though it was nearly as wrongheaded , given its duration and the stakes involved , as NBC ’s subsequent decision to move Mr. Leno to 10 p.m .
Today ’s situation flows directly from that weak - kneed compromise of 2004 , which created the Original Embarrassment : Mr. Leno ’s status as lame duck .
How did the nefarious , underhanded , egomaniacal Mr. Leno respond ?
By doing his job : he continued to put on the highest - rated late - night show on television throughout the intervening five years , making so much money for NBC that they felt they had to find some way to keep him around .
The demonizing of Mr. Leno and corresponding beatification of Mr. O’Brien seem to be based on some weird notion of noblesse oblige : that ceding the stage to Mr. O’Brien would be the proper thing to do .
This ignores the obvious facts that ( 1 ) television is a business and ( 2 ) it ’s NBC ’s money .
Mr. Leno , his predictably dismal prime - time ratings aside , is the reigning king of late night ; NBC would n’t be at this pass if it did n’t think that he could immediately return to 11:35 and outperform Mr. O’Brien .
It seems obvious that what ’s really at play here is a generation gap .
A younger , more vocal , more online audience simply does n’t like Mr. Leno ’s show , which has gradually come to represent an entire pre-digital , Middle American culture that the Internet commentariat wishes would just get out of the way .
Unfortunately for them , their parents are more likely to be watching television at 11:35 p.m. than they are .
Key Republican and independent senators and former members of the Bush administration spoke up Sunday in support of Janet Napolitano , the secretary of homeland security , despite stinging criticism last week of her comments that a Nigerian ’s foiled effort to blow up a Detroit - bound airliner on Christmas Day showed that “ the system worked really smoothly . ”
Michael Chertoff , her predecessor as homeland security secretary , when asked on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press ” television program whether he had confidence in Ms. Napolitano , said forcefully , “ I do . ”
Susan Collins of Maine , the ranking Republican on the Senate homeland security committee , said she found Ms. Napolitano ’s comments “ bizarre and inappropriate . ”
Nevertheless , she said , she has confidence in Ms. Napolitano and that she is working hard to keep the nation safe .
Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut , who heads the homeland security committee and has assailed the Obama ’s administration failure to prevent the Nigerian suspect , Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , from boarding the Northwest Airlines plane , said on the same program that Ms. Napolitano had done a “ tremendous ” job .
He said her words were “ subject to a misunderstanding ” and that he did n’t agree with her choice of words , but he too had confidence in her work .
Mark Summerfield discusses using regular expressions in Python 3 , including Python 's regular expression language and the regular expression module .

Python 's Regular Expression Language
The Regular Expression Module
A regular expression is a compact notation for representing a collection of strings .
What makes regular expressions so powerful is that a single regular expression can represent an unlimited number of strings — providing they meet the regular expression 's requirements .
Regular expressions ( which we will mostly call " regexes " from now on ) are defined using a mini-language that is completely different from Python — but Python includes the re module through which we can seamlessly create and use regexes .*
Regexes are used for five main purposes :
Parsing : identifying and extracting pieces of text that match certain criteria — regexes are used for creating ad hoc parsers and also by traditional parsing tools
Searching : locating substrings that can have more than one form , for example , finding any of " pet.png " , " pet.jpg " , " pet.jpeg " , or " pet.svg " while avoiding " carpet.png " and similar
Searching and replacing : replacing everywhere the regex matches with a string , for example , finding " bicycle " or " human powered vehicle " and replacing either with " bike "
Splitting strings : splitting a string at each place the regex matches , for example , splitting everywhere colon - space or equals ( " : " or " = " ) occurs
Validation : checking whether a piece of text meets some criteria , for example , contains a currency symbol followed by digits
The regexes used for searching , splitting , and validation are often fairly small and understandable , making them ideal for these purposes .
However , although regexes are widely and successfully used to create parsers , they do have a limitation in that area :
They are only able to deal with recursively structured text if the maximum level of recursion is known .
Also , large and complex regexes can be difficult to read and maintain .
So apart from simple cases , for parsing the best approach is to use a tool designed for the purpose — for example , use a dedicated XML parser for XML .
If such a parser is n't available , then an alternative to using regexes is to use a generic parsing tool , an approach that is covered in Chapter 14 .
Parsing XML files 312
At its simplest a regular expression is an expression ( e.g. , a literal character ) , optionally followed by a quantifier .
More complex regexes consist of any number of quantified expressions and may include assertions and may be influenced by flags .
This chapter 's first section introduces and explains all the key regular expression concepts and shows pure regular expression syntax — it makes minimal reference to Python itself .
Then the second section shows how to use regular expressions in the context of Python programming , drawing on all the material covered in the earlier sections .
Readers familiar with regular expressions who just want to learn how they work in Python could skip to the second section ( 499 ) .
The chapter covers the complete regex language offered by the re module , including all the assertions and flags .
We indicate regular expressions in the text using bold , show where they match using underlining , and show captures using shading .
Python 's Regular Expression Language
In this section we look at the regular expression language in four subsections .
The first subsection shows how to match individual characters or groups of characters , for example , match a , or match b , or match either a or b .
The second subsection shows how to quantify matches , for example , match once , or match at least once , or match as many times as possible .
The third subsection shows how to group subexpressions and how to capture matching text , and the final subsection shows how to use the language 's assertions and flags to affect how regular expressions work .
Characters and Character Classes
The simplest expressions are just literal characters , such as a or 5 , and if no quantifier is explicitly given it is taken to be " match one occurrence " .
For example , the regex tune consists of four expressions , each implicitly quantified to match once , so it matches one t followed by one u followed by one n followed by one e , and hence matches the strings tune and at tune d .
Although most characters can be used as literals , some are " special characters " — these are symbols in the regex language and so must be escaped by preceding them with a backslash ( \ ) to use them as literals .
The special characters are \.^$ ?+*{ } [ ] ( ) | .
Most of Python 's standard string escapes can also be used within regexes , for example ,
for newline and \t for tab , as well as hexadecimal escapes for characters using the \x HH , \u HHHH , and \U HHHHHHHH syntaxes .
String escapes 66
In many cases , rather than matching one particular character we want to match any one of a set of characters .
This can be achieved by using a character class — one or more characters enclosed in square brackets .
( This has nothing to do with a Python class , and is simply the regex term for " set of characters " . )
A character class is an expression , and like any other expression , if not explicitly quantified it matches exactly one character ( which can be any of the characters in the character class ) .
For example , the regex r[ ea ] d matches both red and rad ar , but not read .
Similarly , to match a single digit we can use the regex [ 0123456789 ] .
For convenience we can specify a range of characters using a hyphen , so the regex [ 0 - 9 ] also matches a digit .
It is possible to negate the meaning of a character class by following the opening bracket with a caret , so [ ^0 - 9 ] matches any character that is not a digit .
Note that inside a character class , apart from \ , the special characters lose their special meaning , although in the case of ^ it acquires a new meaning ( negation ) if it is the first character in the character class , and otherwise is simply a literal caret .
Also , - signifies a character range unless it is the first character , in which case it is a literal hyphen .
Since some sets of characters are required so frequently , several have shorthand forms — these are shown in Table 13.1 .
With one exception the shorthands can be used inside character sets , so for example , the regex [ \dA - Fa-f ] matches any hexadecimal digit .
The exception is .
which is a shorthand outside a character class but matches a literal .
inside a character class .

Quantifiers
A quantifier has the form { m , n } where m and n are the minimum and maximum times the expression the quantifier applies to must match .
For example , both e{1,1}e { 1,1} and e{2,2} match f ee l , but neither matches felt .
Writing a quantifier after every expression would soon become tedious , and is certainly difficult to read .
Fortunately , the regex language supports several convenient shorthands .
If only one number is given in the quantifier it is taken to be both the minimum and the maximum , so e{2} is the same as e{2,2} .
And as we noted in the preceding section , if no quantifier is explicitly given , it is assumed to be one ( i.e. , { 1,1} or { 1} ) ; therefore , ee is the same as e{1,1}e { 1,1} and e{1}e{1} , so both e{2} and ee match f ee l but not felt .
Meaning of the flags 496
Having a different minimum and maximum is often convenient .
For example , to match travelled and traveled ( both legitimate spellings ) , we could use either travel { 1, 2}ed or travell {0 , 1}ed .
The {0,1} quantification is so often used that it has its own shorthand form , ? , so another way of writing the regex ( and the one most likely to be used in practice ) is travell?ed .
Two other quantification shorthands are provided : + which stands for { 1 , n } ( " at least one " ) and * which stands for {0 , n } ( " any number of " ) ; in both cases n is the maximum possible number allowed for a quantifier , usually at least 32767 .
All the quantifiers are shown in Table 13.2 .
Table 13.2 .
Regular Expression Quantifiers
Syntax Meaning e ? or e {0,1} Greedily match zero or one occurrence of expression e e ?? or e {0,1} ?
Nongreedily match zero or one occurrence of expression e e + or e { 1 , } Greedily match one or more occurrences of expression e e +? or e { 1,} ?
Nongreedily match one or more occurrences of expression e e * or e {0 , } Greedily match zero or more occurrences of expression e e *? or e {0,} ?
Nongreedily match zero or more occurrences of expression e e { m } Match exactly m occurrences of expression e e { m , } Greedily match at least m occurrences of expression e e { m , } ?
Nongreedily match at least m occurrences of expression e e { , n } Greedily match at most n occurrences of expression e e { , n } ?
Nongreedily match at most n occurrences of expression e e { m , n } Greedily match at least m and at most n occurrences of expression e e { m , n } ?
Nongreedily match at least m and at most n occurrences of expression e
The + quantifier is very useful .
For example , to match integers we could use \d + since this matches one or more digits .
This regex could match in two places in the string 4588.91 , for example , 4588 .91 and 4588 .
91 .
Sometimes typos are the result of pressing a key too long .
We could use the regex bevel+ed to match the legitimate beveled and bevelled , and the incorrect bevellled .
If we wanted to standardize on the one l spelling , and match only occurrences that had two or more ls , we could use bevell+ed to find them .
The * quantifier is less useful , simply because it can so often lead to unexpected results .
For example , supposing that we want to find lines that contain comments in Python files , we might try searching for #* .
But this regex will match any line whatsoever , including blank lines because the meaning is " match any number of # s " — and that includes none .
As a rule of thumb for those new to regexes , avoid using * at all , and if you do use it ( or if you use ? ) , make sure there is at least one other expression in the regex that has a nonzero quantifier — so at least one quantifier other than * or ?
since both of these can match their expression zero times .
It is often possible to convert * uses to + uses and vice versa .
For example , we could match " tasselled " with at least one l using tassell*ed or tassel+ed , and match those with two or more ls using tasselll*ed or tassell+ed .
If we use the regex \d + it will match 136 .
But why does it match all the digits , rather than just the first one ?
By default , all quantifiers are greedy — they match as many characters as they can .
We can make any quantifier nongreedy ( also called minimal ) by following it with a ?
symbol .
( The question mark has two different meanings — on its own it is a shorthand for the {0,1} quantifier , and when it follows a quantifier it tells the quantifier to be nongreedy . )
For example , \d+? can match the string 136 in three different places : 1 36 , 1 3 6 , and 13 6 .
Here is another example : \d ?? matches zero or one digits , but prefers to match none since it is nongreedy — on its own it suffers the same problem as * in that it will match nothing , that is , any text at all .
Nongreedy quantifiers can be useful for quick and dirty XML and HTML parsing .
For example , to match all the image tags , writing < img . *>
( match one " < " , then one " i " , then one " m " , then one " g " , then zero or more of any character apart from newline , then one " > " ) will not work because the .* part is greedy and will match everything including the tag 's closing > , and will keep going until it reaches the last > in the entire text .
Three solutions present themselves ( apart from using a proper parser ) .
One is < img [ ^ > ]*>
( match < img , then any number of non- > characters and then the tag 's closing > character ) , another is < img .*?>
( match <img , then any number of characters , but nongreedily , so it will stop immediately before the tag 's closing > , and then the > ) , and a third combines both , as in < img [ ^ > ]*?> .
None of them is correct , though , since they can all match < img > , which is not valid .
Since we know that an image tag must have a src attribute , a more accurate regex is < img\s + [^>]*? src=\w +[^>]*?> .
This matches the literal characters < img , then one or more whitespace characters , then nongreedily zero or more of anything except > ( to skip any other attributes such as alt ) , then the src attribute ( the literal characters src= then at least one " word " character ) , and then any other non- > characters ( including none ) to account for any other attributes , and finally the closing > .
Grouping and Capturing
In practical applications we often need regexes that can match any one of two or more alternatives , and we often need to capture the match or some part of the match for further processing .
Also , we sometimes want a quantifier to apply to several expressions .
All of these can be achieved by grouping with ( ) , and in the case of alternatives using alternation with | .
Alternation is especially useful when we want to match any one of several quite different alternatives .
For example , the regex aircraft |airplane|jet will match any text that contains " aircraft " or " airplane " or " jet " .
The same thing can be achieved using the regex air ( craft|plane ) |jet .
Here , the parentheses are used to group expressions , so we have two outer expressions , air ( craft|plane ) and jet .
The first of these has an inner expression , craft|plane , and because this is preceded by air the first outer expression can match only " aircraft " or " airplane " .
Parentheses serve two different purposes — to group expressions and to capture the text that matches an expression .
We will use the term group to refer to a grouped expression whether it captures or not , and capture and capture group to refer to a captured group .
If we used the regex ( aircraft|airplane|jet ) it would not only match any of the three expressions , but would also capture whichever one was matched for later reference .
Compare this with the regex ( air( craft|plane ) | jet ) which has two captures if the first expression matches ( " aircraft " or " airplane " as the first capture and " craft " or " plane " as the second capture ) , and one capture if the second expression matches ( " jet " ) .
We can switch off the capturing effect by following an opening parenthesis with ? : , so for example , ( air ( ? : craft|plane ) | jet ) will have only one capture if it matches ( " aircraft " or " airplane " or " jet " ) .
A grouped expression is an expression and so can be quantified .
Like any other expression the quantity is assumed to be one unless explicitly given .
For example , if we have read a text file with lines of the form key=value , where each key is alphanumeric , the regex ( \w + ) =(.+ ) will match every line that has a nonempty key and a nonempty value .
( Recall that .
matches anything except newlines . )
And for every line that matches , two captures are made , the first being the key and the second being the value .
For example , the key=value regular expression will match the entire line topic = physical geography with the two captures shown shaded .
Notice that the second capture includes some whitespace , and that whitespace before the = is not accepted .
We could refine the regex to be more flexible in accepting whitespace , and to strip off unwanted whitespace using a somewhat longer version :
[ \t ] *( \w + ) [ \t ] *=[ \t ] *(.+)
This matches the same line as before and also lines that have whitespace around the = sign , but with the first capture having no leading or trailing whitespace , and the second capture having no leading whitespace .
For example : topic = physical geography .
We have been careful to keep the whitespace matching parts outside the capturing parentheses , and to allow for lines that have no whitespace at all .
We did not use \s to match whitespace because that matches newlines (
) which could lead to incorrect matches that span lines ( e.g. , if the re.
MULTILINE flag is used ) .
And for the value we did not use \S to match nonwhitespace because we want to allow for values that contain whitespace ( e.g. , English sentences ) .
To avoid the second capture having trailing whitespace we would need a more sophisticated regex ; we will see this in the next subsection .
Regex flags 502
Captures can be referred to using backreferences , that is , by referring back to an earlier capture group . *
One syntax for backreferences inside regexes themselves is \ i where i is the capture number .
Captures are numbered starting from one and increasing by one going from left to right as each new ( capturing ) left parenthesis is encountered .
For example , to simplistically match duplicated words we can use the regex ( \w+ ) \s+\1 which matches a " word " , then at least one whitespace , and then the same word as was captured .
( Capture number 0 is created automatically without the need for parentheses ; it holds the entire match , that is , what we show underlined . )
We will see a more sophisticated way to match duplicate words later .
In long or complicated regexes it is often more convenient to use names rather than numbers for captures .
This can also make maintenance easier since adding or removing capturing parentheses may change the numbers but wo n't affect names .
To name a capture we follow the opening parenthesis with ?
P< name > .
For example , (? P < key >\w + ) =(? P< value >.+ ) has two captures called " key " and " value " .
The syntax for backreferences to named captures inside a regex is ( ? P= name ) .
For example , (? P < word >\w + ) \s+(?
P=word ) matches duplicate words using a capture called " word " .
Assertions and Flags
One problem that affects many of the regexes we have looked at so far is that they can match more or different text than we intended .
For example , the regex aircraft|airplane|jet will match " waterjet " and " jetski " as well as " jet " .
This kind of problem can be solved by using assertions .
An assertion does not match any text , but instead says something about the text at the point where the assertion occurs .
One assertion is \b ( word boundary ) , which asserts that the character that precedes it must be a " word " ( \w ) and the character that follows it must be a non" word " ( \ W ) , or vice versa .
For example , although the regex jet can match twice in the text the jet and jetski are noisy , that is , the jet and jet ski are noisy , the regex \bjet\b will match only once , the jet and jetski are noisy .
In the context of the original regex , we could write it either as \baircraft \b| \bairplane \b|\bjet\b or more clearly as \b (?:aircraft|airplane|jet ) \b , that is , word boundary , noncapturing expression , word boundary .
Many other assertions are supported , as shown in Table 13.3 .
We could use assertions to improve the clarity of a key=value regex , for example , by changing it to ^( \w + ) = ( [ ^
]+ ) and setting the re.
MULTILINE flag to ensure that each key=value is taken from a single line with no possibility of spanning lines — providing no part of the regex matches a newline , so we can't use , say , \s .
( The flags are shown in Table 13.5 ; 502 ; their syntaxes are described at the end of this subsection , and examples are given in the next section . )
And if we want to strip whitespace from the ends and use named captures , the regex becomes :
^[ \t ] *(? P< key >\w + ) [ \t ] *=[ \ t ] *(? P< value > [ ^
] + ) (?<![ \t ] )
Table 13.3 .
Regular Expression Assertions
Symbol Meaning ^ Matches at the start ; also matches after each newline with the re.MULTILINE flag $ Matches at the end ; also matches before each newline with the re.
MULTILINE flag \A Matches at the start \b Matches at a " word " boundary ; influenced by the re .
ASCII flag — inside a character class this is the escape for the backspace character \B Matches at a non -" word " boundary ; influenced by the re .
ASCII flag \Z Matches at the end ( ?= e )
Matches if the expression e matches at this assertion but does not advance over it — called lookahead or positive lookahead ( ?! e )
Matches if the expression e does not match at this assertion and does not advance over it — called negative lookahead ( ?<= e )
Matches if the expression e matches immediately before this assertion — called positive lookbehind (?<! e )
Matches if the expression e does not match immediately before this assertion — called negative lookbehind
Even though this regex is designed for a fairly simple task , it looks quite complicated .
One way to make it more maintainable is to include comments in it .
This can be done by adding inline comments using the syntax ( ?# the comment ) , but in practice comments like this can easily make the regex even more difficult to read .
A much nicer solution is to use the re.VERBOSE flag — this allows us to freely use whitespace and normal Python comments in regexes , with the one constraint that if we need to match whitespace we must either use \s or a character class such as [ ] .
Here 's the key=value regex with comments :
Regex flags 502
^ [ \t ] * # start of line and optional leading whitespace (? P< key >\w + ) # the key text [ \t ] *= [ \t ] * # the equals with optional surrounding whitespace ( ? P< value > [ ^
]+ ) # the value text ( ?<![ \t ] ) # negative lookbehind to avoid trailing whitespace
Regex flags 502
In the context of a Python program we would normally write a regex like this inside a raw triple quoted string — raw so that we do n't have to double up the backslashes , and triple quoted so that we can spread it over multiple lines .
Raw strings
67
In addition to the assertions we have discussed so far , there are additional assertions which look at the text in front of ( or behind ) the assertion to see whether it matches ( or does not match ) an expression we specify .
The expressions that can be used in lookbehind assertions must be of fixed length ( so the quantifiers ? , + , and * cannot be used , and numeric quantifiers must be of a fixed size , for example , { 3} ) .
In the case of the key=value regex , the negative lookbehind assertion means that at the point it occurs the preceding character must not be a space or a tab .
This has the effect of ensuring that the last character captured into the " value " capture group is not a space or tab ( yet without preventing spaces or tabs from appearing inside the captured text ) .
Let 's consider another example .
Suppose we are reading a multiline text that contains the names " Helen Patricia Sharman " , " Jim Sharman " , " Sharman Joshi " , " Helen Kelly " , and so on , and we want to match " Helen Patricia " , but only when referring to " Helen Patricia Sharman " .
The easiest way is to use the regex \ b ( Helen\s + Patricia ) \s + Sharman\b .
But we could also achieve the same thing using a lookahead assertion , for example , \b( Helen\s + Patricia ) (?=\s + Sharman\b ) .
This will match " Helen Patricia " only if it is preceded by a word boundary and followed by whitespace and " Sharman " ending at a word boundary .
To capture the particular variation of the forenames that is used ( " Helen " , " Helen P. " , or " Helen Patricia " ) , we could make the regex slightly more sophisticated , for example , \b( Helen ( ?:\s +(?: P\. |Patricia ) ) ? )\s+(?
=Sharman\b ) .
This matches a word boundary followed by one of the forename forms — but only if this is followed by some whitespace and then " Sharman " and a word boundary .
Note that only two syntaxes perform capturing , ( e ) and ( ? P< name > e ) .
None of the other parenthesized forms captures .
This makes perfect sense for the lookahead and lookbehind assertions since they only make a statement about what follows or precedes them — they are not part of the match , but rather affect whether a match is made .
It also makes sense for the last two parenthesized forms that we will now consider .
We saw earlier how we can backreference a capture inside a regex either by number ( e.g. , \ 1 ) or by name ( e.g. , ( ? P= name ) ) .
It is also possible to match conditionally depending on whether an earlier match occurred .
The syntaxes are ( ? ( id ) yes_exp ) and ( ? ( id ) yes_exp | no_exp ) .
The id is the name or number of an earlier capture that we are referring to .
If the capture succeeded the yes_exp will be matched here .
If the capture failed the no_exp will be matched if it is given .
Let 's consider an example .
Suppose we want to extract the filenames referred to by the src attribute in HTML img tags .
We will begin just by trying to match the src attribute , but unlike our earlier attempt we will account for the three forms that the attribute 's value can take : single quoted , double quoted , and unquoted .
Here is an initial attempt : src= ( [ " ' ] ) ( [ ^ " '> ]+ ) \1 .
The ( [ ^ " '> ]+ ) part captures a greedy match of at least one character that is n't a quote or > .
This regex works fine for quoted filenames , and thanks to the \1 matches only when the opening and closing quotes are the same .
But it does not allow for unquoted filenames .
To fix this we must make the opening quote optional and therefore match only if it is present .
Here is a revised regex : src= ( [ " ' ] ) ? ( [ ^ " ' > ]+ ) ( ?
( 1) \1 ) .
We did not provide a no_exp since there is nothing to match if no quote is given .
Unfortunately , this does n't work quite right .
It will work fine for quoted filenames , but for unquoted filenames it will work only if the src attribute is the last attribute in the tag ; otherwise it will incorrectly match text into the next attribute .
The solution is to treat the two cases ( quoted and unquoted ) separately , and to use alternation : src= ( ( [ " ' ] ) ( [ ^\ 1 > ]+? ) \1 | ( [ ^ " ' >]+ ) ) .
Now let 's see the regex in context , complete with named groups , nonmatching parentheses , and comments :
< img\s + # start of the tag [ ^ >]*?
# any attributes that precede the src src= # start of the src attribute (? : (? P< quote > [ " ' ] ) # opening quote ( ? P< qimage > [ ^\ 1 > ]+? ) # image filename (? P=quote ) # closing quote matching the opening quote | # --- or alternatively --- (? P< uimage > [ ^ " ' >]+ ) # unquoted image filename ) [ ^ > ]*?
# any attributes that follow the src > # end of the tag
The indentation is just for clarity .
The noncapturing parentheses are used for alternation .
The first alternative matches a quote ( either single or double ) , then the image filename ( which may contain any characters except for the quote that matched or > ) , and finally , another quote which must be the same as the matching quote .
We also had to use minimal matching , +? , for the file - name , to ensure that the match does n't extend beyond the first matching closing quote .
This means that a filename such as " I 'm here !. png " will match correctly .
Note also that to refer to the matching quote inside the character class we had to use a numbered backreference , \1 , instead of ( ? P=quote ) , since only numbered backreferences work inside character classes .
The second alternative matches an unquoted filename — a string of characters that do n't include quotes , spaces , or > .
Due to the alternation , the filename is captured in " qimage " ( capture number 2 ) or in " uimage " ( capture number 3 , since ( ? P=quote ) matches but does n't capture ) , so we must check for both .
The final piece of regex syntax that Python 's regular expression engine offers is a means of setting the flags .
Usually the flags are set by passing them as additional parameters when calling the re.compile ( ) function , but sometimes it is more convenient to set them as part of the regex itself .
The syntax is simply (? flags ) where flags is one or more of a ( the same as passing re .
ASCII ) , i ( re .
IGNORECASE ) , m ( re. MULTILINE ) , s ( re. DOTALL ) , and x ( re .
VERBOSE ).*
If the flags are set this way they should be put at the start of the regex ; they match nothing , so their effect on the regex is only to set the flags .
Big O notation
Warning :
This blogpost has been posted over two years ago .
That is a long time in development - world !
The story here may not be relevant , complete or secure .
Code might not be complete or obsoleted , and even my current vision might have ( completely ) changed on the subject .
So please do read further , but use it with caution .
Normally you would develop against a test - database .
It probably contains about 10 people so you can do your programming and testing ..
Once it ’s done and QA ’d , it will go live and people start to visit the site .
After a year or so , .. the site is too slow .
Adding more db servers is of no use , your system administrator is spending his holiday inside the my.cnf ’s and after dumping a gazzilion GB ’s of extra memory to the systems does n’t help at all …
Sounds like it ’s the code that ’s falling behind .. it cannot cope sorting or handling user lists of 40.000 people , or arrays with more than a million items and even simple validation functions are way to slow .. why ?
what just happened ?
Most PHP developers have never heard of Big - O , yet in web development big - O is maybe more important than any other aspect of development ( ok , except for systems and OS programming maybe :) ) .
Centralized code can be executed by only 10 users a day , but the same code could quite possibly be run thousands of times per minute .
What is big O ?
Big -O , or the landau notation is a mathematical principle that defines how well a function scales in respect to it ’s arguments .
To put it in plain English : big - O tells you how the relation in time between a strpos ( ) function with a 10 - char long string argument and a 1000000 - char long string argument .
It wo n’t tell you the specific times , but more the ratio between them on how many times faster or slower it is .
So , what ’s the deal you might ask ?
A lot …
Suppose you have a function that would sort data in array on certain conditions ..
For instance , on alphabetical order by last name .
Everybody can image that sorting 10 users would be a lot quicker than sorting 10 million users ..
But how much quicker or better yet : how much longer would the latter take ?
When knowing the answer to this question , you KNOW how fast your code will be with a lot of users .
You will know what the first bottleneck will be .. your code or the hardware .
In other words , you just became aware of scalability .
Example 1 :
Suppose you have a function called IsEven ( ) :
function isEven ( $ iNumber ) { return ( ( $ iNumber & 1 ) == 0 ) ; }
This function will check if a number is even , and if so , returns boolean true , otherwise it will return boolean false .
For this function it does not matter if $ iNumber is int ( 1 ) , or int( 100000005 ) .
If will always take the same amount of time for the function to do the check and return .
Now suppose we have written the function this way :
function isEven ( $ iNumber ) { $ b Even = true ; for ( $ i = 0 ; $ i != abs ( $ iNumber ) ; $ i ++ ) { if ( $ b Even == true ) { $ b
Even = false ; } else { $ b Even = true ; } } return $ bEven ; }
Granted , it does n’t make much sense to check it this way .. but I occasionally see code where the wrong algorithms are used so this example will suffice to make my point .
When we do a is Even ( 1 ) , the for - loop will only be called once .
It ’s fast enough so no problems there .
However , when we want to check the number 1000000 we might run into a wee bit of trouble since the function has to loop 1000000 times .
If we would put the first example function into a graph , where the X axis is $ iNumber ( ranging from 1 to 1000 ) and the time spend in the function on the Y axis , we would get a graph with a straight horizontal line .
This would indicate that it does n’t matter what number is given to the function , it always returns in the same time .
This is called O ( 1 ) , which is the most optimized function .
It will always run in the same time no matter what you feed it .
It ’s a scalability dream come true so to speak :)
Now .. let ’s analyze the second function .
If we would plot $ iNumber against time , we would see a straight line going up .
This is more or less a straight line and will be O( N ) ( where N stands for the number of arguments or argument ) .
The number of arguments is in direct relation with the time .
Example 2 :
function getModuleInfoByID
( $ iModuleID ) { foreach ( $ this -> _aModuleInfo as $ aInfo ) { if ( $ aInfo [ ' id ' ] == $ iModuleID ) return $ aInfo ; } return null ; }
This method will return the module information of a specified ID or it will return null when the ID is not found .
It is a very common way to find data by browsing over an array and return the correct one when found .
Functions like these would be O(n ) where N stands for the number of moduleInfo ’s we have in our $ _aModuleInfo property .
How could we optimize a function like this ?
It would be nice to get rid of the iteration .
Those pesky things are always a good way of throwing your code way down the O-line :)
In order to do that , we have to change some other things as well ..
For instance , .. if we made $ _aModuleInfo into a associative array with the ID as key , we would suffice with a function like this :
function getModuleInfoByID
( $ iModuleID ) { if ( isset ( $ this -> _aModuleInfo [ $ iModuleID ] ) ) return $ this -> _aModuleInfo [ $ iModuleID ] ; return null ; }
at this point , we do n’t care how long our $ _aModule Info array is .
It would not need to iterate over anything anymore and it does n’t matter if we got 1 moduleInfo item , or 1 million .
However , there are some catches :
what is the behavior of the isset ( ) ?
Is it O ( 1 ) or maybe O( n ) or even worse ?
You have to find that out as well which means you need to time your functions ( and calls in those functions ) .
You are only checking on PHP - level .
It could be a whole different ballgame on CPU - level .
For instance : numeric arrays should be a lot faster than associative arrays ( since they do n’t involve a lookup of the hash ) .
However , there is no real difference in time between an numeric and associative array in PHP .
The different O’s
There are too many and they are too complex :)
Just stick with the basic few and see to which one your function behaves ..
You probably never need an exact formula but as long as you know that your function is more behaving like O ( log N ) instead of O ( N ) , you know enough ..
A list of O - functions , ranging from the best to the worst :
O(1 )
Constant time ..
Arguments do not matter and the function duration stays always the same .
O ( log N )
Logaritmic time ..
The function time will increase rapidly in the beginning , but after a while they do n’t have much impact .
These are good when you know you always have a lot of items ( like sorting users , articles , comments etc ) .
O(n ) Linear .
The number of arguments is in direct relation with the time .
Twice the number of arguments means twice the duration of the function .
O( n^2 ) Quadratic .
Most of the time it means 2 iterations of the same dataset ( like many unoptimized sorts algorithms ) .
O( n^3 ) Cubic .
The same as quadratic , but with one more extra loop .
Recipe for disaster to happen :) .
O(n ! ) Factorial .
These graphs go practically straight up .
( for instance , faculty of 10 = 3628800 , which means a lot of iterations ) .
If you have functionality that behaves this way , really think about rewriting them since they will be very , very slow in a very short time .
From http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bestand:Exponential.png, the red line is linear O ( n ) , the blue one cubic O( n ^3 ) and the green one exponential O ( 2^n ) .
Note that even though the green once stays the best one until 8 items , after 10 items it is the worst .
When fetching data , we statistically have to search only half the array .
To find a random number between 0 and 100 , there is a 50 % change that it will be lower than , and 50 % change it will be higher ( or equal ) than 50 .
However , big - O will define the worst case scenario .
So searching sequentially trough an N - array will be O ( N ) , not O ( N/2 ) .
Big - O Catches
Note that an O - notation does not say anything about speed itself .
It only tells you about speed relative to the arguments .
For example , in some situations , a O ( n ) function could be faster then a O ( log n ) or even a O ( 1 ) function .
However , there will be a break - even point in where the other functions will be faster .
It ’s a trade - off you have to make between function and algorithm complexity and speed .
Time your functionality .. time it again and again and see the results .. they might not be as bad as you think ( or maybe they are even worse ; ) ) .
Code speaks for itself , but without timing you just do n’t know :)
Conclusion
Know your functions and know how they behave .
But always make sure you do n’t over - optimize things .. making everything O ( 1 ) is a nice goal but realistically can never be done and there will always be a trade off between development time / budget and speed / optimization .
I sit in one of the dives
On Fifty - second Street
Uncertain and afraid
As the clever hopes expire
Of a low dishonest decade :
LONDON , U.K. —
It was a different time and a different place when W.H. Auden coined the phrase " low , dishonest decade , " but it is as apt a way of describing the Two - Thousand Noughties as it was the 1930s .
I could sit down over the Twelve Days of Christmas and easily write 10,000 bitter words a day about all the low , dishonest things the great and the good and we ordinary mortals got up to since the turn of the millennium .
I 'd have written a 360 - page book by the time the holiday was over .
You could start with the stolen American election of 2000 and end with the Obama team doing nothing about Goldman Sachs ' bonuses , stopping off along the way to visit the useless egocentricity of Davos-man and woman and the bloody duplicity of Israeli and Palestinian politicians , their people and their respective diasporas .
I could throw in the way the owners and managers of the news media in the U.S. dismembered their businesses and the way aid work became a gravy train for those who administered it .
But no one reads anything that long online so I will furnish you with a record of the lowest and most dishonest actions from this island off the western coast of Europe .
This was the decade when the " Third Way , " the British Labour Party 's adaptation of the American Democrats ' political philosophy of triangulation , was revealed for what it was — a brilliant method for winning elections to no particular purpose .
There are no principles in the Third Way , just slogans .
Tony Blair , was its greatest practitioner .
He made finding a middle way on virtually every issue his hallmark and won three elections doing it .
But you can't lead a government without eventually having to take a stand on principle .
For Blair , that moment came in Iraq in April 2004 , the first anniversary of the overthrow of Saddam .
That was the week Bush administration arrogance collided with the deepening alliance of Ba'ath loyalists and Al Qaeda operatives .
From the shock waves of that collision emanated an insurgency that would destroy Iraq 's chances of a decent transition to fair government and bury the prospects of humanitarian intervention by any nation or international organization in the foreseeable future .
I know this was the moment Blair failed because I was in Iraq at precisely that moment reporting on the state of the country a year after Saddam 's overthrow .
I remember sitting in the Green Zone with a British diplomat on the staff of Sir Jeremy Greenstock , Britain 's top man in Iraq — Blair 's eyes and ears — listening to the diplomat 's criticisms about the grotesque politicization of the occupation .
It was all being run as an extension of the Bush - Cheney re-election campaign , he complained .
Greenstock , a fluent Arabic speaker , a man with infinite knowledge of the region was completely sidelined , according to this fellow .
Day by day , hour by hour , blunder by blunder , Iraq was falling apart .
Abu Ghraib , the failure to co-opt Moqtada al - Sadr , the flattening of Fallujah to avenge the deaths of four Blackwater mercenaries :
The White House seemed not to care , so long as the American media was being spun and the president 's poll numbers were buoyant .
Blair had to have known all of this and yet , he did nothing .
As the only foreign leader of any note to have signed up for the overthrow of Saddam , as a partner of the U.S. in the ending of Slobodan Milosevic 's wars in the Balkans , as the prime minister who had finally neutered the IRA and seen the Good Friday Agreement to completion , he had the authority to speak out in private or in public against the Bush administration 's blunders .
He did not .
Why not remains a question to this day .
It perplexes those who knew him intimately , people who worked for him and journalists who covered him .
No one has ever given a satisfactory explanation .
I think it was because he was trapped in the Third Way ideology .
The ingrained habit of seeking compromise meant there was no bottom line ... no point of principle to which he would hold fast and say , " No more . "
Finding a mid-point between opposing views may be a way to win elections but it offers no help when it comes to governing .
Blair , like the ancient general Hannibal knew how to win victories but he did not know how to use them .
Iraq might well have gone through the convulsions of 2004 - 2007 , but having been there in the streets when Saddam was overthrown and then a year later , I am certain it would never have been as bloody if Hannibal Blair had stood up to George Bush in private and told him America 's policy in Iraq had to change immediately or he was pulling his troops out .
If Bush did n't listen then he should have put his foot down in public .
But he was a Third Way man up against My Way or the Highway politicians .
There was no middle ground for Cheney - Rumsfeld .
The search for an answer to Blair 's behavior continues as the decade ends .
Once more in Britain , the main players in Iraq are summoned to an inquiry .
This one chaired by Sir John Chilcot .
The scope of the inquiry is very broad .
It is n't billed as " The Search for Why Tony Blair Put Up With Bush Administration Incompetence and Arrogance , " but that is the theme .
The senior diplomats and civil servants are questioned almost exclusively about why the British government went along with the Bush administration on everything related to Iraq .
Those testifying finally acknowledge how perplexed and angered they were by the Rumsfeld - Cheney duopoly 's lack of post - war planning ; by American satrap Jerry Bremer 's continuing to send the messages his masters wanted to hear even as Iraq went to hell in a handcart .
Nothing new in what they say — it was all covered eloquently in books by American journalists published years ago .
What rankles is that when it might have done some good , back in 2004 as Iraq fell apart , they acted in a low , dishonest way and said nothing .
And even now they protect Blair , practicing the Omerta common to their class .
When Sir Jeremy Greenstock , who knows every detail of the Bush administration 's stupidity and hubris was asked by the Chilcot Inquiry what he told Blair about the ineptitude of America 's man in Baghdad , Jerry Bremer , he ducked .
" I took the approach that if I disagreed with something that was happening on the ground and was trying to change it , that I would not go weeping to London about it and ask them to get Washington to persuade Bremer to do something differently . "
So he never asked the boss to help out by talking to Bush ?
I do n't believe it .
The decade is over , Iraq is staggering out of the pit , does it matter that Blair was incapable of finding some bottom line of principle to stand on ?
Yes .
Think of the people of Zimbabwe still ruled over by Mugabe or the never - ending suffering in Sudan .
Think of the unbridled brazenness of Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , leading his nation towards peril .
There will be no intervention from the international community now to ease the suffering of these countries ' people because the idea of of intervention has been discredited .
If Blair and his team had been less low and dishonest that might not be the case .
Ever heard the song “ In a big country ” by the Scottish band Big Country ?
Of course you have .
That was n’t just any country they were talking about , you know .
It was America and it certainly makes sense considering that today ’s youth and adults alike are consuming dangerous amounts of calories per day , sometimes in excess of 4000 .
And thus , we present to you 15 of America ’s worst offenders .
From TGI Friday ’s pasta to Hardee ’s Monsterthick Burger , no company is safe .

You may have seen that Times and Seasons elected Harry Reid “ Mormon of the Year ” for 2009 .
Then — not to be outdone — BCC created the Boggs - Doniphan “ Gentile of the Year ” Award , and awarded it to Stephen Colbert .
Well , it ’s time for Main Street Plaza to get into the game !!
Suggested by our own Chino Blanco — who also provided the fabulous graphic ! —
Main Street Plaza will be hosting the 2009 X - Mormon of the Year Award .
Before we start the election , we need to make a couple of decisions .
First of all , what should the award be for ?
Should it be the exmo who has had the biggest impact in general in 2009 ?
Or should it be the exmo who has had the biggest impact on Mormonism in 2009 ( like William Law , who is a bit of a footnote in the grand scheme of history , but who had a pretty big impact on Mormon history ) ?
Or something else ?
Second of all , we need to collect the nominations !
I ’ve thought of a handful , but I ’m sure I ’m missing some obvious ones :
** Reed Cowan , for his work on 8 : The Mormon Proposition , premiering at Sundance .
He was actually nominated for “ Mormon of the Year , ” but I think he qualifies for this contest as well , right ?
Or is he still a member in good standing ?
** Heather Armstrong , a.k.a.
Dooce ( also cribbed from the T & S nominations ) .
She was named one of the 30 most influential women in media and also published her second book in 2009 .
** Brian Keith Dalton , a.k.a. Mr. Diety .
He has confirmed a few times ( including here ) that He ’s a former Mormon .
In 2009 , He and His team produced the third season of Their series on Their own .
** Chad Hardy , for Hot Mormon Muffins .
I think Hardy gets bonus points for actually getting X’ed because of his work , and for the fact that BYU refused him his transcripts .
So what do you think ?
And who else should be nominated ?
Envoys of Tibet 's Dalai Lama in new China talks
By Michael Bristow
BBC News , Beijing
Analysts say the Dalai Lama may be China 's best chance of compromise Envoys of the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader , the Dalai Lama , are in Beijing to resume talks with China 's government after a break of 15 months .
Discussions broke down in acrimony in 2008 , with Beijing saying that no progress had been made .
One of the Dalai Lama 's representatives told the BBC he thought the resumption of talks may signal a change in approach from China .
But concrete evidence for this is so far unclear .
Relations between the two sides , which were never good , were strained further due to unrest in Tibetan areas in 2008 .
Real autonomy ?
This will be the ninth round of discussions between China and the Tibetan government - in - exile since 2002 .
CHINA - TIBET RELATIONS
1950 : China enforces a long - held claim to Tibet 1959 : Full - scale uprising breaks out in Lhasa .
Thousands are said to have died .
The Dalai Lama and most of his ministers flee to northern India 1989 : The Dalai Lama is awarded the Nobel Peace Prize 2002 : Contacts between the Dalai Lama and Beijing resume March 2008 : Anti-China protests escalate into the worst violence Tibet has seen in 20 years , five months before Beijing hosts the Olympics Nov 2008 : China - Tibetan talks end without progress Jan 2010 : China - Tibetan talks resume
The Tibet issue : China 's view The Tibet issue : Tibetan view News of the resumption of talks was released by the exiled Tibetan leadership , based in Dharamsala in India .
A statement on the website of the Dalai Lama , the spiritual head of Tibetan Buddhism , said the five - person group would return to India at the beginning of February .
Speaking to the BBC's China Editor Shirong Chen , the Dalai Lama 's representative for northern Europe , Thubten Samdup , suggested China could now be more willing to negotiate than it had been in the past .
" Within the Chinese citizens there 's a re-awakening , so to speak , that perhaps the Dalai Lama is the best chance that Beijing has , " he said .
But there is little evidence to suggest that China is willing to make definite concessions to the Tibetan government - in - exile .
Last week senior Chinese leaders held a major meeting about Tibet - the first in nine years - in which they indicated they would continue their hard - line approach .
Chinese President Hu Jintao told those at the meeting that China would maintain efforts to prevent " penetration and sabotage " by supporters of Tibetan independence .
He added that Beijing would ensure the " normal order of Tibetan Buddhism " .
A report on the three - day meeting was carried by the state - run news agency Xinhua , which said : " The Communist Party of China 's policies towards Tibet in the new era were totally correct . "
Following the last round of talks between the Chinese and Tibetans , Zhu Weiqun , of the Chinese Communist Party 's United Front Work Department , blamed the Tibetans for lack of progress .
He said they had not given up their dream of an independent Tibet .
The Tibetans say they do not want independence , only real autonomy to help protect Tibet 's unique culture .

Flags fly in front of the United Nations Headquarters in New York July 31 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Brendan McDermid
DUBAI ( Reuters ) - Dubai said on Friday it has offered to host the headquarters of the United Nations should the global organization want to leave New York , a sign the Gulf emirate ’s ambitions remain high despite its debt problems .
“ The government of Dubai announces that it is fully prepared to host the U.N. headquarters on its territory in the event its officials take the decision to move from New York , ” the Dubai government said a statement .
Dubai ’s offer comes days after an article by an academic and a real estate developer on the website of Forbes magazine called for the United Nations to relocate to Dubai .
“ Bringing the United Nations to Dubai makes sense , ” wrote Joel Kotkin , a fellow in urban futures at Chapman University , and Robert J. Cristiano , the California university ’s “ real estate professional in residence . ”
“ New York gets rid of one of its worst welfare cheats , and Dubai finds new tenants to fill its vacant towers , ” they said , describing the U.N. headquarters as a “ pain in the butt ” which “ pays no taxes and annoys hard - working New Yorkers with its sloth , pretensions and cavalier disregard for traffic laws . ”
Dubai , which has gained worldwide attention for its extravagant real estate projects , left global markets reeling in November when it said it would request a standstill agreement on billions of dollars of debt .
The global financial crisis saw many real estate projects delayed or shelved in the emirate , but construction has barely stopped and new projects are still coming on line , raising questions on how the buildings will be filled in the downturn .
Earlier this month , Dubai ’s ruler inaugurated the tallest building in the world , the Burj Khalifa .
“ Dubai has already built something that looks the part of a 21st - century world capital , ” Kotkin and Cristiano wrote .
“ Let it get a cast appropriate for its glittering set . ”
I ’m proud to announce that a draft of the release of my paper , “ Lloyd Allison ’s Corecursive Queues : Why Continuations Matter “ , is now available .
( Source code available here , with a hackage package soon to come available here ) Wouter Swierstra has informed me that he will publish it in the Monad Reader .
However , it will appear in the next issue after the upcoming one , due to an unexpectedly large number of submissions this time around .
Here is the abstract :
In a purely functional setting , real - time queues are traditionally thought to be much harder to implement than either real - time stacks or amortized O ( 1 ) queues .
In “ Circular Programs and Self - Referential Structures , ” Lloyd Allison uses corecursion to implement a queue by defining a lazy list in terms of itself .
This provides a simple , efficient , and attractive implementation of real - time queues .
While Allison ’s queues are general , in the sense it is straightforward to adapt his technique to a new algorithm , a significant problem has been the lack of a reusable library implementation .
This paper solves this problem through the use of a monadic interface and continuations .
Because Allison ’s queues are not fully persistent , they can not be first class values .
Rather , they are encoded in particular algorithms written in an extended continuation passing style .
In direct style , this extension corresponds to mapCont , a control operator found in Control .
Monad .
Cont , part of the Monad Template Library for Haskell .
This paper conjectures that mapCont cannot be expressed in terms of callCC , return , and ( >>= ) .
I intend to include a careful performance comparison before this becomes an official Monad Reader article .
Allison ’s queues come out very well ; often better than two stack queues .
I have conducted a careful performance comparison in the past , although with older versions of GHC , and older versions of my code .
While I did take reasonably careful notes , things have changed .
Haskell being what it is , figuring out why is often a challenge .
In the meantime I am interested in feedback .
For fun , here is something I wrote right after I first came up with the basic idea behind the paper .
It ’s still the best error message I ’ve gotten out of GHC .
Kudos to whomever came up with that strategically placed bit of humor !
Thursday , August 25th , 2005 , 5:22 am : Back to the Future I ’ve been up all night , but I now have a working fragment of computer code that is entirely too cute .
It ’s easily the cleverest bit I ’ve written in years .
I managed to implement … a queue .
Yes , a queue .
One queue , not two .
One purely functional queue , with one esoteric implementation !
On my penultimate attempt , which was an utter failure except that it got me thinking in the right direction , I came by the most amusing error message I ’ve seen to date out of GHC : leon@deleon : ~/ Programs / snippets $ ghci - fglasgow - exts Queue.hs ___ ___ _ / _ \ /\ /\/ __(_ ) / /_\// /_/ / / | | GHC Interactive , version 6.2.2 , for Haskell 98 . / /_\\/ __ / /___| |

Michael Schumacher says he is impressed by the Mercedes team 's continuing hunger for success , after spending two days at the squad 's Brackley factory this week .
Although this was not the seven times world champion 's first visit to Mercedes Grand Prix 's base , as he had also visited when finalising his deal to return to Formula 1 , this trip marked the start of his serious work with the team .
" I have been in the factory in Brackley now for two days and spent the time to get to know the engineers and the structures a bit better , and I am extremely positively surprised about how motivated everybody was , " Schumacher wrote on his personal website .
" This a world champion team but it does not seem to be spoilt by success at all ; it seems to be hungry for more instead ! "
He said he had learned a lot more about Mercedes while working with the team this week .
" It is important for me to be informed about everything and it was very interesting to get to understand the engineers and their structures and the way they work , " said Schumacher .
" I was there already around the time of the signature of the contract and learned a lot , now I have seen much more about the team . "
Having also visited Mercedes ' engine facility in Brixworth , Schumacher added that he was already enjoying working with a German - speaking organisation having spent his original F1 career with British and Italian squads .
" I also was in the Mercedes factory in Brixworth and I have to say that I am very impressed about the high level you see there , " he said .
" In Brixworth the people seem to be highly motivated as well and I find that encouraging , as it perfectly fits my personal mood .
" What I also liked was that you hear a lot of people speaking German there .
That is nice for once , I am not so much used to that at my work , and I find it quite convenient . "
In 2006 , the Cato Institute 's David Boaz and David Kirby crunched some numbers in the service of finding out more about the elusive Libertarian Vote and its role in American politics .
Now , they have updated their work , tracking The Libertarian Vote in the Age of Obama .
Here 's what they found :
Libertarians are about 14 percent of the electorate .
Libertarian voters swung away from Bush and the GOP in 2004 and 2006 , but in 2008 they swung back , voting for McCain by 71 to 27 percent .
Younger libertarians voted 59 percent for Obama versus 36 percent for McCain .
But their enthusiasm for his policies may be short - lived .
Younger Americans are an optimistic generation , but easily shaken when things go badly .
If unemployment continues to remain weak , an economic issue that disproportionately affects young people , this generation of voters could quickly become disillusioned with Obama 's policies .
Before the 2006 elections , we predicted that if the swing away from the Republicans continued , " Republicans will lose elections they would otherwise win . "
Now we offer the reverse prediction : if libertarians continue to lead the independents away from Obama , Democrats will lose 2010 midterm elections they would otherwise win .
Boaz and Kirby write about it — but Massachusetts senator - elect Scott Brown is living it .
For those interested in the study 's definition of libertarian , here are the details .
Snagging results from a respected long standing public option poll series , the study uses three questions to mark someone out as a libertarian :
This is an attempt to collect together , in tutorial form , a few of the things I 've said about monads going back as far as my field guide .
It 's probably not a good first tutorial , but it contains things I 'd wish I 'd known immediately after reading my first tutorial .
Unfortunately , I used a few more LaTeX features than I ought to have while drafting it making it hard to get back into HTML form cleanly .

Antarctic fur seals have been filmed catching and eating king penguins in the open ocean , behaviour not seen before .
Male Antarctic fur seals are known to occasionally take king penguins on land .
But this is the first time seals have been observed chasing , killing and eating king penguins at sea .
The preference for king - sized fast food has evolved among fur seals living at Possession Island in the Indian Ocean .
Details of the behaviour are published in the journal Polar Biology .
Catching a king penguin at sea is not easy .
They can weigh up to 13kg at certain times of the year and are very fast moving in the water .
" Both species are very fast swimming and agile animals , " says Dr Karine Delord of the French National Centre for Scientific Research , who observed the behaviour .
Usually , the penguins are predated upon by much larger leopard seals and orcas .
Fur seals are also known to prey on king penguins on the shore , a behaviour filmed by the BBC Planet Earth Series .
" But our observations add strength to the unique similar predation in the water , " says Dr Delord .
She and her colleagues Dr Yohan Charbonnier and Dr Jean - Baptiste Thiebot were studying the conservation of penguins , sooty albatrosses and giant petrels around Possession Island , one of five small islands that make up the Crozet archipelago in the southern Indian Ocean .
While located high up on top of a nearby cliff , they witnessed fur seals predating on king penguins below them in the sea on 17 occasions during five days .

Media requires JavaScript to play .
The longest chase took five hours , when one male fur seal successively attacked at least ten king penguins .
Though all were injured , each made it to the shore .
Later the researchers witnessed a fur seal killing and eating a king penguin at sea .
" We found that predation on king penguins by Antarctic fur seals is more common and widespread than previously reported , " says Dr Delord .
" It is too early to assess the impact of such behaviour because our observations need to be quantified on a longer period of time and other colonies of king penguins . "
However , as seal numbers increase in the area , they could start to have a greater impact on small populations of king penguins .
" Furthermore , the impact on injured adults is probably more difficult to evaluate because some of them survive the attacks , at least a few days , " she adds .
" But it is necessary to estimate the impact on their breeding and survival at a longer time . "
Currently , 30,000 pairs of king penguins reside at the largest colony on Possession Island , while less than 500 seals live in the same area .
The fur seals are still recovering , after both species were nearly driven extinct by human hunters at Crozet during the 19th century .
So far , the researchers have not documented female Antarctic fur seals attacking king penguins at sea , though it is unclear why the females do not also hunt penguins .
At nearby Marion Island , where most documented attacks by Antarctic fur seals on shore - bound penguins occur , males , and particularly sub-adults males , are responsible .
Victoria cellphone users are unlikely to have access to the country 's new wireless carrier until late this year .
According to Chris Robbins , chief customer officer for startup cellphone carrier Wind Mobile , the company is still in its infancy and unlikely to hit the West Coast until June and wo n't jump to Victoria until the fall .
article continues below
" It 's always tough with networks because they require permits , so you think it will take a week and it ends up taking a month , " said Robbins , noting they have not yet started building a network in Victoria .
" We have probably done the lease acquisitions ( for cell antennae ) in Victoria ; we 've probably found the sites we prefer but we have n't started construction yet . "
Robbins said Victoria wo n't see service until at least late in the third quarter of 2010 .
The company , operated by Globalive Wireless Management , launched in mid December in Calgary and Toronto with the big selling feature of not requiring contracts .
Wind offers three voice and text plans starting at $ 15 per month , all with unlimited calling between Wind customers , while the two more expensive options , at $ 35 and $ 45 allow for unlimited calling across the province and Canada respectively from the customer 's " home zone . "
Data plans add from $ 10 for unlimited instant messaging , Facebook and MySpace access to $ 35 a month for unlimited Internet data for phones .
While there are no contracts ,
Wind sells the handsets and phones without the deep discounting available at Telus , Bell or Rogers -- that means
Wind plans to sell handsets to subscribers starting at $ 130 for a Huawei U7519 to $ 450 for the BlackBerry Bold 9700 .
Telus , as an example , offers discounts of as much as $ 500 on some of its phones .
Robbins said so far it's been a hit as the company boasts more than 10,000 subscribers .
Wind Mobile is in the final stages of preparing the Edmonton and Ottawa markets for launch late in the first quarter of this year , while they are in mid-construction of the network in Vancouver eyeing a late June launch date .
With launch will come the retail stores .
Robbins said Wind has secured spectrum in its target markets and estimates the company has spent in excess of $ 1 billion in building its Canada network with plenty of work left to go .
The tricky part can be getting approval from municipalities , he said .
But he pointed out there is a tried - and - true path to success paved by years of work done by Telus , Rogers and Bell with municipal halls .
" The cities have it down to a science now , so we just follow along exactly what the city tells us to do , " he said .
Wind Mobile is also looking at landing a powerful ally in its fight with the established carriers like Telus and Rogers , as it has pursued Google in order to get the Nexus One smartphone into Canada .
Google unveiled the Nexus One earlier this week -- a smartphone that will compete against devices like the iPhone and BlackBerry .
In this case , Wind has an advantage as it is the only carrier in Canada whose network operates on the AWS spectrum band , the same band as T - Mobile USA , the carrier Google has partnered with to launch the device in the U.S .
Rogers , Bell and Telus offer similar 3G networks , but none operate on the AWS band .
However , Google is quickly developing a version of the Nexus One for another U.S. carrier , Verizon Wireless , which will begin selling the phone this spring .
Verizon Wireless uses a network standard called CDMA .
Both Bell and Telus also use the standard alongside their joint HSPA network .
Rogers , the largest cellphone operator in Canada by subscriber numbers , relies solely on HSPA technology for 3G devices , like Apple 's iPhone 3GS .

Psychologists at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Memphis have released a new study on linguistic evolution that challenges the prominent hypothesis for why languages differ throughout the world .
The study argues that human languages may adapt more like biological organisms than previously thought and that the more common and popular the language , the simpler its construction to facilitate its survival .
Traditional thinking is that languages develop based upon random change and historical drift .
For example , English and Turkish are very different languages based upon histories that separate them in space and time .
For years , it has been the reigning assumption in the linguistic sciences .
The recent report , published in the current issue of PLoS One , offers a new hypothesis , challenging the drift explanation .
Gary Lupyan , a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Psychology in Penn 's School of Arts and Sciences , and Rick Dale , an assistant professor in psychology at the University of Memphis , conducted a large - scale statistical analysis of more than 2,000 of the world 's languages aimed at testing whether certain social environments are correlated with certain linguistic properties .
The researchers found striking relationships between the demographic properties of a language -- such as its population and global spread -- and the grammatical complexity of those languages .
Languages having the most speakers -- and those that have spread around the world -- were found to have far simpler grammars , specifically morphology , than languages spoken by few people and in circumscribed regions .
For example , languages spoken by more than 100,000 people are almost six times more likely to have simple verb conjugations compared to languages spoken by fewer than 100,000 people .
Larger populations tend to have simpler pronoun and number systems and a smaller number of cases and genders and in general do not employ complex prefixing or suffixing rules in their grammars .
A consequence is that languages with long histories of adult learners have become easier to learn over time .
Although a number of researchers have predicted such relationships between social and language structure , this is the first large - scale statistical test of this idea .
The results draw connections between the evolution of human language and biological organisms .
Just as very distantly related organisms converge on evolutionary strategies in particular niches , languages may adapt to the social environments in which they are learned and used .
" English , for all its confusing spelling and exceptions -- if a baker bakes , what does a grocer do ? -- has a relatively simple grammar , " Lupyan said .
" Verbs are easy to conjugate and nouns are mostly pluralized by adding 's . '
In comparison , a West African language like Hausa has dozens of ways to make nouns plural and in many languages -- Turkish , Aymara , Ladakhi , Ainu -- verbs like ' to know ' have to include information about the origin of the speaker 's knowledge .
This information is often conveyed using complex rules , which the most widely - spoken languages on earth like English and Mandarin lack . "
Lupyan and Dale call this social affect on grammatical patterns the " Linguistic Niche Hypothesis . "
Languages evolve within particular socio- demographic niches .
Although all languages must be learnable by infants , the introduction of adult learners to some languages ( for example , through migration or colonization ) means that aspects of a language difficult for adults to learn will be less likely to be passed on to subsequent generations of learners .
The result is that languages spoken by more people over larger geographic regions have become morphologically simpler over many generations .
A remaining puzzle is why languages with few speakers are so complex in the first place .
One possibility , explored by researchers , is that features such as grammatical gender and complex conjugational systems , while difficult for adult learners to master , may facilitate language learning in children by providing a network of redundant information that can cue children in on the meanings of words and how to string them together .
The results and theory proposed by Lupyan and Dale do not aim to explain why a specific language has the grammar it does .
Because the findings are statistical in nature , many exceptions to Lupyan and Dale 's theory can be identified .
Their work , however , provides a comprehensive analysis of how some social factors influence the structure of language and shows that the relationships between language and culture is far from arbitrary .
The study was funded by an Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training award to the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science at Penn and by the National Science Foundation .
It 's the end of the beginning ;
A catastrophic heat wave appears to be closing in on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
How hot is it getting in the scientific kitchen where they 've been cooking the books and spicing up the stew pots ?
So hot , apparently , that Andrew Weaver , probably Canada 's leading climate scientist , is calling for replacement of IPCC leadership and institutional reform .
If Andrew Weaver is heading for the exits , it 's a pretty sure sign that the United Nations agency is under monumental stress .
Mr. Weaver , after all , has been a major IPCC science insider for years .
He is Canada Research Chair in Climate Modelling and Analysis at the University of Victoria , mastermind of one of the most sophisticated climate modelling systems on the planet , and lead author on two recent landmark IPCC reports .
For him to say , as he told Canwest News yesterday , that there has been some " dangerous crossing " of the line between climate advocacy and science at the IPCC is stunning in itself .
Not only is Mr. Weaver an IPCC insider .
He has also , over the years , generated his own volume of climate advocacy that often seemed to have crossed that dangerous line between hype and science .
Notes
Other than the fact that Muslims have n't killed every non-Muslim under their domain , there is very little else that they can point to as proof that theirs is a peaceful , tolerant religion .
Where Islam is dominant ( as in the Middle East and Pakistan ) religious minorities suffer brutal persecution with scant introspection .
Where Islam is in the minority ( as in Thailand , the Philippines and Europe ) there is the threat of violence if Muslim demands are not met .
Either situation seems to provide a justification for religious terrorism , which is persistent and endemic to Islamic fundamentalism .
This begins with the Quran .
Few verses of Islam 's most sacred text can be construed to fit the contemporary virtues of religious tolerance and universal brotherhood .
Those that do are earlier " Meccan " verses which are abrogated by later ones .
The example of Muhammad is that Islam is a religion of peace when Muslims do not have the power and numbers on their side .
Once they do , things change .
Many Muslims are peaceful and do not want to believe what the Quran really says .
They prefer a more narrow interpretation that is closer to the Judeo - Christian ethic .
Some just ignore harsher passages .
Others reach for " textual context " across different suras to subjectively mitigate these verses with others so that the message fits their personal moral preference .
Although the Quran itself claims to be clear and complete , these apologists speak of the " risks " of trying to interpret verses without their " assistance . "
The violent verses of the Quran have played a key role in massacre and genocide .
This includes the brutal slaughter of tens of millions of Hindus for five centuries beginning around 1000 AD with Mahmud of Ghazni 's bloody conquest .
Both he and the later Tamerlane ( Islam 's Genghis Khan ) slaughtered an untold number merely for defending their temples from destruction .
Buddhism was nearly wiped off the Indian subcontinent .
Judaism and Christianity met the same fate ( albeit more slowly ) in areas conquered by Muslim armies , including the Middle East , North Africa and parts of Europe , including today 's Turkey .
Zoroastrianism , the ancient religion of a proud Persian people is despised by Muslims and barely survives in modern Iran .
Violence is so ingrained in Islam that it has never really stopped being at war , either with other religions or with itself .
Muhammad was a military leader , laying siege to towns , massacring the men , raping their women , enslaving their children , and taking the property of others as his own .
On several occasions he rejected offers of surrender from the besieged inhabitants and even butchered captives .
He inspired his followers to battle when they did not feel it was right to fight , promising them slaves and booty if they did and threatening them with Hell if they did not .
Muhammad allowed his men to rape traumatized women captured in battle , usually on the very day their husbands and family members were slaughtered .
The popular apologist argument that many verses of violence apply to war is shaded by the fact that war was started by Muslims , both in Muhammad 's time and since .
For the most part , Islamic armies waged aggressive campaigns , and the religion 's most dramatic military conquests were made by actual companions of Muhammad in the decades following his death .
The early Islamic principle of warfare was that the civilian population of a town was to be destroyed ( ie. men executed , women and children taken as slaves ) if they defended themselves and resisted Islamic hegemony .
Although modern apologists claim that Muslims are only supposed to " attack in self - defense " , this oxymoron is flatly contradicted by the accounts of Islamic historians and others that go back to the time of Muhammad .
Some modern - day scholars are more candid than others .
One of the most respected Sunni theologians is al - Qaradawi , who justifies terror attacks against Western targets by noting that there is no such thing as a civilian population in a time of war :
" It has been determined by Islamic law that the blood and property of people of Dar al - Harb [ ie .
non-Muslim people who resist Islamic conquest ] is not protected ...
In modern war , all of society , with all its classes and ethnic groups , is mobilized to participate in the war , to aid its continuation , and to provide it with the material and human fuel required for it to assure the victory of the state fighting its enemies .
Every citizen in society must take upon himself a role in the effort to provide for the battle .
The entire domestic front , including professionals , laborers , and industrialists , stands behind the fighting army , even if it does not bear arms . "
Consider the example of the Qurayza Jews , who were completely obliterated only five years after Muhammad arrived in Medina .
Their leader opted to stay neutral when their town was besieged by a Meccan army that was sent to take revenge for Muhammad 's deadly caravan raids .
The tribe killed no one from either side and even surrendered peacefully to Muhammad after the Meccans had been turned back .
Yet the prophet of Islam had every male member of the Qurayza beheaded , and every woman and child enslaved , even raping one of the captives himself ( what Muslim apologists might refer to as " same day marriage " ) .
One of Islam 's most revered modern scholars , Sheikh Yusuf al - Qaradawi , openly sanctions offensive Jihad : " In the Jihad which you are seeking , you look for the enemy and invade him .
This type of Jihad takes place only when the Islamic state is invading other [ countries ] in order to spread the word of Islam and to remove obstacles standing in its way . "
Qutb wrote : " Islam has the right to take the initiative … this is God ’s religion and it is for the whole world .
It has the right to destroy all obstacles in the form of institutions and traditions … it attacks institutions and traditions to release human beings from their poisonous influences , which distort human nature and curtail human freedom .
Those who say that Islamic Jihad was merely for the defense of the ' homeland of Islam ' diminish the greatness of the Islamic way of life . "
The widely respected Dictionary of Islam defines Jihad as " A religious war with those who are unbelievers in the mission of Muhammad .
It is an incumbent religious duty , established in the Quran and in the Traditions as a divine institution , and enjoined specially for the purpose of advancing Islam and of repelling evil from Muslims … [ Quoting from the Hanafi school , Hedaya , 2:140 , 141. ] , " The destruction of the sword is incurred by infidels , although they be not the first aggressors , as appears from various passages in the traditions which are generally received to this effect . "
Dr. Salah al - Sawy , the chief member of the Assembly of Muslim Jurists in America , stated in 2009 that " the Islamic community does not possess the strength to engage in offensive jihad at this time , " tacitly affirming the legitimacy of violence for the cause of Islamic rule - bound only by the capacity for success .

Muhammad 's failure to leave a clear line of succession resulted in perpetual internal war following his death .
Those who knew him best first fought afterwards to keep remote tribes from leaving Islam and reverting to their preferred religion ( the Ridda or ' Apostasy wars ' ) .
Then the violence turned within .
Early Meccan converts battled later ones as hostility developed between those immigrants who had traveled with Muhammad to Mecca and the Ansar at Medina who had helped them settle in .
Finally there was a violent struggle within Muhammad 's own family between his favorite wife and favorite daughter - a jagged schism that has left Shias and Sunnis at each others ' throats to this day .
The strangest and most untrue thing that can be said about Islam is that it is a religion of peace .
If every standard by which the West is judged and condemned ( slavery , imperialism , intolerance , misogyny , sexual repression , warfare ... ) were applied equally to Islam , the verdict would be devastating .
Islam never gives up what it conquers , be it religion , culture , language or life .
Neither does it make apologies or any real effort at moral progress .
It is the least open to dialogue and the most self - absorbed .
It is convinced of its own perfection , yet brutally shuns self - examination and represses criticism .
This is what makes the Quran 's verses of violence so dangerous .
They are given the weight of divine command .
While Muslim terrorists take them literally , and understand that Islam is incomplete without Jihad , moderates offer little to contradict them - outside of personal opinion .
Indeed , what do they have ?
Speaking of peace and love may win over the ignorant , but when every twelfth verse of Islam 's holiest book either speaks to Allah 's hatred for non-Muslims or calls for their death , forced conversion , or subjugation , it is little wonder that sympathy for terrorism runs as deeply as it does in the broader community - even if most Muslims prefer not to interpret their personal viewpoint of Islam in this way .
Although scholars like Ibn Khaldun , one of Islam 's most respected philosophers , understood that " the holy war is a religious duty , because of the universalism of the Muslim mission and ( the obligation to ) convert everybody to Islam either by persuasion or by force " , many other Muslims are either unaware or willfully ignorant of the Quran 's near absence of verses that preach universal non-violence .
Their understanding of Islam comes from what they are taught by others .
Believers in the West are often led to think that their religion is like Christianity - preaching the New Testament virtues of peace , love , and tolerance .
They are somewhat surprised and embarrassed to find that the Quran and the bloody history of Islam 's genesis say otherwise .
Others simply accept the violence .
In 1991 , a Palestinian couple in America was convicted of stabbing their daughter to death for being too Westernized .
A family friend came to their defense , excoriating the jury for not understanding the " culture " , claiming that the father was merely following " the religion " and saying that the couple had to " discipline their daughter or lose respect . " ( source ) .
In 2011 , unrepentant Palestinian terrorists , responsible for the brutal murders of civilians , women and children explicitly in the name of Allah were treated to a luxurious " holy pilgrimage " to Mecca by the Saudi king - without a single Muslim voice raised in protest .
The most prestigious Islamic university in the world today is Cairo 's al - Azhar .
While the university is very quick to condemn secular Muslims who critique the religion , it has never condemned ISIS as a group of infidels despite horrific carnage in the name of Allah .
When asked why , the university 's Grand Imam , Ahmed al - Tayeb explained : " Al Azhar can not accuse any [ Muslim ] of being a kafir [ infidel ] , as long as he believes in Allah and the Last Day — even if he commits every atrocity . "
For their part , Western liberals would do well not to sacrifice critical thinking to the god of political correctness , or look for reasons to bring other religion down to the level of Islam merely to avoid the existential truth that it is both different and dangerous .
There are just too many Muslims who take the Quran literally ... and too many others who could n't care less about the violence done in the name of Islam .

BEIRUT ( Reuters ) - All 90 people aboard an Ethiopian Airlines plane were feared dead after it plunged into the Mediterranean in a ball of fire , minutes after taking off from Beirut in a raging thunderstorm on Monday .
More than 16 hours after the crash and with night falling , authorities downplayed hopes of finding survivors and search efforts focused on recovering the remains of passengers still strapped to their seats and the black box flight recorders .
Flight ET409 , a Boeing 737-800 , heading for Addis Ababa , disappeared off the radar five minutes after taking off at 2:37 a.m. ( 7:37 p.m. ET ) .
The Lebanese army said the plane had broken up in the air before plummeting into rough seas .
One witness described the impact as a “ flash that lit up the whole sea . ”
Lebanese President Michel Suleiman said he did not think the plane had been brought down deliberately , emphasizing “ a sabotage attack is unlikely . ”
Defense Minister Elias el - Murr said that weather “ in principle ” was to blame for the crash .
He later told local media there was information indicating “ it was a pilot error ” but did not provide further details .
Ethiopian Airlines CEO Girma
Wake said he had spoken with Lebanese authorities and there was no word of survivors .
Eighty - three passengers and seven crew were on the flight .
Twenty - four bodies , including those of two toddlers , had been recovered .
At least six of the bodies recovered were of Ethiopians , officials said .
Only one of the 14 bodies being examined at a Beirut hospital , where weeping relatives gathered , was identifiable .
The rest would require DNA testing to confirm identities , Health Minister Mohammad Khalifeh said .
HOPES FADE
Khalifeh said hopes were fading for any survivors .
A U.S. Navy ship with advanced equipment arrived in Lebanon to aid in the night search .
Mangled debris , aircraft seats and luggage washed up on the shore south of Beirut near the airport ’s main runway .
Fifty - four of those on board were Lebanese , 22 were Ethiopian , two were British and there also were Canadian , Russian , French , Iraqi , Syrian , and Turkish nationals .

Marla Pietton , wife of the French ambassador to Lebanon Denis Pietton , was on the plane , the embassy said .
Most of the Lebanese passengers were Shi’ites from southern Lebanon who have business interests in Africa .
The Lebanese government declared a day of mourning .
Prime Minister Saad al - Hariri visited the airport to meet distraught relatives , some of whom were angry that the plane was allowed to take off in bad weather .
“ They should have delayed the flight for an hour or two to protect the passengers .
There had been strong lightning bolts and we hear that lightning strikes at planes , especially during take - offs , ” a relative of one of the passengers said .

Information Minister Tareq Mitri said there was no reason not to give the plane the permission to take off .
“ Other planes landed and took off after and before it .
There was no reason why the airport authorities should not have allowed it to take off , ” he told reporters .
INTERNATIONAL HELP
Airline CEO
Girma said he did not think the crew would have taken off in dangerous weather conditions .
“ There was bad weather .
How bad it is , I will not be able to say .
But , from what I see , probably it was manageable weather otherwise the crew would not have taken off , ” he told reporters in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa .
A team of investigators from Ethiopia , including Ethiopian Airlines officials , arrived in Beirut .
Boeing said it was coordinating with the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board to assist Lebanese authorities in the inquiry .
Lebanese army , U.N. peacekeepers in Lebanon , Cypriot police and the British military stationed in Cyprus provided helicopters , ships and divers to aid search - and - rescue efforts in an area off Na’ameh , 10 km ( six miles ) south of the capital .
State - owned Ethiopian Airlines has positioned itself as a major player in international air traffic in Africa and has recently expanded its Asian network .
Girma said the plane , built in 2002 , last underwent a maintenance check on December 25 and no technical problems were found .
The plane had been leased from a division of U.S. financing company CIT Group .
Last Friday the airline announced an order for 10 of Boeing 737-800s for $ 767 million .
Ethiopian Airlines has regular flights to Lebanon , catering for business clients and the thousands of Ethiopians who work there as domestic helpers .
Some passengers had been en route to Angola and other African countries .
The last incident involving Ethiopian Airlines was in November 1996 when 125 of the 175 passengers and crew died after a hijacked Boeing 767 crashed off the Comoros Islands .
Andrew Conley Says He Was Inspired by ' Dexter ' to Strangle Brother Girlfriend of accused teen killer says he was " happiest " she had seen him .
Dec. 4 , 2009  --
An Indiana teen who has allegedly admitted strangling his little brother likened the murder to satisfying a craving for a hamburger and told authorities he was inspired by the television series " Dexter . "
Anthony Conley , 17 , is charged with murdering his 10 - year - old brother Conner on Saturday night , allegedly strangling the boy and then stuffing his head in a plastic bag so that blood would n't " get everywhere , " according to Dearborn - Ohio County Prosecutor Aaron Negangard .
" It 's disturbing that a 17 - year - old would want to kill under any circumstances , let alone his own brother , " said Negangard .
He described Conley as " emotionless " when he was interviewed by police .
According to Negangard , Conley turned himself into authorities the day after he allegedly murdered his brother .
But the night before , Conley said he stopped at his girlfriend 's home to give her a " sweetheart ring . "
The couple also watched the movie " The Green Mile , " which focuses on the lives of prison guards on death row .
" His girlfriend described him as the happiest he had been in a long while , " said Negangard .
Conley 's lawyer , Gary Sorge , was not available for comment .
Conley , who was scheduled to appear in court today , is being held without bail at Switzerland County Jail in Vevay .
Nobody answered calls made to the Conley 's Rising Sun , Ind. , home .
Teens Alleges He Was Inspired by TV Serial Killer Dexter Morgan
Negangard said that when Conley was asked to explain his behavior by investigators the teen said he identified with Dexter Morgan , the main character in Showtime 's " Dexter , " which chronicles the life of an undercover Miami blood spatter expert who doubles as a serial killer .
" Conley said that he just ' felt like him , ' " said Negangard .
Reached for comment , a Showtime spokesperson had no comment .
This is the second murder that was allegedly inspired by " Dexter . "
Last year , a 29 - year - old Canadian man Mark Twitchell mimicked a story line from the drama when he allegedly killed 39 - year - old Johnny Altinger .
Twitchell was dubbed a " fervid fan " of the show in local reports .
Melissa Rosenberg , the show 's executive producer , told Canwest News Service at the time that this was a " worst fears " situation , and one that the show 's creators " worried about from the beginning . "
In interviews with investigators , Conley also allegedly likened his desire to kill to a craving a person gets when they want a particular food .
" He analogized the murder to when someone wants a hamburger , " said Negangard .
" He said that when someone wants a hamburger they 've just got to have it . "
Conley allegedly admitted to strangling his brother on Saturday night when their parents were both at work .
Stuffing his brother 's dead body in the back of his car , he then drove to his girlfriend 's house where he spent the night .
Sometime the next day , authorities said Conley dumped his brother 's body in a park just a few hundred yards from where the 10 - year - old attended elementary school .
The next morning Conley was asked by his parents – both of whom Negangard said work night shifts – where his little brother was .
Conley told his parents that his little brother was at his grandmother 's home , which is apparently not unusual .
But when asked to pick up his brother a few hours later , Conley drove to the police station and turned himself in .
" The defendant walked into the police station and indicated that he had killed his brother , " Negangard said .
Later , Conley told authorities that he had been having trouble sleeping , the prosecutor said .
Conley was apparently recently pulled out of school , but a reason was not given , according to authorities .
Conley Case Comes in Wake Of Several Other Teen Crimes
Because of state law , Conley is not eligible for the death penalty but could be sentenced to 65 years in prison .
Prosecutors have said they will campaign for Conley to get life without parole if he 's convicted .
Conley 's alleged murder of his brother comes in the wake of several other gruesome teen crimes .
Fifteen - year - old Alyssa Bustamante was charged in October for strangling her 9 - year - old neighbor after allegedly digging a grave for the girl in their Missouri neighborhood .
And five Florida teenagers , one just 13 years old , were charged with throwing rubbing alcohol on 15 - year - old Michael Brewer and lighting him on fire over a videogame debt .
Brewer was burned over 65 percent of his body , but survived .
In October , six teens allegedly gang raped a 15 - year - old girl outside her Richmond , Calif. , high school homecoming dance .
BALTIMORE —
It is what Edgar Allan Poe might have called “ a mystery all insoluble ” : Every year for the past six decades , a shadowy visitor would leave roses and a half - empty bottle of cognac on Poe ’s grave on the anniversary of the writer ’s birth .
This year , on Tuesday , no one showed .
Did the mysterious “ Poe toaster ” meet his own mortal end ?
Will he be heard from nevermore ?
The visitor ’s absence only deepened the mystery over his identity .
One possibility was a Baltimore poet and known prankster who died in his 60s last week .
But there is little or no evidence to suggest he was the man .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Nearly one in five U.S. households ran out of money to buy enough food at least once during 2009 , said an antihunger group on Tuesday , urging more federal action to help Americans get enough to eat .
“ There are no hunger - free areas of America , ” said Jim Weill of the Food Research and Action Center .
Weill said he hoped President Barack Obama would exempt public nutrition programs from a proposed three - year freeze on domestic spending .
Obama has a goal to end childhood hunger by 2015 .
He backed a $ 1 billion a year increase in school lunch and other child nutrition programs a year ago .
Nationwide polling found 18.2 percent of households reported “ food hardship ” -- lacking money to buy enough food -- in 2009 , according to the group .
That is higher than the government ’s “ food insecurity ” rating of 14.6 percent of households , or 49 million people , for 2008 .
Households with children had a “ food hardship ” rate of 24.1 percent for 2009 compared with 14.9 percent among households without children .
Twenty states had rates of 20 percent or higher .
Seven Southern states led the list .
The figures were based on responses to the question , “ Have there been times in the past 12 months when you did not have enough money to buy the food that you or your family needed ? ”
The question is similar to one asked by the Census Bureau in collecting data for the annual food - insecurity report .
A new analysis of global surface temperatures by NASA scientists finds the past year was tied for the second warmest since 1880 .
In the Southern Hemisphere , 2009 was the warmest year on record .
Although 2008 was the coolest year of the decade because of a strong La Nina that cooled the tropical Pacific Ocean , 2009 saw a return to a near - record global temperatures as the La Nina diminished , according to the new analysis by NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies ( GISS ) in New York .
The past year was a small fraction of a degree cooler than 2005 , the warmest on record , putting 2009 in a virtual tie with a cluster of other years -- 1998 , 2002 , 2003 , 2006 , and 2007 -- for the second warmest on record .
" There 's always interest in the annual temperature numbers and a given year 's ranking , but the ranking often misses the point , " said James Hansen , GISS director .
" There 's substantial year - to - year variability of global temperature caused by the tropical El Nino - La Nina cycle .
When we average temperature over five or ten years to minimize that variability , we find global warming is continuing unabated . "
January 2000 to December 2009 was the warmest decade on record .
Looking back to 1880 , when modern scientific instrumentation became available to monitor temperatures precisely , a clear warming trend is present , although there was a leveling off between the 1940s and 1970s .
In the past three decades , the GISS surface temperature record shows an upward trend of about 0.36 degrees F ( 0.2 degrees C ) per decade .
In total , average global temperatures have increased by about 1.5 degrees F ( 0.8 degrees C ) since 1880 .
" That 's the important number to keep in mind , " said GISS climatologist Gavin Schmidt .
" The difference between the second and sixth warmest years is trivial because the known uncertainty in the temperature measurement is larger than some of the differences between the warmest years . "
The near - record global temperatures of 2009 occurred despite an unseasonably cool December in much of North America .
High air pressures from the Arctic decreased the east - west flow of the jet stream , while increasing its tendency to blow from north to south .
The result was an unusual effect that caused frigid air from the Arctic to rush into North America and warmer mid-latitude air to shift toward the north .
This left North America cooler than normal , while the Arctic was warmer than normal .

" The contiguous 48 states cover only 1.5 percent of the world area , so the United States ' temperature does not affect the global temperature much , " Hansen said .
GISS uses publicly available data from three sources to conduct its temperature analysis .
The sources are weather data from more than a thousand meteorological stations around the world , satellite observations of sea surface temperatures , and Antarctic research station measurements .
Other research groups also track global temperature trends but use different analysis techniques .
The Met Office Hadley Centre in the United Kingdom uses similar input measurements as GISS , for example , but it omits large areas of the Arctic and Antarctic where monitoring stations are sparse .
Although the two methods produce slightly differing results in the annual rankings , the decadal trends in the two records are essentially identical .
" There 's a contradiction between the results shown here and popular perceptions about climate trends , " Hansen said .
" In the last decade , global warming has not stopped . "

But if 4 chan is any indication of what they have in store for us , we are in for a very rough time indeed .
For the blissfully innocent , 4 chan is an image board — a format copied from popular Japanese sites , it allows users to post text and images anonymously .
The anonymous nature of the board , of course , allows users the courage to post everything from the most extreme pornography to death threats to the coordination of raids on public institutions .
The site was started in 2003 by a kid named “ moot ” ( then fifteen ) who set up the site with his mom ’s credit card , and who has managed to keep it going with sporadic ad revenue from only the dodgiest , least scrupulous advertisers .
( Improbably , moot was a top 100 finalist for Time magazine ’s “ most influential person of the year ” award for 2009 . )
4chan and its sister sites , the other “ Chans ” — 7 chan , 420 chan , 711 chan , etc. al. — are the black hole of the Internet .
They collect the worst that the Internet has to offer , a morass compounded from the ids of the world ’s adolescent shut-ins .
All extremities , all filth , all illegal activities — such complete chaos that even Lovecraft ’s monsters would be forced to make a sanity check , and all updated at a speed far beyond what even an NSA data miner could process .
Yet somehow , out of this singularity of abject wrongness , the Chans spew out the Internet humor that preoccupies middle America — LOLCats and the “ Chocolate Rain ” video , for instance .
The Chans are like a particularly huge toxin processor for human consciousness .
They are also , I suspect , our best preview of where human consciousness is going .
Mainstream media coverage of 4 chan and its sister sites has been extensive , especially after the much - noted raids on the Church of Scientology , coordinated on the Chans and conducted on the web and in real life by Anonymous users wearing V for Vendetta masks to conceal their identities from the infamously vindictive organization .
The general attitude of the mainstream media towards the Chans has been one of rubbernecking disgust .
( In typical overstated form , Fox News called it an “ ’ Internet hate machine ’ filled with calls for domestic terrorists to bomb stadiums . ” )
Yet what the media has failed to grasp is what 4 chan can tell us about where we ’re headed .
The Chans are n’t the freak sideshow of the Internet .
They are the heart and soul of the Internet .
And they are the ones furthest ahead of the pack , leading us .
At this point there should be little doubt that the Internet is mutating the human species into something completely different .
Therefore it ’s instructive to look at the most extreme , freebased forms of the Internet to see where we ’re going — and 4 chan is that freebased version of mankind ’s new drug of choice .
Permanently glued to their computers , the Anonymous users of 4 chan exist in a kind of suspended animation , where no attention span is too short .
The Chans show us the chaos at the edge of human perception , where the mind has consumed so much information through artificially enhanced sensory inputs that it begins to break down and cannibalize itself .
The brave pioneers of 4 chan are the Magellans of media desensitization , who abandon the grim reality of their parents ’ basements to wallow in infinite , recursively self - referential filth .
In the last decade , we ’ve seen the increasing acceleration of information ( a la Terence McKenna and Moore ’s law ) heralded as the key to new business development , though it has , in fact , so ruined our attention spans that it is almost impossible for modern man to get any kind of productive work done .
We ’re too lost in the datastream , too focused on taking in new information to complete a task that takes more than a few minutes , at best .
I think a direct correlation can be made , for instance , between the rise of social media and the fall of the economy .
The kaleidoscope of the Internet is more endless , more distracting and more mutating than even the most potent psychedelic drugs could have ever prepared us for .
And 4 chan is the ultimate , final trip .
It is the car crash that can not be looked away from .
Ever .
If the mainstream Internet - using world has driven itself to distraction and insanity with social networking , the denizens of the Chans have upped the ante past all conceivable boundaries , like switching from a light alcohol problem to crushing and injecting Oxycontin .
This is the place where all senses are deadened , where the mind cannot function because it is trapped in its own overstimulation .
This , I am sure , is where media theorists from Marshall McLuhan to Neil Postman to Douglas Rushkoff assured us that the inherently liberating force of information technology was leading us .
And though I am sure they knew that the filth and fury would follow , I ’m not sure they ever expected it to look quite like … this .
My own 4 chan addiction crept up slowly .
Once a casual user of gateway drugs like icanhascheezburger.com , ytmnd.com and Encyclopedia Dramatica , I followed a link to the black hole itself one day and — sucked past its event horizon — have since been unable to escape .
Stuck there now , I am clicking back and forth from this article to peruse the halls of 4 chan ’s /x/ forum , afraid that I might have missed the latest spew from the Internet ’s collective maw .
It is the car crash that can not be looked away from .
Ever .
What is happening here ?
The escape from the constraints of the flesh ?
The escape from the constraints of being human ?
The inevitable purge following the collective unconscious ’ information binge ?
With the Internet we can now erase space and time , erase the restraints placed on the mind by matter .
But what for ?
Once mankind set sail to explore the limits of the human world and to discover the frontiers of the planet .
And once mankind plunged into himself to discover the limits , or lack thereof , of his own nature , through inner experience .
But this is a new world , one bereft of the luxury of such meaningful activities .
And in this new climate , the collective entity known as Anonymous has found a new frontier , and set out to discover the limits of boredom itself , mining the darkness for glittering jewels to bring back to the rest of us .
4chan is , I contend , the most interesting angle we have on the evolution of human consciousness .
It is a shamanic experience , a bardo of becoming , where the soul is detached from the body , set free to wander in the wilderness of banality until it encounters the epic lulz of meeting itself … and finding that it , itself , is the most disturbing thing on 4chan .

This exoplanet orbits the star Gliese 667 C , which belongs to a triple system .
The six Earth - mass exoplanet circulates around its low - mass host star at a distance equal to only 1/20th of the Earth - Sun distance .
The host star is a companion to two other low - mass stars , which are seen here in the distance .
Astronomershave discovered hundreds of Jupiter - like planets in our galaxy .
However , ahandful of the planets found orbiting distant stars are more Earth - sized .
Thisgives hope to astrobiologists , who think we are more likely to find life onrocky planets with liquid water .
The rocky planets found so farare actually more massive than our own .
Dimitar Sasselov , professor ofastronomy at Harvard University , coined the term ?
Super - Earths ? to reflecttheir mass rather than any superior qualities .
But Sasselov says that theseplanets ?
which range from about 2 to 10 Earth masses ?
could be superior tothe Earth when it comes to sustaining life .
On Shaky Ground
It is said that 99 percent ofall species that ever lived have gone extinct .
Earth , it seems , is a toughplace to call home .
Our planet has gone through Ice Ages and global warmingtrends , it has been hit by comets and asteroids ( leading , in one case , to amass extinction that felled the mighty dinosaurs ) , and the amount of oxygen inthe atmosphere has risen and fallen over time .
Our planet is always in a stateof flux , and life must adapt to these changes or die .
The shifting of tectonicplates is another example of Earth ?s restless nature .
Continents bang together , forming mountains , only to be later torn apart .
Islands grow from underwatervolcanoes , and elements are liberated from rocks when they are melted beneaththe crust .
While all this geologicactivity makes us literally stand on shaky ground , scientists have come tobelieve that tectonics is one of the key features of our planet which makeslife possible .
If not for tectonics , carbon needed by life would stay lockedwithin rocks .
The fear today is that toomuch carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will lead to global warming .
Yet toolittle carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would make Earth a much colder place , and the photosynthetic plants and algae that rely on CO2 would perish .
Thedemise of these oxygen - producing organisms would leave us all gasping forbreath .
According to Sasselov , Earth ? smass helps keeps tectonics in action .
The more massive a planet , the hotter itsinterior .
Tectonic plates slide on a layer of molten rock beneath the crustcalled the mantle .
Convective currents within the mantle push the plates around .
For smaller planets like Mars , the interior is not hot enough to drivetectonics .
Super Earths , with alarger and hotter interior , would have a thinner planetary crust placed undermore stress .
This probably would result in faster tectonics , as well as moreearthquakes , volcanism , and other geologic upheavals .
In fact , Sasselov saysthe plate tectonics on Super Earths may be so rapid that mountains and oceantrenches would n?t have much time to develop before the surface was againrecycled .
Venus , only slightly lessmassive than Earth , has had a great deal of volcanic activity , but it does notappear to have tectonics .
This may be because low mass planets need water tolubricate the process , and Venus lost its water long ago through evaporation .
Sasselov says Earth has just enough water for tectonics to work .
Tectonics onSuper Earths might be so efficient that water is n?t even needed .
On the other hand , it ? spossible that a SuperEarth could be entirely covered by water .
Sasselov saysthat in the case of such an ocean world , most of the water will be in an exoticstate known as iceVII -- a very compressed , hard ice with a melting point above 212 degrees Fahrenheit ( 100 degrees Celsius ) .
Whether made of rock or ice , Sasselov says Super Earths will be only 1 or 2 times the actual size of Earthbecause they become densely compressed as they gain mass .
This higher densitywill result in greater gravity .
Sasselov says the most massive Super Earthwould have about 3 times the gravity of Earth .
Tests of human resistance tovertical G - force , where the blood is pulled down to the legs , have found thetypical person can tolerate up to 5 Gs before losing consciousness .
So whileyou might feel much heavier walking on a Super Earth , the extra gravitywould n?t be beyond what human explorers could endure .
Of course , any life thatevolved on a Super Earth would be adapted to the greater gravity , just as ahuman feels comfortable on the 1 G surface of Earth .
Habitable Hot Spots
This greater gravity means aSuper Earth can easily hold onto an atmosphere , so it would not end up with atenuous atmosphere like Mars .
But the role of a planet ?s atmosphere in creatingprime conditions for life can be tricky .
Venus has a surface temperature ofnearly 900 F ( 480 C ) due to the thick greenhouse atmosphere that does n?t letheat escape .
One of the biggest influenceson a planet ?s climate is the star it orbits .
Earth has a circular orbit 150 million kilometers away from the Sun , a yellow dwarf star .
This helps keepconditions warm enough so that our oceans don?t freeze over , but cool enough sothat we don?t lose all our water through evaporation .
The SuperEarths discovered so far orbit a variety of stars .
The first Earth - likeextrasolar planets ever found orbit a pulsar , a rotating neutron star thatemits high energy radiation .
The other Super Earths orbit stars that aresmaller and cooler than our Sun .
Most of the known Super Earthsare veryclose to their stars , closer than the planet Mercury is to the Sun .
Eventhough these stars don?t burn as brightly as our Sun , the planets are so closethey are like burnt cinders flickering close to a fire .
One such hot Super Earth isCoRoT 7 - b ( named for the CoRoT telescope that was used to locate the planet ) .
CoRoT 7 - b orbits the orange dwarf star TYC 4799 - 1733 - 1 once every 20 hours .
This planet is nearly 5 times themass of Earth , but is less than twice as big .
This solar system has another hotSuper Earth , CoRoT - 7 c , which is 8 times asmassive as Earth and circles the star in 3 days and 17 hours .
For astrobiologists hoping tofind alien life , two Super Earths orbiting the star Gliese 581 have potential .
Gliese 581 , a mce_style= " color : black ; " > style= ' color : black '> reddwarf star , is cooler than our Sun .
Based on their orbit around this star , planets Gliese 581-c and Gliese 581-d are thought to have habitableconditions , although some think planet ?c? might have a runaway greenhouseatmosphere like Venus .
Another aspect affecting thepotential for life is the presence of a companion moon .
Earth ?s
Moon helpsbalance our planet ?s rotation on its axis .
Sasselov notes that a Super Earth ?
sextra mass would give it a very stable rotation , so a moon would not be neededto help keep the planet in line .
Superior Alien Civilizations
Missions like the Kepler spacetelescope , launched just this year , could help astronomers find many Earth - likeplanets in the years to come .
Sasselov estimates there could be a hundredmillion habitable Super Earth planets just in our Milky Way galaxy .
He predictswe?ll find 50 to 100 Super Earth planets in the next 5 years .
The existence of so many SuperEarths could explain the ?
Fermi Paradox ?
of why aliens have not contacted us .
If our lower mass planet does not have the ideal conditions for life , alienexplorers would be less likely to look to us , choosing instead to target themany Super Earths in the galaxy .
? Earth is a marginal planet when it comes to conditions we would like to see for complex life to sustain itself , ?
Sasselov notes .
?
In the family of Earth - like planets , the sweet spot for complex chemistry and biochemistry to emerge and sustain itself lies in planets larger than the Earth .?
If aliens on Super Earths everdecided to investigate Earth to see if such a tiny world could harbor life , they would have a harder time sending rockets into space because of the highergravity on their planet .
?
This could be another answer to the Fermi Paradox , ? says Sasselov , ? but it ?s not an insurmountable problem .?
It could even be thatbecause of their deeper gravity well , aliens living on Super Earths would haveto develop a technology superior to our chemical rockets in order to explorethe universe .
Sasselov?s own suggestion for the Fermi paradox relates to the age and evolution of planets in the universe .?
When the universe was young , only hydrogen and helium were available .?
Generations of stellar evolution were needed to produce the heavier elements , such as silica and iron , which build rocky planets .?
Even though the universe is approximately 14 billion years old , our solar system only formed about 4.6 billion years ago .?
( Astronomers did find a 12.7 - billion - year - old Jupiter - mass object in our galaxy , but Sasselov thinks this so - called ancient planet could instead be the remnant of a red or brown dwarf star that was stripped of some of its mass . )
If other rocky worlds with life are about as young as we are , then perhaps the lack of visiting spaceships indicates there are no ancient , highly advanced alien civilizations out there .
? Most life emerges on Super - Earths with habitable potential , but Super - Earths started forming in the galaxy only relatively recently , and few technical civilizations have managed to emerge since , ?
Sasselov says .
The sharing of Iraq 's oil revenues is still under discussion
But minutes ahead of the deadline for an agreement , Sunni politicians said there was no consensus .
The original deadline last week was shifted to midnight on Monday ( 2000 GMT ) when no agreement was reached .
MPs have gathered in the chamber to receive the text but it is not clear what decision they will make .
Shia and Kurdish political groups have enough of a majority in parliament to push through a draft constitution without the support of Sunni members of parliament .
Correspondents say this would be a politically damaging move , possibly further alienating Sunni Iraqis from the political process .
US officials say a delay risks playing into the hands of the insurgents , who killed 10 people in Baghdad on Monday .
Eight policemen were among those killed as their mini-van was riddled with bullets north of the capital .
Stumbling blocks
Shia , Sunni and Kurdish teams have had difficulties agreeing on key issues including federalism , oil and the role of Islam .
" Thank God we have finished all the details related to the agreement , " Shia negotiator Jawad Maliki told reporters .
He acknowledged differences with Sunni Arabs over the key issue federalism - which they oppose for all but Iraq 's northern Kurdish area .
There are still major points of disagreement
Saleh Mutlaq
Sunni committee member
Constitutional issues
The Sunnis oppose greater autonomy for the Kurdish north and Shia south , fearing its share of revenues from those oil - rich regions could eventually be compromised .
And Sunni negotiator Saleh Mutlaq said " major points of disagreement " remained and the plan to submit the text to parliament was unlawful .
" There is still no agreement and if they want to hand the draft today they will be violating the law , " Mr Mutlaq told the Associated Press news agency .
One prominent Kurdish negotiator , Mahmoud Othman , said earlier the Shia insistence on submitting the draft had created a lot of bad feeling .
He said it was important to have the Sunnis on board .
The prime minister 's spokesman has said the government may ask for another one - week extension or " the national assembly would be dissolved " paving the way for fresh elections .
Correspondents say there appears to be little appetite for new elections , so an extension appears the more likely outcome if the deadline is not met for the second time .
The United States has led the way in urging the completion of the constitution , seeing it as a step towards stabilising Iraq .
' Sidelined '
The BBC's Mike Wooldridge in Baghdad says Sunni politicians complain of being sidelined and have urged the international community to prevent the pushing through of a constitution lacking consensus .
He says the most optimistic participants believe a final text at this stage would still leave some details unresolved .
Officials say the communities have edged closer on some issues , but not close enough to come up with a draft form of words for the constitution .
A draft constitution agreed by the committee would be put to a referendum due in October .
If it was approved , fresh elections would follow to elect a fully - mandated parliament under its terms , probably in December .
