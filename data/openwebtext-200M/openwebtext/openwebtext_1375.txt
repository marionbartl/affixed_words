Yeah , Perl 6 is going to allow us to do very interesting things .
Given this code :
use v6 ; subset Filename of Str where { $ _ ~~ :f } ; sub foo ( Filename $ name ) { say " Houston , we have a filename : $ name " ; } my Filename $ foo = $ * EXECUTABLE_NAME ; foo ( $ foo ) ; foo($ * EXECUTABLE_NAME ) ; foo ( ' no_such_file ' ) ;
We get this output :
Houston , we have a filename : / Users / ovid / bin / perl6
Houston , we have a filename : / Users / ovid / bin / perl6
Constraint type check failed for parameter ' $ name ' in Main ( file src/gen_setting.pm , line 324 )
Obviously the error message needs some work ( and I would love to be able to generate custom error messages for subsets ) , but proper use of subsets are going to save a lot of code and prevent a lot of errors .
Flashback Friday .
A reader named Judith B. wrote in confounded by the copy describing the watch pictured above .
It began :
Do n’t be fooled by the girly blue and white face on this multifunction Pro Spirit® digital sports watch .
It ’s more than a match for any tough guy ’s watch …
“ Girly blue and white ? ” she asked .
“ Huh ? ”
I think I ’ve got an answer for you , Judith .
And it has to do with fractals .
Trees are good examples of fractals : branches can split into two branches , and each of those branches can split into two branches , etc .
The gender binary — that is , the rule that everything ( oh animals , jobs , food , kleenex , housework , sound , games , deordorant , love and sex , candy , vitamins , etc ) gets split into male and female — is fractal .
That means that , for every male or female version of something ( say sports versus dance ) , there is a further gendered split that can be made .
If we take sports , we might divide it into the masculine football and the feminine swimming .
If we take swimming , we could probably divide it down further .
Take education ( which is , arguably , feminized ) : we can split it into physical sciences ( masculine ) and social sciences ( feminine ) .
And we can split the physical sciences into biology ( dominated these days by women ) and physics ( dominated by men ) .
So the gender binary has a fractal character .
What does that mean for blue ?
Well , it means that , even though “ blue ” is socially constructed to be masculine , blue can be broken down into more and less masculine types of blue .
Turquoise and light blue , for example , are often seen as more feminine that the primary color blue or royal / dark blue .
The text , then , is referring to , literally , “ girly blue . ”
Lots of ads aimed at women employ the feminine blues .
These ads sent in by some of my former students are good examples :
Usually the use of a “ girly blue ” serves to balance masculinity and femininity .
It ’s no accident that these ads are sports - related , or use copy such as “ strong & beautiful ” and “ I totally have a soft side .
You comfortable with that ? ”
So , that ’s my explanation for “ girly blue ” : fractal gender binaries .

No , I had to write them .
It was my job .

When you say you had “ a client , ” do you mean President Bush ?
Yes , I mean the president , but also the U.S. government as a whole .

Advertisement Republican Scott Brown has won a shock victory in the race for the US Senate seat in Massachusetts left vacant by Democrat Edward Kennedy 's death .
The result is a huge blow to President Barack Obama , whose healthcare reform programme is now in doubt .
Democrat Martha Coakley conceded she had lost the race after early results gave Mr Brown a healthy lead .
The Republican win means the Democrats have lost their filibuster - proof 60 - seat majority in the Senate .
This will make it much harder for Mr Obama to pass a healthcare reform bill - the most important domestic policy objective of his first year as president .
' Senator Beefcake '
The BBC's Paul Adams , in Boston , says Ms Coakley 's defeat is a humiliating defeat for the Democrats , and a deeply unwelcome anniversary present for President Obama exactly one year after his inauguration .
This is a referendum on the Barack Obama agenda and a way of working in Washington , an arrogant approach to politics
Mitt Romney Senior Republican
Your comments on the result Revolution in Kennedy country Obama approval ratings fall
He adds that it is one of the biggest political upsets in years - in a seat held for almost half a century by Edward Kennedy , a Democratic Party colossus , who died last year .
In his victory speech , Mr Brown , 50 , said that the voters of Massachusetts had " delivered a great victory " .
He said : " Tonight , the voters of this commonwealth defied the odds and the experts . "
He also made clear he would join his Republican colleagues in trying to block President Obama 's healthcare reform proposals .
Mr Brown led Ms Coakley by 52 % to 47 % with virtually all votes counted ; a third candidate got less than one per cent .
Dubbed Senator Beefcake in the US media , Mr Brown is a lawyer and former model who posed almost naked for Cosmopolitan magazine in the 1980s while in law school .
' No sugar - coating '
After conceding the election in a telephone call to Mr Brown , Ms Coakley told her supporters she was " heartbroken at the result " .
MARDELL'S AMERICA
This is a calamity for the Democrats , all the more on the very day the president has been in power a year
Mark Mardell
Read more of Mark 's thoughts Sen Robert Menendez , head of the Senate Democrats ' campaign committee , said he had " no interest in sugar - coating " the result .
" There is a lot of anxiety in the country right now , " he added .
" Americans are understandably impatient . "
President Obama had campaigned personally on behalf of Ms Coakley .
Analysts say the race should have been an easy win for her in a state which has traditionally voted for Democratic candidates for the US Senate .
Lacklustre campaign
Just weeks ago , Ms Coakley , the state attorney general , had a double - digit lead in polls and seemed destined to win .
But a lacklustre campaign allowed her Republican opponent to seize on voter discontent and overtake her in the final stretch .
Voters flocked to the polls through the snow and rain that fell all day on Tuesday .
Ms Coakley said she had received a telephone call from President Obama , who told her : " We ca n't win them all . "
Senior Republican figure Mitt Romney said the vote heralded a political sea-change .
" This is really a referendum on the Barack Obama agenda and I think a way of working in Washington , which is kind of an arrogant approach to politics in this country , " the former presidential candidate told Fox News .
Third major loss White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said President Obama had called Mr Brown to congratulate him and to tell him he was looking forward to working with him .
WHAT NEXT FOR OBAMA AGENDA ?
Obama 's bid to reform healthcare and pass climate bill now in doubt
On healthcare , Democrats in House could pass bill already passed by Senate
Or rush a compromise bill through before Brown can take his seat
But that could spark a political backlash on Democrats , even if both houses could agree it so soon
On climate , cap - and - trade bill passed by the House faces even more difficulties in Senate
Q&A : Effect on Obama 's agenda Q&A : US healthcare reform Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said Mr Brown could take his seat " as soon as the proper paperwork has been received " from Massachusetts officials .
Correspondents say the vote does not bode well for the Democrats ahead of November 's congressional elections , and that if they cannot hang on to a party stronghold such as Massachusetts they could be vulnerable almost anywhere .
The result comes amid opinion polls showing nearly half of Americans think President Obama is not delivering on his major campaign promises .
It was the third major loss for Democrats in state - wide elections since he became president : Republicans won governors ' seats in Virginia and New Jersey in November .

Legalization as a means to law and order
One of the tough jobs we have is that so many people have been led to believe that legalization means chaos , when in fact it ’s just the opposite .
This is where the LEAP message has been so effective , and it needs to be hammered home time and time again to reach so many of those who are afraid of legalization .
James P. Gray has an excellent OpEd : Ballot Measure Is Way to Properly Police Pot
Our marijuana policy must change in order to achieve the following goals : Reduce marijuana consumption by children .
Stop or reduce the violence that accompanies the growing and distribution of marijuana .
Stop or reduce the corruption that accompanies the growing and distribution of marijuana .
Stop or reduce crime both by people trying to get money to purchase marijuana and by those under its influence .
Reduce the harm to people who consume marijuana .
Reduce the number of people we must put into our jails and prisons .
He goes on to list a number of advantages of a legalized system ( putting street drug dealers out of business , improving purity , etc. ) , and ends with :
Under this initiative , all crimes committed by people under the influence of marijuana would still be prosecuted , just like we do today with alcohol - related offenses .
Holding people accountable for their actions , instead of what they put into their own bodies , is a truly legitimate criminal justice function .
Interestingly , also at the Sac Bee and following the same general line of thought is Paul Armentano ’s Prohibition of pot feeds lawlessness
This absence of state and local government controls jeopardizes , rather than promotes , public safety .
For example : Prohibition abdicates the control of marijuana production and distribution to criminal entrepreneurs ( e.g. , drug cartels , street gangs , drug dealers who push additional illegal substances ) .
This is good stuff , and an excellent way to de-fang the crass attempts by some prohibitionist law enforcement lobby groups to claim the high ground on law and order .
( see also LEAP ’s appropriate press release : Cops & Judges Support Calif .
Assembly Marijuana Legalization Votes on Tuesday — Law Enforcers Say Ending Prohibition Will Improve Public Safety )
….
Of course , one can hardly miss the opportunity to check out the comments on articles like this , and there is a pretty spirited comment section on the Armentano article , including one rather vocal prohibitionist named fsteph , who follows a truly bizarre line of thought that I ’ve seen pop up more often lately — that libertarianism supports prohibition !
fsteph wrote on 01/10/2010 11:47:56 AM :
NewAmerican – Wrong again .
As a lifetime libertarian I know what life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness truly means .
This new libertarianism is nothing less than a way of keeping our private lives from any moral scrutiny .
A true libertarian resists the pull to privatize all morality — and instead argues that society can’t survive unless we all support the public good .
We do not live alone in this society .
Your actions , especially driving and working loaded ( drugs and / or alcohol ) , can kill your coworker or an innocent bystander ( medical research shows that it impairs memory and motivation ) .
Public order is essential for liberty to exist .
New libertarians conveniently ignore this truth .
I ’ll ask again , is law simply a flexible arrangement whereby we condone any behavior we find inconvenient to restrain ?
I just do n’t get it .
Have these folks actually read anything about libertarian thought ?
Sure , I understand that some libertarians focus more on civil libertarianism and others focus more on financial libertarianism , but a self - proclaimed lifetime libertarian being … pro-prohibition ?
Unreal .
The U.S. Courts released data last week closing out the 2009 fiscal year .
In the release we find that bankruptcy filings are up 100 + percent from 2007 .
No other economic vehicle shows deeper signs of financial strain than bankruptcy .
Bankruptcy is the end of the road for many Americans .
Although businesses file for bankruptcy as well the vast majority of filings come from individuals simply not able to meet the demands of their monthly payments .
Average Americans are looking at the recovery talks but the reality on the street is much different .
Bankruptcy is n’t a new concept .
In fact it has its roots in English law dating back to 1542 under the reign of Henry the VIII .
The first laws of bankruptcy were designed to protect the creditor , not the debtor .
The creditor had the right to seize all the possessions of the debtor and the debtor also lost his freedom by imprisonment if he failed to pay his debt .
Families were left struggling to pay for this debt over multi-generations .
Many in the 1700s that were released from debtors ’ prison left England and immigrated to places like Georgia and Texas in what came to be known as debtors ’ colonies .
We have come a long way from that point in history .
Bankruptcy happens for a variety of reasons including loss of job , divorce , medical , and simply being unable to meet the new terms of onerous debt .
Many credit card companies jacking rates up to 79.99 percent or suddenly setting up traps for consumers only help to accelerate the growing trend in bankruptcies .
In 2005 , the bankruptcy code was redesigned by the banking oligarchs to stick it to the average American yet again .
That is why if we look at quarterly filings , we see an enormous spike in 2005 before the modern debtors ’ prison made its way back :
The spike above is enormous because this happened in a supposedly booming economic time .
Since bankruptcy always involves debt , this bubble decade induced by debt was a perfect breeding ground for bankruptcy .
Many unable to pay their debts saw the writing on the wall and filed before the new law took effect in 2006 .
Even with the new stringent measures bankruptcy filings have been soaring and are now up 104 percent from 2007 .
This is happening because 27 million Americans are unemployed or underemployed and it is hard to squeeze any payment out of someone with no income .
65 percent of all U.S. consumer filed bankruptcies are Chapter 7 cases .
In a Chapter 7 , the individual surrenders their non-exempt property to a trustee that then liquidates the unsecured property .
Usually a home is protected in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy .
That is , unless a home is underwater and is the financial reason for bankruptcy .
In that case , many homeowners will simply allow the home to go into foreclosure and with 300,000 foreclosure filings a month this is what is happening .
After the unsecured property is liquidated , the debtor usually has much of the debt discharged .
But what happened in 2005 was a “ means test ” was added to the bankruptcy process .
Someone that failed to meet the means test would have their case dismissed and possibly have their case converted into a Chapter 13 .
With Chapter 13 , the debtor still holds onto the property but needs to allocate a portion of their income to debt repayment .
If you want to look at the HAMP program that is trying to rework hundreds of thousands of mortgages , this is a mini Chapter 13 .
On the surface it sounds good .
But in reality , this is only a method of siphoning off more money from struggling debtors by the banking oligarchy .
The average American in many of these cases is simply unable to pay their debts .
A large reason for our economic problems stems from too much debt given to too many people .
On a yearly basis bankruptcy filings are still rolling up :
Now if things were recovering why would bankruptcies still be going up ?
The fact of the matter is that many Americans are seeing nothing of the recovery .
The fact that many of the cases are Chapter 7 means that even with the more stringent means tests , many simply do not have the means to pay their debts .
A program like HAMP , in states where housing has fallen by 30 , 40 , or even 50 percent is a Chapter 13 for a home .
On the surface it looks like a helping hand to a homeowner in distress .
But in reality , it is a way for banks to protect their bottom line without confronting the massive onslaught of foreclosures that would result .
The borrower in many cases is still struggling but the banks at least have a little bit of cash flow from the place and can claim the home is still worth the inflated asset value they secured a note with .
Things are so tough , that you have people asking if they do n’t have to pay bills to companies that have filed bankruptcy :
“ ( Cleveland )
The fact that the retailer went broke does not mean that its credit customers get to keep the merchandise they have not yet fully paid for , ” says Cleveland bankruptcy attorney Richard Nemeth .
He says that , if you have n’t already , you can expect to hear from the court - appointed trustee , who will request you pay the loan as agreed .
You should , however , be able to reduce the loan balance by the cost of the soon - to - be - worthless extended service plan .
These kinds of extended service plans usually involve simple maintenance like cleanings and prong - tightenings , and they may cover lost stones . ”
I know some think that people that file for bankruptcy at times are trying to game the system .
This is just another myth perpetuated by the corporate welfare banking system .
In fact , according to the ABA over 85 percent of Chapter 7 filings are “ no - asset filings ” meaning there are no assets for creditors to go after to recover the debt .
Average Americans are still struggling with the real problems of the real economy .
So it should come as no surprise that bankruptcy filings are still trending up .
Without employers hiring and unemployment still high , we can expect more and more Americans to reach the end of their rope .
But also , with $ 3 trillion in commercial real estate coming due in the next five years starting in 2010 we will expect many businesses to also file for bankruptcy protection .
The real economy is telling us something very different from the stock ticker .

There has been a rapid increase in the production and availability of information , in addition to the growing need for access to the same .
Under this context , the transition from print to digital media is increasingly asserting itself as a decisive step towards the creation of a new library structure where information will exist only in digital form , being able to be accessed remotely and shared almost instantly , relatively low costs .
According to Marchiori [ MAR97 ] as a possible break in the treatment and dissemination paradigm of information represented by the resources , activities and services of the “ traditional library ” .
Barker [ apudMAR97 ] identifies the seven basic functions assumed by the library system in use , namely : ·
Preservation and maintenance of culture
Knowledge archive ; · ; · Dissemination of knowledge ; · Knowledge sharing ; · Information retrieval ; · Education ; · Social interaction :
The implementation of digital library systems does not alter the functions listed above , it only provides new ways to make them feasible .
The archiving of information starts to take place in digital media , which allows a better preservation and maintenance of data that were previously subject to the degradation of the medium in which they were stored .
The dissemination , sharing and retrieval of information now has the support of computer networks , hypermedia and knowbots1 .
Finally , a1 In the view of Vinton Cerf [ apud TOM94 ] in relation to the digital library systems of the future , the “ knowbots ” will be small self - sustaining programs that move through networks ,
reside on different machines and load search algorithms in databases relevant .
The knowbots will be able to communicate , translate requests into specific formats , perform searches and then , if necessary , incorporate the search results into a new modified search .10 Education and social interaction take place through the adoption of new paradigms in the process teaching / learning as , for example , Distance Education and Computer Supported Collaborative Teaching .
According to Levacov [ LEV99 ]
“ the library stops being a tranquil deposit of books to become the focal point of varied research , accessed at any time by virtual users of several places in the world ” .
In other words , libraries start to make available other information that is not necessarily that contained in e-encyclopedias books for local or remote users .
1.1 CLASSES OF LIBRARIESBrowning [ apud in LEV97 ] suggests the creation of “ libraries without walls without pages ” through the use of new technologies of information .
Then , the concepts of electronic library , digital library and virtual library arise , which we define as follows : · Electronic library : library in which the basic processes are of an electronic nature , that is , the use of computers includes the
construction of online indexes , the searching for texts and retrieving and storing records · Digital library : your information exists only in digital form .
Although
the collection is not physical , it is still local to the library .
It has all the resources of an electronic library , such as searching and viewing documents ( full text , video , etc. ) , both locally and remotely through computer networks .
· Virtual library : as well as in the digital library , your collection also is exclusively in digital format .
However , its structure is formed by a series of links that point both to a possible local collection and to documents , or any other digital objects2 , scattered on the Web .
Currently , these models coexist with traditional libraries
and multimedia libraries .
The transition to the digital library model follows the advances made through research and projects in this area .
Some of these projects will be presented below .
2
By using the term “ digital objects ” it becomes possible to cover different types of information stored in digital format , be it a document , a song , a film , an engraving , a piece of code , etc. . 111.2 CURRENT OVERVIEW
Due to the growing need for information and the speed with which it is updated , alternatives have been studied for the storage , manipulation , distribution and retrieval of
Due to the growing need for information and the speed with which it is updated , alternatives have been studied for the storage , manipulation , distribution and retrieval of information in addition to the use of traditional libraries .
Some experiments have already been developed using the new paradigm . of the
digital library , highlighting the following : · Project Gutenberg3 : this project intends , until December 2001 , to make free of charge thousands of electronic text texts whose copyright has expired .
·
American Memory Collections4 : the enormous variety of collections at the Library of the American Congress makes it one of the largest libraries of the world .
Little by little , this large amount of information is being made available through the Internet , with the objective of making available documents from its collection that are not subject to copyright law .
One of the largest collections of documents from
the Library of Congress now in digital format is available through American MemoryCollections .
In it , the user will find a heterogeneous set of information in the form of texts , images and sounds .
All documents are freely available to researchers .
· Project Xanadu5 : intends to create a worldwide network that serves as a large repository of all documents of humanity .
These documents , archived in a universal data structure , could point associatively to other similar documents , having in common their digital and hypertextual nature , in which the links redefine the boundary between one document and another .
· ACM Digital Library6 : aware of technological innovations and its applications from births , engineering and information systems , the ACM ( Association for Computing Machinery ) developed the ACM
Digital Library , through which it makes available to its members ,
via Internet , vast resources for searching bibliographic information , citations and full text articles , with updated content of its main periodicals and conferences .
Non-members can also use the research services , free of charge , through a registration as a visitor , but they will not be allowed to retrieve full text articles contained in the library , with restricted access only to abstracts .
·
PUCRS7 Digital Library : this project , under the responsibility of the Faculty of Computer Science and the Central Library of PUCRS , provides for the implementation of an integrated solution for the creation of a digital library , involving aspects such as digitalization of documents , storage , administration , search , distribution and protection of digital objects .

As “ Clive Davis ” : http://www.clivedavisconfab.com/2010/01/how-some-people-see-europe/ notes , “ Charles Murray ” : http://blog.american.com/?p=8616 “ is disconcerted by the number of black and brown faces he sees around him ” during three days that he recently spent stranded in Paris .
I collected data as I walked along , counting people who looked like native French ( which probably added in a few Brits and other Europeans ) versus everyone else .
I ca n’t vouch for the representativeness of the sample , but at about eight o’clock last night in the St. Denis area of Paris , it worked out to about 50 - 50 , with the non-native French half consisting , in order of proportion , of African blacks , Middle - Eastern types , and East Asians .
And on December 22 , I do n’t think a lot of them were tourists .
Mark Steyn and Christopher Caldwell have already explained this to the rest of the world — Europe as we have known it is about to disappear — but it was still a shock to see how rapid the change has been in just the last half - dozen years .
The term “ looked like native French ” is an interesting euphemism , given that a quite substantial percentage ( and , I suspect , a large majority ) of the people whom Murray worried about during his peregrinations were citizens of France .
I rather think that the word that Murray was looking for here is “ white . ”
Meanwhile , Clive also links to this “ very good Foreign Policy article ” : http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/01/04/eurabian_follies?print=yes&hidecomments=yes&page=full on the whole disgraceful Eurabia genre .

Sometimes , I ’ll keep a pear or two out on my vegetable / fruit plate , pushing into it slightly with my finger to check for ripeness each day .
Well , this time , I forgot about my precious pears for a few days , and when I noticed them again , they felt over - ripe .
I put them in my fridge until I could figure out what to do with them .
I did n’t want a whole cake or pie , but something in a ramekin , individually - sized .
Something like this : chocolate pear cakes .
Perfect .
Instead of butter , I used 3 tbsp of coconut oil , melted until liquid .
I did use 2 tbsp brown sugar , but could have easily used agave nectar instead .
Instead of cow ’s milk , I used oat milk .
It also took 40 minutes to bake , instead of the 20 minutes that the original recipe called for .
For the topping , I used a left - over mix of crumble topping that I had made a while ago , and figured this would be a good time to use some of it up .
Served with vanilla ice cream , and you ’ve got yourself a delicious dessert .

Astronomy Picture of the Day Discover the cosmos !
Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured , along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer .
2010 January 16
Explanation : Intense and overwhelming , the direct glare of the Sun is blocked by the smooth occulting disk in this image from the sun-staring SOHO spacecraft .
Taken on January 3rd , an extreme ultraviolet image of the Sun to scale , is superimposed at the center of the disk .
Beyond the disk 's outer boundary is a sungrazer comet , one of the brightest yet seen by SOHO .
The comet was discovered ( movie link ) by Australian amateur astronomer Alan Watson , while examining earlier images from another sun-watching spacecraft , STEREO -A .
Based on their orbits , sungrazers are believed to belong to the Kreutz family of comets , created by successive break ups from a single large parent comet that passed very near the Sun in the twelfth century .
Subjected to strong tidal forces and intense solar heat , this sungrazer comet did not survive its close encounter .
I will be back and write more .
In my mailbox this morning !
I am the President of the ShelterBox Board and I wanted to thank you for your ongoing efforts to raise money for Haiti .
I assume you are the person who started this effort .
If not can you please pass this on to those responsible .
How did you know about us ?
Do you want me to send you news updates and pictures as they become available ?
As you know the situation there is dire .
We have had a report from our people in Haiti that this is worse than the tsunami .
Also one Haitian has told our team that Haiti is gone .
Please let me know what we can do to help you get the word out .
We are posting a thank you to all the donors on the blog , but I wanted to thank you personally for your efforts .

CT Scan Radiation May Lead to 29,000 Cancers , Researchers Warn Researchers warn overuse of CT scans may lead to 29,000 cancer cases annually .
Dec. 15 , 2009  -- Radiation doses from computed tomographic ( CT ) scans are higher than previously thought and vary widely , even among the same types of examinations , two studies showed .
Radiation from medical tests is generally measured in units called millisieverts , or mSv . One mSv is equivalent to the estimated dose of background radiation the average American absorbs in a year .
In the first study , based on information from four San Francisco - area hospitals , median effective doses ranged from 2 mSv for a routine head scan to 31 mSv for a multiphase abdomen and pelvis scan , according to Dr. Rebecca Smith - Bindman of the University of California San Francisco , and her colleagues .
Radiation doses as low as 10 mSv have been linked to an increased cancer risk among survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bomb blasts , the researchers reported in the latest issue of the journal Archives of Internal Medicine .
The issue is important , investigators say , because over the past two decades , the use of diagnostic CT has skyrocketed from 3 million scans nationwide in 1980 to 70 million in 2007 .
In the latest study , exposure varied widely both within and between hospitals .
In many cases , a 13 - fold difference existed between the highest and lowest dose for each study type , " highlighting the need for greater standardization across institutions , " the researchers wrote .
In addition to standardizing procedures , they suggested reducing the number of unnecessary CT scans and tracking dose information for individual patients to lower overall radiation exposure from medical imaging .
A second study , by Amy Berrington de González of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda , Md. , and colleagues , projected that 29,000 future cancers will be directly attributable to CT scans performed in 2007 .
In an accompanying editorial , Dr. Rita Redberg of the University of California San Francisco , editor of Archives of Internal Medicine , said the two studies " make us question if we have gotten carried away in our enthusiasm " for the use of CT .
It 's becoming clear , she said , that the large doses of radiation from CT scans will lead to additional cancers , which must be taken into account when physicians consider use of CT for their patients .
" In light of these data , physicians ( and their patients ) cannot be complacent about the hazards of radiation or we risk creating a public health time bomb , " she wrote .
In a statement , Robert Smith , director of cancer screening for the American Cancer Society , urged caution when interpreting the results of the studies .
" As striking as these numbers are , we need to address this issue with common sense , " he said .
" It is important that patients not refuse a CT scan when one is indicated . "
But he said the results have to be taken seriously .
" They remind us that the potential benefits of a CT scan have to outweigh the possibilities of harm . "
The projected impact on future cancer risk varied by exam type , age , and sex .
For example , an estimated 1 in 270 women who undergo CT coronary angiography at age 40 will eventually develop cancer directly related to that scan , the researchers said ; for men , the estimated rate was 1 in 595 .
Risks were roughly doubled in 20 - year - olds and halved in 60 - year - olds .
" CT is generally considered to have a very favorable risk - to - benefit profile among symptomatic patients , " Smith - Bindman and her colleagues wrote .
" However , the threshold for using CT has declined so that it is no longer used only in very sick patients , but also in those with mild , self - limited illness who are otherwise healthy .
In these patients , the value of CT needs to be balanced against this small but real risk of carcinogenesis resulting from its use . "
In the study by Berrington de González and colleagues , the risk of future cancers from CT scans in 2007 was estimated using risk models based on the National Research Council 's " Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation " report .
Of the 29,000 projected cancers -- or about 2 percent of all cancer diagnoses -- most were expected to be caused by scans of the abdomen and pelvis ( 14,000 ) , chest ( 4,100 ) , and head ( 4,000 ) .
About 2,700 would be caused by CT coronary angiography .
The most commonly caused cancers would be those of the lung ( 6,200 ) and colon ( 3,500 ) , as well as leukemia ( 2,800 ) .
Acknowledging the estimates involved several assumptions , the researchers wrote that " further work is needed to investigate the balance of the risks and benefits from CT scan use and to assess the potential for dose or exposure reduction . "
But in an interview , Dr. James Thrall , radiologist - in - chief at Massachusetts General Hospital and chair of the American College of Radiology 's board of chancellors , said the projections in the Berrington de González study are likely overestimates , he cautioned , which could scare patients and physicians away from using necessary CT scans .
" Radiation should never be given unnecessarily , " said Thrall , who noted that he , too , believes there are too many CT scans performed each year .
" If a scan is necessary , it should be done with the lowest dose possible , " he said , " and before a scan is done the reasons for doing it should be challenged and subject to appropriateness review . "
He also attempted to put the 29,000 projected cancers into context .
Because about a quarter of the population will develop cancer with or without radiation exposure , about 15 million people in the analysis would develop cancer anyway .
" In that context , 29,000 is a very small number when you put it up against the immediate benefits to the patients from the scans they receive , " he said .

It ’s another example there is absolutely no difference between the Bush and Obama administrations , the lamentations of Dick Cheney not withstanding .
Clinton and Gates dredge up al - CIA - duh during Senate Foreign Relations Committee testimony on Capitol Hill .
Bilderberg doorstop and current Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Bush era leftover Secretary of War and Destruction Robert Gates have mounted a corporate media defense campaign in favor of Obama ’s widely condemned mass murder escalation in Afghanistan .
“ Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert Gates highlighted links between al- Qaeda and militants in Afghanistan and beyond to drive home the need for a surge of U.S. troops amid congressional skepticism , ” reports Bloomberg .
Gates and Clinton were teamed up with Admiral Michael Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , during testimony today on Capitol Hill .
“ The three faced questions today from Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on whether al - Qaeda ’s diminished strength in Afghanistan negated the need for deepening U.S. involvement .
The Obama administration is emphasizing the potential of instability in Afghanistan to ripple through the region and worldwide . ”
Sounds vaguely familiar , would n’t you say ?
This is basically the same nonsense used by the Bush neocons to defend their twin mass murder campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The U.S. has increasingly come to see the various militant groups in Afghanistan , Pakistan and beyond not as separate “ but as part of a syndicate of terrorism , ” Clinton told the committee .
“ At the head of the table , like an old mafia diagram , sits al - Qaeda . ”
Yawn .
Is it possible people still believe this tired old and completely discredited explanation ?
Probably not .
But then Clinton , Gates , and Mullen were not talking to the American people , who are wholly irrelevant , but their partners in crime in the district of criminals .
Afghanistan , along with areas across the border in Pakistan , remains the nexus of al - Qaeda ’s operational and propaganda strength , Gates said .
The U.S. has provided extensive resources to fight terrorism globally , he said .
“ It ’s important to recognize where the whole nest is and to deal with that as well , ” Gates told the panel .

Back in September on the anniversary of the false flag attack that made all of this possible , top commander of U.S. and international forces in Afghanistan , Gen. Stanley McChrystal , said he saw no “ indications of a large al - Qaida presence in Afghanistan . ”
Maybe since McChrystal ’s comment the CIA and Pentagon flew in a fresh batch of patsies and mental cases ?
Maybe a few more “ foreign ” helicopters were dispatched as they were earlier this year to ferry in fresh new Taliban troops .
Around the same time the big cheese of Congress , Nancy Pelosi , said she did n’t think “ there ’s a great deal of support for sending more troops to Afghanistan in the country or in the Congress . ”
How things change .
Obama ’s top officials have begun a campaign of congressional and public appearances to ease Democrats ’ anxiety over extending a war that already has dragged on for more than eight years .
The officials are also trying to lessen Republican concerns that a simultaneous plan to begin a drawdown of troops in July 2011 will hamstring the effort .
It is an effort to add the U.S. to other empires that have fallen — since Alexander the Great and the Mongols — in Afghanistan .
It really is pathetic to drag out the government and corporate media created mirage known as al - Qaeda once again and prop it up like a moth - eaten scarecrow .
It ’s not going to work .
Most Americans , save a few recalcitrant neocons and their zombie worshipers , are sick and tired of this war against the people of Afghanistan .
The Clinton - Gates - Mullen trio certainly will not convince them otherwise .
The al - CIA - duh ruse is a prime example of the disturbing bankruptcy prevalent in the district of war criminals .
It remains to be seen how much longer this charade can continue .

According to one historian , the anti-government rallies that made their way across the country last summer , known as tea parties , may explain more about Americans than their views on high taxes and gun control .
Ohio State University historian Randolph Roth claims that the distrust of government on display at the tea parties earlier this year has appeared sporadically throughout America 's history and may be linked to homicide rates .
In short , when Americans begin routinely complaining about how they hate their government and do n't trust their leaders , they commit more murders .
Although odd suspects , Roth believes that people 's views about the legitimacy of government and how much they identify with their fellow citizens play a major role in how often they kill each other – much more so than the usual theories revolving around guns , poverty , drugs , race , or a permissive justice system .
"
The predisposition to murder is rooted in feelings and beliefs people have toward government and their fellow citizens .
It is these factors , which may seem impossibly remote from murder , that hold the key to understanding why the United States is so homicidal today . "
If you look at the evidence over time , poverty and unemployment do n't lead to higher murder rates , as many liberals argue , he said .
But locking up criminals , using the death penalty , and adding more police do n't hold the murder rate down either , as conservatives claim .
At any one point in time , researchers may find an association between one of these causes and homicide rates in a particular area .
But once you try to apply those theories more broadly , at different places and in different eras , the links disappear .
For example , during the Great Depression the homicide rate in the United States went down , even while poverty was increasing .
In the 1960s , the United States had more police and more people in prison than nearly any other nation on earth , along with strong economic growth – and yet the murder rate skyrocketed .
" Criminologists make a case for one theory or another by going through records for a short period of time .
But if they try the same theory in colonial America or the early 20th century , it wo n't fit .
That 's where it helps to have a historical perspective , " Roth said .
In his analysis , Roth found four factors that relate to the homicide rate in parts of the United States and western Europe throughout the past four centuries : the belief that one 's government is stable and its justice and legal systems are unbiased and effective ; a feeling of trust in government officials and a belief in their legitimacy ; a sense of patriotism and solidarity with fellow citizens ; and a belief that one 's position is society is satisfactory and that one can command respect without resorting to violence .
When those feelings and beliefs are strong , homicide rates are generally low , regardless of the time or place , Roth said .
But when people are unsure about their government leaders , do n't feel connected to the rest of society , and feel they do n't have opportunity to command respect in the community , homicide rates go up .
While measuring trust in government and fellow citizens provides one challenge for historians , the other is figuring out homicide rates before the advent of national crime statistics .
To do this , Roth created the Historical Violence Database , housed at Ohio State , which allows researchers to examine data from many studies of homicides from a variety of time periods and places .
This database now includes information on tens of thousands of homicides in different areas of the United States and western Europe from medieval times to the present .
The database includes detailed studies of homicides in places as different as New York City , Holmes County , Ohio , and regions in the far West and Deep South .
The lesson to take away from his research , Roth said , is that the best way to reduce homicide rates has nothing to do with guns , or police , or courts or even economics .
" Political leadership has the greatest opportunity to have a real impact on homicide rates , " he said .
" It is difficult , I know , but we need a leader who can unite the country around some values and beliefs that we can all accept .
That said , leadership can be effective only if the conflicts within a society are manageable .
When they become unmanageable , as they did during the Civil War , even a great leader like Abraham Lincoln can't pull the nation together and keep homicide in check . "

( NaturalNews ) A study conducted by Children Now , a California - based child advocacy group , has been released that indicts the food industry for continuing to market unhealthy food to children .
Despite many food companies ' expressed willingness in years prior to self - regulate themselves and shift their advertising efforts towards more healthy fare , little change has been seen .
In 2006 , the Institute of Medicine ( IM ) made recommendations to the food industry to reform their marketing strategies towards promoting more healthy , nutritious food rather than junk food .
In 2007 , the U.S. Council of Better Business Bureaus launched the Children 's Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative , an effort aimed at meeting the IM recommendations .
Over 12 of the nation 's largest food producers agreed to cooperate in changing their advertising strategies .
The current study found that despite their promises , the food industry has generally failed to adopt any of the primary recommendations .
Advertisements continue to entice children with nutritionally - deficient foods that are attractive to them , often trying to pass their products off as healthy when they are not .
Dr. Dale Kunkel , the author of the study , has concluded based on years of research that the marketing of junk food is a substantial contributor to childhood obesity .
More than 72 percent of television food advertisements aimed at children today are for food products in the worst nutritional category .
Only one percent of all advertising is for truly healthy foods .
Prior to 2005 when the initiative began , 84 percent of television ads were for food products in the worst nutritional category , representing a 14 - percent drop since that time .
Dr. Kunkel sees this as too little and is hoping that Congressional intervention will be the next step .
Let 's be straight about this :
Any nation that wanted to protect the health of its children would flat - out The junk food corporations , of course , now claim " free speech " rights thanks to the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision that effectively grants corporations the same free speech rights as individuals .
So now we 're going to be overrun by " free speech " advertisements for junk food , targeted to children and infants in order to hook them on processed junk foods ..
The corporatocracy cannot be allowed to poison our children with more toxic junk foods and sodas laced with chemical sweeteners .
The United States of America is supposed to be a nation of the People , by the People and for the People ... not for the corporations !
Any nation that raises its children on junk foods has no real future .
Sadly , that now seems to include the United States of America .
Analysts in Europe and the United States are using high resolution satellite imagery to identify and track shipments of timber illegally logged from rainforest parks in Madagascar .
The images could be used to help prosecute traders involved in trafficking and put pressure on companies using rosewood sourced from Madagascar .
Illegal logging of precious hardwoods in Madagascar ’s national parks exploded in the aftermath of a military coup last March .
The coup — which displaced the increasingly autocratic , but democratically elected president , Marc Ravalomanana — triggered a collapse in governance , which was exacerbated when donor countries pulled financial aid .
Without funding , and under pressure from criminal syndicates operating primarily in the northeastern part of the country , park rangers abandoned their posts and loggers moved in , harvesting hundreds of millions of dollars worth of rosewood and ebony from tens of thousands of hectares of protected areas .
Typically the logs were transported from forest areas to ports , where they were loaded onto ships .
Much of the cargo was carried by foreign freighters to Reunion and Mauritius before going on to China .
But since the harvesting and trafficking of rosewood was illegal , a large portion of the logs were hidden in stockyards and buried on beaches .
The Missouri Botanical Garden has taken a leadership role in working to address the logging crisis in Madagascar .
Last month “ transitional authority ” leader Andry Rajoelina authorized rosewood export , ushering in a new frenzy of activity .
Eyewitnesses have reported the presence of “ more than 1,000 ” loggers in Masoala National Park and Makira Natural Park , reserves renowned for their biodiversity , and “ long queues of trucks ” carrying rosewood to Vohemar , a major port in the region .
There are indications that hundreds of containers of rosewood will soon be moved from Vohemar to Tamatave , the country ’s largest port , for export .
Rosewood stockpiles are being uncovered , dug up and readied for shipment .
Timber shipments are being tracked by satellite .
These GeoEye Satellite images from December 2 of Antalaha identify several timber depots .
The four close - ups with a radius of 100 m show rosewood stacks .
Peter Raven , Pete Lowry , and others at the Missouri Botanical Garden have been working with Clinton Jenkins of the University of Maryland to prepare and analyze images from the GeoEye - 1 satellite .
The Missouri Botanical Garden is one of the only major Western NGOs working to address the logging crisis in Madagascar .
But while traders may be able to evade detection locally by concealing their contraband or through bribery , timber stocks and timber - carrying trucks and boats are clearly visible to the rest of world via regularly - updated , high resolution satellite imagery .
Organizations and international law enforcement agencies are therefore capable of monitoring storage and movement of the illegally sourced timber .
Furthermore , new techniques make it possible to determine the origin of wood through its chemical composition , giving authorities powerful investigative capabilities when working to enforce trade laws like the Lacey Act in the United States and FLEGT in Europe .
These regulations put the burden of responsibility on importing companies , holding them to the environmental laws of producing countries , even when those countries are unwilling or unable to enforce their rules .

The Missouri Botanical Garden is one of the only large NGOs working to address the logging crisis in Madagascar .
In the case of Madagascar rosewood , there has already been enforcement action under the Lacey Act : in November , U.S. federal agents raided Gibson Guitar ’s factory in Tennessee due to concerns that the company had been using illegally harvested rosewood from Madagascar .
At least one major Malagasy trader , Jeannot Ranjanoro , could be directly at risk since he does business under Flavour Handling LLC , a corporation based in Delaware .
As a U.S. company , if Flavour Handling is shown to be involved in timber trafficking that violates Madagascar ’s environmental laws , it could be potentially exposed to prosecution under the Lacey Act .
Satellite imagery and chemical signatures of wood could serve as the evidence .

Coup leaders sell out Madagascar ’s forests , people
( 01/27/2010 ) Madagascar is renowned for its biological richness .
Located off the eastern coast of southern Africa and slightly larger than California , the island has an eclectic collection of plants and animals , more than 80 percent of which are found nowhere else in the world .
But Madagascar ’s biological bounty has been under siege for nearly a year in the aftermath of a political crisis which saw its president chased into exile at gunpoint ; a collapse in its civil service , including its park management system ; and evaporation of donor funds which provide half the government ’s annual budget .
In the absence of governance , organized gangs ransacked the island ’s biological treasures , including precious hardwoods and endangered lemurs from protected rainforests , and frightened away tourists , who provide a critical economic incentive for conservation .
Now , as the coup leaders take an increasingly active role in the plunder as a means to finance an upcoming election they hope will legitimize their power grab , the question becomes whether Madagascar ’s once highly regarded conservation system can be restored and maintained .

Global Household Leverage , House Prices , and Consumption
Household leverage in the United States and many industrial countries increased dramatically in the decade prior to 2007 .
Countries with the largest increases in household leverage tended to experience the fastest rises in house prices over the same period .
These same countries tended to experience the biggest declines in household consumption once house prices started falling .
“ [ O ] ver - investment and over - speculation are often important ; but they would have far less serious results were they not conducted with borrowed money . ”
— Irving Fisher ( 1933 )
In the United States and many other industrial countries , the recent financial crisis contributed to the longest and most severe economic contraction since the Great Depression .
The rapid expansion in the use of borrowed money , or leverage , by households in recent years , is one factor that may help account for the virulence of the downturn .
In the years leading up to the crisis , a combination of factors , including low interest rates , lax lending standards , a proliferation of exotic mortgage products , and the growth of a global market for securitized loans fueled a rapid increase in household borrowing .
An influx of new and often speculative homebuyers with access to easy credit helped bid up U.S. house prices to unprecedented levels relative to rents or disposable income .
U.S. household leverage , as measured by the ratio of debt to personal disposable income , reached an all - time high , exceeding 130 % in 2007 ( see Glick and Lansing 2009 ) .
National house prices peaked in 2006 and have since dropped by about 30 % .
The bursting of the housing bubble set off a chain of events that pushed the U.S. economy into a severe recession that started in December 2007 .
This Economic Letter shows that the recent U.S. experience is by no means unique .
Household leverage in many industrial countries increased dramatically in the years prior to 2007 .
Countries with the largest increases in household leverage tended to experience the fastest rise in house prices over the same period .
Moreover , these same countries tended to experience the most severe declines in consumption once house prices started falling .
The common patterns observed across countries suggest that , as in the United States , the unwinding of excess household leverage via increased saving or increased default rates could be a significant drag on consumption and bank lending going forward , possibly muting the vigor of the economic recovery .
Household leverage and consumption : U.S. county data
The typical residential housing transaction is financed largely with borrowed money .
The use of such leverage to purchase an asset magnifies the risk assumed by the buyer .
If the value of the asset subsequently drops , as in a burst bubble , the debt incurred to buy the asset remains in place and the buyer must still repay the loan in full .
If the debt exceeds the asset ’s market value , refinancing options are limited .
If the debt is very large relative to the buyer ’s income , repayment can strain the buyer ’s finances , forcing a reduction in other spending .
And if the strain becomes too great , the buyer may be forced to default , shifting some or all of the loss to the lender or the taxpayer if the loan is government - insured .
Using data on household borrowing for the 450 largest U.S. counties by population , Mian and Sufi ( 2009a , b ) provide evidence that the rapid rise in household leverage in recent years was a primary driver of the recession that began in December 2007 .
Their analysis identifies several important patterns .
First , they find that house prices rose faster in areas where subprime mortgages were more prevalent .
This suggests the existence of a self - reinforcing feedback loop in which new buyers with access to easy mortgage credit helped fuel the run-up in prices by bidding competitively for houses , which in turn encouraged lenders to ease credit even further based on the assumption that house prices would continue to appreciate indefinitely .
Second , the authors find that for each incremental dollar of house price appreciation , the average homeowner extracted about 25 to 30 cents in cash via home equity borrowing , which was used primarily for consumption or home improvement .
This indicates that house price appreciation fueled by easy mortgage credit was a significant driver of economic growth during the boom years .
Third , they find that counties that experienced the largest increases in leverage tended to experience the sharpest rise in loan defaults and the most severe recessions , where severity is measured by the subsequent fall in consumption of durable goods or the subsequent rise in the unemployment rate .
The last point suggests that recession severity in a given area reflects the degree to which prior growth there was driven by an unsustainable borrowing trend–one which came to an abrupt halt once house prices stopped rising .

As in the United States , household borrowing in many industrial countries grew rapidly in the years leading up to the financial crisis .
Figure 1 depicts the increase in the household leverage ratio , defined as household debt as a percent of disposable income including transfers , in the United States and 15 other industrial countries over a 10 - year period ending in 2007 , according to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development .
Compared to the U.S. household leverage ratio of around 130 % in 2007 , leverage ratios were significantly higher in some countries , including Denmark ( 199 % ) , Ireland ( 191 % ) , and Netherlands ( 185 % ) , but lower in others , such as Italy ( 43 % ) , France ( 60 % ) , Belgium ( 64 % ) , and Germany ( 82 % ) .
From 1997 to 2007 , the U.S. household leverage ratio rose by 42 percentage points .
Other countries experienced a greater increase in household leverage over the same period , including Ireland ( +85 points ) , Netherlands ( +82 points ) , Denmark ( +69 points ) , Portugal ( +65 points ) , Spain ( +52 points ) , United Kingdom ( +52 points ) , and Norway ( +50 points ) .
At the other end of the spectrum , leverage ratios rose only modestly in Austria ( +13 points ) , Belgium ( +14 points ) , and France ( +15 points ) , while they actually declined in Germany ( - 2 points ) and Japan ( - 5 points ) .
Figure 2 plots the trajectory of real house prices in the United States and other industrial countries since 1997 .
Austria , Belgium , and Portugal are omitted due to lack of data .
Real house prices in the United States rose by roughly 50 % , reaching a peak in 2006 .
House prices in other industrial countries also rose substantially and in most cases more than in the United States .
At their peaks , prices rose the most in Ireland ( 172 % ) , United Kingdom ( 146 % ) , Spain ( 118 % ) , and France and Sweden ( 108 % ) , followed by Denmark , ( 89 % ) , Netherlands ( 75 % ) , and Italy ( 61 % ) .
These dramatic run-ups , which far exceeded the growth in disposable incomes over the same period , show that housing bubbles were widespread .
The two exceptions were Japan and Germany , where real house prices fell over this period .
However , both countries had previously experienced large run-ups in house prices during the late 1980s and early 1990s .
Figure 3 combines data from Figures 1 and 2 .
The scatter plot shows that countries exhibiting the largest increases in household leverage from 1997 to 2007 also tended to experience the fastest rise in house prices over same period .
The pattern suggests that the link between easy mortgage credit and rising house prices held on a global scale .
Figure 4 shows that countries experiencing the largest increases in household leverage before the crisis tended to experience the most severe recessions , where severity is measured by the percentage decline in real consumption from the second quarter of 2008 to the first quarter of 2009 .
Consumption fell most sharply in Ireland ( - 6.7 % ) and Denmark ( - 6.3 % ) , both of which saw huge increases in household leverage prior to the crisis .
Consumption was flat or fell only slightly in Germany , Austria , Belgium , and France , which were among the countries that saw the smallest increases in household leverage before the crisis .
Overall , the data suggest that recession severity in a given country reflects the degree to which prior growth was driven by an unsustainable borrowing trend .
Of course , other factors besides leverage could have influenced the post - crisis consumption pattern .
These include actions taken by policymakers in the respective countries to mitigate the economic fallout from the financial crisis .
Interestingly , King ( 1994 ) identifies a similar correlation between prior increases in household leverage ratios and the severity of the early 1990s recession using data for 10 major industrial countries from 1984 to 1992 .
Reviewing earlier historical episodes , he also notes that U.S. consumer debt more than doubled during the 1920s–a factor that probably contributed to the severity of the Great Depression in the early 1930s .
Conclusion
Going forward , the efforts of households in many countries to reduce their elevated debt loads via increased saving could result in sluggish recoveries of consumer spending .
Higher saving rates and correspondingly lower rates of domestic consumption growth would mean that a larger share of GDP growth would need to come from business investment , net exports , or government spending .
Debt reduction might also be accomplished via various forms of default , such as real estate short sales , foreclosures , and bankruptcies .
But such deleveraging involves significant costs for consumers , including tax liabilities on forgiven debt , legal fees , and lower credit scores .
As countries begin to emerge from the recession , it is important to consider what lessons might be learned for the conduct of policy .
History suggests that asset price bubbles can be extraordinarily costly when accompanied by significant increases in borrowing .
During the recent housing bubble , underwriting standards were weakened and credit extension rose at abnormally high rates , creating a self - reinforcing feedback loop that drove house prices upward .
In the aftermath of a global boom - and - bust cycle in credit and housing , financial regulators should take the necessary steps to prevent a replay of this damaging episode .

The CIA , Narcotics & Underworld : Doug Valentine Interview
By SUZAN MAZUR
81 Bedford Street & Richard Helms ( from Suzan Mazur's Archives )
Richard Helms , chief of the Central Intelligence Agency 's Clandestine Services , asked the Agency to start funding a biochemical warfare program in 1953 called MKULTRA , which included the drugging of unwitting suspects in New York 's Greenwich Village with LSD and other hallucinogens .
One of the safehouses was at 81 Bedford Street across from Chumley 's speakeasy .
While many of Greenwich Village 's buildings today bear historic plaques , the CIA 's mind control experiments at 81 Bedford Street go unacknowledged .
Several years ago , when I was trying to make the distinction between Lewis Lapham , the Editor of Harper 's Magazine -- whose roots are in an old San Francisco banking family -- and Lewis Lapham , the Central Intelligence Agency 's man , I was directed to author Doug Valentine by Lou Wolf , Editor of Covert Action Quarterly , who described Valentine as one of the most knowledgeable people on the CIA .
Valentine told me the two Laphams were not the same man .
I was relieved .
But in the next breath he said that Tony Lapham , Harper 's Editor Lewis Lapham 's brother , had been both a covert CIA agent and General Counsel to the CIA , appointed in 1976 by then Director of Central Intelligence , George H.W. Bush .
I was again concerned .
Lewis Lapham has since left Harper 's to start his own publication .
I 've kept in touch with Doug , and recently asked him if he'd help me to flesh - out the new CIA book , Legacy of Ashes by Tim Weiner , the New York Times National Security reporter .
Doug Valentine is a poet and also the author of several incredibly rich and revealing books on the workings of National Security .
Best known of these is the Phoenix Program
about the Vietnam War and Strength of the Wolf : The Secret History of America 's War on Drugs .
His new book , Strength of the Pack , volume two about America 's war on drugs , will be published next year by the University of Kansas Press .
Strength of the Wolf documents the history of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics .
The FBN rubbed up against the CIA and FBI until it was finally rubbed out by " the Establishment " in 1968 .
Valentine attributes the demise of the FBN to the bureau 's success in penetrating the Mafia and the French connection and case - making agents uncovering " the Establishment 's ties to organized crime " .

Over the past 15 years the Charlie Rose Show 's host and executive producer , the elegant Charlie Rose , has established himself as sort of the US minister of propaganda , using PBS as a platform , and funding from major foundations and major banks to broadcast his public affairs program from New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg 's Bloomberg News studios in Manhattan .
Sometimes the propaganda is a result of Rose not knowing the material , making it a perfect showcase for the Kissingers , Holbrookes , etc. to maneuver around in .
For the record , I appeared on the broadcast in the 1990s when the show first went national , to discuss the crisis in Sudan .
The Khartoum government had been overwhelmingly condemned for human rights violations by the UN .
It was not letting in Western journalists .
Osama bin Laden , Carlos the Jackal and Abu Nidal were all based in Khartoum at the time .
Is it a coincidence that bin Laden was there ?
Maybe not .
Khartoum had been the CIA ’s most important outpost in Africa and Sudan ’s de facto leader , Hassan Turabi , had an interesting history with the CIA , most visibly through Operation Moses .
I managed to get in and do a videotaped interview in Khartoum with Hassan Turabi .

It 's to Charlie Rose ’s credit that he attempted a segment on Sudan when nobody else was really .
Fortunately , John McLaughlin followed up , inviting me for an in - depth look at the issues .
However , even in those years , the Charlie Rose Show seemed controlled or perhaps bungled so that none of the footage from my conversation in Khartoum with Turabi or discussion of that conversation or even discussion of my visit to Khartoum made it into the broadcast .
Rose ’s focus was on starvation , and a decade and a half later we still have starvation – now in Darfur – because the media backed by big money will not look squarely at the problem .
It takes work and honesty .
As you ’ve said so well in the introduction to your book , Strength of the Wolf : The Secret History of America ’s War on Drugs :
“ Much of our history is hidden behind a wall of national security and that sad fact prevents America from realizing its destiny . ”
My first question to you is this :
In Tim Weiner ’s hour - long talk with Charlie Rose about his book on the CIA , Weiner made the point that the late Director of Central Intelligence , Richard Helms , thought it was tragic that the US did not care enough anymore about espionage , which “ seeks to know the world ” through secrecy and deception .
Charlie Rose replied , “ I do too . ”
What is US national security all about really – whose national security is being served ?
Doug Valentine :
It 's a class issue .
The CIA has not been running around the world trying to improve the lives of poor people , to raise their standard of living , even though they say they ’re out there trying to bring freedom and democracy to the world .
They ’re just as likely to back a Pinochet , a despot , as they are to fight a Communist .
Suzan Mazur :
What do you suppose the New York Times is up to with the Weiner book ?
Why is a reporter from one of the most important commercial newspapers , sticking it to the CIA by exposing the CIA ’s 60 years of horrific failure , with monarchs and dictators on the payroll ( King Hussein of Jordan for 20 years , Mobutu , etc. ) , when as you note in your richly informative book on the Federal Bureau of Narcotics , “ Establishment privateers run the secret government ” ?
Doug Valentine : Most of what Weiner writes about the CIA is already known .
It ’s a history book with a bias , not an expose , at least not for the Vietnam generation .
He does n’t even really get into the current Bush administration .
He gives us a predictable treatment of William Casey and the Contras , when there was an incredible revival of the CIA under Casey .
William Casey - Image Source
Suzan Mazur : Weiner plays up the fact that long - time CIA counterintelligence chief , James Angleton , was constantly spilling the beans to Kim Philby during their frequent liquid lunches – Philby , a British agent who turned out to be a spy for the Soviet Union .
Doug Valentine : Angleton was key to understanding the CIA .
Weiner has n’t detailed Angleton ’s relationship with the underworld through the Federal Bureau of Narcotics .
He has n’t gotten past CIA 101 .
James Jesus Angleton - Image Source
Angleton had his own mysterious agenda , counterintelligence , seeking out enemy agents inside the CIA .
He had liaison to the Mafia through Charles Siragusa , a Federal Bureau of Narcotics agent – and Mario Brod , a labor lawyer from Connecticut and New York , who as an Army counterintelligence officer had worked with Angleton at OSS – Office of Strategic Services , the forerunner of the CIA .
As I say in the book , James Angleton alone possessed the coveted Israeli account .
His loyalty was to the Director of Central Intelligence , Allen Dulles – then Richard Helms , who was chief of Clandestine Services and later DCI .
Director William Colby was his enemy .
Allen Dulles ( Image Source ) And William Colby ( Image Source )
Through Angleton ’s relationships with Italian royalty , Tibor Rosenbaum [ Mossad agent ] , Charlie Siragusa [ FBN agent ] , Hank Manfredi [ FBN ] , and Mario Brod , he was certainly aware of Meyer Lansky ’s central role as the Mafia ’s banker in the Caribbean - where Lansky ’s mob associate from Las Vegas , Moe Dalitz , opened an account at Castle Bank - as well as in Mexico , where Angleton ’s friend , Winston M. Scott , was station chief , and certainly kept tabs on Lansky ’s associate , former Mexican president Miguel Aleman .
As ever , Angleton and Lansky were the dark stars of the intelligence and financial aspects of international drug smuggling .
Alan Block devotes some pages to this in his book , Masters of Paradise .
Meyer Lansky - Image Source
Angleton thought William Colby might be a mole .
Angleton exposed the divisions within the CIA after 1966 , the Colby vs. Helms factions .
He also represented the literary sensibility the CIA once had , where finding secrets was like teasing the meaning out of a poem .
Now we have sledgehammer spies .
Suzan Mazur :
What kind of cut do the “ privateers ” take from the Agency for clearing the way for new markets abroad however they can do it ?
Doug Valentine : History here :
The feds made it illegal for the government to hire Pinkertons to break up labor unions and so the FBI was formed .
These industrialists in America then had no foreign ambitions .
They kept President Wilson out of the League of Nations .
But other industrialists did have foreign ambitions .
Big division .
It shows the class origins of the CIA .
How the CIA represents a faction of the United States Establishment that has imperial ambitions as opposed to the nativist faction of the American Establishment which is more concerned about doing business here in the United States .
The original CIA is the Foreign Policy Association , which sent representatives to the League of Nations and survey teams around the world looking for market opportunities for the non-nativist industrialists .
Depression brought Franklin D. Roosevelt and social reform .
Before WW II , FDR ( aristocrat ) hired William Donovan ( lace curtain Irish lawyer ) to start the office of Coordinator of Information and then the OSS .
Who was hired to run these organizations ?
Representatives of the privateers .
This is how to understand the money part of the CIA .
Suzan Mazur :
So the current Foreign Policy Association is in essence a CIA ?
Doug Valentine : From my point of view , the Council on Foreign Relations and the Foreign Policy Association are the original CIA .
They work for industry that is interested in trade overseas , inviting themselves into the politics of foreign countries .
They sent representatives to the League of Nations when the United States government would n’t officially do so .
Suzan Mazur :
So nothing has changed in that sense .
Doug Valentine : No .
It ’s a shell game .
Suzan Mazur :
Is there a chance Weiner and Rose are looking out for the common good , and pushing for more resources for the CIA in order to prevent a further Shackleyization of intelligence , a further privatization of intel , which disenfranchises most people ( the late spymaster , Ted Shackley , operated a political risk group – Research Associates International – after he left the Agency in the late 1970s and ran oil shipments into apartheid South Africa , for example ) ?
( See… Scoop : John Deuss - The Manhattan projects )
Ted Shackley - Image Source
Doug Valentine : Trick question .
The CIA created its own privateers , as spying itself became an industry .
Weiner and Rose have no say in the matter .
Weiner is doing a history book .
He ’s not a player as far as I know .
He ’s not someone who ’s actually making foreign policy .
He has n’t explained with any depth that would indicate he has any vested interest in either promoting the CIA or not promoting the CIA .
It 's a superficial account of something that ’s really serious .
Something called " courting the compatible Left " was also a useful instrument of the Agency , created after WWII .
That was pretty much devised by a guy named Cord Meyer , who was head of the CIA ’s International Operations division .
Suzan Mazur : Speaking of affairs , Weiner ’s mention of Cord Meyer on the show had to do with Meyer ’s ex-wife ( no name ) , who was one of JFK ’s lovers , being mysteriously murdered and Angleton turning up at her house to see if there was a diary .
But as you illuminate in Strength of the Wolf , Mary Pinchot Meyer took LSD given to her by Timothy Leary and also distributed it to the Washington Establishment , possibly to JFK as well .
LSD Guru Timothy Leary - Image Source
Doug Valentine : Cord Meyer worked with Angleton and used people like labor leader Irving Brown and Jay Lovestone to travel around Europe in the early 1950s .
Despite all the strum and drang about battling the Soviet Union , what the CIA was really trying to do was court Socialists away from Communists to form Social Democracy governments to counter the influence of the Soviet Union .
Eventually that strategy worked .
That was really what was going on behind the scenes .
The CIA never had to convince right wing governments that they should fight the Soviet Union .
It was a battle that was occurring secretly .
Even here in the United States , the CIA was always trying to recruit Liberals .
Suzan Mazur :
Do you think Weiner and Rose may be hinting that some kind of a global intelligence agency should rise up out of the “ ashes ” of the CIA , which they repeat has “ lost its primacy ” ?
Afterall , the US has merged Defense operations with the UK to a degree , etc. etc .
Doug Valentine :
That assumes the CIA is in ashes , I do n’t think it is .
But technically , the CIA has liaison relations with the intel services of almost every country , so what you see is the " consolidated " CIA running everyone 's intel servces .
Suzan Mazur :
Why is a Times reporter the messenger for this ?
What does it say about the NYT ’'s compromised relations with the National Security Establishment where Weiner has access to 10 directors and conducts 300 interviews with agency officers ?
We know from the Church hearings in the 1970s of the CIA ’s links to major news organizations and foundations – like the Ford Foundation and Asia Foundation – and dictating content and direction , getting bureau chiefs to assist in the overthrow of governments .
Charlie Rose gets his funding from major foundations , and of course , major corporations – although he ’s just announced he ’s now also considering Internet funding like PayPal .
No doubt because people are disgusted by the right wing noose he ’s currently in on public television .
Doug Valentine : Some things never change .
The Weiner CIA book is revisionism for a purpose .
Suzan Mazur :
More recently , we 've had Lewis Lapham running Harper ’s magazine while his brother Tony Lapham was the CIA ’s general counsel .
How tight would you say the connections between the CIA and the media are at the moment , including the new media ?
Doug Valentine : Tony Lapham was a George H.W. Bush appointee as CIA General Counsel when Bush was DCI .
Lapham had also been a covert agent .
He ordered the shut down of a CIA MKULTRA New York safe house at 105 West 13th Street in Greenwich Village where the agency did some of its mind control experiments .
George H.W. Bush - Image Source
To answer your question about the connections between the CIA and the media and new media – I ’d say they ’re tighter than ever .
It has to do with the centralization of wealth and influence .
News organizations used to be a lot of independent owners of news outlets .
There ’s now less and less of that .
It goes hand in hand with the consolidation of capital in the United States .
The media ’s in the hands of fewer and fewer people , and those people are closer and closer to the imperial interests of the United States abroad .
Their interests are now more in tune with the interests of the CIA .
And they ’re more likely to skew , without even being agents of the CIA .
So you do n’t have to rely on the old boy system anymore ; accommodating the CIA is built into the system because of the consolidation of capital .
It ’s been reported that the CIA writes for Wikipedia , the online encyclopedia .
So establishing and corroborating sources is more important now than ever .
Also , since Watergate and Deep Throat , there ’s a tendency on the part of CIA - connected journalists like Bob Woodward and Seymour Hersh to use anonymous sources .
Just another sign of how incestuous it is between the media and the CIA .
Suzan Mazur : Rose and Weiner agree that Bill Clinton had a dysfunctional relationship with the CIA .
Would you comment on the Clintons ’ relationship with the CIA ?
First there was Operation Chaos , right ?
And then Mena ?
You ’ve got a new book coming out this Fall , Strength of the Pack , that refers to the Mena Cartel .
Can you name some names – who were the Mena Cartel ?
Doug Valentine : Well , I ’m actually being facetious in the book about the Mena Cartel .
I have n’t been on the ground in Mena researching the drug operation there , so I ’d prefer not to get into a detailed discussion about it .
But if anybody should be associated with the goings on at Mena – Barry Seal and his operations – it ’s William Casey , George Bush I , and Ronald Reagan .
Mena was a CIA operation that existed between 1981 and 1984 but became an issue while Clinton was president and was used to deflect attention from Iran - Contra and the CIA ’s own involvement in international drug trafficking .
( See… Scoop : Mazur : Deeper Into The Clintons ' CIA Drug Nexus )
Suzan Mazur : Speaking of drugs , Weiner does a Holly - go - lightly over the CIA ’s MKULTRA mind control episode .
He says the Agency destroyed almost all the MKULTRA records .
But beyond Richard Helms ' and Allen Dulles ' MKULTRA program of random drugging of Greenwich Village Leftists at 81 Bedford Street in the 1950s and 60s after getting them drunk at Chumley ’s speakeasy across the street , or around the corner on Cherry Lane at the Lefty Blue Mill tavern – in your book , Strength of the Wolf , you mention the Agency ’s involvement on the Colombian Amazon where the celebrated American adventurer Mike Tsalickis , the region ’s one - time US Vice Consul , was asked to find some useful tropical drugs for the CIA – probably along the lines of hallucinogenic yaje .
Curiously , in the late 1980s , Tsalickis was busted for smuggling into the US 4.4 tons of cocaine in a shipment of Brazilian lumber ; it was the biggest cocaine bust in US history at the time .
Tsalickis told me in a phone conversation following the bust that the feds were in the drug business on the Amazon .
The DEA told me they ’d been tracking Tsalickis ’ exploits for 10 years .
He was sent to Marion .
Believe he ’s out now .
I stayed at Tsalickis ' hotel there in Leticia , the Parador Ticuna , months before the drug bust , researching a story .
Leticia was indeed the wild frontier , made wilder because of the armed desperados high on drugs .
Have fond memories of the night I spent upriver at Tsalickis ’ Monkey Island communing with caiman by flashlight and their cooing -- nyock , nyock , nyock .
. . .

There were clearly no surveillance cameras in the bird nests along the banks of the Amazon – it was anything goes on the river .
Peru on the opposite bank and Brazil a walk across the Colombian border .
Recall sitting around a table at Tsalickis ’ Leticia hotel sipping Aguardiente with a British art scholar and a lumber dealer from Manaus , the latter anxious about speaking with Mike about a lumber sale .
Kept pacing . .
Weiner does not go into the CIA ’s commercial drug exploits .
In fact , he quotes Helms in his book as follows :
“ We could get money anyplace in the world . . .
We ran a whole arbitrage operation .
We did n’t need to launder money – ever . ”
Would you comment ?
Doug Valentine : Angleton ran the CIA 's narcotics operation , in league with the Federal Bureau of Narcotics , until 1971 , when Helms put it under Tom Karamessines at operations ; Karamessines was the former CIA Athens chief .
I know for a fact that Angleton in the counterintelligence division of the CIA was in charge of its relations with law enforcement agencies , including the Federal Bureau of Narcotics , which is one of the reasons organizationally that he ended up having relations with people like Charlie Siragusa , a high ranking official in the FBN .
This is how Angleton enters into relationships with Corsican drug traffickers and uses them for counterintelligence operations .
I know this because I interviewed one of the officers who was on Angleton ’s staff and who actually was his liaison to the Bureau of Narcotics .
And I ’ll be talking more about that in my new book , Strength of the Pack .
The guy ’s name was Jim Ludlum .
People say he ’s related to Robert Ludlum .
In 1968 the Federal Bureau of Narcotics was abolished and Lyndon Johnson ’s administration created the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs .
Angleton and the CIA continued to have an official relationship with the BNDD until 1971 , at which point Nixon declared narcotics law enforcement a national emergency and made it an issue of national security .
And at that point relations switched from Angleton at counterintelligence to the operations branch of the CIA .
That ’s incredibly important in understanding the history of the CIA ’s involvement with drug trafficking , because now it ’s no longer a function of counterintelligence , something deep inside the Agency .
Now you actually have CIA chiefs of station all around the world becoming actively involved in collecting intelligence on drug trafficking .
It became in 1971 a very , very big business – drug trafficking within the CIA .
Suzan Mazur :
When you say big business , what exactly do you mean ?
Doug Valentine :
There was a guy at the CIA who worked with the BNDD .
Jim Ludlum then gave up his liaison relationship because he was counterintelligence and the new liaison was an operations officer .
His name was Seymour Bolton , the father of Joshua Bolton – now a high ranking official in the Bush administration .
What the CIA drug business is , is controlling how the DEA targets foreign drug traffickers .
The CIA ’s drug business is the management of how the DEA conducts foreign investigations .
The CIA reports directly to the president or the national security council and there are issues to consider in going after traffickers that transcend law enforcement and involve national security .
Which is why Nixon made that change .
Nixon did not want officials going off and investigating Chinese drug traffickers at the same time he was to trying to secretly form diplomatic relations with China .
So he had to put the CIA in control of how the DEA mounted its foreign drug investigations .
Suzan Mazur :
And what are your thoughts about that arrangement ?
Doug Valentine :
If you ’re going to go about the business of empire , creating an empire around the world , you do n’t want to put it in the hands of a law enforcement agency that ’s going to bust Salvador Allende yesterday and General Pinochet tomorrow .
You want to make sure they only bust Allende .
And that Pinochet gets away with drug trafficking for 20 years .
How the CIA evolved over the past 60 years in all these different ways in relation to narcotics trafficking , to the media , in relation to foreign policy , etc. – has enabled it to consolidate power .
It ’s far from being out of business or in descent or rising from the ashes .
It ’s more powerful than it ever was .
Suzan Mazur :
Are you familiar with the Eurasia Group ?
Started out as a mini- foreign policy association back in 1998 , backed by the CIA – the so - called analyst side – and the Council on Foreign Relations .
I attended some of their fascinating meetings .
They invited a slew of officials and former officials of the FSU , as well as business leaders to speak – Boris Berezovsky , etc .
There 's been a controversial Russian industrialist on the advisory board from the start .
At some point they began charging $ 100 to attend meetings .
And I got an angry phone call from EG because I ’d contacted someone I met at one of the meetings regarding an interview .
Apparently EG was now selling those contacts the CIA & CFR helped them establish .
Eurasia Group has had some affiliation with Lehman Brothers and is considered the world ’s largest political risk group .
( http://www.eurasiagroup.net/about/ )
Doug Valentine : One of the great untold stories of the CIA .
Privatization of intelligence – as you call it , Shackleyization .
RJ Hillhouse , a blogger who investigates the clandestine world of private contractors and US intelligence , recently obtained documents from the Office of the Directorate of National Intelligence ( DNI ) showing that Washington spends some $ 42 billion annually on private intelligence contractors , up from $ 17.54 billion in 2000 .
Currently that spending represents 70 percent of the US intelligence budget going to private companies .
William Casey sort of paved the way for the downfall of the Soviet Union .
The CIA officers involved in the Russia division at that time were responsible for recruiting over to our side KGB officers , intelligence officers , government officials who brought about the breakup of that republic .
Those relationships still exist .
And if anybody was REALLY interested in doing a history of the CIA , that particular aspect would be the most explosive story .
Suzan Mazur :
In your book you also tie in Agency drug operations to the JFK assassination .
You note that " the CIA protected its drug dealing assets in the Mexican intelligence services " and say further :
“ [ I ] t ’s possible that SDECE [ French Intel ] agents working for the KGB may have sent an assassin into Dallas [ to kill JFK ] through Angleton ’s [ Irving ] Brown -[ Maurice ] Castellani drug network , or through Paul Mondoloni [ a Corsican who smuggled drugs from Mexico and then from Cuba under Batista 's protection ] . ”
You say this assassin may have been the Agency ’s own QJ / WIN with Oswald as the patsy :
" The best evidence suggests that this mysterious operative [ QJ / WIN ] was Jose Marie Andre Mankel , as Mason Cargill ( a staff member of vice president Rockefeller 's Commission to Investigate CIA Activities within the United Sates ) reported in a 1 May 1975 memo .
. . .
According to documents contained in his 201 - file , QJ / WIN was tall and thin , married ( although homosexual ) , with many friends in well - to - do Parisian circles .
He was a conman extraordinaire ! "
It ’s interesting , Tim Weiner says in his book that President Lyndon Johnson requested all the files on Oswald following his murder by Ruby -- who you say was a Federal Bureau of Narcotics informant beginning in the 1940s -- and that those files then vanished .
You say further in your book :
“ JFK wanted to expel Air America , the CIA ’s drug smuggling proprietary airline from Laos .
And , in 1962 in another attempt to curb the CIA ’s drug smuggling activities in East Asia , Bobby [ Kennedy ] indicted Sea Supply manager Willis Bird .
. . .
Kennedy ’s enemies ensured that the Bird prosecution was blocked , and that Air America kept its contract in Laos , and continued to fly drugs .
Meanwhile , General Walker , the far - right American Security Council ( including General Lansdale and Air America Chairman Admiral Felix Stump ) , and the Texas ultras started plotting their coup d’etat in Dallas . ”
And you note that Senator Estes Kefauver 's committee investigation was kept away from a discussion of Dallas , Ruby would only tell the committee what he knew about Chicago .
“ Was it to deflect attention from the Pawley - Cooke mission in Taiwan , which was funded by ultra Texas oilmen like H.L. Hunt , and which in 1951 , was facilitating the CIA - Kuomintang drug smuggling operation that entered the US by crossing the Mexican border at Laredo , Texas ? ”
You also say that Joseph Civello ran the heroin business in Dallas with John Ormento and the Magaddino family in Buffalo and that they were linked to Carlos Marcello , Santo Trafficante , Jr. and Jimmy Hoffa – “ the House Subcommitte on Assassination ’s three prime suspects in the JFK murder . ”
Then you note that Hunt and the other Texas oil men , including the emerging Bush dynasty , were also outraged at JFK for planning to “ eliminate the oil depletion allowances ” not to mention JFK 's desegregating the South .
Jackie Kennedy in a kind of premonition of Dallas wrote in one of her letters to Clark Clifford that she was concerned about the 50 businessmen in Texas who said : " Why should we do anything to help the Kennedys ? " -- something I highlighted in one of my FT stories .
( See. Financial Times : he President 's Man )
Anything you 'd like to add ?
And are you still of the opinion that QJ / WIN may have been JFK ’s assassin and that the best evidence suggests he was Mankel .
Doug Valentine : First of all , I do n’t pretend to know who killed Kennedy .
For all I know it could have been Lee Harvey Oswald .
That chapter on JFK in my book is speculative , that is to say , if the CIA was involved in JFK ’s assassination , how would it have been involved .
And it goes back to the relationship the CIA had with the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and in particular with an agent named George White .
George
White was the guy the CIA went to when they wanted to start up the MKULTRA program at Bedford Street .
But prior to that , in 1947 , he was head of the Chicago office and one of his informants was Jack Ruby .
Jack Ruby went to Dallas in 1948 working for White and actually infiltrated Bugsy Siegel ’s Mafia drug connection with the Kuomintang in Mexico .
As far as I know nobody was ever arrested .
Bugsy Siegel was killed because he was getting a little out of control .
Bugsy Siegel - Image Source
The CIA needs to manage drug trafficking in a way of providing internal security for it .
It needed to keep the Mafia happy .
It needed to keep Mexican officials happy .
It needed to keep the Kuomintang financed and so the CIA protected this drug route of Nationalist Chinese heroin going through Mexico through Nuevo Laredo through Laredo and into Dallas into Chicago .
Suzan Mazur :
And they protected it for how long ?
Until when ?
Doug Valentine :
Well as far as I know .
Suzan Mazur :
They ’re still protecting it .
Doug Valentine :
They never stopped protecting it .
Suzan Mazur : I did a story recently about the Mormon church – which the CIA and FBI have traditionally recruited heavily from – and possible LDS drug money link in Mexico , where the Mormon church doubled its membership beginning in the mid 1980s when the Latin American drug epidemic really hit .
( See …Scoop : LDS Church -- Mexico Drug Money Connection ? )
The treasury of the LDS church is nobody ’s business but the LDS church ’s .
The story followed one about a Roman Catholic bishop who went on television in Mexico announcing that his church was , of course , taking substantial donations from drug traffickers .
One of the LDS temples is right there on the border at El Paso .
Doug Valentine :
As far as I ’m concerned , the CIA never stopped protecting those drug routes .
It ’s just an ongoing operation .
Suzan Mazur : Another item Weiner did n’t discuss was that CIA Director Bill Casey turned up in the VIP section of the Mormon church in Salt Lake City one day when author Alex Shoumatoff was visiting , which Shoumatoff writes about in his book , Legends of the American Desert .
Shoumatoff said the CIA recruits heavily from the LDS flock because they ’re good at surveillance technology and tend to be loyal .
I ’ve reported about the FBI recruits from the LDS church , including the former FBI Chief Information Officer , Darwin A. John – a Robert Mueller hiree , coming right from a decade - long job as chief information officer of the LDS church .
( See… Scoop : he AZ Polygamy Town Airport Built With Fed $ $$ Mns )
Doug Valentine : The CIA does n’t get arrested .
So you never really know .
It ’s an espionage organization .
The Rosenbergs in the United States were tried for espionage and given a death sentence .
But this is what the CIA does for its business .
It goes around the world and it gets foreign nationals to spy on their government and it has an army of Rosenbergs out there .
It ’s a group of mafia bosses who are getting people of foreign countries to spy on their own countries and subvert their own countries and they give them masses amounts of dollars to do it .
The CIA people who do these things are no different than the KGB people running the Rosenbergs .
And the issue I referred to earlIer , the " courting of the compatible Left " .
This takes us to Bill Clinton and the CIA .
If anybody represented the compatible Left , it was Bill Clinton .
Bill Clinton destroyed the Democratic party .
There used to be a difference between Republicans and Democrats until Bill Clinton came along .
If anybody was a CIA agent , it was Bill Clinton .
Suzan Mazur : Well , that ’s what Roger Morris is saying in Partners in Power -- his book on the Clintons -- going back to Bill ’s days at Oxford University with Operation Chaos .
Doug Valentine : I do n’t see why people say there was a problem between Clinton and the CIA .
Suzan Mazur : “ Dysfunctional relationship ” , say Weiner and Rose .
Doug Valentine : Clinton and the CIA were hand - in - glove .
They may have had a problem getting a director on the payroll for a while , but I think that was more a problem of the Senate , which was under Republican control .
Just would n’t confirm anybody that he threw up , because they did n’t want anybody who was too cozy with him .
That was in domestic politics .
But it has nothing to do with the fact that Clinton and the CIA were expanding the American empire .
Suzan Mazur :
As in the mad rush for oil in Azerbaijan where we now have a military base ?
The wild amounts of oil there heavily promoted in the major newspapers and then as I discovered in my interviews in Baku -- the dry holes and subsequent resignation of Energy Secretary Pena ?
Another geostrategic move .
Doug Valentine : Yes , Clinton and the CIA were expanding the American empire gleefully , hand - in - hand .
Suzan Mazur : Plus in the 1990s , when Clinton was so chummy with Boris Yeltsin and money was being thrown at the Russians .
And then the Russian economy collapsed .
In the 1990s international organized crime made Russia the biggest money laundering operation in the world as it primed the new Russian economy .
Weiner also does not mention the CIA - linked banks like Nugan Hand or founding CIA father Clark Clifford ’s role in BCCI .
Doug Valentine : Drugs again .
Suzan Mazur :
But you cite in Strength then - general counsel for the Thai Consulate in Miami , Paul Helliwell , establishing and directing a “ string of drug money - laundering banks for the CIA .
And you mention Vanguard Services set up as a front in 1962 “ for yet another batch of CIA - financed , drug - related anti-Castro operations . ”
Can you say more about these outlaw banks ?
Doug Valentine : A little .
Drugs again , and Nugan Hand , and Golden Triangle stuff , among other things .
The Mafia connection to Trafficante and JFK .
Angleton .
Paul Helliwell had been in the OSS .
When Nugan died in 1980 or 1981 , he had William Colby ’s business card on his body .
William Colby was providing legal counsel for the Nugan Hand bank and it had on its board numerous generals , retired US generals who had been in Vietnam .
AND ALL THESE GUYS ARE IN IT FOR THE MONEY .
And if they can get the money selling drugs , they get the money selling drugs .
If they can get the money breaking up the Soviet Union , and then cutting deals with the Mafia and robbing the Russian treasury , then they ’ll do it that way .
THE CIA IS REALLY INTERESTED IN FINANCIAL CRIME .
And one of their stronger suits is financial intelligence and following the money .
Something they ’re light years ahead of the FBI or DEA on .
The CIA was able to put together strong boxes full of $ 750 million dollars and bring them over to Iraq for paying off Iraqi officials in $ 20 bills .
Where did this covert cash come from ?
They ’ve got a diversified portfolio after 60 years in the business :
The institutions they started building up from Ford franchises in the Philippines , kickbacks from Westinghouse for helping them get contracts in Korea , deals with the Mafia , drug traffickers and arms dealers .
The CIA gets oodles of money from the arms business .
Most of their income comes from criminal activity .
The Russian Mafia operates with a sort of impunity .
And so does the Israeli Mafia .
And one of the reasons they have this sort of impunity is that they ’re sharing their profits with the CIA .
And I think a lot of CIA money is capital investments .
They ’re like movie producers .
They want to overthrow the Iraqi government , they go to companies like Halliburton and others who are going to profit from the overthrow of Iraq .
And like the executive producers of some movie , they get them to ante - up some cash .
Telling them , do n’t worry about it , the government contracts you get in return will cover your investment .
Plus they have the old boy network – which now is so far flung .
Suzan Mazur : Plus some of the military contractors are organized crime and have had contracts since the 50s .
Doug Valentine : Exactly .
Which bring us back to Barry Seal ( Iran - Contra ) .
Because in 1972 , Barry Seal was to fly some arms and some explosives into Mexico .
What the Brooklyn Drug Task Force found out is that this guy named Murray Kessler , who was involved with the Gambino family in Brooklyn , had an arms manufacturing company in New Jersey where the guns and the bombs came from .
Suzan Mazur :
And some of these arms merchants also had security clearance during the McNamara and Clifford years of heading the Defense Department .
They make weapons for the US government and some for whoever they feel like .
Doug Valentine : From my perspective , the spy industry and especially the arms industry , is the foundation on which the American empire is built .
The United States has a military budget of I think $ 300 billion dollars and the CIA budget is like $ 50 billion – that ’s a year .
Together that ’s bigger than the gross national product of any country in the world .
And in the meantime we ’re worried about 20 guys in Al - Qaeda .
Suzan Mazur :
And the American people are largely innocent captives of this ever - turning screw .
Weiner considers
Helms the greatest of the CIA directors .
He notes : " When Richard Helms was in charge , the agency spoke the truth to Lyndon Johnson and Robert McNamara about the war in Vietnam and they listened . "
Even though in another breath Weiner says Helms ( like George Tenet ) " caved " : Regarding the reporting of numbers of Vietcong irregulars , Helms said the numbers " did n't mean a damn " .
" Helms felt a crushing pressure to get on the team -- and to trim the CIA 's reporting to fit the president 's policy . "
Weiner says the agency officially accepted the falsified figure of 299,000 enemy forces or fewer .
What are your thoughts about Helms ?
Doug Valentine : A patrician , old school , but destroyed by Kissinger and the neo-con Nixon wave .
Suzan Mazur : Former DCI Robert Gates , now serving as Secretary of Defense , who Weiner says was the Agency ’s chief Kremlinologist but had never been to the Soviet Union ?
Doug Valentine : Boy , you ask a lot of questions .
Suzan Mazur : How about Frank Carlucci ?
Weiner citing an oral history of Carlucci ’s describes him as instrumental in ending the Cold War as a result of his “ disarming ” talk to some Soviet generals in Moscow in 1988 in which he was asked how the US knew so much about them .
Carlucci said the US had to do it from satellites and it would be " a lot easier " if the Soviets would publish their military budget .
The generals laughed ; it dawned on them America did not want to kill them and that even if they were stronger militarily , the system of secrecy left them weaker .
A closed society could n't match an open one -- end of game .
Doug Valentine : The Russian people may have a different view .
Suzan Mazur :
Which exploits of the agency do you consider the most diabolical – aside from the fact that one of its founding fathers molested two of his own children – and a reason why the CIA should have been dismantled years ago ?
Doug Valentine : Your readers do n't want to know that answer .
The most dastardly thing that the CIA has done is to wage this campaign of psychological warfare against the American people .
Where the American people do n’t see the CIA for a bunch of basically American KGB agents who are conducting criminal activities around the world .
There ’s a movie called The Usual Suspects with a much feared criminal named Keyser Soze .
And Keyser is talking to a cop and he says the greatest trick that the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world that he does n’t exist .
And this is what people like Weiner are doing with books about the CIA that do n’t explain it for what it really is .
They ’re part of a propaganda machine that ’s making the American people see the CIA in mythological terms as good guys , crusaders , as Lawrence of Arabia – when , in fact , they ’re criminals .
They 're part of THE GRAND LIE .

Zwar gibt es derzeit keinen aktuellen Fall , weshalb ich diesen Artikel schreibe – das Thema beschäftigt mich aber schon so lange , dass ich dazu was schreiben muss .
Manchmal habe ich das Gefühl , die Piraten wären einem Kuschelzoo im Umgang miteinander näher , als wie man dies in einer politischen Gemeinschaft aka Partei erwarten würde .
Warum ?
Nun zum einen sind dies Vorstände .
Nicht nur in den Untergliederungen Bayerns gab es letztes Jahr einige Rücktritte oder zurückgezogene Kandidaturen , weil sich diese Piraten zu stark unter Druck gefühlt haben .
Zumeist mag es noch andere Gründe gegeben haben , doch wurde dies auch öfters ins Feld geführt .
Doch was macht denn u.a. den Job als Vorstand aus ?
Man übernimmt Verantwortung .
Um Popper zu zitieren :
„ Optimismus ist Pflicht .
Man muß sich auf die Dinge konzentrieren , die gemacht werden sollen und für die man verantwortlich ist “ .
Dabei ist es klar , dass man Gegenwind bekommt .
Man kann es nie allen recht machen – man könnte nur versuchen , es entweder so vielen wie möglich Recht oder allen gleich Unrecht zu machen .
Wer sich als gewählter Vorstand aber auf einen Kuschel - Konsens Kurs begibt wird sich m.E. sehr schnell verrennen und zudem überhaupt nicht zu irgend einem Ergebnis kommen .
Zu solchem Handeln können auch durchaus unpopuläre Entscheidungen zählen ; wichtig ist nur , dass es der Sache und dem Selbstverständnis der Piraten nicht entgegensteht .
Nötigenfalls wird man eben nicht mehr wiedergewählt .
Die innerparteiliche Demokratie ist schließlich das beste Korrektiv .
Wenn Vorstände nicht in der Lage sind , einen Kurs zu halten , wie können sie von den Mitgliedern erwarten , dass diese Flagge zeigen ?
Dem entsprechend keimen aller Orten Initiativen auf , die aufgrund von echter oder zu erwartender Kritik gefrustet ihre Arbeit einstellen oder zumindest auf bessere Zeiten hoffen .
Hier müssen Leute aufstehen und den Kurs halten : eine noch so hart geführte Mailinglisten - Diskussion führt nicht zu einem abschließendem Ergebnis .
Das kann nur eine Abstimmung .
Oder begrenzt auch ein Vorstandsbeschluss .
Bis dahin muss es gebracht werden .
Diese Kritik schließt übrigens mich selbst ein – doch mit den Ergebnissen der derzeit laufenden Mitgliederbefragung in Bayern werde ich daran einiges ändern .
Piraten
Wie schon ausgeführt , kann man von Mitgliedern wohl kaum Standhaftigkeit verlangen , wenn man als Vorstand dies nicht selbst deutlich zeigt .
Dennoch müssen auch Piraten lernen , dass Diskussion , Debatte und Streit im politischen Prozess wichtig sind .
Natürlich dürfen allzu heftige und in persönlichen beleidigende Schlagabtausche nicht sein .
Doch selbst zu den noch so klaren
Themen die man 1:1 aus unseren bestehenden Parteiprogrammen übernehmen kann wird man nie einen echten Konsens erlangen .
Es wird immer Leute geben , die aus welchem Grund auch immer in dem Moment nicht mitziehen .
Wir alle müssen lernen damit um zu gehen – sei es als die , welche einen Vorschlag durch bringen wollen oder als solche , die dem entgegen stehen .
Wenn beide Seiten ihre Positionen als unvereinbar erkannt haben ( durch Debatte ) , muss dies auch anerkannt werden .
Die Lösung wird die Mehrheit geben .
Venezuela may have just become the center of an energy - starved world .
The Orinoco Belt , situated squarely underneath the South American nation , may hold some 513 billion barrels of crude oil , according to a new report by the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) .
That ’s twice the size of Saudi Arabia ’s oil reserves , placing Venezuela firmly atop the list of oil - rich nations .

The timing of the USGS announcement is striking .
On Jan. 28 , international firms will take part in an auction for contracts to drill in the Orinoco Belt .
The deadline for auction registration was Jan 18 , according to industry publication Petroleum World .
Results will be announced on Feb. 10 .
However , the USGS did not make an estimate of how much oil is actually recoverable .
The Orinoco Belt ’s reserves are typically thick and tar - like , with some patches difficult to reach with current drilling technology .
“ The initial opening of the Orinoco oil belt resulted in a major production boost in the region , but ended in legal controversy , when state - owned Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. took over control of the projects in 2007 under a new hydrocarbons law , ” a Dow Jones release noted .
“ ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips left , starting arbitration proceedings against the country .
Chevron , Total and other international companies stayed . ”
“ Knowing the potential for extractable resources from this tremendous oil accumulation , and others like it , is critical to our understanding of the global petroleum potential and informing policy and decision makers , ” said USGS Energy Resources Program Coordinator Brenda Pierce , in an advisory .
“ Accumulations like this one were previously very difficult to produce , but advances in technology and new understandings in geology allow us to assess how much is now technically recoverable . ”
The primary beneficiary of Venezuelan oil is the United States , which consumed 19.5 million barrels of domestic and imported crude per day in 2008 , according to the USGS .

Venezuelan socialist leader Hugo Chavez , a longtime antagonist to U.S. political leaders , recently approved construction of a massive oil refinery as a joint venture between state - run Petróleos de Venezuela and China ’s state - run CNPC .
The project , projected to cost some $ 6 billion USD , would ensure a steady flow to as much as 10 percent of China ’s oil imports , according to Reuters .
China consumed 7.9 million barrels of crude oil per day in 2008 , according to the USGS .
The announcement is likely to cause waves in Venezuela ’s political circles , where oil diplomacy has been a key to the country ’s global outreach .
That the estimate comes from a U.S. firm is also likely to sharpen President Chavez ’s rhetoric , which has in recent months repeatedly decried U.S. military presence in neighboring Colombia .
As recently as November , 2009 , Chavez warned Venezuelans to “ prepare for war ” with the United States and Colombia , arguing that rapidly expanding defense spending was prudent in the face of such a perceived threat .
The U.S. State Department claimed its agreement , settled in August , allows U.S. soldiers to operate drone aircraft from Colombian military bases as a way of prosecuting the drug war .

Shortly after the announcement , Colombia said it would suspend all gas exports to Venezuela .
In response , Chavez froze all diplomatic ties with the country .
Ecuador , Bolivia , Brazil and Argentina have also objected to Washington ’s plan to use Colombian military bases , calling the US military deployment suspiciously large .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Gold posted its biggest one - day loss since 2008 on Thursday , hitting a three - month low as a wave of risk aversion swept through global markets , triggering massive technical selling in the metal .

Bullion tumbled more than 4 percent in heavy trade , briefly falling below $ 1,060 an ounce as escalating sovereign debt fears in Europe prompted investors to bid up the dollar and unload riskier assets .
Other precious metals also fell .
Silver slid nearly 7 percent to its lowest since September , platinum dropped more than 4 percent and palladium fell 6 percent .
Scott Meyers , senior analyst at Pioneer Futures , a unit of MF Global , said gold has slid below technical support levels .
“ There is not a lot of technical support in gold right now .
It is more of a function of how the market reacts to whatever stimulus is forcing the market lower right now , ” Meyers said .
Risk - averse economic sentiment pummeled world stock markets , pressuring gold , oil and other commodities .
Wall Street fell more than 3 percent on an unexpected increase in the number of Americans claiming jobless benefits , and as fiscal worries in euro - zone countries led investors to buy safe - haven U.S. Treasury debt .
Spot gold hit a low of $ 1,059.10 an ounce , the weakest since November 3 .
It was last at $ 1,064.30 an ounce at 4:07 p.m. EST , sharply lower than $ 1,108.85 late on Wednesday .
Spot bullion ’s 4.2 percent decline was its biggest one - day percentage loss since December 1 , 2008 , when it tumbled 5.6 percent , Reuters data showed .
U.S. gold futures for April delivery settled down $ 49 at $ 1,063 on the COMEX division of the NYMEX .
“ If you are short , you stay short , because there is no real reason to be a buyer unless the market sold off more , ” said Rick Bensignor , chief market strategist at broker - dealer Execution LLC .
The euro plunged to a seven - month low against the dollar .
European Central Bank President Jean - Claude
Trichet predicted many members in the bloc will have large , sharply rising fiscal imbalances .
Strength in the U.S. dollar makes dollar - priced commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies .
Among other commodities , oil prices fell nearly $ 4 to about $ 73 a barrel amid a global sell - off , as Reuters - Jefferies CRB index .CRB also fell 2.5 percent .
TECHNCIALLY VULNERABLE
The sharp decline sent spot gold well below its 14- , 50 - and 100 - day moving averages .
Technical analysts said gold could fall further after the sell - off pushed it below major support levels , but it should hold above $ 1,000 an ounce .
With U.S. January non-farm payrolls data due Friday , all eyes will focus on whether the jobs report will rejuvenate gold through its influence on the dollar .
“ This is a broken chart , at least short term .
Unless tomorrow ’s job numbers somehow change the entire picture on the dollar and gold turns around , I am in the bear camp here , ” Bensignor said .
The world ’s largest gold - backed exchange - traded fund , New York ’s SPDR Gold Trust on Wednesday reported its first outflow this month .
Its holdings declined 1.6 tonnes that day , after falling 21.7 tonnes in January .
In other precious metals , silver touched a low of $ 15.16 , lowest since September , tracking gold ’s losses , and was last at $ 15.26 an ounce against $ 16.34 .
Platinum was at $ 1,504.50 an ounce versus $ 1,572.50 , and palladium at $ 408 versus $ 434.50 .
EPCglobal , a subsidiary of global nonprofit standards organization GS1 , has released its Strategic Overview Guide and Technical Implementation Guide for GS1 EPCglobal RFID - based Electronic Article Surveillance ( EAS ) .
The two documents provide the first guidance specifically for the production of RFID solutions that include EAS functionality based on EPCglobal 's standards .
The combined use of Electronic Product Code ( EPC ) numbers with UHF EPC Gen 2 RFID tags and readers will enable manufacturers and retailers to track inventory , as well as gain key security data as items pass through the door of a retailer 's store .
German retail company Metro Group is among several retailers that have begun piloting this RFID EAS system — provided by Checkpoint Systems , which worked closely with GS1 EPCglobal to develop the new guide — at Metro's Innovation Center that uses an RFID tag for both inventory visibility and EAS .
Other companies that participated in the development of GS1's guides included retailers Best Buy and Wal - Mart , and RFID technology vendors Tyco Electronics , Avery Dennison , Motorola , Impinj and UPM Raflatac , as well as the University of Arkansas and the American Apparel and Footwear Association ( AAFA ) .
The guides — developed and written by GS1's Electronic Article Surveillance Joint Requirements Group , to assist companies implementing GS1 EPCglobal standards - based RFID technology with EAS and loss - prevention capabilities — illustrate where and how RFID - based EAS implementation , based on existing GS1 EPCglobal standards , is possible .
According to GS1 , RFID 's ability to combine two functions — inventory management and theft prevention — will reduce costs to retailers , by eliminating the need for retailers to buy , deploy and maintain two separate systems .
" I think this will help drive item - level tagging in the retail world , " says Natalie Taylor Debouvry , the manager of GS1's Standards Group in Brussels , Belgium .
With one tag , according to the recommendations in the GS1 guides , retailers can accomplish what was previously managed with several tags — an RFID tag for inventory visibility , and a separate EAS plastic or paper tag for security — as well as separate RFID and EAS interrogators and software .
In addition , with an RFID - based EAS solution , a retailer will have visibility into which item is taken if it passes through a doorway without being purchased .
Taylor Debouvry says GS1 first launched efforts to develop standards for an RFID - based EAS system in 2007 , in Hong Kong , then later in Europe and North America , meeting with a group of RFID and EAS vendors , as well as retailers and associations .
The resulting specifications , says Patrick Javick , GS1 US ' director of industry development , included such details as the size of doorways where RFID interrogators would be installed to read the tags , the type of air interface and RF frequency that should be employed , and how to ensure that the use of RFID at the point of sale would not slow the sales process .
Privacy was another concern , Javick says .
" Throughout the [ guide development ] process , " he states , " we continued work to ensure that deployments of EPC RFID technology for EAS respected consumer privacy , " which was part of the group 's strategic overview .
" To encourage consumer acceptance , it 's advisable for the retailer to adhere to the EPCglobal Consumer Guidelines , " which dictate privacy measures .
With as many as 100 associations and companies participating , the group developed a strategic overview that included the necessary requirements .
The group began putting the guides together in March of this year .
The guides describe a system in which an EPC Gen 2 UHF tag can be attached to an item and linked to information in a company 's back - end system for inventory tracking .
An item's EPC number would be placed on a list in the database , indicating it was not sold .
At the point of sale , the tag would be interrogated by an RFID reader , and the database list would then be updated , removing the EPC number from the list of unsold items .
If the item had not been sold , and was carried through an interrogator at the exit , the software would determine the EPC number was on the list of unsold items and trigger an alert .
At the same time , because the EPC number is linked to data regarding that item , the store would know exactly what had been removed , thereby allowing replenishment .

Immediately aftershipped , BioWare knew what it wanted to fix for the sequel -- and the team incorporated feedback from fans and media to try to address " absolutely every issue " for " Every area needed improvement ...
We knew what we wanted to change right away , " says lead producer Adrien Cho in a new Gamasutra feature interview .
" But the other part of the equation was actually taking all the feedback -- I 'm not saying some -- absolutely every feedback from press and the fans , and collating all that into a huge list .
" From there , they categorized the feedback and mapped it against the team 's desired changes , and from there " it became really clear .
It became a blueprint , " he says .
" It made making the sequel really easy .
" It helped that the originalprovided such a " firm foundation , " according to Cho , but that does n't mean it was easy sailing : " I can not describe just the amount of effort , the tensions , " he says .
But with the core ideas in place , it 's been easier for the team to target specific areas , like improving the digital acting .
Combining " very focused changes " with developing all the game content means that " all of a sudden the game is very different . "
" We wanted to make sure that absolutely every issue that was brought up was addressed ... so the press had nowhere to go , and all the critics had nowhere to go , because we had made an attempt to hopefully address all those issues in some capacity , " says Cho .
Thoroughly addressing the feedback meant more than choosing generalized areas like simply combat or exploration -- it was all about the specifics .
" Because Uncharted Worlds came up as ' We wish it was better , ' " he says .
Getting specific with the aspects that needed improvement , " we found out that people really like the idea of exploring planets , it 's just sometimes the execution where the planet looked the same .
" Easy fix , according to Cho : " Let 's keep the exploration side and keep the idea that you can explore all these different planets , " he says .
" What people are really just saying is that they wish the planets looked different and that you did n't end up at the same base all the time .
And that made it really clear to say , ' Well , how can we go about implementing that ? '" More details on 's design and development are now available in our feature interview with BioWare 's Adrien Cho .
In Battlefield : Bad Company 2 , the ‘ B ’ company fight their way through snowy mountaintops , dense jungles and dusty villages .
With a heavy arsenal of deadly weapons and a slew of vehicles to aid them , the crew set off on their mission and they are ready to blow up , shoot down , blast through , wipe out and utterly destroy anything that gets in their way .
Total destruction is the name of the game , delivered as only the DICE next generation Frostbite engine can .
Either online or offline , enemies will soon learn there is nowhere to hide .
WP : Who has the honor to speak with us ?
State your name , rank and occupation !
I 'm Patrick Bach , and I 'm a senior producer for Battlefield : Bad Company 2 .
WP : Did you also work on the first Bad Company title ?
PB : Yes , I worked on the first one as well .
WP : One of the things that people either loved or hated about the original title was the humor .
Some people really got into it and others did n't .
In your presentation , you said that the second game is a little more serious .
Is that referring to the gameplay or the story line ?
PB : It 's actually referring to both the gameplay and the story line , but that does n't change the characters .
They still have the same personalities , and there will still be the bantering between the squad members .
There will still be elements of humor within the characters , of course , but the whole story line and the settings they are put into are quite more serious .
WP : What about the level design ?
Not to start off on a negative note , but again , one of the complaints that people had with the first game was that things felt a little too forced or too narrow .
Have you tried to open things up at all to make things a little more organic ?
PB : What we found from the first game , based on our personal biggest problem and a lot of feedback , was that the game was a bit bland .
It felt more or less the same all the time , and like you said , it felt a bit forced when it came to gameplay .
Of course , we put a lot of energy into making sure not only the missions were varied but also the gameplay elements , that it feels more natural to go from A to B to C .
We also have sandbox elements and driving sections and tried to get more variation into the gameplay .
WP : In the presentation , you described the game as stretching from Alaska down to South America , so that 's one snow level and one jungle level .
Are there any levels set in North America , or after Alaska , does it occur solely in South America ?
PB : Not that much .
I can't go into detail exactly , but the main part of the game will be set in South America .
WP : Another story question .
It 's been quite a while since game developers have used the America - versus - Russia theme .
What made you guys decide to go back for an old ' 80s Cold War classic rather than pulling from current events ?
So many games today deal with the Middle East and terrorism .
It 's almost like an ' 80s flashback , but in a good way .
PB : The idea is that Russia never really died away ; they just kind of went to sleep and now they 're starting to get bigger again .
It 's a classic drama if you have the fight between Russia and the U.S. , but also the point that Russia is negotiating with the South American countries and building more and more military bases on South American soil .
It 's like during the Cold War , when the U.S. started to build military bases and missile ramps pointing from Poland into Russia .
Russia 's now doing the same thing but in South America .
If you spin on that idea , you can easily see that , looking at how the economy looks today , things could easily go sideways and turn into a situation like this .
WP : In terms of straight gameplay , how is it going to play out in terms of which character you play for Bad Company 2 ?
Do you get to choose ?
Does the game follow you ?
Do you go from one squad member to another based on the story line ?
PB : No , you will only play as one character throughout the whole game .
We want the game to focus on you being this character instead of jumping between characters and getting all confused .
You want the classic storytelling arc throughout the game where you play as one character and you have the other characters around you that you get to know better and better as you go through the game .
WP : From a creative standpoint , on the character side , you obviously got the base of the characters from the first game .
When you 're bringing the squad back , how did you decide that this is how they 're going to react , this is what they 're going to do , and these are the weapons that they 're going to carry ?
PB : In the first game , we already had character descriptions that were quite deep .
For different reasons , that did n't always show .
One thing that we did now is that by putting them in other situations where they get more stressed and pushed to the edge , you will get other reactions out of the squad members that you might not have guessed when you saw them in the first game .
By twisting the situations , you 'll get more interesting personal reactions from the squad members .
WP : You 've described Bad Company and Bad Company 2 as " sandbox " games , but every developer has a different idea of what that means .
What does " sandbox " mean to DICE ?
PB : To DICE , it 's a classic Battlefield expression .
To most people , sandbox means that you provide the playground and then you provide the toys .
By having specific gameplay physics on top of that , you can build your own gameplay depending on how you see it .
It 's more a set of rules rather than a linear way of playing a game .
To DICE , I would say that it 's a combination of the open environments , vehicles and infantry and on top of that , destruction that would actually change how the world looks and plays over the period of the map session .
That 's kind of what the Battlefield recipe 's all about .
WP : Engine - wise , what 's been going on behind the scenes since the first game ?
What kind of tweaks can we expect to see in the visuals and physics ?
PB : We 're using the Frostbite Engine , which is DICE 's own engine .
We 've been fiddling with , more or less , all systems , so looking at the graphics , it 's obvious that we improved that quite a lot .
Physics - wise , the vehicles will handle better .
There 's a more detailed physics model .
The game will sound better than ever before .
Of course , it 's not only the engine but the work put into creating the assets , and those two things in combination will make a huge difference when it comes to the quality from the first game to the second game .
WP : Aside from the obvious " We have to ship it " deadline , how do you decide internally at DICE when the game is done ?
What is that moment when internally , the team decides that it 's done ?
PB : We tried to set that quite early .
You have a lot of different milestones on the project where you lock down the scope of the game .
It 's also based on the routine from the actual developers , that you know how much you can build .
When you have the scope , you can easily say that , " We can get to this quality level based on this scope with this set of talent that we have in the company . "
It 's hard to give a specific date that , 50 days before launch , you make this decision .
It 's more of a gut feeling from all the talent that you have in the game , whether you 'll be able to pull it off .
Yes or no ?
If you get a " yes " and you have a lot of trust in those talents , you just go .
WP : Getting that intuition , knowing that talent , how much of that is knowing the systems themselves ?
It 's 2010 , the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 are almost pushing five years .
Are your developers still pulling more out of the systems , or do they know what they can do and there are n't a lot of questions or last - minute surprises ?
PB : I think both .
If you look at the console platforms , the PS3 and X360 , if we had another go in making a new game on the same platform , we could probably make it feel almost as much more as this game looks to the previous one .
There are a lot of small tricks and quirks that you can take advantage of in both systems , so there 's still a lot of gold to be found in the consoles .
WP : Looking at console versus PC , since the advent of digital distribution with Steam and broadband becoming more common , it 's almost like we 're seeing a resurgence in PC gaming .
As a developer , is console versus PC really an either - or question , or has it gotten back to the point where you need to develop for all of them ?
PB : At DICE , we never really let go of the PC .
Bad Company 1 was an exception because we initially designed it to be a console - only game .
We got a lot of negative comments about that when we released the game because people asked , " Hey , this is a real Battlefield game .
Why are n't you releasing it for PC ? "
This time around , we decided , yes , let 's make Bad Company 2 for the PC so that the audience can enjoy the game as well .
We 're not taking it lightly and just making a port .
We actually have a big PC - focused team just working on the PC version of the game .
I think the PC gamers will be amazed with the quality that we get out of the PC .
We have DirectX 11 support , we support all the latest sound and graphics , and we even have support for nVidia 's 3 - D screens , so there 's a lot of cool stuff going on when it comes to the PC version .
WP : You mentioned a new multiplayer mode and a new hardcore mode in your presentation .
Can you briefly expand on both of those ?
PB : Well , first of all , the squad rush game mode is a very competitive game mode that is more or less squad versus squad .
It 's designed to have you and your friends meet another group of people and have these quick and fast game sessions .
It 's a very quick and aggressive game mode .
We also have the setting that you can use for all game modes , and it 's called hardcore .
Hardcore means that we double the damage of the weapons so it 's more or less one shot , one kill .
We remove most of the hub elements , so there 's no reticle , no ammo counter , so in that way , it turns into a more visceral and realistic experience .
WP : Is that a per-user experience ?
When you create a multiplayer game , if I want to , can I play on hardcore and get that experience ?
Or does everyone have to be on hardcore ?
PB : It 's a server setting so everyone has to be in on it , so you can choose whether you want to play hardcore or not in any of the game modes : conquest , rush , squad deathmatch or squad rush .
It turns the game into something that is a lot more fast - paced and dangerous .
You change your play style immediately when you get into it .
WP : If you had to sum it up in two to three sentences , what really makes Battlefield : Bad Company 2 a game that 's worth playing ?
PB : If you like a very deep and long multiplayer experience that competitive , easy - to - use and high quality , then this is the game for you .
If you want a single - player that is dramatic and varied , with cool storytelling and cool characters and all these cool environments , it 's all part of the same package .
I do n't see a reason why you should n't pick it up .
WP : Is there anything about the game that we have n't talked about that you wanted to add ?
PB : One thing that 's also very interesting is how we see our customers .
We see the game as the first step to a longer experience .
We have an in - game store where you get free content or you can buy new content to the game , so it 's a very integral part of the game that we will have a long post - launch campaign .
I think people will be thrilled to see what 's in that already .
On day one , you will get some really cool stuff .
WP : We saw the launch of Battlefield 1943 on Xbox Live Arcade , and that went well .
Has there been any more talk at DICE about going back to those older PC properties for PSN and Xbox Live ?
Were you happy with what happened , or was it an experiment that did n't work out ?
PB : It started as an experiment , but it turned out to be much bigger than anyone could have anticipated .
I think we 're the best - selling Xbox Live title ever produced , and we got pretty good reviews .
The customer feedback has been extremely good .
From that perspective , it 's a complete success , and you never know what will happen in the future .
It 's definitely something that we got a good taste from , so you 'll never know what happens .
To the Editor :
“ Making ‘ No Child ’ Better ” ( editorial , Feb. 5 ) misses the point that the No Child Left Behind law is founded on faulty assumptions of top - down mandates , zero tolerance , narrow forms of assessment , and privatization .
These are all popular nowadays , but have been shown to be ineffective in other sectors ( health , corrections , welfare and so on ) and have a dismal track record so far in education .
“ Tightening up ” the law will only prolong the agony .
President Obama ’s appointment of Arne Duncan as education secretary instead of the education scholar Linda Darling - Hammond has set authentic reform in education back by at least a decade .
Educators are n’t the villains ; we might actually know something about education and how to reform it .

BNP votes to accept non-white members ( and a Sikh grandfather will be first to join up )
The British National Party has ripped up its racist constitution and voted to allow black and Asian members .
BNP leader Nick Griffin pushed the far - right party to axe the whites - only membership rules after being told it could face legal action by the Equality and Human Rights Commission .
After yesterday 's vote at a meeting in Essex , Mr Griffin said he expected a ' trickle , rather than a flood ' of applications from black and Asian people .
But he added that several ethnic - minority supporters had been ' begging ' to join the party because they supported its opposition to immigration .
BNP president Nick Griffin said the party would accept black and Asian people provided they agreed with its aims
Mr Griffin said he expected to soon welcome the party 's first non-white member - a Sikh called Rajinder Singh .
He said : ' I will be absolutely delighted to shake his hand and give him his membership card .
' People like Rajinder accept the party 's position .
' He 's a guest of our country - he agrees to abide by our laws and customs .
We are happy to accept anyone as a member providing they agree with us that this country should remain fundamentally British .
' Some of these people have been in Britain for years now .
They do n't like the current wave of mass immigration and they want us to help stop it .
' Plenty of ethnic minorities agree with us .
People came here in the 1950s and 60s specifically because this was a British Britain .
' It was a good place for them and for their children and that 's what we 're losing now .
Three million new immigrants since Tony Blair came to power in the most overcrowded country in Europe .
It 's madness and it's not racist to say it . '
Controversial : Rajinder Singh , who once appeared on the BNP 's internet TV channel , is set to become the party 's first non-white member
Mr Singh , a 78 - year - old retired maths teacher from Wellingborough in Northamptonshire , came to the UK in 1967 .
He was born in West Punjab , now Pakistan , where he says his father was killed by a Muslim mob during Indian Partition in 1947 .
He has expressed his admiration for the BNP's ' tough stance ' on Islam and believes Muslims are trying to take over Britain .
The grandfather has been a convert since he saw Griffin on television in 2001 and even provided him with a character reference for his 2005 trial for inciting racial hatred for which he was convicted .
The BNP has accepted only white members since its foundation in 1982
It was formed by John Tyndall , a former chairman of the extreme - right National Front who enjoyed dressing up in Nazi uniform and was jailed in 1986 for disseminating racist literature .
Mr Griffin , a Cambridge law graduate , took over in 1999 with the intention of toning down the party 's image , dropping the party 's public declarations of Holocaust denial and policy of forcibly repatriating non-white immigrants .
Members yesterday also agreed new rules that mean party members must share the views of the party - an attempt to prevent opponents infiltrating the party and destroying it from the inside .
The party 's claims to be open and democratic took a knock when Mr Griffin helped to bundle a Times journalist out of the meeting .
A spokesman for anti-fascist group Searchlight said : ' This is a meaningless gesture by the BNP .
‘ No - one seriously believes that thousands of black and Asian Britons will now be queueing up to join Nick Griffin 's party .
The BNP are as racist and extremist as ever . '
A spokesman for the Equality and Human Rights Commission said : ' We have n't yet seen what the changes are , but hope that the BNP 's revised membership policy is no longer discriminatory .
' We 're expecting to see a copy of the policy on Tuesday , which is the deadline set by the court .
When we 've received this we will consider our position ahead of the next court hearing on March 9 . '
As we reach maximum oil extraction rates , the era of cheap oil is behind us .
We must plan for a world in which oil prices are likely to be both higher and more volatile and where oil price shocks have the potential to destabilise economic , political and social activity .
Today's ( 10th Feb 2010 ) launch of the second report of the Industry Taskforce on Peak Oil and Energy Security ( ITPOES ) was rather more high - profile than the previous one .
After summaries of the report from other contributors , Richard Branson arrived late to read out a short speech and media interest ( informally measured by the rate of camera flashes ) picked up ; we can expect a scattering of news stories about the report to follow , in the usual places .
Protagonists
Involved in the current report are :
two construction companies : Arup and Foster + Partners
two energy companies : Scottish and Southern Energy ( one of the UK's " Big Six " energy suppliers ) and Solarcentury ( group convener Jeremy Leggett 's solar energy installation firm )
two companies with a stake in public transport : Stagecoach Group ( the second largest transport firm in the UK ) and Virgin ( which has fingers in many pies but are here under a transport " hat " ) .
The above six firms all have a great interest in advocating action to reduce oil dependence , as they set out in the report and in their presentations at the launch .
Government incentives or public infrastructure projects to improve energy efficiency , invest in renewable energy and increase use of public transport would benefit these companies directly .
Of course , they also lay stress on the cost and risks to consumers , the need to reduce energy poverty , and in some cases a wish to contribute to reducing carbon emissions .
Since the last report was published , FirstGroup ( the largest transport firm in the UK ) and Yahoo !
have quietly absented themselves from the table .
Whether or not other companies have been approached is unclear .
What 's new ?
As before , they offer two " expert opinions " - one from Chris Skrebowski , with updates on the impact of recession and new shale gas developments , and one from economist Robert Falkner on economic consequences and the role of climate and energy policy .
This reflects the shift in tone from the more technical first report to a greater emphasis on advocacy , remembering that a UK general election is imminent .
Economic modelling
Perhaps the most useful issues raised by the ITPOES report are the comments on risk to the UK 's balance of payments in the next decade :
The UK , because it is now a net and rising importer of oil , gas and coal , is becoming increasingly exposed to competition for supplies from other energy importers .
The insulation from international supply pressures provided when the UK was self - sufficient in oil and gas supply is now eroding quite quickly .
This is likely to put pressure on the UK balance of payments and in a world of floating exchange rates is also likely to put downward pressure on the valuation of the pound sterling .
In other words the positive benefits to the valuation of the pound as a petrocurrency are now disappearing .
Appendix D to the report considers this in more detail , with an ( illustrative rather than predictive ) model of the UK economy to 2025 , developed by Arup .
They consider two scenarios : one reactive ( BAU ) and one proactive .
The proactive scenario assumes that some industrial output to consumer goods is diverted to investment in energy efficiency and renewables , and passenger car and freight oil consumption is reduced , so that total demand for fossil fuels is reduced to about 2/3 of the present level by 2025 .
The modelling is also interesting in being the first economic model I have seen which values both energy flows and capital stocks in energy units ( petajoules and " virtual petajoules " ) .
The result of a BAU reactive approach is " a continuous devaluation of sterling at an average of about 1 percent per year " .
The UK 's balance of payments is propped up by a decline in the value of sterling compensating for increased fuel imports in the reactive scenario .
Click to enlarge .
In the proactive scenario , demand for energy falls and fuel imports remain low .
Click to enlarge .
Despite the somewhat simplistic modelling , there is a useful point here which is often unremarked ; that the UK's declining North Sea production threatens the balance of payments quite drastically in the next decade or so unless domestic energy demand can be reduced or , equivalently , domestic energy production increased .
Even if , as in this analysis , the effects of volatility in oil prices and the possibility of supply shocks are neglected , there are clearly medium term structural problems with current UK energy policy which have further consequences for national energy security .
Recommendations
The recommendations of the report are divided into the categories of " general " , transport , retail and agricultural , power generation / distribution and heating policies .
In most areas the recommendations are rather vague and and may be criticised by the cynical as self - serving ( however , in what instance would we expect a company to make any other recommendations ? ) .
Actual reductions in service demand are skirted around carefully .
Conspicuous by its absence is any mention of a carbon price , which was only mentioned in passing by Brian Souter ( of Stagecoach , and clearly the most environmentally motivated of the group ) at the launch .
Government response
A recurring theme of the morning 's speakers was the need to move " from recognition to action " .
This was echoed by a representative of the UK Department for Energy and Climate Change ( DECC ) in an official response to the report , emphasising their own commitment to move " from strategy to delivery " .
The response was muted in tone , sticking to the party line that DECC " are already taking action " and citing a list of their projects from last summer 's Low Carbon Transition Plan - which did not mention oil depletion , even obliquely .
It seems that peak oil , though evidently recognised within DECC , remains somewhat unutterable as a specific motive for action .
Whether or not it still influences policy decisions remains to be seen .
Conclusions
Although there is little new analysis , this report marks a further milestone as energy security issues continue an inexorable rise up the national agenda .
Coming on the heels of a new consultation by the energy regulator Ofgem on energy security and longer term energy policy , and in the run-up to a general election , the report is what it set out to be : a well - timed wake - up call to British industry and government .
Whether it will be heeded remains to be seen .
Criticism is likely to focus on the ( unavoidable ) specific motivations of the partner companies , the ( perhaps necessarily ) simplistic approach to analysis and the ( very much contestable ) implicit assumptions .
Nevertheless , the high profile of the companies and individuals involved is a marker of the increasingly widespread , if overdue , recognition of the UK energy dilemma , and the fact that DECC were represented at the launch event of a report with Peak Oil in the title is certainly a step in the right direction .
The first report ( 2008 ) was discussed on The Oil Drum here :

Neil Strandberg , the manager of operations at the Tattered Cover in Denver seconded this bit of reader profiling .
“ Our arrest record is very male , ” he said .

There is a certain hip factor to stealing a book , said Mark Z. Danielewski , whose novel “ House of Leaves ” is commonly shoplifted at Vroman ’s Bookstore in Pasadena , Calif. , according to Allison Hill , the store ’s president and chief operating officer .
“ In ‘ The Savage Detectives , ’ Roberto Bolaño writes about visiting various bookstores and stealing books , ” Danielewski said .
“ I never stole a book , though .
I always found there was a pleasure , weirdly enough , in saving for and paying for something . ”
Some authors do n’t share that pleasure , however .
At Boulder Book Store in Boulder , Colo. , one writer was even busted stealing his own books .
Christopher Ohman , who was a manager at the time , said : “ I think he felt somewhat entitled to the copies .
In some ways I can kind of understand that logic .
I mean , it ’s a commonly held misconception that authors get as many copies of their books as they want , and that ’s not always the case . ”
( Ohman conceded that the author ’s alcohol problem may also have had something to do with it . )
Although there ’s no hard statistical evidence on most - stolen titles , The Telegraph of London reported last year that Jeffrey Eugenides ’s novel “ The Virgin Suicides ” was said to be “ the most shoplifted book of modern times . ”
Eugenides had heard this for many years .
“ I just assumed that the book appealed to the young and sticky - fingered to a certain extent , ” he told me , with some amusement .
Years ago , Eugenides was at a literary conference with Paul Auster , another top choice among literary thieves .
“ Paul and I argued about whose book was stolen more , ” Eugenides said .
“ He claimed he was stolen a lot , I claimed I was stolen a lot .
Back and forth .
It was one of those deep intellectual conversations . ”
Were there fisticuffs ?
“ No , no , ” he said .
“ We had no way of adjudicating the argument .
That was the problem . ”
Auster , for his part , is n’t sure why his books are popular to steal .
“ It could be that my work appeals to the criminal element , ” he told me .
“ When I was young many of my friends stole books from bookstores .
They ’d wear trench coats with lots of pockets , and they ’d jam them in like Harpo Marx .
Of course they did n’t understand that these stores were important resources . ”
He lamented the demise of Bookforum , formerly located near Columbia University .
“ I ’m just so worried about bookstores in general right now .
I do n’t want any more of them to fold up . ”
Books are not the only items disappearing from stores .
Allison Hill of Vroman ’s in Pasadena recalled the time someone tried to take a security camera .
Ohman , the former manager at Boulder Book Store , remembered full - size framed art prints mysteriously vanishing from the bathroom walls .
“ There ’s nothing in here that no one ’s tried to steal , ” said Bercu of Austin ’s BookPeople .
“ Plants , chairs , lights — if you can touch it , someone will steal it , or attempt to . ”
The Clerks and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back director said he was booted by the captain after he was seated because he was considered a " safety risk . "
" I know I 'm fat , but was Captain Leysath really justified in throwing me off a flight for which I was already seated ? " he wrote , maintaining , " I broke no regulation , offered no ' safety risk ' ( what , was I gonna roll on a fellow passenger ? ) .
" Thank God I do n't embarrass easily ( bless you , Jersey Girl training ) , " he continued .
" But I do n't sulk off either ... "
So he promised more tweets zinging the airline in the coming days for telling him " I 'm too wide for the sky . "
Smith said he refused a $ 100 voucher offered by Southwest and eventually got on another Southwest flight .
He then tweeted a photo of himself on the plane with his cheeks puffed out , writing , " Look how fat I am on your plane !
Quick !
Throw me off ! "
( 1/2 ) Hey @SouthwestAir ?
Fuck making it right for me just ' cause I have a platform .
I sat next to a big girl who was chastised for not buy -
( 2/2 ) ing an extra ticket because " all passengers deserve their space . "
Fucking flight was n't even full !
Fuck your size - ist policy .
Yesterday afternoon , my inbox started lighting up wildly with emails about writer , director , and actor Kevin Smith being kicked off a Southwest Airlines flight for being too fat .
Smith , who 's got 1.6 million followers on Twitter , began tweeting furiously about the incident ( right fucking on ) : Kate Harding says , quite rightly , " I am so sorry that Kevin Smith , human being , had to go through that .
But quite frankly , a part of me is really happy that Kevin Smith , Famous Person With 1.6 Million Twitter Followers , is holding an airline 's feet to the fire over this bullshit . "
And Smith is keenly aware of his dual role , too : Smith bought two seats , but flew home in one , " with the armrests down , " just to prove a point .
Which , let 's be honest , is not something everyone can afford to do .
I am terrified to fly anywhere these days , in fear that the same thing will happen .
Embarrassment would be theof my worries if I get stuck in another city and told out of nowhere I 've got to buy a second seat just to get home .
US firms lose out in bidding for Iraq oil fields
By Patrick Martin
14 December 2009
In a clear signal of the declining influence of American capitalism , even in a country conquered and occupied by the US military , companies from China , Russia , Malaysia and Angola , along with several European oil giants , won most of the rights for exploration and development of Iraq ’s oil fields .
The concessions were awarded Friday and Saturday by the Iraqi oil ministry , after a competitive auction in which joint ventures of European and Asian companies won the lion ’s share .
Of the ten concessions awarded so far , including in an earlier auction , US - based companies will play the lead role in only one , while getting a lesser share in a second .
The most aggressive bidder was the China National Petroleum Company ( CNPC ) , while Lukoil and Gazprom of Russia , and European firms like Royal Dutch Shell , ENI ( Italy ) , British Petroleum , Statoil ( Norway ) and Total ( France ) all won bids .
Petronas , the state - owned Malaysian oil company , won the most bids , three , while the Angolan state oil company Sonangol won two .
A total of 15 oil fields were put up for bidding , but five received no bids , because they are located in areas in the center and north of Iraq still contested by insurgents or politically unstable , and considered too risky for significant investment .
A sixth field drew only one bid .
The main interest was in oil fields in the southern part of the country , around Basra .
The oil ministry offered fields with nearly 40 billion barrels in proven reserves , about one - third of Iraq ’s 115 billion total .
Iraq has the world ’s third - largest proven reserves , trailing only Iran and Saudi Arabia , but most of these were discovered more than 25 years ago , before international sanctions cut off the flow of investment capital .
The country is believed to have undiscovered reserves that could be as extensive as the oil already known to exist .
Discarding the production - sharing contracts initially proposed by US occupation officials — a structure that would have given the bulk of profits to the multinationals — the oil ministry offered 20 - year service contracts in which the oil companies would receive a flat fee per barrel and any increase in oil prices will go to the Iraqi government .
The winning bidders agreed to accept fees in the range of $ 1.35 to $ 1.50 per barrel of oil , with the market price for oil now over $ 75 a barrel .
According to oil minister Hussein Shahristani , the deals will allow Iraq to increase its oil output from the current level of 2.5 million barrels a day to as many as 12 million barrels a day in 2016 , double the production level before the US invasion and more than Saudi Arabia produces today .
The biggest single field , Majnoon in the south , with an estimated 12.58 billion barrels in reserves , nearly a third of the total offered , was won by a combination of Shell and Petronas , which underbid the rival consortium of Total and CNPC .
The Shell - Petronas consortium agreed to raise production from the current 45,900 barrels per day to 1.8 million barrels per day by 2019 .
The second largest field , West Qurna Phase 2 , with some 12 billion barrels in reserves , was awarded to a consortium led by Lukoil , Russia ’s second largest energy company .
Lukoil had previously signed a contract to develop West Qurna Phase 2 in 1997 , but Iraqi president Saddam Hussein subsequently reneged on the deal .
For the Halfaya field , with an estimated 4.1 billion barrels , Petronas , CNPC and Total submitted the winning bids , beating three other European and Asian consortiums .
Output would increase from 3,100 barrels per day to 535,000 barrels per day by 2022 .
The poor showing of the American - based oil companies was predictable , since seven of them registered and paid fees to participate , but only one actually submitted a bid to the latest auction .
Two US companies , ExxonMobil and Occidental Petroleum , won bids during an earlier auction .
In an early summer decision , BP and CNPC won a contract to run the Rumaila oil field , the biggest in the world , with 17.8 billion barrels in proven reserves .
ENI , Occidental Petroleum and Korea Gas signed an agreement last month to develop the Zubayr field , with an estimated 4.1 billion barrels in reserves .
ExxonMobil and Shell signed a contract to develop West Qurna Phase 1 , believe to hold 8.6 billion barrels .
Industry analysts cited two main reasons for the failure of the US companies .
The European - Asian consortiums were able to combine technical expertise and relatively lower labor costs , allowing them to accept a lower per-barrel fee .
More significantly , the US companies needed higher fees to offset the substantially higher security costs they face in Iraq , due to the widespread popular hostility to the US occupation .
Any US - run oil facility in Iraq would be a high - profile target for insurgent attack , and a successful attack could lead to colossal losses .
Iraq ’s enormous oil resources were a major factor in the Bush administration decision to invade and conquer the country .
Vice President Richard Cheney ’s energy task force , which held closed - door meetings early in 2001 , reportedly pored over maps of Iraq as part of the process of determining the source of future US oil supplies .
US oil companies were kicked out of Iraq in 1972 , along with all the other multinationals , when the Baathist regime in power at the time nationalized the oil industry .
The cost of production for Iraqi oil is very low , about $ 1.50 to $ 2.25 a barrel , rivaling Saudi Arabia’s .
This compares to $ 20 a barrel in Canada ’s tar sands , and figures in between for most offshore oil drilling , as in the Gulf of Mexico .
The main difficulty is replacing equipment that is either outdated , because of the protracted economic sanctions , or destroyed by years of war and civil war .
Iraqi oil minister Shahristani said that the government has spent more than $ 8 billion trying to increase capacity , but needs $ 50 billion more , which it must seek from the global oil industry .
The deals are precarious not only because of the ongoing security issues , but because the legal position of the multinational firms is uncertain .
Despite constant prodding from Washington , the Iraqi parliament has failed to adopt a law to regulate the oil industry and give legal protection to foreign investors .
The Kurdish regional government took unilateral action two years ago to invite Western exploration companies into the provinces it controls .
The national government is now following suit , opening up the massive southern oil fields to foreign capital .
Puck Daddy has a very good piece up about the two major disciplinary actions ( or non-actions ) from the past couple of days .
Please , go read the post .
The quote of the day for Wild fans , and a quote that proves that the NHL does n't care if someone tries to kill someone , just so they have n't done it before :
" Every 5 - minute major is not a suspension or a fine .
There 's gotta be a little bit of passion in the game .
" Cal Clutterbuck leads the League , or is close to leading the League , in hits .
He hit Gonchar very hard into the boards prior to that -- real hard .
That could have been boarding .
Could have been charging .
It was n't .
So Gonchar , who 's been hurt before and knocked out before and suffered a concussion ; he's on the receiving end more than he's on the giving end -- I do n't think he 's ever been on the giving end -- he went in and it was a 5 - minute interference penalty and he hit him with his shoulder .
" We felt the penalty was the penalty .
We do n't feel [ based on ] past history that Gonchar deserved to be suspended .
Clutterbuck came out and I thought his statement was ridiculous , that somebody 's going to ‘ get this guy ' .
Last time I looked , Sergei Gonchar was n't on too many guys hit lists . "
That is from Colin Campbell himself , via EJ HRadek , and I have a follow - up question : " Mr. Campbell , are you drunk at this very moment ? "
Let me give you all a moment to absorb that .
" We do n't feel IN PAST HISTORY that Gonchar deserved to be suspended . "
So it has absolutely nothing to do with the current action on the ice .
Got it .
So let me ask this question :
If Chris Simon had absolutely no history of having done anything wrong before he tomahawked Ryan Hollweg , would he have been suspended ?
How many dirty hits does it take before someone is considered a suspendable person ?
Can we get it spelled out in a rule please ?
Is there any way , any way at all that the RULE BOOK could explain this to us ?
Or is it normal for a major professional sports league to allow one man to make discipline decisions that make as much sense as my 18 month old daughter asking for the nuclear launch codes .
Let 's break it down , shall we .
For in it 's glory , this may be the dumbest string of words that any one man has ever put into the public sphere .
Every 5 - minute major is not a suspension or a fine .
There 's gotta be a little bit of passion in the game .
Agreed .
Not every five minute penalty deserves a suspension or fine .
That much is obvious .
However , when a player admits fully that he hit someone high , with intent for pay back , that leads logically to intent to injure .
Intent to injure automatically should equal a suspension .
Nice argument , though , Mr. Campbell .
Passion in the game , yes .
Smashing people across the face with your elbow ?
Not so much .
That 's called inability to control your emotions , not passion .
Cal Clutterbuck leads the League , or is close to leading the League , in hits .
He hit Gonchar very hard into the boards prior to that -- real hard .
And ?
So what ?
How many questions can you come up with that all mean the same thing ?
What 's your point ?
Clutterbuck hits people .
He checks them .
Sometimes hard .
Unless we have moved into high school girls hockey , or perhaps to under 13 year old hockey , checking is legal , and there are no rules as to how hard you can hit them .
That could have been boarding .
Could have been charging .
It was n't .
So it could have been , but it was n't .
So either you really do n't think it was , or you are admitting that your referees blew a call they should have made .
Which is it ?
So Gonchar , who 's been hurt before and knocked out before and suffered a concussion ; he's on the receiving end more than he's on the giving end -- I do n't think he 's ever been on the giving end -- he went in and it was a 5 - minute interference penalty and he hit him with his shoulder .
Mr. Campbell , are you saying that any player who has been injured in the past now has free reign to lay illegal hits on players ?
Because that is certainly what it sounds like .
He has had a concussion , so , what the hell , let him hand out concussion inducing hits .
Sounds fair .
He 's had one before , so what the hell , right ?
Does he also get to stick his leg out and go knee - on - knee with anyone he wants ?
Since Ovechkin did it to him , Gonchar must be permitted to do that too .
Any other injuries Gonchar has permission to inflict ?
As for him hitting Clutterbuck with his shoulder .
Not so much , Mr. Campbell .
Do you not have access to Youtube ?
Perhaps someone could teach you how to do a screen capture , because this moment , right here , is in internet speak , where you get " pwned . "
Unless Gonchar 's shoulder is three feet long , his shoulder is not what is in Clutterbuck 's forehead in this picture .
Nice try .
We felt the penalty was the penalty .
Yeah .
This makes you sound really intelligent .
The penalty was the penalty ?
Well done , sir .
Indeed , the penalty was the penalty .
We do n't feel [ based on ] past history that Gonchar deserved to be suspended .
Ugh .
My argument against this is above , but let me just say this .
Until Colin Campbell is in the unemployment line , I would not want to be in the NHL anymore .
This is one of the most dangerous admissions I have ever read .
Go ahead Mikko , chop someone across the shin , buddy .
You are a stand up player , and have no past history , plus you had someone do it to you , so go right ahead .
Watch out Ohlund .
Mikko's got free reign now .
Clutterbuck came out and I thought his statement was ridiculous , that somebody 's going to ‘ get this guy ' .
Last time I looked , Sergei Gonchar was n't on too many guys hit lists .
Nice .
Criticize Clutterbuck .
That 's professional .
Never mind that the super star just broke so many rules in one play that the refs , media , and players do n't even know what the penalty was .
Never mind that Gonchar tried to break someone 's nose , or worse .
No big deal .
It is way easy to tell a guy like Cal Clutterbuck to shut his yap .
Why would someone not be out to get Gonchar the next time around ?
Explain that to me .
Oh wait , that 's right , because of your stupid instigator rule .
No need to let the players police themselves when we have such a crack staff of disciplinarians on the job at NHL headquarters .
And , Mr. Campbell ?
Gonchar just got put on at least 24 guys ' hitlists .
Just saying .
Moving on to Wysh 's post :
Huh , that 's strange : Last time we looked Sergei Gonchar was blindsiding an opponent with a hit to the head that 's an obvious intent to injure , something that 's clearly validated by Campbell 's admission that Gonchar had been hit earlier in the sequence .
Exactly .
But that would be using logic , Wysh , and that just would not be right .
It 's actually stunning how Down Goes Brown perfectly captured the thinking here iin the now - legendary Suspension Flow Chart , though we suppose an argument could be made that Clutterbuck 's non-penalized hit instigated Gonchar 's hit to the head .
But that argument is secondary to the " Gonch is a good egg " thesis that was clearly at the core of Campbell 's thought process here .
Which is a joke , considering Gonchar 's actions .
Someday , I am going to be somewhere with the guys at DGB , and I am buying drinks the entire night .
What ever they want , and in as high of volume as they wanted .
It 's almost like Campbell himself designed the flowchart .
Alright .
I am going to sign off now .
Why ?
Because , it is safer that way .
I am about to start typing highly unprofessional things , and I just really do n't want to do that .
Let him have it Wilderness readers .
He deserves it .

EPISODE SYNOPSIS :
Pid’jin completes his most important AI project and decides to kick back a little .
A University of Illinois researcher advises caution when trying to characterize gender roles and sexual behavior among this country 's Latino adolescents and young adults .
" When a recent documentary about U.S. Latinos featured two teen mothers in a 90 - minute program , the Latino students in my classes thought it was an unbalanced portrayal of their community -- and they were right ! " said Marcela Raffaelli , a U of I professor of human and community development and co-author of a recently published chapter on Latino teen sexuality .
National surveys do show that Latino young people as a group are less likely than their non-Latino peers to use condoms and birth control and are more likely to become pregnant and have a child .
But these statistics hide a much more complicated picture , she said .
For one thing , Latinos represent more than 20 different groups , and they live in very different situations in the United States .
" For example , Cuban immigrants who moved to the United States when Castro came to power tended to be very wealthy , and they created an entrepreneurial , successful enclave in Miami .
Compare them with Central American immigrants who may be refugees from a civil war in the 1980s .
Language , religion , and some aspects of culture are apt to be the same , but socioeconomic status is probably very different , and that 's a big predictor of early sexual activity and teen pregnancy , " Raffaelli said .
When you adjust for socioeconomic status and other demographic factors , the difference in adolescent sexual behavior between Latinos and other groups largely disappears .

Attempts to understand sexuality among Latino teens are also complicated in that researchers do n't have the data to draw conclusions about how cultural factors influence sexuality .
" People talk a lot about Latino culture and sexuality , but they typically do n't measure cultural variables , such as adherence to cultural norms and attitudes , in their studies , " she said .
So what do we know about Latino sexuality and risk taking among teenagers ?
For one thing , no one really knows how much the traditional gender role attributes of machismo and marianismo -- idealizing the Virgin Mary -- actually influence today 's Latino adolescents .
" In traditional Latin cultures , machismo dictates that men be virile and strong and provide for their family .
In the United States , when we say macho , often we mean someone 's a male chauvinist , but in most Latin cultures , this idea encompasses such positive behavior as being responsible for your family and taking care of your household , " she said .
The female ideal of marianismo includes being self - sacrificing , pure , and silent .
But the researcher emphasized that few studies have tried to measure the extent to which Latinos adhere to these traditional gender roles and whether cultural beliefs are linked to sexual behavior .
" Also , most research on Latino gender roles and sexuality does n't take into account that Latin cultures have changed tremendously over the last 20 years as a result of globalization , migration , and changing norms , " she added .

Immigrant status also plays a role in teens ' sexual risk taking .
" For first - generation Latinos , recent immigration seems to be a protective factor .
Families tend to bring the practices they had in their home country , and over time there 's a shift as they become acculturated .
For girls , being an immigrant is protective because Latin American countries are typically more conservative about sexuality than the United States is , " she said .
For boys , the opposite pattern may be true because in many Latin American countries men have more freedom to explore their sexuality .
In the United States , they might shift to a more conservative pattern , she said .
Scholars in multiple disciplines have described a pattern called the " immigrant paradox " in which immigrants have better outcomes than their U.S. - born counterparts despite their more challenging situations .
" First - generation teens do better in school , get into less trouble , have fewer early pregnancies , and so on , but by the second or third generation , that protective effect dissipates .
A lot of immigrant families have tremendous optimism .
They think , our life here is difficult , but we 're here to improve our children 's chances and , besides , things may be worse back home , " she said .
" By the third generation , things often look very different -- maybe because of discrimination , bad schools , or socioeconomic factors , " she said .
Raffaelli said that she and other researchers are working to update what is known about American Latino families .
" Cultural ideals provide general guidelines , but we need recent research to tell us whether people believe in these ideals and how much those beliefs affect behavior , " she said .
Raffaeli and co-author Maria I. Iturbide of the University of Nebraska at Lincoln wrote the chapter " Sexuality and Sexual Risk Behaviors Among Latino Adolescents and Young Adults " for the Handbook of U.S. Latino Psychology .
In future , fdisk will arrange partitions in such a way that the new hard disks with 4 - KByte sectors can achieve optimum performance – although , for now , users will still need to select fdisk 's appropriate mode of operation manually .
The developers of Realtime Linux have released new kernel versions , and the completion of 2.6.32.9 and 2.6.33 is also approaching .
Red Hat developer Karel Zak has released version 2.17.1 of the util - linux - ng tool collection used in many Linux distributions .
It includes the " fdisk " command line program which , in its sector - based mode of operation , activated via the " - u " option , will from now on try to align partitions along megabyte boundaries in the same way as Windows 7 and Vista have done for some time .
While this sounds like a minor change , it is essential for the gradually emerging large hard disks that work with 4 - KByte sectors internally while , for compatibility reasons , externally pretending to use 512 - Byte sectors like any other desktop hard disk released in the past 20 years .
Linux file systems prefer to read and write in 4 - KByte blocks , but older versions of fdisk arrange the first partition in such a way that it begins with the ( 512 - Byte ) sector 63 by default – which is right in the middle of a physical ( 4 - KByte ) sector .
Writing 4 KBytes of data to the beginning of the partition consequently requires the hard disk to read two physical sectors of 4 KBytes , distribute the 4 KBytes of data across these two physical sectors , wait for the disks to do an extra round and then write the two sectors back to disk .
This causes the data throughput of all 4 - KByte sectored hard disks ( as well as some RAID arrays ) to be significantly lower than that of a volume whose partitions start at ( 512 - Byte ) sector numbers which are divisible by eight .
More background information can be found in an article at LWN.
net .
Western Digital 's WD10EARS , for example , is one of the first desktop SATA hard disks on the shelves that uses 4 - KByte sectors internally .
Only recently , the problem sparked prolonged discussions at Slashdot following the release of an article entitled " Linux not fully prepared for 4096 - Byte sector hard drives " by OSNews .
The correctness of this headline varies with the interpretation of the term " Linux " , as the Linux kernel is hardly at fault ; it has already informed userland applications about the parameters relevant for optimum partition alignment since the I/O topology patches in Linux 2.6.31 .
Fdisk , on the other hand , has only used this information since the January version of util - linux - ng .
However , this does n't fully eradicate the problem because fdisk is n't the only partitioning tool included in Linux distributions .
The distribution installers also need to be adapted or need to use fdisk in the correct way – in a comment concerning the OSNews article mentioned above , the developer of the I/O topology patches , Martin K. Petersen , suspects that this is currently only the case in Fedora .
The version of fdisk used in the current util - linux - ng 2.17.1 not only aligns partitions along megabyte boundaries , it also recognises the " - c " parameter .
This parameter disables a DOS compatibility mode which is incompatible with the new approach because it involves aligning partitions along logical cylinder boundaries – this was required by DOS before the advent of LBA addressing and is still used by fdisk unless the tool is switched to sector - based operation by adding " u " or the " - u " command line parameter .
While the DOS mode has been marked as deprecated , this version is the last to include it as its default for compatibility reasons .
Until this changes , the sector - based display should be activated manually to ensure that 4 - KByte hard disks are aligned correctly .
Linux version status
A week after the release of the previous regular Kernel Log , the maintainers of the Stable Series have released kernel version 2.6.32.8 , which differs from its predecessor by more than 70 patches .
Kernel developer Greg Kroah - Hartman released Linux kernel version 2.6.32.9 just 24 hours ago .
The eighth release candidate of 2.6.33 is now more than 10 days old .
Although , in this phase of the development cycle , Torvalds usually releases a new RC every week , we dare not predict whether this indicates the imminent release of Linux 2.6.33 , or whether a 2.6.33 - rc9 will be appear beforehand .
The past few days have also seen a lot of activity from the developers of the RT branch , who develop Linux kernels with real - time functionality .
For instance , an announcement posted by the OSADL ( Open Source Automation Development Lab ) says the recently released version 2.6.31.12-rt21 is now considered the " Latest Stable " .
The OSADL web page also offers a short report about the renamed spinlocks mentioned in part 4 of the Kernel Log 's " Coming in 2.6.33 " mini series .
Thomas Gleixner writes that the renaming measure has significantly reduced the size of the real - time patches , in the release email for Linux 2.6.33 - rc8 - rt1 – the first RT kernel to be based on the current release candidates of Linux 2.6.33 .
In brief
Kernel
In mid February , the developers had a long discussion on the LKML about switching the kernel archives at kernel.org to the " XZ " compression format .
While no summary or appropriate road map has so far been released , there is evidence to suggest that the kernel sources will also become available in XZ format .
XZ compresses more efficiently than Gzip ( .gz ) and is faster than Bzip2 ( .bz2 ) .
In the long term the latter may be abandoned and the old files removed ; however , files compressed with Gzip will probably remain available .
In his " XFS status update for January 2010 " , Christoph Hellwig gives an overview of the latest developments in the XFS filesystem area .

In an instance of shocking apathy , a sub-inspector of Tamil Nadu police , brutally attacked by a gang in Tirunelveli district , bled to death , as his cry for help went in vain , even after two ministers with their convoy stopped by and saw his plight .
44 - year old Vetrivel , who was a member of the Special Task Force that gunned down forest brigand Veerappan in 2004 , lay in a pool of blood with his leg severed , and begged for help after the attack by the gang at Alwarkuruchi , shortly before the ministerial convoy was to pass by last evening , eyewitnesses said .
Health minister MRK Panneerselvam and youth and sports development minister Mohideen Khan , along with officials , including the district collector , halted their convoy on seeing the profusely bleeding police official battling for life on the road .
Eyewitnesses said Vetrivel was screaming for help , but did not get assistance in time from the ministers and accompanying officials .
Though later taken to a hospital , Vetrivel , who got a double promotion for being part of STF that gunned down forest brigand Veerappan , succumbed to injuries .
However , state health secretary VK Subburaj , who was part of the convoy , denied any insensitivity on the part of the ministers and officials , and said Panneerselvam had got down from his car and had gone near Vetrivel .
Today would be Jack London ’s 134th birthday .
The man was not only one of the most popular writers at the turn of the last century , he was also one of the first writers to see his novels be turned into a movie .
In fact , his novel , The Sea Wolf , was adapted into the first full - length feature film .
Also notably , he was one of the first celebrities to use his endorsement to advertise a product -- in his case , grape juice and dress suits .
To honor this prolific man , let ’s take a look at the life and times of Jack London .
Who ’s Your Daddy ?
Jack London never was certain of who his actual father was , although most biographers believe his dad was astrologer William Chaney .
His mother , Flora Wellman , claimed that Chaney insisted she have an abortion and that when she refused , he refused all responsibility for the child and left the city .
Flora shot herself as a result of her overwhelming depression .
Although she survived , she was temporarily deranged , and after Jack was born , she gave him to an ex-slave named Virginia Prentiss .
After Flora married a Civil War veteran named John London , baby Jack was given back to the her , but Virginia remained a strong maternal figure to Jack throughout his life .
When Jack was 21 , he searched for newspaper reports of his mother ’s attempted suicide and was able to research the name of his supposed biological father .
He wrote to William Chaney , but William claimed he could n’t be Jack ’s father because he was impotent .
He claimed Flora slept around and that she had slandered him when she said he told her to get an abortion .
Needless to say , Jack was devastated .
Education Versus Working Life
Jack grew up very working class and was forced to educate himself in the public library , as he could not afford to attend primary school .
He was mentored by Oakland public librarian Ina Coolbrith who became California ’s first poet laureate later on .
Jack referred to Coolbrith as his “ literary mother . ”
At only 13 , Jack started working at Hickmott ’s Cannery clocking in for anywhere between 12 and 18 hours per day .
In an effort to get out of this difficult life , he borrowed money from his foster mother and bought a boat .
He then started working as an oyster poacher .
Within only a few months , his boat was damaged beyond repair and he soon started working for the California Fish Patrol to hunt down fish poachers .
A few years later , Jack started protesting and fighting for labor unions in Kelly ’s Army .
He was known for giving stump speeches on Socialism to eager - eared workers .
Soon enough , he spent 30 days in jail in Buffalo on vagrancy charges .
The experience disturbed him seriously and he later wrote about it :
" Man - handling was merely one of the very minor unprintable horrors of the Erie County Pen .
I say ' unprintable ' ; and in justice I must also say undescribable .
They were unthinkable to me until I saw them . "
He returned to California where he finally started school at Oakland High .
It was here , in the school magazine , that he was first published .
His first story was Typhoon off the Coast of Japan , a recount of his experiences as a sailor .
While attending classes , he was inspired to become a writer when he read the book Signa by Ouida , which told the story of an unschooled Italian peasant who became a famous opera composer .
He credited this book as being the seed of his writing career .
After high school , Jack eventually was able to attend the University of California , Berkeley .
Unfortunately , the depression he began to experience after recently hearing from his father , paired with crushing financial circumstances , forced him to leave school only a year later .
Inspiration For " Bucks "
Most people know that Jack London was part of the Klondike Gold Rush , as this was the setting for his most popular story , Call of the Wild .
Not everyone knows that the main character in the story , a dog named Buck , was based on a dog that Jack ’s landlords had lent to him while he stayed in Dawson .
While in the north , he developed a number of health problems , including scurvy , which eventually led to the loss of his four front teeth .
The many hardships he faced during this period later served as inspiration for what is often called his greatest short story , To Build A Fire .
Breaking Into The Business
When Jack left the Klondike , he wanted to escape the difficulties of working class life and he realized his ticket out was his writing .
Jack 's first work printed by a major publisher , To the Man On Trial , ended up almost causing him to quit as soon as he started because the publisher was so slow to pay and the pay itself was so low .
His second published story actually ended up being his first paid assignment , as they actually came through with payment on time .
Luckily , that second story ’s payment gave him the motivation he needed to continue writing , he entered his field at just the right time , as magazine production ( and subsequently , the market for short fiction stories ) was skyrocketing due to new technologies that allowed for lower production costs .
Among the first stories he sold were Batard and Diable , which were two very similar stories about a French Canadian man who brutalized his dog , who then kills the man out of revenge .
Those familiar with The Call of the Wild will recognize these plot lines as being fairly similar to the novel .
Eugenics Versus Love
Jack ’s first marriage was to a friend Bessie Maddern .
The couple never actually had a romantic relationship together -- even after their marriage .
They agreed to be married because they believed they would be able to produce strong and healthy children .
While they had a loveless marriage , things remained exceptionally cordial before the children came along ; Bessie edited Jack ’s manuscripts and helped him improve his writing .
After they had children though , the relationship became strained .
Jack complained that “ every time I come back after being away from home for a night she wo n't let me be in the same room with her if she can help it . "
Not surprisingly , the couple ’s relationship ended in divorce .
Jack ’s next marriage was notably more successful , largely because it was based on love and not good genes .
While his nickname for Bessie was “ Mother - Girl , ” his nickname for his new wife , Charmian Kittredge ( pictured at right ) , was “ Mate Woman . ”
With Charmian , Jack found more than a friend , he found a soul mate and a lover .
She had been raised without prudishness and was very open to any and all of Jack ’s lustful fantasies -- this certainly helped keep Jack interested , as he was known for being a bit of a womanizer at the time .
The Making of a Historic Park
Speaking of his true loves , Jack was enamored with the ranch he bought in Sonoma County in 1905 , saying , “ next to my wife , the ranch is the dearest thing in the world to me . "
Jack wanted his ranch to become its own money making enterprise and dedicated a lot of his time to growing and improving the farm .
It was n’t long before he started writing only to support his farm .
His daughter , Joan , noted that after 1910 , " few reviewers bothered any more to criticize his work seriously , for it was obvious that Jack was no longer exerting himself . "
While the ranch ended up being a failure , Jack was largely ahead of his time and would likely have thrived in today ’s eco-friendly world .
He was one of the first U.S. farmers to practice the concept of sustainable agriculture and designed the first concrete silo built in California .
His home was designed and constructed by the finest Italian and Chinese stonemasons .
Unfortunately , just before the mansion was completed , it was destroyed by fire .
Nowadays , his ranch is a National Historic Landmark and part of the Jack London State Historic Park .
A Rip Off Artist ?
Many people , both past and present , have claimed London plagiarized much of his work .
To some extent , the accusations were fair .
When accused of basing The Call of the Wild on Egerton R. Young ’s My Dogs in the Northland , Jack admitted that it was a " source " and he said he wrote a letter to the author thanking him for the inspiration .
Jack even bought plots and novels from Sinclair Lewis and used them as his own .
The most damning case against him involved a chapter in his book The Iron Heel .
Jack claimed that he based this chapter on a speech by the Bishop of London that he clipped from an American newspaper that he did n’t realize was actually an excerpt from an ironic essay by Frank Harris called “ The Bishop of London and Public Morality . "
Harris was angered by this use of his essay and he argued that he should receive 1/60th of all royalties for the book .
On the other hand , some of the plagiarism accusations against Jack were merely a result of his using newspaper stories to inspire his plots .
A 1901 newspaper article criticized how similar his “ Moon - Face ” story was to Frank Norris ’ “ The Passing of Cock - eye Blacklock . ”
London defended himself by proving that both stories were inspired by the same newspaper story .
Soon , there was even a third similar story discovered to have been written about the same article .
This one was published a year earlier .
When criticized for writing a story directly from a non-fiction article by Augustus Biddle and J. K Macdonald , London argued that it was fair game , saying , " I , in the course of making my living by turning journalism into literature , used material from various sources which had been collected and narrated by men who made their living by turning the facts of life into journalism . "
A Contradictory Nature
Like most of us , Jack London was an extremely complex individual .
As a result , many of his views seemed contradictory , even hypocritical .
He was a life - long socialist , but was devoted to monetary pursuits .
While he always looked to his black foster mother as a role model and worried about the white man destroying indigenous cultures , he also bought into Social Darwinism and eugenics .
While he was a self - proclaimed alcoholic , he supported prohibition .
Death and Conspiracies
Jack died in 1916 of uremia .
The kidney stones and dysentery he was suffering from at the time were extremely painful , so he was taking morphine , which may have contributed to his death .
Because he wrote so many stories about people who killed themselves though , many people mistook his death for a suicide .
A decade later , a writer known as B . Traven started to become known as “ the German Jack London . ”
This author kept his identity secret his entire life , which led to some people speculating that Jack actually was B. Traven .
Some supporters of the theory claim that Jack faked his own death only to reappear as the German later on .
Funny enough , Traven ’s own widow revealed his identity after his death , but some conspiracy nuts still claim he was actually Jack London , while others claim he was actually Ambrose Bierce .
Sources # 1 , # 2 , # 3 , # 4
Although poverty and gender significantly influence health and socioeconomic development , health professionals are not always adequately prepared to address such issues in their work .
This publication aims to improve the awareness , knowledge and skills of health professionals in the region on poverty and gender concerns .
The modules that comprise this sourcebook are intended for use in pre-service and in - service training of health professionals .
This publication is also expected to be of use to policy - makers and programme managers as a reference document , or in conjunction with in - service training .
All modules in the series are linked , though each one can be used on a stand - alone basis if required .
Two foundational modules establish the conceptual framework for the analysis of poverty and gender issues in health .
Each of the other modules is intended for use in conjunction with these two foundational modules .
The sourcebook also contains a module on curricular integration to support health professional educational institutions integrate poverty and gender concerns into existing curricula .
About this module
This module is designed to improve the awareness , knowledge and skills of health professionals regarding poverty and gender concerns in actions to improve access to clean water , adequatesanitation and safe food .
The Western Pacific Region has made great strides in improving access to clean water and sanitation in recent years .
On average , the Region is making significant progress towards meeting the Millennium Development Goal for clean water and adequate sanitation .
However , these averages mask striking inequalities in access toclean water and adequate sanitation across and within countries in the Region .
Evidence shows that poor individuals and households in rural and remote communities and urbanpoor areas are particularly disadvantaged .
In addition , men and women 's needs , access to and use of adequate water and safe sanitation tend to differ .
With regard to food safety , the Region has made progress in establishing and strengthening nationalfood safety systems and responding to outbreaks of foodborne diseases .
However , some evidence suggests that poor households are more vulnerable than wealthier ones to foodborne pathogens .
As is the case with water and sanitation , gender roles accord a more significant role to women than to men in handling and preparing food .
The knowledge and tools needed to drastically improve the coverage of cleanwater , adequate sanitation and safe food largely exist .
Mobilizing support for these interventions in developing countries will improvethe health of millions , thereby contributing to poverty reduction and gender equality .

Hearing 2010 predictions by futurists and others is both entertaining and educational .
National and state bankruptcy , discombobulating failures in corporate state health , finance , domestic security , intelligence and military industries , the breakup or collapse of both halves of the American political duocracy — political and economic crises and chaos are predicted by many observers .
War is a Racket : The A ... Butler , Smedley D. Best Price : $ 2.55 Buy New $ 7.01 ( as of 05:45 EST - Details )
One thing not predicted in 2010 is a reduction of American forces , or the numbers of American interferences and entanglements overseas .
No one is predicting the ending of America ’s illegal wars , or even the ending of a front in just one of the illegal wars .
However , government spokesmen are aware that this is exactly what Americans want , and are beginning to pander .
Case in point is JCS Chairman Admiral Mullen on The Daily Show last week discussing how we are coming out of Iraq in 18 months , and how the US military is 40 % smaller than it was at the end of the Cold War .
Naturally , Mullen represents his case well , and is lying .
In 1988 , about a year before the end of the Cold War , a Congressional Research Service chronology of military spending put the DoD take at $ 451 billion ( in 2005 dollars ) .
In 2009 , DoD got $ 460.5 billion ( in 2005 dollars ) .
The real military budget in 2009 was larger , not smaller , than at the end of the Cold War .
But there ’s more , namely the modern habit of funding any actual wars the DoD may be fighting through separate supplemental Congressional appropriations and authorizations .
Not only is the DoD budget share larger in comparable dollars than just before the Cold War ended , it is a lot larger .
In terms of people , seems like this country has today 1,473,900 active duty personnel , and 1,458,500 reserves and that is indeed technically smaller than in 1988 , when the US military had over 2.1 million men and women under arms .
But that was before the broad - based government and military outsourcing rage of the last 15 years , which as one economist correctly wonders ,
" … was it really about saving money ?
Or was it a way to ramp up the effective size of the fighting force without having to institute a draft or some other means of increase the size of the military ( e.g. increasing pay substantially ) ?
And perhaps sending a few , more than a few actually , bucks in certain directions ? "
A Century of War : Linc ... John V. Denson Best Price : $ 3.72 Buy New $ 8.50 ( as of 07:45 EST - Details )
Admiral Mullen was applauded by The Daily Show audience when he stated that the US military is leaving Iraq in 18 months , and that the military is smaller .
Under a security pact signed with Iraq , all U.S. forces are indeed to be out by the end of 2011 .
But General Odierno recently stated that he would be looking at whether there is a significant increase in violence after the [ March 2010 Iraqi ] election or major problems seating a new government when he makes his decisions [ italics added ] about whether to continue with the drawdown as scheduled . "
Certainly Obama ’s speech ( and the still employed Bush defense strategy team of Gates , Mullen and Odierno ) of a year ago all indicate that when the US leaves Iraq , 50,000 soldiers ( and presumably many more civilians and security contractors ) will remain forever , housed in our monster embassy and the four major bases we constructed .
This kind of deployment should be familiar — Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo is nearly 1000 acres and holds 5,000 — 7,000 American troops and civilians / contractors .
But like our bases in Iraq , it is a robust military lily pad in a client state , designed for and capable of housing 70,000 combat troops .
There has been no publicity at all about how we are actually going to turn our brand new , massive and US - tailored military bases in Iraq over to Iraqis in 2011 .
This suggests that as the administration and its military leadership have already stated , 50 — 70 thousand American " non-combat " troops will remain permanently stationed in Iraq to " secure " its borders , or its position as lackey state .
War Is a Force that Gi ... Hedges , Chris Best Price : $ 1.25 Buy New $ 4.04 ( as of 01:05 EST - Details )
Even though we do n’t want to hear about it , as the pandering Mullen understands , many news outlets are predicting expanded wars , while others are simply reporting them .
Some suspect , as history has amply demonstrated , that when a state is in trouble , with its finances , credibility or politics — it will seek new or expanded war .
Chris Hedge ’s 2002 book War is a Force that Gives Us Meaning examines the excitement and attraction of " the communal march against an enemy . "
Before the rise of the state in North America and everywhere else , young men in particular sought ways to prove themselves , in manhood or adulthood ceremonies pitting them against their fears , against nature , and testing their worthiness to be good sons , good husbands , good neighbors , good men .
If war can be co-opted by the state , the innate energy in human emotions , the combination of testosterone and uncertainty of young men everywhere , and mob tendencies can prolong the survival of that state .
If you like this site , please help keep it going and growing .
So why am I excited about 2010 ?
I think this year many more Americans will begin to bear the pain of the corporate and warmongering state , led by a gutless , fat - cat Congress and its fake but very expensive wars on terror , drugs , tobacco , alcohol , fat , privacy , private property , guns and free speech .
They will bear it with decreased personal revenue and the frustration of dealing with government at all levels .
They will increasingly suffer repeated small humiliations associated with living in a mature confiscatory and emerging police state .
As they suffer , they will be increasingly exposed to the utter waste and stupidity of our government , at home and abroad — and will begin to consider themselves superior to it .
What if , instead of a new series of state - created and state - led wars , we got some recombination of a people - created and people - led war against the state ?
We have seen and lived the Ron Paul revolution , and witnessed the undeniable rise of Tea Party populism .
Coming mass tax increases combined with state and federal defaults , and inflation , will shape the American psyche in a way that could make us quite ungovernable .
In government circles , 2010 could become known as the Year of the Bad Serf .
In the face of expensive wars and a dying desperate federal state , 2010 will mark the year that Americans self - consciously embrace the power of civil disobedience , and launch a decade of fundamental and good - natured repudiation of all things government — its wars , its debts , its never - ending lies and yes , even its promises .
It ’s already happening , and it ’s going to be a lot of fun .
The Best of Karen Kwiatkowski
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A top executive at American International Group Inc has resigned because of pay curbs imposed by the Obama Administration ’s pay czar , the insurer said on Wednesday .

Anastasia Kelly , AIG ’s vice chairman for legal , human resources , corporate affairs and corporate communications , resigned effective December 30 for “ good reason ” and is eligible for severance pay under the terms of the company ’s executive severance plan , the insurer said .
Kelly stands to be paid about $ 2.8 million in severance , according to a source familiar with the matter .
Kelly ’s resignation comes after Kenneth Feinberg , who is charged with monitoring pay levels at companies that received taxpayer funds , imposed pay caps for AIG ’s top executives .
Earlier this month , Feinberg set the compensation structures for the 26th through 100th highest - paid employees at four firms , including AIG , limiting most cash salaries to $ 500,000 .
Feinberg also granted less than a dozen special exemptions from the cash salary cap , including several AIG executives , after being urged to do so by Federal Reserve and Treasury officials .
Kelly met frequently with Feinberg to discuss pay issues as he prepared to rule on compensation at companies that received extraordinary taxpayer bailouts .
She was among five executives reported by The Wall Street Journal to have notified the insurer that they were prepared to resign and collect severance benefits if their pay was cut sharply by Feinberg .
Chief executive Robert Benmosche separately also had considered quitting because of the pay constraints , the Journal has reported .
AIG had to be propped up with some $ 180 billion in taxpayer support after its near collapse in September 2008 .
The U.S. government now owns nearly 80 percent of the company , once the world ’s largest insurer by market value .
The government stepped in to rescue AIG after it ran short of funds to meet collateral demands from global banks that had bought credit protection from an AIG financial products unit .
The government saw the company ’s possible collapse as a systemic risk .
AIG angered many Americans earlier this year when it paid million - dollar retention bonuses -- payments simply for staying in their jobs -- to executives at a financial products unit that was responsible for its financial implosion .
The insurer also said on Wednesday that Suzanne Folsom , chief compliance and regulatory officer , has left to pursue other opportunities .
It said it is looking for successors for both officials .

So you ’re laid up in bed with the flu like everyone else , with nothing to do but chug Emergen - C , ride the NyQuil train , and gaze glassy - eyed at hours of DVRed shows that you ’d usually let languish .
It ’s time for a new playlist !
When even keeping your eyes open starts to hurt , queue up this nerdy mixtape and zonk out to the best in library - inspired jams .
Thanks to @flavorpill follower Lauren for the smart ( and challenging ! ) idea .
View the full tracklist after the jump .
1. “ At the Library ” by Green Day ytaudio( CEV0BulOv6 Y )
A tale of unrequited library lust .
Unfortunately the object of Billie Joe ’s affection has no idea why he ’s staring at her .
She also happens to read too quickly for his taste ( or at least his taste back in 1991 ) and she already has a boyfriend .
2 . “ In the Army Kid ” – Of Montreal
Our innocent protagonist is “ riding to the station on the bus ” because he wants to pick out some library books .
Jen , a librarian who ’s not his type and sounds like a bit of a cougar , always hunts his “ butt . ”
He ca n’t ditch the situation because there are bills to pay — whatever that means .
3. “ Swinging London ” – The Magnetic Fields
The epitome of geek love ?
“ I read your manifestos and your strange religious tracts / You took me to your library and kissed me in the stacks . ”
Unfortunately this nerdy fling does n’t last : “ You went off swinging London and forgot to come back . ”
4. “ Young Adult Friction ” by The Pains of Being Pure at Heart
The definitive song about getting laid in the library : “ Between the stacks in the library / Not like anyone stopped to see / We came they went our bodies spent / Among the dust and the microfiche . ”
5. “ Lost in the Library ” – Saint Etienne ytaudio( BRjNJjID2wQ )
This one is an instrumental , but feels decidedly bookish .
6 . “ There She Goes , My Beautiful World ” by Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds
This song runs through a gamut of writers and the difficulties that they overcame in their careers — including Philip Larkin “ sticking it out ” in a library in Hull .
7. “ Library Card ” by Frank Zappa
Pianist Hermann Kretzschmar begins Zappa ’s experimental album Everything Is Healing Nicely ( a posthumous work culled from The Yellow Shark sessions ) by reading the information from his library card .
Unfortunately , we do n’t have the audio .
8. “ Fun Fun Fun ” by The Beach Boys ytaudio( QXif3HvtpNg )
True story : Brian Wilson and Mike Love wrote this song about a rich girl who Dennis Wilson was dating .
She ’d tell her father that she needed to borrow his T - bird to get to the library when really she was hanging out with Dennis at his apartment .
Until daddy took the car away .
9. “ Librarian ” by My Morning Jacket
This is like the “ Let ’s Get It On ” of the library world : “ It ’s not like you ’re not trying , with a pencil in your hair / To defy the beauty the good lord put in there / Simple little bookworm — buried underneath / Is the sexiest librarian / take off those glasses and let down your hair for me . ”
10 . “ Library Rap ” by MC Poindexter & The Study Crew ytaudio( AfVXPdiBWRM )
Because we had to include one rap song in the mix ; it comes from an episode of the ’90s sci-fi TV series Sliders .
Our favorite lyric ?
“ And I give you one warnin ’ / There will be no repeats :/ Get out of my face / While I ’m readin ’ my Keats . ”
Sen. Chuck Schumer , D - N.Y. , and Rep. Chris Van Hollen , D - Md. , announced several proposed legislative changes today to blunt the effect of the Supreme Court 's recent ruling that allows corporations and unions to spend unlimited amounts of money on political advertising .
Schumer said the lawmakers , who are working closely with the White House and Democratic leaders , plan to introduce a bill in the coming weeks that would require new disclosure rules on corporate spending and CEO disclaimers in political ads , along with limits on foreign involvement in political advertising .
They said they want the measures in place quickly to curb unrestricted corporate spending in November 's midterm congressional elections .
" Today , we 're beginning to pick up the pieces of campaign - finance " laws " shattered " by the high court 's ruling , Schumer told reporters .
But groups supporting a bill that would publicly finance congressional elections said the proposal does n't go far enough .
" These are good first steps but as a package they fall short of getting to the heart of the problem of money in politics , " said Nick Nyhart , president and CEO of Public Campaign .
" At the end of the day , these proposals still leave members of Congress dependent on money from Wall Street interests , insurance companies , and the other deep pocket interests who control Washington , D.C. "
The " framework " unveiled Thursday would :
Ban federal contractors or recipients of federal bailout money from spending on political ads that call for the election or defeat of candidates .
Bar foreign companies from paying for the ads .
( Federal law already bans foreigners from contributing to campaigns .
Schumer and Van Hollen say they want to ensure that U.S. companies with substantial foreign investment cannot sway U.S. elections .
Companies with 20 % foreign ownership or those with a majority of foreign board members would be subject to the ban . )
Impose new disclosure requirements to discourage corporations and unions from funneling their money through trade associations and shadowy non-profit groups that do not have to publicly release their donors ' names under current law .
Companies also would have to disclose their political spending to shareholders and federal securities regulators .
Require CEOs of companies who fund political ads to appear in the advertising .
Candidates and political parties mentioned in corporate - funded ads could demand the cheapest available rate on response ads .
The lawmakers face several challenges .
The Federal Election Commission already has announced that it would stop enforcing its rules on corporate - and union - funded political advertising to comply with the ruling .
At the same time , the measures to curb spending have attracted little Republican support .
Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , who championed a major campaign - finance law in 2002 , recently declared there was little Congress could do to respond .
Update at 4:45 p.m. ET : The folks at the Center for Competitive Politics , which favors fewer campaign restrictions , slammed the Schumer - Van Hollen proposals this afternoon .
The proposals violate constitutional rights to free speech , the group says .
" The First Amendment should not be plowed over because of an inconvenient political storm , " said Bradley A. Smith , the group 's chairman and a former Federal Election Commission chairman .
" This is a cynical attempt to brush aside constitutional concerns because of a short - term perception of partisan gain . "

Gernot Heiser is CTO and founder of Open Kernel Labs .
Earlier this year , Open Kernel Labs and its research partner , NICTA ( Australia 's Information and Communications Technology Research Centre of Excellence ) , announced completion of groundbreaking long - term research and development providing formal mathematical proof of the correctness of a general - purpose operating - system microkernel and virtualization platform .
The project centered on the need to assure extremely high levels of reliability , safety , and security in mission - critical domains that include aerospace , national security , and transportation .
The correctness proof will significantly reduce the effort required for certification under formal security or safety evaluation regimes , such as Common Criteria , and paves the way for deploying trustworthy virtualization technology for business - critical applications in mobile telephony , business intelligence , and mobile financial transactions .
Formal Verification : Key to Secure and Reliable Software
Existing certification regimes center on software processes , testing , and conformance to specifications of models of software .
By contrast , the formal verification project actually proved the correctness of the code itself , using formal logic and programmatic theorem checking -- the first time this has been achieved for a general - purpose operating system ( OS ) kernel or hypervisor .
The verification eliminated a wide range of exploitable errors in the kernel , including design flaws and code - based errors like buffer overflows , null pointer dereference and other pointer errors , memory leaks and arithmetic overflows , and exceptions .
The project entailed more than five years of work by NICTA and researchers from the University of New South Wales on behalf of OK Labs .
The joint team verified 7,500 lines of source code , proving over 10,000 intermediate theorems in over 200,000 lines of formal proof .
The verified code base , which underlies the OK : Verified platform ( project name seL4 ) , is a newly developed OS microkernel .
It is derived from the globally developed and deployed open source L4 project and is designed for use as a hypervisor that can support multiple virtual machines .
The code constitutes a third - generation microkernel and is influenced by the Extremely Reliable Operating System ( EROS ) project .
It features abstractions for virtual address spaces , threads , inter- process communication ( IPC ) , and , like EROS but unlike most commercial systems , capabilities for access control .
Initial development and all verification work was performed on an ARM v6 - based platform , with a subsequent port of the kernel ( so far without proof ) to the x86 architecture .
The proof was machine - checked and is one of the largest proofs ever completed .
Formal proofs for specific properties have been conducted for smaller kernels and code bases , but what the team achieved constitutes a general , functional correctness proof , which has never before been realized for software of this complexity or size .
To reach this milestone , the team invented new techniques in formal machine - checked proof methods , made advances in the mathematical understanding of real world programming languages , and developed new methodologies for rapid prototyping of OS kernels .
This work went beyond the usual checks for the absence of certain specific errors .
Instead , it verified full compliance with the system specification .
The project has yielded not only a verified microkernel but also a body of techniques that can be used to develop and verify other pieces and types of software .
Smaller is Better
Large code size and complexity are the archenemies of software reliability .
Experience shows that well - engineered software tends to exhibit at least two to five bugs per thousand lines of code ( kLoC ) , and where there are bugs , there are , most certainly , security or safety vulnerabilities .
And , as many mobile / wireless devices now field hundreds of thousands , even millions of lines of code , they therefore may have literally thousands of bugs with concomitant vulnerabilities .
The security and reliability of a computer system can only be as good as that of the underlying OS kernel .
The kernel , defined as the part of the system executing in the most privileged mode of the processor , has unlimited hardware access .
Therefore , any fault in kernel implementation has the potential to undermine the correct operation of the entire system .
The existence of bugs in any sizeable code base is inevitable .
As a consequence , when security or reliability is paramount , the usual approach is to reduce the amount of privileged code , in order to minimize the exposure to bugs .
The best way to manage this complexity and accompanying reliability challenges is to architect systems to limit the size of security - or safety - critical components .
The trusted computing base ( TCB ) comprises the part of the system that can violate security policies .
If the TCB is small enough , it becomes feasible to engineer it to the highest standards .
TCB reduction is a primary motivation behind security kernels and separation kernels , the MILS ( multiple independent levels of security ) approach , the use of small hypervisors as a minimal trusted base , as well as systems that require the use of type - safe languages for all code except some " dirty " core .
It is the reason why Common Criteria , at the strictest evaluation level , requires the system under evaluation to have a " simple " design .
Easily said , but not as easily done .
Rich functionality ( like GUIs and sophisticated application programs ) is generally implemented on top of powerful , function - rich OSes like Windows , Linux , or Android .
These are themselves large and complex , and consequently full of bugs .
But the OS is inherently part of the TCB of whatever program is running on top .
One simple and elegant solution to the challenge of TCB reduction is based on virtualization : A system is partitioned into several virtual machines ( VMs ) , each containing a separate subsystem .
For a typical mobile device , one VM would host a rich OS supporting the user - facing software , another a real - time OS ( RTOS ) supporting the wireless communication software , and a third VM would contain and protect security - or safety - critical software ( possibly running directly on the virtual hardware without any OS ) .
In such a setup , the TCB of the critical subsystem would consist of little more than the hypervisor that implements the virtual machines .
The security and safety of the system would then hinge on the trustworthiness of a relatively modest - sized hypervisor .
By adapting the hypervisor to the specific requirements of mobile systems ( and the similar requirements of other consumer electronic devices ) , with careful design and implementation of a minimum set of primitives , a total TCB size of approximately 10 kLoC is achievable .
The number of bugs in such a small code base can be reduced to a small number by using good software - engineering techniques , and one can hope that none of them constitute vulnerabilities .
However , with human lives and national security at stake , we should take a more pessimistic approach than hoping for the best , and assume that there are critical bugs unless proven otherwise .
The signs all point to n earthquake indeed ...
But I debate your thoughts on the latter part of your statement BIG TIME ...
Who says it 's bad ..?
If you would read more , learn more , and absorb the fact , you 'd see what 's bad and it's not the opinions or discussions ...
The fact are there for all to read ...
Are you not aware of the background of the past world incidences regarding terrorism acts , and what about Dearborn , Michigan ...???
And it 's more than obvious that you did not see or read the speech given by a Dutch politician recently in NYC regarding the key " word " within your text ...
Look at the facts - not just voice an opinion of what 's good , bad , or indifferent ..
Rachelle In High Heels
We all know how difficult it is just to get out the door in the morning ( though it can be easier if you know how to wake up fast and attack the day ) , so it 's no surprise that preparing lunch often falls by the wayside .
Make bringing lunch — or preparing it at work — easier by using one of these 25 trouble - free and tasty ideas .
Sandwiches
Sandwiches are the epitome of an uncomplicated lunch , but they do n't have to be boring .
Use ingredients from last night 's dinner in innovative ways to bring new life to those two slices of bread .
( See also : The 5 Best Bread Machines )
1. Chicken Salad Sandwich
Dice or shred leftover chicken with celery or pickles ( both are delicious ) , mix with mayonnaise or ranch dressing , and add a Kaiser roll , and you 've got one delicious , easy lunch .
2. Meatball Sub
This is one of my all - time easiest lunches .
Anytime I have spaghetti and meatballs for dinner , I reserve three to five meatballs and some sauce for lunch the next day .
After dinner , I cut a French baguette in half , layer on meatballs on sauce , and go to bed .
That is the easiest lunch ever , right ?
3. Italian Sub
The classic Italian sub is both practical and delectable .
Start yours with a good foundation of a French or sourdough sub roll , and layer on salami , provolone , lettuce , and add Italian dressing .
Done !
You can spice up your sub with the addition of pepperoncini , roasted red pepper , or even artichoke hearts .

4. Philly Cheese Steak
Being a new resident of Philadelphia , I had to add this one to the list .
Make your own , super - easy version of this old favorite by sautéing half a white onion and half a bell pepper in 1 tbsp of butter until the onion is translucent .
Mix in leftover steak and heat .
Put the filling on a hoagie roll and top with provolone cheese ( or , like the real cheese steak , Cheese Whiz ) .
What 's that you say ?
No leftover steak ?
No problem — just use sliced roast beef deli meat for an easy alternative , like Hillshire Farm recommends .
5. Tasty Turkey Sandwich
We 've all probably had a turkey sandwich greet us for lunch at some point in our lives .
Dress up your turkey with this turkey sandwich recipe from Good Housekeeping .
It gets a lift from fresh lemony mayo and spinach greens .
Pasta
Pasta is a lunchtime staple because it's easy to combine the three main components of any pasta dish — noodles , sauce , and a protein or veggies — in countless ways to create delectable new lunches .
6. Pasta Frittata
Almost everyone eats spaghetti , but not everyone enjoys eating leftover pasta the next day .
Transform leftover spaghetti noodles into a tasty pasta frittata by adding six eggs and ¼ cup milk to one cup of leftover spaghetti or fettuccine noodles and cooking on medium heat in a skillet for about five minutes .
Add about two cups of cheese ( any kind will do ) , and broil the frittata until the eggs are set and the cheese is golden brown .
For a more fancy version , try this frittata recipe from Rachel Ray .
7. Easy Pasta Salad
I love pasta salad , not only because it 's delicious , but also because it 's easy to make and easy to eat on the go .
The most economical way to make past salad is , of course , with leftovers — use pasta , veggies from another dish , and cheese ( cubed or grated ) , then toss with olive oil , red wine vinegar , and spices .
You can also add in a protein for an even more filling salad .
My personal favorites are cubed chicken , shrimp , or pepperoni .
8. Shrimp and Orzo
Orzo ( that small , rice - shaped pasta ) is wonderful eaten both hot and cold .
I make a lunch version by cooking ¼ pound orzo the night before and throwing in ¼ pound pre-cooked shrimp , ½ cup feta cheese , ½ of a chopped cucumber , and some cherry tomatoes .
Toss all the ingredients with olive oil , red wine vinegar , salt and pepper , and chill .
Mmmm , mmmm good !
Random Lunches
For those people who refuse to be boxed into a neat category , try a lunch recipe that refuses to do the same .
Decide for yourself which most suits your unique personality .
9. Pinwheels
This staple at office food days and parties is easy , cheap , and can be made with a tortilla and just about any filling your heart desires .
One of my go - to favorites is cream cheese and turkey , but if you 're looking for some inspiration , try a few of these ideas from the Williams - Sonoma Blog .
10 . Mediterranean Pita Pocket
In my humble opinion , the pita pocket is second only to sliced bread when it comes to making a variety of lunch items .
I personally love a Mediterranean - inspired version , which involves stuffing a pita with lettuce , red onion , tomatoes , and Kalamata olives and topping with Greek yogurt and cucumber ( a quasi - tzaziki sauce , if you will ) .
You could substitute the yogurt and cucumber with hummus , too .
11 . Quinoa Salad
Quinoa , a grain - like crop grown for its edible seeds , is a good source of protein , amino acids , and calcium .
It is also , by the way , gluten free .
Quinoa can be a perfect lunch staple because it is so healthy and easy to make .
Try making your own quinoa salad by cooking two cups chicken broth with one cup of quinoa according to the package directions .
Add cooked broccoli florets , cherry tomatoes , and feta cheese .
Toss with extra virgin olive oil , red wine vinegar , salt and pepper .
Enjoy !
Mexican - Inspired Fare
The tortilla is Mexico 's answer to the sandwich .
Endlessly versatile , inexpensive , and tasty , tortillas can be filled and folded in innumerable ways .
Here are some of my favorites .
12 . Black Bean and Corn Burrito
What could be easier than opening a can of beans and a can of corn , and folding into a burrito ?
I make these tasty lunches by using one can of black beans and one can of corn ( rinse before using ) ; adding an avocado , red onion , and cilantro ; and mixing with olive oil and salt and pepper to taste .
Pile the filling on a flour tortilla , fold burrito - style , and enjoy !
13 . Taco Salad
OK , this one does not call for a tortilla like the other lunches in this category , but it 's equally versatile .
I 'm not a huge fan of leftover ground beef ( personal choice , I guess ) , so I leave that out when making a super - easy taco salad for lunch .
Instead , I substitute black beans .
I pack beans and salsa separately from shredded iceberg lettuce and cheese .
Also separately , I pack a nice lime vinaigrette ( 2 tbsp lime , 4 tbsp olive oil , salt , and pepper ) .
Come lunchtime , my lunch is still fresh and appetizing .
14 . Omelet Burrito
Take a portable , protein - filled lunch by wrapping your omelet in a tortilla .
Cook three eggs in a skillet , adding cheese , veggies , and ham as desired .
Fill a tortilla , fold burrito - style , and wrap in wax paper until ready to eat .
I especially love to eat this one when I 'm feeling under the weather — maybe because having breakfast for lunch is also a pick - me - up .
( Wise Bread Pick : Lodge 12 - Inch Cast Iron Skillet at Amazon )
15 . Chicken , Apple , and Cheese Quesadilla
If you have leftover chicken from last night 's dinner , use some of it to make this easy lunch .
Place ½ cup of shredded cheese ( mozzarella is my personal favorite , although cheddar works fine too ) on a tortilla , add chicken and apple , and top with another ¼ cup of cheese .
Add another tortilla on top and microwave for 30 seconds , or until cheese is melted and bubbly .
Slice and eat .
Old Favorites
Just because you grew up does n't mean your lunch has to — as far as the basics , that is .
Below are some of the best of classic lunches from our childhood , dressed up in work - appropriate form .
16 . PB&J
What 's not to like about the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches of our youth ?
They are the epitome of cheap , easy , and tasty .
If you feel that you need your PB&J to grow up with you , try preparing a gourmet version , with almond butter , peach raspberry preserves , and sliced sourdough bread .
You can get creative in other ways , too , like with PB&J " sushi " rolls .
17 . Macaroni and Cheese
It does n't have to come from a box to be easy and cheap !
Try making this easy stovetop macaroni and cheese recipe the night before and taking it along for lunch .
I also like to add a protein to my mac , like chicken , shrimp , or sliced Italian sausage .
18 . Hot Dogs
Try making these childhood favorites easier to eat at the office by wrapping them in croissant rolls .
Buy refrigerated croissant rolls at the grocery store , and unwrap one of the triangular squares .
Add a shredded cheese of your choice and a hot dog , roll up , and place on a baking sheet .
Bake at 350 °F for 15 minutes or until the dough is golden brown .
19 . Ramen Noodles
This staple of college dorm pantries is also an easy and cheap lunch option for grown - ups .
For an exhaustive list of things to do with ramen noodles , check out the appropriately named book , 101 Things to Do with Ramen Noodles .
For a quick lunch without the tutorial , simply add 1 cup of fresh or frozen veggies of your choice and ½ cup alfredo or pasta sauce to ramen noodles .
Cook according to noodle directions , but only add ½ of the seasoning included — that 's where all the sodium is .
20 . Grown - Up Lunchables
A typical Lunchables package is filled with crackers , cheese , and meat .
Pack your own version with whole - wheat crackers , cubed or sliced cheeses , and deli meat .
Add some hardy fruit that 's easy to eat on the go ( like sliced apples , grapes , or clementines ) , and you 've got a balanced lunch for cheap .
21 . Mini-Pizzas
Spread some tomato sauce on an English muffin , add cheese , top with pepperoni or chicken , and broil until the cheese bubbles .
These delicious bites are easy to take with you on the go and just as easy to make .
You can also try variations on the theme , like chicken alfredo pizza ( alfredo sauce ) , barbeque chicken pizza ( barbeque sauce ) , or buffalo chicken pizza ( with butter and hot sauce ) .
Soups
Soups are great lunches for a number of reasons :
They wo n't make you feel full enough to put you to sleep mid-afternoon , they 're generally healthy , and they are almost always economical to make .
Here are a few that are particularly well suited to lunchtime .
22 . Cheddar Beer Soup
Who could n't use a drink at the office ?
Get your fix with a hearty cheese soup enlivened with a splash 'o beer .
This cheddar - beer soup recipe takes only 15 minutes to make and requires only five ingredients .
Make it the night before ( or even the morning of ) , take along , and heat for lunch .
23 . Sweet Corn Soup
This sweet corn soup recipe is delicious , nutritious , and ( bonus ! ) can be made in the microwave , making it officially one of the easiest soup recipes around .
I highly recommend it for a chilly fall day .
24 . Gazpacho
Gazpacho , or cold tomato soup , was originally invented to avoid using the stove on a hot summer day .
Make it any time of year for an easy lunch using this simple gazpacho recipe .
Add some croutons or a crusty baguette , and you 're set !
25 . Cannellini Bean and Tomato Soup
Here 's another one that is über - simple to make ahead or even in the microwave at work , if you have one .
Empty one can of cannellini beans ( plus liquid ) and one can of spaghetti or marinara sauce into a microwave - safe container and microwave on high for three minutes .
Let sit for one minute before removing .
Dress it up with Parmesan cheese and bacon if desired , and enjoy with some croutons .
So there 's the big list of 25 quick and cheap lunch ideas .
Was there anything I left out , or do you have a variation on a theme ?

Crosby Ovechkin – a match made in the media labs
Here is video diary of the Crosby Ovechkin story .
Hope you enjoy .
Like CNN going on for hours on end about a seemingly non-news event just because they are short on material , the NHL media seem to look for conflict where non exists ; at least not much more than any other 2 determined captains .
They are needy of some drama .
There have n’t been any ‘ sloppy seconds ’ remarks , no Cormier type assassination attempts , no new clubs joining the fray , even the Phoenix situation has petered into a non-event .
There ’s been a lot of great hockey mind you , like the Junior Tourney and now the Olympics but not a heck of a lot of conflict .
There can be no drama without conflict .
The Sidney Crosby – Alex Ovechkin conflict reminds me more of Rick Rude vs. The Ultimate Warrior than it does Gordie Howe vs. Rockey Richard .
Of course these guys battle very hard while playing against each other , they are both hyper competitive , elite athletes .
Neither of them would be where they are if they were n’t absolutely determined to be the best and in hockey these days that means being aggressive and tough to play against .
Feel free to read our Sidney Crosby biography and our Alexander Ovechkin biography .
Subtleties : Was Alex Ovechkin mocking Crosby during the 2009 NHL All - Star shootout contest ?
At the time not much was said about Ovechkin ’s attire , it was just a bit of showmanship but as Michael Farber points out , Ovechkin was wearing a Tilley hat ( Canadian made ) , the CDN flag , Gatorade ( a Crosby sponsored pruduct ) – probably a deep over - analysis but still fun ..
Crosby Ovechkin – I think they enjoy this pseudo - conflict as much as the media .
Any great story has to have a hero and a villain .
It does n’t matter that it ’s not clear cut which is which , Canadian fans will say that Ovechkin is a dirty cheap shot artist that gets away with anything because of his star status ..
While Ovechkin ’s supporters will go on about how Crosby is the biggest baby in the league .

Right now these comments by two of the game ’s most highly regarded intellects ( ah…hemm ) battle wits in naming the game ’s best player actually get it right .
On the ice these two guys are simply the best in the game .
They both want to lead their team to the cup finals and get a chance to hoist the hallowed trophy .
To wrap things up , here ’s how your mortal enemies actually battle when off the ice … careful – this may be hard to watch .
I saw Live Free or Die Hard few days ago and I must say that I ’m really glad that I did not actually waste money to see this piece of crap on the big screen .
My gut instinct is to automatically pass on any movies that feature hackers or cyber - terrorism because Hollywood always gets these things horribly wrong .
Watching the new installment of the Die Hard was a bit like revisiting The Net all over again .
The level of technical expertise and realism is about the same in both pictures .
In all fairness , The Net is probably a better movie of the two simply because it contains Sandra Bullock in her prime , and does not contain Justin Long ( who seriously needs to get punched in the face with a sledge hammer ) .
This is the plot of the movie : a bunch of evil terrorists ( and you know they are totally evil because they all wear black ) hack into the United States and shut everything down .
You gonna ask me “ United States what ? ” but no , I did not skip a word there .
That is precisely the problem with this movie .
These dudes hack into everything !
They are such 1337 hackers that they can control anything : street lights , gas mains , tv channels , cell phone networks , the stock market , banking , trains , plains , on board avionics in military jets – hell , they can even take over that shitty $ 10 webcam in your bedroom and spy on your ass .
The movie is full or ridiculous scenes that look like they were inspired by The Net .
For example , at one point the bad guy played by Timothy Olyphant ( who we probably better know as The Asexual Hitman Man ) goes “ McClain , I just deleted your bank account and now I ’m deleting your 401k – how do you feel about that ?
Muahahahaha ” as he types something on his keyboard .
Next thing you know there is an animation of a page with a big 401k heading and a table with some numbers that suddenly start counting down until they all reach $ 0 while you hear the ka-ching cash register sound effect .
Really ?
I mean , seriously !
Come one people !
The scene is silly in itself but it becomes even sillier when you find out what the bad guys are “ really after ” .
You see , according to this film , after 9/11 the government created a secret facility with some totally awesome servers ( and you know they are totally awesome because they like have a lot of blinkenlights ) where all financial , banking and social security information from the whole country will be backed up in case of a national emergency .
The terrorists want to steal that data because once they have it they will be able to ( and this is a direct quote ) :
“ Put it on a portable disk , take it anywhere .
They will be able to make transfers , and will be untraceable !
Or they could delete it all and send us back to the stone age ! ”
In other words , the terrorists pretty much shut down the country order to perpetrate some petty identity theft .
I ’m ignoring that stone age bit because it just does n’t make any sense and I do n’t even want to know what they were getting at .
Why do they create a media circus instead of doing things quietly is beyond me .
What is even funnier , you have to realize that they already took over computer systems of banks , investment firms , the NY stock exchange , social security systems and etc .
It seemed like they already had access to all that information that was supposed to be in the super - secret backup facility .
After all they were deleting people ’s bank accounts and 401k plans and making untraceable transfers throughout the movie .
So why did they needed the backups ?
I mean , it ’s not like they could erase them and “ send us to stone age ” since every single institution they broke into is likely to have localized and / or off - site physical backups .
No super - duper national backup plan would ever replace that .
It makes no sense .
Live Free or Die Hard uses virtually every single hated computer cliche in the book .
Hacking is done by vigorous typing and you can pretty much tell how hard one is hacking by how fast and hard he is punching the keys .
No one ever uses a mouse , or the space bar for anything .
Tracing the source of a video chat takes the same amount of time as tracing a phone call , and you must stall the person on the other side of the line making small talk .
I mean , I ’d just take the IP number and look it up in the whois database to get the address of the registrant but apparently it is a much more complex procedure that displays a big red “ ROUTER DENIED ” warning whenever you fail to trace the source properly .
It takes exactly 4 key strokes to pull up any information .
It goes like this : a bad guy says “ locate McClains daughter ! ” .
A dude sitting at a computer terminal goes tap , tap , tap , TAP ( you know , the last tap must be like emphasized ) and goes “ She is stuck in an elevator between 4th and 5th floor in the such and such building on the 34th street ” .
Then of course they pull up the elevator cam feed to look at her with exactly 4 more keyboard strokes .
Justin Long on the other hand manages to reprogram his cell phone to use the super secret satellite network in exactly 4 keyboard strokes .
It ’s amazing really !
If you plan to watch this movie make sure you keep Clarkes ’ third law firmly in mind .
In Live Free or Die Hard technology is indistinguishable from magic .
Hackers are wizards with unlimited power who can do anything the plot is calling for at the moment : reroute the gas mains , shut down the electrical grid , change stock prices , take over your GPS system , hack into your hamster and turn it into a time bomb ( ok , I made this last one up ) – you name it .
They can shut down the country and bring about the end of civilization and the only person who can stop them is a grizzled , cynical cop who does n’t know much about computers but can kick serious ass .
I find it funny how all the evil hackers are smart , educated , and well dressed .
They all use big words , they enunciate and act professional at all times .
You know , highly educated and well spoken people are all evil elitist bastards with their science , and their logic and etc .
The good hackers on the other hand are lovable geeks – clumsy , oafish and mumbling cryptic stuff to themselves all the time .
They might be smart , but the writers take special care to show that they would never survive without the big , bad McClain holding their hand and wiping their noses all the time .
Both of these portrayals personally offend me as a programmer and IT professional but hell , what do I know .
I understand that no one in Hollywood hires technology consultants anymore – and if they do , they probably fired them on the first day when they start crossing out all the awesome hacker stuff from the script and replace it with boring stuff .
I get it .
I am not their target audience and I guess someone with less technical knowledge than me could overlook all the flaws I listed above .
But the badness of the movie extends way beyond that .
It is simply way over the top .
You ’d think that the 3 previous die hard movies were over the top but they are nothing compared to this installment .
It seems that there is some sort of pissing contest going on in Hollywood to see who can make a movie with more outrageous stunts .
This trend peeked and culminated in the proverbial Nuking of the Fridge in Indiana Jones 4 .
Die Hard 4 is a clear runner up in the same league though .
McClain destroys a helicopter by driving over a fire hydrant , blows up another driving a car up a makeshift ramp into it , outmaneuvers and destroys a Harrier jet while driving a tractor trailer .
Of course before he destroys the jet he jumps on top of it , and manages to stand upright on one of the wings while the plane spins out of control .
I mean , WTF is this ?
Jet surfing ?
This sort of thing has to stop .
The fact that CGI is dirt cheep these days does n’t mean you have to use so much of it .
The fact that you have a big budget does not mean you need to blow it all on explosions , crashes and outrageous stunts .
The original Die Hard while still stunt / special effect heavy was much more low key .
McClain had to use stealth and cunning to survive and dispatch the bad guys .
The proportions between realism and ass - kicking action were maintained at a level where the viewer was kept on edge of his seat most of the time .
There was just enough realism to allow the viewer to suspend his disbelief , and just enough of unrealistic stunts to make things exciting .
In Live Free or Die Hard reality goes out the window as soon as the hero blows up the n’th helicopter , falls down from a 10 story building , dusts himself off and then tries to surf on top of a military jet plane while the pilot ejects from the cabin .
You ca n’t build tension when your character pulls off crazy reality defying stunts every 5 minutes .
You ca n’t escalate the special effects indefinitely and expect viewers to go ooh and ahh after each explosion .
The more stunts you have in your movie , the less impressive they become .
This is exactly what was happening to the James Bond franchise – they kept escalating the special effects , and adding crazier and crazier stunts with each new installment and at some point people just started yawning and leaving theaters in droves .
Then Bond was reinvented anew .
Instead of having him jumping over a helicopter on a motorcycle they made him do some Parkour .
Instead of an elaborate trap involving sharks with lasers attached to their heads , they used a bottomless chair and a piece of rope with a big knot on the end ( and holly shit , that torture scene made me cringe ) .
Lo and behold they scored a huge blockbuster success .
I thought that Hollywood got the message after that one .
But it is clear that they did n’t since we have movies such as Live Free or Die Hard or Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of Crystal Suck still coming out these days .
I can’t really say anything about Bruce Willis ’ performance because any respect I might have had for his character was instantly destroyed when he started doing the condescending “ I do n’t know about computers so why do n’t you say that in English you pathetic nerd ” routine every time Justin Long said something .
Most of the signature Die Hard attitude and bravado was drowned out by the outrageous action sequences , and the pointless and tedious banter with Long .
Long pretty much plays the same annoying character he portrays in the Apple commercials – a smug know it all with some of the least favorable geek stereotypes .
For example he delivers a rambling rant about how “ the man ” is controlling the media , makes inappropriate star wars references or uses nonsensical technobabble around McClain knowing full well he is a computer illiterate idiot .
Bottom line is that the movie is absolutely horrible .
It is incoherent , inconsistent , badly written and nukes the fridge on average every 5 minutes .
Plot is nonsensical , and the stunts become more and more far fetched up to the point where all suspense is gone and you ca n’t help but yawn once you get to the part when Willis is running on top of a flying harrier jet mid flight .
Avoid at all costs !
Also , I propose a new rule : Hollywood is no longer allowed to make movies that feature hackers , hacking or cyber terrorism .
We will all be better off if they stick to old fashioned lo -fi terrorism which most people can understand and comprehend .

PORT -AU - PRINCE , Haiti —
Ten Americans who tried to take 33 Haitian children out of the country last week without the government ’s consent have been charged with child abduction and criminal conspiracy , as Haitian officials sought to reassert judicial control after the Jan. 12 earthquake .
The Americans , most of them members of a Baptist congregation from Idaho , had said they intended to rescue Haitian children left parentless in the quake and take them to what they described as an orphanage across the border in the Dominican Republic .
But they acknowledged failing to seek approval to remove the children from Haiti , and several of the children have at least one living parent .
The Americans will face a potentially extended legal proceeding in Haiti and could , if convicted , face prison terms of up to 15 years .
In a sign of the cloudy nature of the case , the prosecutor , Mazar Fortil , decided not to pursue what could have been the most serious charge against the group , that of trafficking .
The charges will now be considered by an investigative judge , who has up to three months to decide whether to pursue the matter further .
FORGET what your parents told you : money does grow on trees .
Well , at least for the street photographers who work the crowds around the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree , it does .
With digital cameras and ink - jet printers powered by car batteries , they churn out images at about $ 10 a pop .
Arrivistes , as far as Louis Mendes is concerned .
Where is the skill in setting a camera to “ automatic ” and pushing a button ?
Where is the permanence in a shot printed with no - name ink on no -name paper ?
Where is the craft ?
In his hands .
Mr. Mendes works the same crowds  and parades , graduations and concerts  cradling like a piece of sculpture a vintage Speed Graphic camera outfitted with two flash units and a Polaroid back .
That ’s right , instant film , a phrase that sounds almost as dated as “ electric typewriter . ”
In an age when digital photography offers instant gratification and cameras come in most phones , who would have thought a decent living could be had taking pictures with a vanishing technology ?
JERUSALEM — Highway 443 is about 15.5 miles long , nine miles of which run through the West Bank — Palestinian territory .
An estimated 40,000 cars ply the highway daily , all of them Israeli .
A year and a half ago , Nabil Mohammad Alkawi , 36 , brought a white truck filled with chocolate to the edge of the village of Beit Sira , alongside the highway .
On what used to be an on - ramp , today there is a sprawling parking lot .
At night , the lot fills with Alkawi ’s customers — workers who arrive as early as 2:30 a.m. to trudge across the nearby Modi ’in checkpoint into Israel .
Alkawi can run a snack truck on this former onramp because for the last eight years , Highway 443 , the main artery to Ramallah , Jerusalem and the city of Modi’in , has been closed to Palestinian traffic .
The army closed the road after six Israelis died from terrorist attacks on Highway 443 in the first two years of the Second Intifada .
The Beit Sira ramp was blocked with giant boulders ; other villages in the area are similarly closed off with three - foot high concrete blocks , metal gates or garbage .
Now , an Israeli High Court of Justice has ordered that the Israeli army open the road to Palestinians within five months .
“ Despite understanding the security needs , security means like these , which create complete separation between different populations on the roads and which prevent an entire population from using the road , engender a sense of inequality , ” wrote Chief Justice Dorit Beinisch in a concurring opinion in late December .
The Association for Civil Rights in Israel brought the case in 2007 on behalf of Beit Sira and five other villages cut off from the road .
Melanie Takefman , a spokeswomen for ACRI , hailed the decision :
“ The closure of the road has only done harm to the local population and has not increased security , ” Takefman said , adding that she hopes the ruling will set a precedent for an additional 37 miles of roads closed to Palestinian traffic .
Attorney Nitzana Darshan - Leitner lives in Hashmonaim , a settlement of 2,600 just over the Green Line .
She represented 120 drivers from the area in the court case , and she said she rides Highway 443 every day .
“ We do n’t have any intention to infringe on the rights of the Palestinians , but we ca n’t stand by when we see Jewish blood is being spilled , ” said Darshan - Leitner .
“ And there is a solution .
The IDF is asking to use it , and the court is n’t letting them . ”
Highway 443 originally wound through the centers of the nearby villages and connected the West Bank to Gaza .
In the late 1980s , when Palestinian villagers stoned Israeli cars , Israel expropriated Palestinian land to reroute the road away from the villages .
The Palestinians appealed the rerouting to the High Court , but the army convinced the court that the road was for the benefit of the local population .
The new Highway 443 became a central thoroughfare for Israel , connecting Tel Aviv to Jerusalem while avoiding the frequent traffic jams of the other artery , Highway 1 .
This week , the Israeli Ministry of Transportation warned that opening Highway 443 to Palestinians could mean an overload on Road 1 .
When the Second Intifada broke out , Highway 443 became the backdrop for gory drive - by shootings , stonings , Molotov cocktails and car bombs .
One victim was Ronen Landau , 17 , who was shot in the liver as his father drove him from downtown Jerusalem to their home in the Givat Zeev settlement on a balmy July evening in 2001 .
The army banned all Palestinians from the road the following year .
Modi ’in spokesman Elad Shimonovich said that ban was direly needed .
“ At night the road was nearly empty , and people had to use Highway 1 , ” said Shimonovich .
As a 75,000 - resident bedroom community , Modi ’in relies on Highway 443 to connect to jobs in the nation ’s capital .
Following the ruling , right - wing Knesset members announced they would propose legislation to annex Highway 443 to bypass the ruling .
Palestinian urban planner Rami Nasrallah , who works in Jerusalem and Ramallah , said the closed road created two parallel transport networks .
“ One is fast , for settlers , ” Nasrallah said , while the other “ goes through the center of the villages , and it makes it impossible to guarantee access between towns and villages in the West Bank . ”
Reopening the road will re-link West Bank villages to Ramallah ; however , Jerusalem remains off - limits to Palestinians without residency permits in the capital .
In the weeks running up to the court decision , ACRI and the Israeli human rights organization B’Tselem mounted a public awareness campaign using an online computer game called “ How democratic are we ? ”
Players decide whether to build the road and whether to block Palestinians from driving on it .
“ It ’s a weird situation , ” said Nasrallah , who works in Ramallah and Jerusalem .
“ The whole area of the West Bank is supposed to be under the Palestinian Authority …
The question is how this will be used when there is a Palestinian state . ”

Google ist längst viel mehr als eine Suchmaschine .
Wir surfen mit Google Chrome im Netz , navigieren mit Google Maps von A nach B und schauen witzige Katzenvideos auf YouTube .
Doch nicht alles , was der Konzern aus Mountain View anfasst , wird zu Gold .
Zudem begleitet das Unternehmen immer wieder Kritik von Datenschützern .
Aktuelle News zu Google und Google - Produkten ...

Als Google 1998 das Licht der
Welt erblickte war nicht absehbar , dass sich die gleichnamige Suchmaschine innerhalb weniger Jahre zum wichtigsten Internetunternehmen entwickeln wird .
Tatsächlich hat sich in den vergangen Jahren nur wenig am optischen Erscheinungsbild von Google geändert , wohl aber die Technologien die ringsum entwickelt wurden .
Es gibt nahezu keinen Bereich , in dem Google oder eine seiner Tochterfirmen nicht aktiv sind .
Google vs. Alphabet
Wenn wir von Google als Unternehmen sprechen , meinen wir in der Regel nicht Google , sondern Alphabet .
Die Aktiensgesellschaft wurde 2015 gegründet , um den Konzern neu zu strukturieren .
Google und seine Dienste sind nun eine Tochtergesellschaft von Alphabet , ebenso wie andere Unternehmen des Konzerns .
So gehört beispielsweise zu Alphabet auch die Biotechnologie - Firma Calico , die daran forscht , die menschliche Alterung zu stoppen .
Google - Dienste im Überblick
Google begann als reine Suchmaschine , inzwischen bietet der Konzern aber eine Reihe von zumeist kostenlosen Services an .
Zu den populärsten Google - Diensten zählen neben der Suchmaschine die Navigationssoftware Google Maps und der Freemailer Gmail .
Nachfolgend findet ihr eine Übersicht der von netzwelt getesteten kostenlos nutzbaren Google - Dienste :
Oftmals fragen sich Nutzer , warum Google eine so breite Masse an kostenlosen Services anbietet .
Zumal diese Dienste auf den ersten Blick nichts mit dem eigentlichen Kerngeschäft der Suche zu tun haben .
Dies ist jedoch ein Trugschluss .
Denn Google sammelt über diese Dienste viele Daten , die helfen , die Suche zu verbessern oder Nutzer besser zu verstehen .
Schließlich ist Google mit Google Ads auch im Werbegeschäft aktiv .
Bis 2017 scannte das Unternehmen beispielsweise die eingehende Mails in eurem Gmail - Postfach , um basierend auf diesen passende Werbeanzeigen anzuzeigen .
Inzwischen hat Google diese Praxis beendet und richtet sich bei der Auswahl von Werbeanzeigen nach den in eurem Google - Konto angegeben Interessen .
Wegen solcher und ähnlicher Aktivitäten steht Google häufiger in der Kritik .
Das Unternehmen gilt bei Datenschützern als nimmersatte Datenkrake .
Die Google - Gründer Larry Page und Sergej Brin ahnten wohl bereits früh , dass die vielfältigen Aktivitäten ihres Konzern Nutzern Angst machen könnten .
Lange Zeit galt daher die Phrase " Do n't be evil " , zu deutsch : " Sei nicht böse " als Motto des Unternehmens .
Inzwischen wurde der Leitspruch jedoch gestrichen .
Einige Dienste baute Google in der Vergangenheit auch auf , um Konkurrenten zu schwächen .
So ist Google Docs beispielsweise als Angriff auf Microsoft Office 365 zu verstehen .
Google versucht seit Längerem mit seinen Chromebooks die Vorherrschaft von Microsofts Windows 10 zu brechen .
Auch Facebook sowie der Messenger WhatsApp sind Google ein Dorn im Auge .
Bislang schlugen jedoch Versuche , diese durch eigene Produkte zu ersetzen fehl .
Das Soziale Netzwerk Google + und der Messenger Google
Allo wurden beispielsweise 2019 eingestellt und sind die jüngsten Beispiele dafür , dass nicht jedes Google - Projekt erfolgreich ist .
Android
Ein gigantischer Erfolg ist dagegen das von Google entwickelte freie Handy - OS Android .
Fast 90 Prozent aller Smartphones weltweit laufen mit der Software .
Zum Erfolg beigetragen haben dürfte dabei vor allem die Tatsache , dass es Google gelang ein umfangreiches Ökosystem rund um das Handy - OS zu etablieren .
Im Mittelpunkt steht dabei der App Store Google Play ( ehemals Android Market ) , in dem es heute ähnlich viele Anwendungen gibt , wie beim Apple - Gegenstück .
Android vs. iOS : Handy - Betriebssysteme im Vergleich Welches System passt besser zu euch ?
Android kommt mittlerweile nicht mehr auf Handys zum Einsatz , sondern findet sich auch auf Tablet - PCs , Smartwatches ( hier heißt es WearOS ) , Fernsehern ( Android TV ) und Set - Top - Boxen .
Google - Software
Android ist nicht die einzige erfolgreiche Software des Herstellers aus Mountain View .
Der Browser Chrome gilt inzwischen als Quasi -Standard zum Surfen im Netz , das darauf basierende Notebook - Betriebssystem Chrome OS ist dagegen noch eher gering verbreitet .
Populär ist hingegen der Sprachassistent Google Assistant .
Made by Google : das Hardwaregeschäft
Doch nicht nur Software bietet Google an , auch im Hardware - Geschäft ist der Hersteller aktiv und hat seine Expertise hier in den letzten Jahren durch Zukäufe erweitert .
So übernahm Google unter anderem den Smart Home - Hersteller Nest ( 2014 ) , den Handy - Pioneer Motorola ( 2015 ) , große Teile der Handy - Entwicklung von HTC ( 2018 ) und zuletzt Fitbit ( 2019 ) .
Aktuell bietet Google folgende Produkte in Deutschland an :
Google Pixel : die neue Smartphone - Reihe
Mit der Google Pixel - Serie ( ehemals Google Nexus ) bietet der Hersteller eigene Android - Smartphones an .
Sie zeichnen sich durch lange Software - Updates und eine stärkere Verknüpfung von Hard - und Software aus .
Das aktuelle Top - Modell hört auf den Namen Google Pixel 4 ( XL ) , zudem verkauft Google hierzulande auch noch den Vorgänger Google Pixel 3 ( XL ) sowie die Mittelklasse - Smartphones Pixel 3a ( XL ) .
Google Nest - alles fürs Smart Home
Unter der Marke Google Nest ( ehemals Google Home ) bietet der Hersteller hierzulande smarte Lautsprecher , WLAN - Router sowie allerlei Smart Home - Zubehör an .
Folgende Modelle haben wir aus dem Portfolio bereits für euch getestet :
Google Chromecast : Der etwas andere Streaming - Stick
Wollt ihr Inhalte vom Handy auf den Fernseher bringen , hilft euch Google Chromecast dabei .
Die Besonderheit : Der Streaming - Stick besitzt keine eigene Nutzeroberfläche , sondern wird komplett per Handy - App gesteuert .
Folgende Chromecast - Modelle könnt ihr hierzulande kaufen :
Mit Google streamen : YouTube , Stadia und Co .
Apropos Streaming - dies ist auch ein Bereich , in dem Google zunehmend versucht Fuß zu fassen .
Aktuell sorgt etwa der Gaming - Streaming - Dienst Google Stadia für Aufsehen .
Weniger erfolgreich sind dagegen die Musik - Streaming - Dienste Google Play Music und YouTube Music .
Im Bereich Video - Streaming ist Google vor allem mit der bereits 2006 übernommenen Video - Plattform YouTube aktiv .

The supposed news that the Himalayan glaciers are not , in fact , retreating has given climate - change skeptics yet another weapon with which to impugn an entire body of important science .
What the sensationalist media coverage has missed , however , is that , while many Himalayan glaciers have all but stopped retreating , the vast majority are still shrinking .

Gross injustices were done at Guantanamo Bay to the men rounded up in Afghanistan and beyond , usually because they happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time while America was looking for vengeance and warlords were looking for easy bounties .
Yet the guards who had to enforce often cruel imprisonment at Guantanamo had to wrestle with their consciences everyday .
One such ex-Marine has now come to terms with this .
This is really beautiful ; it does n't feel " artsy , " not at all .
Her dark legs and the nature all around convey an " earthiness , " and the sunlight which I assume was probably a bit overpowering gives the subject and her pose exactly the right softness .

Updated Chopper globocorp
Sikorsky has suffered technical hitches in development of its potentially revolutionary ( cough ) X2 multicopter , which is intended to administer a stinging technical bitchslap to the famous V - 22 " Osprey " tiltrotor from rival firm Boeing .
Let 's get this spin machine off the ground .
Flight International reports that a gearbox problem was detected during ground tests in December , just before the triplex whirlybird was due to take off for a flight test at 150 knots .
The X2 , which first flew with all its capabilities installed last July , is gradually working its way up to the full design speed of 250 knots - much faster than a normal copter , and noticeably better than the Osprey .
Apparently the gearbox snag has now been sorted out , but some lower - speed flights will now have to be repeated .
However Sikorsky test pilot Kevin Bredenbeck told Flight that he expects to hit 250 knots " by the end of the year " .
The X2 works by the use of two main rotor sets spinning in opposite directions .
This avoids one of the problems suffered by ordinary helicopters attempting to go fast , the issue of " retreating blade stall " - where the backwards - going blade briefly becomes almost stationary with respect to the air it cleaves owing to the aircraft 's forward speed , so losing lift on one side of the rotor disc .
An X2 or other stacked - rotor copter has forwardgoing blades on both sides , however .
That 's just one of the snags to be solved , though .
As the retreating blade slows , so the forward - going blade tips tend to go supersonic as the helicopter accelerates .
In general this is hard to deal with , as most choppers spin their rotors at a fixed rpm .
But the X2 has variable speed equipment , allowing it to slow the blades ' spin as it speeds up and so keep the blade tips safely subsonic .
It also has modern superstiff low - drag rotors and active damping tech , which Sikorsky hope will quell the violent vibration which bedevilled previous efforts along these lines .
As the twin main rotors counteract each other 's torque , an X2 needs no side - thruster on its tail for steering .
This means that it can put a forward - driving propeller there instead , to provide the extra thrust necessary to reach high speeds .
A previous attempt at an X2 - like aircraft , the XH - 59A demonstrator , used extra strap - on jet engines instead : but these made the XH - 59 overly heavy and complex , and a fuel hog besides .
Sikorsky believe that their tail prop driven from the X2's single turbine is the way forward - smaller X2 craft of the future could also be single - engined and thus simpler and cheaper to operate than tiltrotors .
So far the machine has flown at only 106 knots , however , a speed which even crummy old normal ' copters can surpass .
However , according to Bredenbeck , the active - vibe - damping kit has n't even been needed yet , which should indicate plenty of room left in the X2's flight envelope .
Meanwhile the Osprey has finally entered frontline service with the US Marines after a long and painful gestation .
Initial operations in Iraq 's Anbar province were unconvincing to the tiltrotor 's critics , as Anbar had pretty much calmed down by the time it arrived .
However the Osprey is now in the thick of serious fighting in Afghanistan , reportedly without any particular problems .
Barring any further tech hiccups , this year should see which is to be victor in the souped - up rotorcraft stakes : tiltrotor or triplex multicopter . ®
Update
We had thought that the Osprey could only go at 240 knots , or 230 in the case of the spec-ops version , based on the normally reliable Globalsecurity .org 's figures for the V - 22 .
However an Osprey pilot writes in to tell us that the tiltrotor , following software changes , can now do 270 knots in level flight - so even if the X2 performs to spec it will not be as fast as a V - 22 .
Sikorsky would no doubt still defend their idea on grounds of reduced complexity and potential to be single - engined rather than twin .
They would also , perhaps , point out the Osprey 's apparent tendency to melt and buckle the flight decks of US warships with its hot exhausts , which is n't an issue with the X2 .
But it does n't seem especially likely that the X2 will snatch away the V - 22's speed crown .

In 1922 , Margaret Sanger wrotewith an introduction by eugenicist H. G. Wells .
The Rockefeller Foundation " enthusiastically supported the concept of ' eugenics , ' which encourages the reproductive efforts of those deemed to have ' good ' genes , while discouraging or stopping procreation by undesirables .
But Rockefeller and others were anxious to go even further to mold America 's breeding patterns along evolutionary lines . " [ 1 ]
John D. Rockefeller Jr. , per the advice of Raymond B. Fosdick , provided financial backing for Margaret Sanger 's Planned Parenthood movement . [ 2 ]
Sanger , a feminist and birth control activist established the first family planning clinics in New York City .
Several U.S. foundations financed eugenic research , including the Carnegie Institution , which funded Davenport 's eugenic studies at Cold Spring Harbor , and the Rockefeller Foundation , which gave grants in the 1930s for eugenic research at the Galton Laboratory at University College in London and to the Cornell Medical School in New York . [ 3 ]
Advocates for population control and the study of eugenics include Theodore Roosevelt , Charles Wilson , president of Harvard and Irving Fisher , president of Yale and president of the Eugenics Research Association in the 1920s plus a host of other very public vocal figures . [ 4 ]
President Theodore Roosevelt appointed Oliver Wendell Holmes , Jr. to the U.S. Supreme Court where he served from 1902 to 1932 .
Holmes was an advocate for selective breeding and issued the sterilization verdict in the case of Carrie Buck in 1927 .
He said , " It is better for all the world , if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime or to let them starve for their imbecility , society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind .
The principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting Fallopian tubes .
Three generations of imbeciles are enough . " [ 5 ]
Sir Frederick Pollock , a Pilgrims Society member and law professor at Oxford , was the editor offrom 1885 to 1919 .
He was in close communication with Harvard - educated Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. during a sixty - year period of time .
Researcher Charles Savoie maintains that the Pilgrims Society was closely connected to America 's Supreme Court for more than a century . [ 6 ]
The Rockefeller Foundation financed what is known as Psychiatric Genetics , a new specialty .
The Foundation restructured medical training in Germany including managing the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Psychiatry and the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Anthropology , Eugenics and Human Heredity under the direction of Swiss psychiatrist Ernst Rudin , supported by his trusty protégés , Otmar Verschuer and Dr. Franz J. Kallmann .
In 1932 , the British eugenics ' movement appointed Dr. Rudin as president of the worldwide Eugenics Federation .
The eugenics movement promoted the killing or sterilization of burdensome people , individuals that Henry Kissinger referred to as " useless eaters . " [ 7 ]
Rockefeller funded the Kaiser Wilhelm Eugenics Institute in Germany , founded in 1927 .
The Bush family joined John D. Rockefeller and the British Royal Family in sponsoring the eugenics initiatives that gave rise to Hitler 's racial hygiene programs .
Prescott Bush was later found guilty of trading with the Nazis during WWII .
According to court records , the Rockefeller family and their Standard Oil Company supported Hitler more than they did the allies during the war .
In fact , one judge declared Rockefeller guilty of treason .
Dr. Gary Glum documented the insidious eugenics programs to create a " superior race , " which were initially sponsored not by Adolph Hitler , but by the American elite like the Rockefeller , Carnegie , Harriman , Morgan , DuPont , Kellogg and Bush families . [ 8 ]
Hitler , who had been financed by international bankers , became Chancellor of the Third Reich on January 30 , 1933 .
Wilhelm Frick , the minister of the interior , introduced the early sterilization law which was enacted within six months after Hitler was appointed chancellor .
Sterilization was used for " life unworthy of life . "
Certain individuals who reportedly warranted serialization included those with : " congenital feeblemindedness ( now called mental deficiency ) , an estimated 200,000 ; manic depressive insanity , 20,000 ; schizophrenia , 80,000 ; epilepsy , 60,000 ; Huntington 's chorea ( a hereditary brain disorder ) , 600 ; hereditary blindness , 4,000 ; hereditary deafness , 16,000 ; grave bodily malformation , 20,000 ; and hereditary alcoholism , 10,000 .
The projected total of 410,000 was considered only preliminary , drawn mostly from people already in institutions ; it was assumed that much greater numbers of people would eventually be identified and sterilized . " [ 9 ]
After the Nazis took power , I.G. Farben and Rockefeller 's Standard Oil merged into a single entity which contained beneficial provisions for each company .
I.G. Farben was , until 1937 , controlled by the Warburg family who had collaborated with Rockefeller in crafting Nazi eugenics .
Standard Oil maintained their alliance with I.G. Farben even after the U.S. entered the war .
In 1940 - 41 , I.G. Farben constructed a large industrial complex in Poland adjacent the Auschwitz concentration camp where they planned to use slave labor to make gasoline from coal .
Standard - Germany president Emil Helfferich admitted that Standard Oil financed part of the operations at Auschwitz . [ 10 ]
In the fall of 1941 , Secretary of War Henry Stimson contacted Dr. Frank B. Jewett , president of the National Academy of Sciences , to discuss the further development of biological warfare .
This was prior to America 's entry into World War II , but according to his diary Secretary Stimson was well aware of imminent events .
Shortly afterwards , President Roosevelt authorized Stimson to create a civilian agency to supervise biological warfare under the jurisdiction of the Federal Security Agency .
George Merck , owner of Merck Pharmaceutical and close adviser to Roosevelt , was appointed director of the new War Research Service . [ 11 ]
Frank McDougall participated in the area of public health within the old League of Nations .
He made the connection between community health , nutrition , and agricultural development and economic policy .
The U.N. , in a conference in Hot Springs between October 16 and November 1 , 1945 , formulated the U.N. Interim Commission on Food and Agriculture .
Officials drafted the constitution of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) .
McDougall was a chief architect and promoter of the organization . [ 12 ]
The Bureau of Human Heredity relocated from London to Copenhagen in 1947 where they moved into a newly constructed building paid for by the Rockefeller Foundation .
The initial International Congress in Human Genetics after World War II was convened in Copenhagen in 1956 .
Verschuer , Rudin 's protégé , was by then a member of the American Eugenics Society , synonymous with Rockefeller 's Population Council .
Dr. Kallmann , a director , also organized the American Society of Human Genetics which directed the Human Genome Project .
Later , the Rockefellers relocated the U.S. eugenics movement to their family offices where they also controlled future population control and abortion advocacy groups .
The Eugenics Society later became the Society for the Study of Social Biology . [ 13 ]
U.S. State Department Policy Planning Study # 23 , 1948 , headed by George F. Kennan , concluded , " We have about 50 percent of the world 's wealth , but only 6.3 % of its population .
In this situation , we cannot fail to be the object of envy and resentment .
Our real task is to devise a pattern of relationships which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity without positive detriment to our national security .
To do so we will have to dispense with all sentimentality and daydreaming and our attention will have to be concentrated everywhere on our immediate national objectives .
We need not deceive ourselves that we can afford today the luxury of altruism and world benefaction .
We should cease to talk about vague and unreal objectives such as human rights , the raising of the living standards and democratization .
The day is not far off when we are going to have to deal in straight power concepts .
The less we are then hampered by idealistic slogans , the better . " [ 14 ]
John Foster Dulles , then chairman of the Rockefeller Foundation , concluded after observations acquired on a number of tours abroad that there was a " need to stop the expansion of the non-white populations . "
In 1952 , Frederick Osborn , an officer of the American Eugenics Society , assisted John D. Rockefeller III in organizing the Population Council and served as its first administrator .
In 1958 , Eisenhower selected William H. Draper to head a committee to evaluate appropriate military actions in other countries .
Draper suggested that a better focus should be the threat of population explosion and a study on depopulation procedures for poorer non-white countries that pose a national security threat to the U.S. [ 15 ]
Apparently , a burgeoning non-white population might reduce available resources that would be put to better use by white populations .
Additionally , growing populations produce resentful individuals who aggressively oppose elitist policies .
In 1965 , the Population Action International ( originally known as the Population Crisis Committee ) , was founded by Hugh Moore , Lammot du Pont Copeland and William H. Draper Jr. The worldwide organization is headquartered in Washington , DC .
Since 2001 , in conjunction with the Population Action International , and with the encouragement of Congress , the U.S. Agency for International Development ( USAID ) distributes information in foreign countries in an effort to initiate family planning and cover other reproductive health programs .
In 1961 , John D. Rockefeller III presented the Second McDougall Lecture to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization .
This predated by a decade Rockefeller 's population protocols that would become part of Kissinger's .
Rockefeller , in his address , said , " To my mind , population growth is second only to control of atomic weapons as the paramount problem of the day . " [ 16 ]
The Rockefeller Foundation funded England 's eugenics movement .
The Rockefeller family had early ties to the House of Rothschild to which the gigantic Standard oil trust owed its beginnings .
Presumably , the Rothschilds , a Talmudic family with early Masonic and Illuminati connections , actively promoted and financed eugenics and depopulation behind the scenes .
By the 1960s , the Eugenics Society of England embraced Crypto- eugenics , under which they would participate in eugenics without actually calling it eugenics .
The Rockefellers lent their support to England 's Eugenics Society by establishing the International Planned Parenthood Federation , in conjunction with the Eugenics Society .
This formed a private , global system in which the elite could choreograph an international holocaust , within the context of offering humanitarian services , all under the jurisdiction of the U.N. flag , another Rockefeller front organization . [ 17 ]
George H. W. Bush of Texas , who served in Congress from January 3 , 1967 to January 3 , 1971 , originated a legislative investigation of world overpopulation . [ 18 ]
Dr. D. M. MacArthur , Deputy Director of Research & Technology for the Pentagon , Department of Defense , requested $ 10 million from the Congressional House Subcommittee on Appropriations to develop a biological weapon through House Bill 15090 .
On June 9 , 1969 , the House Republican research task committee , chaired by George H. W. Bush , heard testimony from General William H. Draper , of the Population Crisis Committee and Dr. William Moran of the Population Reference Bureau .
Draper reported that there were three issues relevant to population control  the census of 1970 in the U.S. and of 1971 in Britain should be worldwide and not limited to two countries , accelerating contraception , and the World Health Organization should implement their international programs such as inoculations , etc . [ 19 ]
Leading World Health Organization scientists , as noted in thehad requested that viruses be created in order to study their affects on humans .
The Department of Defense , now funded with $ 10 million , intended to conduct studies on immune - system - destroying agents for biological warfare .
In 1983 Dr. Robert Strecker , an internist and gastro - enterologist who is also a trained pathologist with a Ph.D. in pharmacology , producedwherein he claims that the AIDS virus is man-made .
Working in conjunction with his brother , attorney Ted Strecker , they discovered thousands of documents verifying the man-made origin of AIDS .
Strecker maintains that it was virologically impossible for HIV to have emanated from monkeys ; the disease was unknown in Africa before 1975 .
Strecker claims that the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , funded by the Department of Defense , initiated testing on a lymphotrophic virus , a bovine virus that could also infect humans .
In 1977 , the WHO instigated a massive campaign in Africa to eradicate smallpox among the urban population .
Over 100 million Africans were deliberately inoculated with AIDS - contaminated smallpox vaccine .
In 1978 , over 2,000 white male homosexuals were inoculated against hepatitis B by the Centers for Disease Control and the New York Blood Center , also with AIDS - contaminated vaccine . [ 20 ]
Merck , Sharp and Dohme ( MSD ) funded the hepatitis B vaccine research that Dr. Strecker claimed spread HIV to homosexuals in the U.S. [ 21 ]
These kinds of weapons were apparently a viable concern immediately after 9/11 as John Bolton gave an address at the Biological Weapons Convention on November 19 , 2001 in Geneva , Switzerland , stating our concerns about " terrorists " using biological and chemical weapons . [ 22 ]
We have trained many foreigners in the use of biological and chemical weapons at Fort McClellan , Alabama .
Kissinger received the Nobel Peace Prize after he directed the dispersion of tons of Monsanto 's toxic Agent Orange in Vietnam .
This chemical , containing dioxin , continues to negatively affect Vietnamese citizens and former U.S. military personnel and their children with horrendous birth defects and neurological disorders .
Conversely , Ali Hassan al - Majid , who dispersed chemicals in Halabja , was recently executed for the same activities .
Kissinger orchestrated the precedent - setting secret bombing of neutral Cambodia over a four - year period , allegedly to protect Americans in Vietnam .
From 1970 onward , Congress had prohibited bombing in Cambodia in every military appropriations bill except for that open - ended purpose  protecting U.S. citizens  but apparently not from Agent Orange . [ 23 ]
According tomagazine of April 19 , 1976 , " Since the Communist victory last year , an estimated 500,000 to 600,000 people , one - tenth of Cambodia 's population , have died from political reprisals , disease or starvation . . .
To escape the bloodbath ; at least 25,000 Cambodians have fled across the border into Thailand .
They tell tales of people being clubbed to death to save ammunition .
Others have been bound together and buried alive by bulldozers , or suffocated by having plastic bags tied over their heads . " [ 24 ]
Generating further resentment , the U.S. installed Lon Nol , who collected millions of dollars in U.S. economic aid .
He declared himself Chief of State , Prime Minister and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces after he disbanded the Assembly in October 1971 in order to declare emergency rule .
He then permitted the U.S. to carpet bomb Cambodia . [ 25 ]
Lon Nol retired to Hawaii on April 1 , 1975 with half a million dollars , compliments of the U.S. taxpayers . [ 26 ]
Pol Pot 's Khmer Rouge with its killing fields , the essential liquidation of the middle class , famine , the destruction of the economy and concentration camps followed America 's activities in the area .
From Kissinger 's Indochina bio warfare experiments , President Richard Nixon commissioned Kissinger to direct the compilation of a National Security Council population policy .
The work was completed during President Gerald Ford 's administration .
Their efforts resulted indated December 10 , 1974 .
It was officially adopted as U.S. policy on November 26 , 1975 , with Memorandum 314 by President Ford .
It is still in effect , as it has never been rescinded .
Each succeeding administration implements the population policies using its own methodology .
Thewas declassified on February 8 , 2007 .
Population control serves the U.S. strategic , economic , and military interests at the expense of the developing Third World or Lesser Developed Countries ( LDCs ) .
The plan claims that their population growth is detrimental and a grave threat to U.S. national security in four ways : ( 1 ) large nations may gain political power ( 2 ) The U.S. and its allies need the strategic materials from those countries .
( 3 ) A high birth rate means more young people who are more likely than older people to challenge global power structures ( 4 ) Population growth in relatively disadvantaged countries jeopardizes U.S. investments . [ 27 ] has special implications for thirteen countries 
India , Brazil , Egypt , Nigeria , Indonesia , the Philippines , Bangladesh , Pakistan , Mexico , Thailand , Turkey , Ethiopia and Colombia .listed Brazil which , at that time , had a population of over 100 million which dominated the continent demographically .
By 2000 , the population projections totaled about 212 million people . [ 28 ]
That kind of population growth was unacceptable to the elite .
In 1975 , Kissinger traveled with Gerald Ford to Indonesia , where they met with the U.S. - backed and armed dictator Suharto , who oversaw the killing of millions during his 35 - year reign .
The day after Ford and Kissinger left , Indonesian forces invaded the independent territory of East Timor .
One - third of the territory 's population was exterminated during the subsequent 20 - year occupation , but this had little impact on continuing American and Western arms shipments to the regime in Jakarta .
Recently released documents establish that Suharto received a green light for the invasion from the U.S. President and Secretary of State .
Nixon and Kissinger , along with John Negroponte , a Kissinger aide and the officer in charge of Vietnam on the National Security Council , arranged a chaos - creating government coup in Cambodia in March 1970 .
Negroponte would later act as Ambassador to Iraq from 2004 to 2005 and as director of national intelligence from 2005 to 2007 .
On March 26 , 2001 , thereported , " While ambassador to Honduras from 1981 - 85 , Negroponte directed the secret arming of Nicaragua 's Contra rebels and is accused by human rights groups of overlooking  if not overseeing  a CIA - backed Honduran death squad during his tenure . "
The CIA had unlimited funds to assist the government in its depopulation efforts .
In concert with Oliver North , " He also helped orchestrate a secret deal , later known as Iran - Contra , to send arms through Honduras to help the Contras overthrow the Sandinista government . " [ 29 ]
Negroponte had charge of the US Embassy in Honduras when hundreds of Hondurans labeled as " subversives " were seized , raped , tortured and slaughtered by Battalion 316 , a Honduran intelligence unit trained , funded and supported by the Pentagon and the CIA .
Battalion 316 also participated in the CIA 's covert operations in Nicaragua . [ 30 ]
Negroponte was Deputy Secretary of State under Condoleezza Rice .
On October 2 , 1979 , Robert S. McNamara , president of the World Bank and former secretary of defense during the Vietnam War , in speaking to a group of international bankers said , " We can begin with the most critical problem of all , population growth , " concluding that , " Either the current birth rates must come down more quickly , or the death rates must go up ... There are , of course , many ways in which the death rates can go up .
In a thermonuclear age , we can accomplish it very quickly and decisively . "
It is a surprising statement in view of the crypto-eugenic position taken by the American Eugenics Society , a stand which McNamara , evidently a dedicated eugenicist , would have certainly been aware of .
It can only be assumed that he did not agree with the society 's stand , and was arrogant enough to ignore it . " [ 31 ]
McNamara and Maurice Strong , a Rockefeller operative and ecological agitator , organized the UN Earth Summit in Stockholm in 1972 . [ 32 ]
Theclaimed that Strong was the " Custodian of the Planet . "
Strong is indebted to George H. W. Bush who maneuvered Strong into the position of Secretary General of the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development , the Earth Summit , convened in Rio de Janeiro , which elevated global economic and environmental regulations . [ 33 ]
Strong thinks that people should be required to have a license in order to have a baby .
The Population Plan was initially implemented by Brent Scowcroft , a long - time Kissinger colleague and Vice - Chairman of Kissinger Associates and National Security Advisor under Ford from 1974 1977 and George H. W. Bush from 1989 1993 .
CIA Director George H. W. Bush ( November 1975 to January 1977 ) assisted Scowcroft who co-authoredwith George H. W. Bush .
In addition to the National Security Advisor , the Secretaries of the Departments of State , Treasury , Defense , and Agriculture are responsible for executing the population plan .
Each administration uses those agencies and determines its own strategy for depopulating the planet .
Scowcroft was President George W. Bush 's Chairman of the President 's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board from 2001 to 2005 and also assisted President Barrack Obama in selecting his national security team .
Scowcroft apparently facilitated Obama 's efforts to continue Bush 's warfare depopulating strategy in the Middle East .
In 1974 the United Nations convened the World Food Conference in Rome where they focused on two issues , as suggested by the U.S.
The first topic was worldwide population growth and food shortages .
The second agenda item was escalating food prices as a consequence of an allegedly decreasing world food supply .
Both oil and grain prices were increasing at about 300 to 400 percent annually .
A supposed food crisis coupled with America 's capacity as the world 's biggest food producer placed the U.S. government in charge of food and prices resulting in an alliance between grain traders and the U.S. government which lead to genetic tampering . [ 34 ]
The Reagan Administration accommodated Monsanto and other private companies who manufactured questionably safe food products designed for worldwide trade .
Genetically modified ( GMO ) products , with little or no testing , were introduced in the U.S. market .
Vice President George Herbert Walker Bush , former CIA Director , was the chief proponent within the Reagan Administration for this innovative field of genetically modified products . [ 35 ]
U.S. citizens were intentionally vulnerable , as GMO labeling had been forbidden by the FDA . [ 36 ]
Monsanto's expensive , elite Terminator seeds , fertile only for one planting , " in the hands of one or more governments intent on using food as a weapon , Terminator was a tool of biological warfare almost ' too good to believe . ' " [ 37 ]
Given that so many third world countries are managed according to Anglo - American eugenics interests , Terminator seeds provide ample opportunity for tyrants to stage famines .
During the 1960s and 1970s the indigenous non-white population of the U.S. , through the Indian Health Service of the Bureau of Indian Affairs , operated an methodical lost generation program against Native American women of childbearing age wherein they sterilized about forty - two percent of those living on reservations without informing them .
This was accomplished in conjunction with other medical procedures .
Allegedly , this program was terminated in 1976 after allegations were made and confirmed .
No officials lost their jobs or suffered judicial consequences as a result of implementing of participating in this program .
They were , after all , simply following government procedures as it pertained to domestic non-white populations . [ 38 ]
More recently , in the 1990s , the World Health Organization dispensed tetanus shots among women between the ages of fifteen and forty - five in Nicaragua , Mexico , the Philippines and some African countries .
Unknown to the women , the tetanus shots were laced with Chorionic Gonadotrophin or ( hCG ) , a natural hormone , which , when combined with tetanus toxoid , prevents a women from sustaining a pregnancy .
This program , to impose a state of permanent sterilization , was financed by the Rockefeller Foundation and began in 1972 .
Sterilization is incredibly appalling but it does not stop there .
The depopulation efforts , conducted by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Department of Defense , include more aggressive protocols .
The British military , whose tactics we have frequently adopted , first used biological warfare as early as 1385 when they tossed the remains of plague victims and diseased animal carcasses into their enemy 's towns .
In North America , Lord Jeffrey Amherst had his men distribute smallpox - laden blankets among the vulnerable Indian population in order to decimate their enemy without firing a bullet .
Amherst 's tactics created an epidemic among the Cherokees in 1783 which helped George Washington 's forces and ended the Cherokee 's resistance .
The Masonic - based Smithsonian Institution has acknowledged Amherst 's use of biological warfare , " During the bitter fighting in 1763 - 1764 General Jeffrey Amherst ordered that the Indians around Fort Pitt be infected with gifts of smallpox ( laden ) blankets .
The Indian uprising failed , and Fort Pitt was easily relieved after a smallpox epidemic broke out among the warriors besieging the fort . " [ 39 ]
The U.S. Army repeated Amherst 's biological warfare tactics by distributing smallpox - infected blankets to the Mandans at Fort Clark in present day South Dakota .
This led to the smallpox epidemic of 1836 - 40 .
The Mandan , out of about 2,400 there were only thirty - one survivors . [ 40 ]
The U.S. Army repeated this deadly tactic by introducing blankets laden with the same disease to the Missouri River Mandans during the 1830s .
Biological warfare became U.S. government policy after the British used it against France 's Indian allies during the French and Indian Wars ( 175463 ) .
Accordingly , during the 19th century , the U.S. Army disseminated contaminated blankets to the Indians for extermination purposes .
Smallpox , now available in a dry state , and cholera were very effective . [ 41 ]
Quite possibly , smallpox , a highly contagious disease , had claimed the lives of more Northern Plains Indians , a " virgin population , " in one year , 1837 - 1838 , than all the military expeditions sent against them .
The Indians used a very descriptive name for smallpox  rotting face . [ 42 ]
The U.S. military also conducted germ warfare by injecting Filipino captives with plague and beriberi germs during our occupation of the Philippines beginning in 1898 .
In 1998 , in South Africa at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission the following testimony was given , " The United States encouraged South Africa 's apartheid regime to develop a Chemical Biological Weapons program that was aimed at the country 's black population .
Dr. Wouter Basson , the South African general who headed the project from its inception in 1981 , testified from notes he made of a meeting with US Major General William Augerson .
He ( Augerson ) feels that chemical warfare is an ideal strategic weapon because infrastructure is preserved together with facilities and only living people are killed .
The warm climate of Africa is ideal for this type of weapon because the diffusion of the poison is better and the absorption is increased by perspiration and increased blood flow in the persons who are targets . " [ 43 ]
Genocidal war is about body counts  un-armed men , women and children are all total war targets to fulfill the objective of world population reduction .
However , war destroys a lot of infrastructure .
Accordingly , other methods were developed that are equally effective and might even increase profits in other service industries , also affiliated with the elite who consistently view other humans as sources of profit or commodities , even in death .
Genocide , under other pretenses , is regularly practiced to limit " excesses " in order to preserve the earth and its resources for the " fittest . "
Elite - controlled governments are indifferent to the slaughter , starvation , slave labor , and suffering of others , as evidenced by a callous response from former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright when questioned about the 500,000 children who died in Iraq as a result of the U.S. - imposed sanctions .
She said , " It was worth it . " [ 44 ]
The Malthusian - mentality elite believe in the survival of the fittest rendering the vast majority of the earth 's population as expendable .
Choreographed economic crisis , sanctions ( government - imposed famines ) , man -made famines , wars , directed energy warfare , diseases , and mass migrations into hostile territory are all methods of thinning out the population .
Abortion , peddled as pro-choice , and homosexuality , promoted as an alternative life style , all contribute to birth reduction rates .
Both Alfred Kinsey 's sexual revolution and Gloria Steinem 's women 's movement were funded and facilitated by the elite .
The greedy elite manage to conceal their miserable machinations by distracting the masses with mindless entertainment and addictive substances from which they also derive profits .
Many Americans think that God sanctions our every action against other ethnic groups just because we are American .
God almost certainly does not sanction everything that the U.S. government does .
In reality , the fallacious claim of divine sanction cloaks the enormity of state - sanctioned wickedness .
The U.S. could and should use its power for good .
Apparently , we establish our own ethical standards , totally exempt from all culpability and , according to Henry Kissinger , our behavior should not be internationalized .
In other words , we condone and even support unilateral attacks on other countries but other countries may not act in the same manner .
The children of every country should have the same rights and protections as white American children . [ 45 ]

Those longer terms and conditions are already under fire .
On Thursday , the California Supreme Court ruled 5 to 2 that a state ballot initiative allowing the indefinite extension of sentences for sexually violent predators might violate constitutional guarantees of equal protection ; the court ordered a new hearing to explore the issues .
On Monday , the court also asked for more study on a law that prohibits sexual predators from living within 2,000 feet of a school or park after their release from prison .
The law , called Jessica ’s law , was approved by voters in 2006 .
Corey Rayburn Yung , an expert in sex crimes at the John Marshall Law School in Chicago , said that while “ it ’s hard to be too sympathetic ” toward those who possess images of child pornography , “ there is such a thing as going too far . ”
The harm to child pornography victims from those who possess the images , he said , is less direct than that caused by those who abused the children .
The most novel approach is being taken by Amy ’s lawyer , James R. Marsh , whose practice focuses on child exploitation cases .
Mr. Marsh ’s arguments are the fruits of a national movement granting greater rights to crime victims and shifting the financial burden of crimes to criminals , said Paul G. Cassell , a former federal judge and professor of law at the University of Utah , who advised Mr. Marsh and wrote a brief supporting his position in a Texas case .
Amy ’s uncle is now in prison , but she is regularly reminded of his abuse whenever the government notifies her that her photos have turned up in yet another prosecution .
More than 800 of the notices , mandated by the Crime Victims Rights Act and sent out by the federal victim notification system , have arrived at Amy ’s home since 2005 .
Image James Marsh is the lawyer representing Amy in a legal action that has led to debate about fairness in sentencing offenders .

Those notices disturb
Amy when they arrive , but Mr. Marsh , looking at the same pieces of paper , saw an opportunity : he could intervene in the federal prosecutions and demand restitution .
He had Amy write a victim - impact statement and hired a psychologist to evaluate her .
Economists developed a tally of damages that included counseling , diminished wages and lawyer fees .
The total came to $ 3,367,854 .
Many people believe that the only thing Democrats understand is pain and so the thing that will change this dynamic will be to deliver them a loss of their majority and perhaps the presidency to show the consequences of failure to fulfill the progressive agenda .
That certainly sounds right , except you can't ever know exactly what lesson will be taken from this sort of pain and if history is any guide , the likeliest one is the simplest and most obvious : they lost because people preferred what the other side had to offer .
Obviously , that 's not necessarily the case , but it is n't illogical for them to believe that .
And the exit polls or whatever other data may be available rarely clearly show that it was base demobilization that caused a turnover .
Often people do n't even know why they failed to vote and you can't exit poll those who did n't bother .
More importantly , you have the ongoing , pernicious problem of the conservative Democrats who will always pimp the anti-liberal line and their friends in the media who pull the old " this is a conservative country " narrative off the shelf by reflex .
Indeed , we can see it in its full glory already manifesting itself with this classic Adam Nagourney piece in today 's NY Times :
... Win or lose in Massachusetts , that a contest between a conservative Republican and a liberal Democrat could appear so close is evidence of what even Democrats say is animosity directed at the administration and Congress .
It has been fanned by Republicans who have portrayed Democrats as overreaching and out of touch with ordinary Americans .
... Senator Evan Bayh , Democrat of Indiana , said the atmosphere was a serious threat to Democrats .
“ I do think there ’s a chance that Congressional elites mistook their mandate , ” Mr. Bayh said .
“ I do n’t think the American people last year voted for higher taxes , higher deficits and a more intrusive government .
But there ’s a perception that that is what they are getting . ”
... Mr. Brown has portrayed Ms. Coakley as an advocate of big government , big spending and big deficits ; Obama advisers and other Democrats have worried that the expanding deficit , now at a level not seen since World War II , was hurting Mr. Obama with independents who lifted him to victory in 2008 .
Polls suggest that those voters have flocked to Mr. Brown , as they did to Republican candidates for governor in Virginia and New Jersey last year ... some Democrats are wondering if Mr. Obama would be in a better position now if he had embraced a less ambitious health care proposal , as some aides urged , permitting him to pivot more quickly on the economy .
Depending on what happens Tuesday , that is a debate that might be reverberating in the White House for a long time to come .
" Some " Democrats wonder if he should have been less ambitious with health care and even Obama advisors are terribly , terribly worried about deficits .
The idea that they have n't been liberal enough does n't seem to be resonating does it ?
And I have very serious doubts that it will resonate if the party of Teabaggers starts winning .
So , how do liberals exert what power they have and have the results be interpreted the way we want it to be ?
The first would be through protest votes for a third party that resulted in Republican victory .
( There is virtually no chance that any third party will ever gain real power short of a fundamental change in the way we elect our representatives , so protest is all it will be . )
It 's been done before .
And if you can live with the idea of voting in a Republican party in the thrall of extremists that make Bush and Cheney look like Rockefeller Republicans , I suppose that might be the way to go .
I wo n't judge you , but I am personally unwilling to put the world through any more of this failed right wing experiment at the moment .
There is a fairly compelling theory in political science that says that after political parties come into power , fulfill some pieces of their agenda , get fat and bloated and are finally removed from office , they then tend to deny the reality of their loss and blame it on everything but themselves until they lose enough elections that they finally realize that their ideology has failed .
The current GOP is not there yet by a long shot .
They are still in the process of doubling down on their radical agenda at a time when the economy is still in ruins , the effects of globalization are being fully felt , the planet is in peril and about to reach a tipping point , and a radical fundamentalist movement is trying to blow people up .
I do n't think the world can take any more of the right 's prescriptions for these problems right now : Lindsey Graham is considered too liberal and neo-Hooverism is their economic program .
Yes , the Democrats are corrupt and inept .
But the other side is batshit insane .
However , that does n't mean that there 's nothing we can do but wring our hands about how the system is broken and fret ourselves into intertia .
The other way to send messages to the Democratic party is through the unsatisfying and often thankless process of primary challenges .
Nobody can have any problem understanding that message , not even Adam Nagourney .
It 's hard to find challengers and it's no wonder .
It 's expensive , time consuming and after all your hard work you will probably lose .
It takes real commitment and a desire to not only win a seat in congress but do it by way of unseating an incumbent of your own party with whom you disagree , an act which is guaranted to make you an odd man out among the party hierarchy .
But if you win , it can send shockwaves through the system .
And guess what ?
We are in the most favorable year for primary challenges in recent memory .
The insane teabaggers are n't going to allow any rational Republicans to run and the anti-incumbent fever is going to be as high as it's been since 1994 .
The Democratic base has an energetic activist faction , the netroots can raise money and there is a burning desire to show the party establishment that they cannot take liberals for granted .
It 's a perfect environment for successful primary challenges .
And lucky for us , there are some brave progressives already out there taking on incumbents and there very well may be more .
This time a few of them may win , and believe me if that happens , the Democratic party will not be able to spin those victories as being a sign that the party needs to move to the right .
Yesterday Digby took a look at the currents that are roiling so many progressives and Democrats , currents that have left Democratic voters disillusioned and demoralized and have tamped down Democratic grassroots participation in the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial races and threaten the election of a popular Attorney General for a " safe " Democratic Senate seat in ...!
See that link a couple lines back ?
That 's Digby 's post at Hullabaloo , and I strongly recommend you click it and read it in full .
She looks at the angst in the Democratic base , " the free floating anxiety that 's pervasive out in the country as a whole , the horrific spectacle of health care reform sausage making and the toppling of President Obama from his heavenly pedestal , " but she does n't equate that with a reason to " kill the bill , " let alone actively ( or even passively ) work for the defeat of Martha Coakley Tuesday , the way Republican operatives are encouraging anxiety - ridden Democrats to do .
And not all self - proclaimed " progressives " are people of pure motive or good faith .
Yesterday Blue America opened a new fundraising page , Send Democrats A Message They Can Understand .
It is n't about defeating Martha Coakley or Barack Obama or health care reform .
It 's about replacing reactionary Democrats who vote like Republicans -- Blue Dogs like John Barrow and Jane Harman -- with stalwart progressives .
And it 's about pointing out Democratic challengers in open races , like Doug Tudor , Jennifer Brunner , Ann Kuster and Colleen Hanabusa , who represent progressive values and who are opposing Insider Establishment candidates who will not stand for progressive values .
Please take a look at the page and the candidates and see if you feel this might be a more constructive way for progressives to proceed than to just strike out angrily and give a GOP that is several degrees further right than Bush and Cheney an opportunity to get back into power .
Because the only people who want that ... are seeing it as a way to make some money for themselves .

Stressed ?
( Image : Peter Cade / Getty )
Next time you enter a username and password , think about the rhythm of your typing .
Not only can it be used to identify you , it can reveal if you are in a stressful environment .
The team behind the discovery suggest it could be used by retailers or banks to detect whether you are logging into your account under extreme stress or duress .
It has long been known that the rhythms of a person ’s typing style are stable over time , leading to suggestions they could be used to verify identity or even spot early signs of Alzheimer ’s disease .
But little was know about the effect of stress on typing patterns , so psychologist Mike Dowman and colleagues at the University of Abertay , UK , investigated .

Stress test
They asked 35 people to log into a computer 36 times over three separate sessions up to a month apart , using the same user name ( abertayexperiment ) and password ( understandsomething ) .
People were put into stressed and neutral states alternately by listening to a range of sounds known to elicit particular emotions and heard either heard gentle paper crumpling or arguing couples and emergency sirens .
The length of time each key was held down and the interval between one being released and another pressed was recorded to generate a typing “ fingerprint ” for each person .
Electrodes were attached to the typists ’ hands to detect sweating – a sign of stress also exploited by lie detectors .
The team used the data to develop and test software that identifies a person from their typing style alone .
Using just the 36 characters of the login details it was able to correctly identify users 97.2 per cent of the time in a total of 42,840 login attempts .
It was n’t unusual for a person ’s timing to vary by just 20 milliseconds between two logins a week apart , says Dowman .
The data also showed that stress can be detected in a person ’s typing because it changes the pattern of timings – for example by making key - presses shorter on average – although typists retained enough of their style to be identifiable .
“ There ’s no question : people do type differently under stress , ” says Dowman .
He suggests that security systems could be designed to raise the alarm if it seems that a person might be being forced to log into a system , whether a cash machine or online account .
More research will be needed , however , before a system could tell if a person is , say , just having a bad day or being held at gunpoint .
No more passwords
Neil Barrett , a computer security consultant and visiting professor at the Centre for Forensic Computing and Security at Cranfield University , UK , says that the Abertay system ’s success rate is similar to other biometric systems in use , such as voiceprints or the fingerprint scanners built into laptops .
With further improvements to typing - style recognition , passwords may no longer be needed for some systems , he says .
“ You can take the identification characteristics of the way they type in their username . ”
The Abertay group have applied for patents on their ideas about how to detect signs of a stressful environment in a person ’s typing style .
An RCMP officer on medical leave has been charged with first - degree murder in the stabbing death of an Ottawa police officer outside a local hospital .
Kevin Gregson , 43 , was charged Tuesday night with first - degree murder , robbery and using an imitation firearm in the commission of an offense , in relation to the death of Const.
Eric Czapnik .
Czapnik , 51 , was stabbed to death early Tuesday morning outside the Civic Campus of the Ottawa Hospital , as he sat in his police cruiser taking notes .
He had immigrated to Canada from Poland in 1990 , was married , and a father of four .
He joined the Ottawa police force in 2007 .
His father was a police officer in Poland for more than 30 years .
The officer was sitting in his cruiser around 4:30 a.m. ET , writing in his police notebook , when he was ambushed by a single man , apparently at random , and stabbed to death , police said .
" There was nothing extraordinary about the incident until ( Czapnik ) interacts with the accused , " Ottawa Police Chief Vern
White said .
The suspect was apprehended and held down by four nearby paramedics , including two women .
The paramedics tried to revive the officer , but were unable to .
He was pronounced dead at about 5:30 a.m , about 90 minutes before his shift was due to end .
White praised the assistance from the paramedics and said they were " essential " to apprehending the suspect .
" Without their assistance , I do n't know what would have happened next , " he said .
" There were heroic in the way they handled the situation . "
Footage of the scene showed a flashlight , gun , notebook , a single glove , two knives and a large stain of blood on the salt - covered pavement .
White said there was no connection between Czapnik and the accused .
Gregson , 43 , used to work for the RCMP at their Regina headquarters .
In 2006 , he was arrested for pulling a knife on a Mormon church official in Regina .
He received a conditional discharge after explaining to the court that he had recently undergone brain surgery for cysts on his brain .
A visibly shaken
White told a morning news conference that Tuesday 's incident is " an overwhelming tragedy . "
" Police forces are like family , " White told CTV News Channel later in the morning .
" We often fight and argue but always , there is this bond and connection like families have . "
He said this incident will be most difficult on the officers from the same platoon as the deceased officer .
" It 'll be a tough time , particularly over the next few days as they try to work through their own emotions and get through the morning , " he said .
Flags outside the Ottawa Police headquarters on Elgin St. are flying at half - staff .
This is the first time an Ottawa police officer has been killed in the line of duty since October 1983 when Const .
David Utman , 38 , was shot during an altercation at a shopping centre .

Hi-tech helps Iranian monitoring
The new cyber battlefield in Iran Euro MPs have " strongly " criticised telecoms firm Nokia Siemens Networks for providing " surveillance technology " to the Iranian authorities .
In a resolution adopted on Wednesday , the MEPs said the hardware was instrumental in the " persecution and arrests of Iranian dissidents " .
But Nokia Siemens said that the implication that it had provided censorship technology was " wrong "
It has previously said that it had installed " lawful " technology in 2008 .
" We will be clarifying any inaccuracy in their understanding of our business in Iran with the European Parliament , " Ben Roome of the firm told BBC News .
Nokia Siemens said the technology that it had installed was similar to that used " in all EU member states and the US " .
Mr Roome stressed that the technology is not used to monitor , filter or censor the internet .
" When you set up a modern network - as an operator - if you want a licence to operate you have to have a standard surveillance capability in the network , " Christina Dinne , also of the firm , said .
Net benefit Nokia Siemens told BBC
News that it had provided " very basic surveillance " capabilities to Iran Telecom in 2008 .
The product is called Monitoring Centre and can be used to monitor local telephone calls .
" You can't track keywords , " said Mrs Dinne .
Google says its Gmail traffic has dropped sharply in Iran Details of Nokia Siemens activities in Iran first came to light in June 2009 when media reports accused the firm of helping the Iranian government intercept communications .
Technology - such as mobile phones - were widely used in protests following Iran 's disputed election .
" We are , of course , aware of reports from Iran , and condemn any abuse of communication technologies that may have taken place , " said Mr Roome .
" We strongly believe that mobile networks enhance individuals ' lives , promote transparency , and empower citizens with effective means of feedback .
" In Iran they have clearly played a pivotal role in their ability to communicate , organise , and share their story with the outside world .
However , the MEPS called on the EU to ban similar exports to " governments and countries such as Iran " .
The statements were part of a wider resolution that included a call for Iran to " restore the transparency of its nuclear programme " .
Iran has said that it has begun a new phase of uranium enrichment at its Natanz plant .
The Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad announced the country has produced its first batch of uranium enriched to 20 % at a rally marking Iran 's revolution .
The anniversary is the most important day in Iran 's political calendar .
The opposition Green Movement is also trying to stage counter - demonstrations .
In the past these have been coordinated via social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook as well as through e-mail and mobile phones .
Reports suggest that the internet has been throttled with services such as Google 's Gmail service markedly reduced .

Washington Secretary of State Sam Reed and Governor Chris Gregoire have made it official , certifying that voters turned down Tim Eyman ’s latest ballot measure , but adopted the “ everything but marriage ” domestic partnership law approved by the Legislature last spring .
Referendum 71 , placed on the ballot by foes of same - sex marriage , was approved by a margin of more than 110,000 votes , or more than 6 percentage points .
National media describe it as the country ’s first voter - approved domestic partnership or “ everything - but - marriage ” law .
The new law had been on hold pending the public vote , and will now go into effect at 12:01 a.m.
Thursday , 30 days after the Nov. 3 General Election .
The law is Senate Bill 5688 and applies to state - registered domestic partners , both same - sex couples and opposite - sex couples where at least one partner is 62 or older .
According to the canvass of returns certified by Secretary Reed and later proclaimed by Governor Gregoire , R - 71 had 951,822 votes to approve the law and 838,842 to repeal .
The other statewide ballot measure , Initiative 1033 , was declared defeated , 1,003,943 to 729,918 .
The margin of defeat was nearly 16 percent .
Eyman ’s measure would have capped state , county and city general fund revenue and used excess revenue for property tax relief .
Reed also certified the returns for three special state House races in Eastern Washington to fill the final year of unexpired terms .
Winners , all Republicans , were Susan Fagan in the 9th District , David Taylor in the 15th and Terry Nealey in the 16th .
Taylor served last session as an appointee .
Nealey defeated the Democratic appointee , and Fagan won an open seat .
Counties certified their returns last week , and in some cases , the winners already have been sworn in to fill unexpired terms , such as King County Executive Dow Constantine .
The voter turnout statewide was nearly 51 percent , with 1,823,364 ballots tallied .

A television news helicopter has been filmed spinning away from a busy Sao Paolo highway before hitting the ground .
The pilot of the Record TV helicopter was killed and a cameraman on board was seriously injured .
Brazilian Air Force Lt. Col. Ricardo Beltran said that the pilot was a " hero " for avoiding the nearby buildings and road .
Language selection is a contentious thing , and often a compromise between " pick the right language for the job " and " use as few languages as possible to increase mindshare . "
Google , for example , limits the programming languages their employees are allowed to use ; and I have come to associate picking whatever language you want for your own projects as irresponsible , having once been told , " Yeah ... that project was written in X and no one besides the guy who wrote it knows X... probably not a good use of your time to work on it . "
Of course , I 've been quite culpable of this myself ; I wrote the member dues tracking system for the Assassins ' Guild in Haskell , and unless a miracle happens I am kind of doubtful future maintainers will be able to deal with it .
When I am not being irresponsible , Python is my favored language for most of my scripting needs , and as such I am painfully aware of quirks in the language that Haskell would smooth away .
Python code is dynamically typed and variables have no scoping .
Brain - o typing errors , variable misnamings and plain ole broken code is n't caught unless a code path is exercised .
What makes it better : pylint -e catches large classes of errors ( but you commonly have to wade through recursion limit errors to find it , and I strongly believe any error checking not built in the compiler is doomed to be ignored by the people who need it most ) , as is full code coverage on whatever automated tests you have .
Why Haskell rocks : the static analysis is complete enough that if it compiles , it runs correctly .

Why Haskell rocks : the static analysis is complete enough that if it compiles , it runs correctly .
Python is slow .
If you do n't believe it : ask yourself why the runtime can't be loaded quickly enough to make running Python as CGI tenable , or why Google has banned it from living in public facing code , or why engineers treat rewriting a Python daemon in C++ as the inevitable conclusion when you just can't wring out anymore speed .
What makes it better :
Not everything has to be blazing fast .
Why Haskell rocks :
Insane people writing insane compilers like GHC which compile into native binaries and have absolutely epic speed .
Python has an limit to comprehensible code golfing .
While duplication of high - level code structure is no where as bad in Python as it might be for Java or C++ , attempts to purify code even further often lead to highly incomprehensible higher order functions that require copious documentation .
As people say , " Do n't write Haskell in Python . "
Why Haskell rocks :
The type system not only becomes essential to the documentation of the code , it also serves as a framework by which a user can " snap " together combinators and data like legoblocks , leading to a much higher tolerance of complexity .
Python has inherited an aging object - oriented paradigm .
However , I am increasingly convinced that typeclass based systems ( Go is one decidedly imperative language that has picked them up ) are the way to go .
In combination with type signatures , they provide the two primary benefits of OOP : a logical organization of functionality and polymorphism , without all of the complicated gunk that is multiple inheritance , mix-ins , metaclasses , etc .
Why Haskell rocks : First - class support for type - classes .
Python has abysmal threading support .
It has the global interpreter lock .
Why Haskell rocks :
It not only has fast , green threads and the notion of purity to make splitting computations feasible , it has made it extremely simple to experiment with scheduling algorithms with the computation .
I can't say much more in this field , because I have very little experience writing parallel Haskell code .
But I would cringe to attempt to write in Haskell one of the large projects that I have done in imperative languages like PHP or Python ( I mention these two particular languages , because within them I have built two systems that are actually large ) , for these very important reasons :
Haskell has not grown sufficient library support to become fully multiparadigm .
I am highly skeptical that a straight - forward port of any given piece of Python code would be possible ; despite great advances in shepherding the more dynamic features of Python into Haskell 's type system with packages such as Text .
Printf , action at a distance intrinsic of an imperative program would require heavy IO wizardry in Haskell .
It 's not obvious which problems in the imperative domain truly are better kept in the imperative domain , as James Hague has mused recently .
The Haskell community is fairly unified in its stance that as little code should be in the IO monad as possible , but when we bring in small bits of the imperative world to help us in cases such as the State monad , we acknowledge the imperative paradigm is useful ... or at least an easy way out .
Perhaps if we tried harder we could find a more elegant , maintainable , purely functional solution ; and one of the favorite pastimes of academics is to figure these things out .
But this is hard even for those used to thinking functionally , and the answers often need to be discovered , let alone implemented .
All of the engineering folklore , wisdom and best practices that have been accumulated from years of hacking on large , imperative codebases may or may not apply to functional codebases anymore .
If functional libraries are encouraged to be as decoupled as possible , do we need to allow for further decoupling in the API ?
Does pure code need to be logged , or is its determinism make it trivial to debug ?
What testing do we need , and how much trust do we put in the types ?
How does API documentation and cross-referencing need to evolve for functional codebases ?
How the heck do you go ahead and debug a logic error in a section of pure Haskell code ?
Yet , there are companies that are putting out production size codebases in Haskell , which makes me optimistic that answers to these questions will soon become public knowledge ; if not for Haskell , for some other purely functional language .
And the " classic " solutions in the imperative world have often lead to insidious errors , especially in a world of multithreaded applications , and we must not settle for " good enough . "
Software sucks , but purely functional systems with strong , flexible types have the promise to eliminate large swaths of this suckage .
And that is why I Haskell .
Maybe the biggest hit from Asylum , H. G. Wells '
War of the Worlds ( also going by the title of Invasion and H.G. Wells ' The Worlds in War ) is one of three film adaptations of The War of the Worlds novel released in 2005 .
Unlike most adaptations ,
The Asylum intended to make this War of the Worlds film more of a horror film .
It was rated R for strong violence / gore , language and moderate sexual content .
Director David Michael
Latt describes the film as The Pianist with aliens instead of Nazis , comparing the tale of one man 's story of survival .
Latt has made it clear that War of the Worlds is about a man and his journey .
The DVD was released on June 28 , one day before Spielberg 's film .
The success of the movie was praised for its revisualization into a horror film , being described as " the most horrifying version of all " .
It was also praised for its faithfulness to the novel .
NOTE : Actually , according to our reader Thomas , it was the Pendragon Pictures version that was praised for being " extremely faithful " .
The Asylum 's version differs greatly .
2010 Olympic Mascots
The 2010 Winter Olympics began on Friday .
The mascots for the Vancouver games are cute , cuddly and culturally significant .
At least that ’s what most people see when they look at Sumi , Quatchi and Miga .
I , on the other hand , see three creatures that I want to include in my next D&D adventure .
Using the information provided on the official Vancouver 2010 Olympics website , I ’ve created three creatures based on the mascots that you can use in your next heroic teir adventure .
Mascot Tactics
All three of the mascots are good alignment .
None of them are agressive and none will initiate combat .
However , they will all defend themselves if attacked .
They are all intelligent , extremely curious and playful .
What the mascots deem as fun and games may be interpreted by some PCs as hostile intent .
The mascots are friendly and are always looking to make new friends .
Any attempt by the PCs to engage the mascots in a dialogue will meet with success .
Due to their inquisitive nature , the mascots all have high Insight and are likely to see through lies if the PCs attempt to use Bluff .
The mascots are happy to aid PCs however they can as long as that aid does not harm anyone .
Sumi is an animal spirit who lives in the mountains of British Columbia .
Like many Canadians , Sumi ’s background is drawn from many places .
He wears the hat of the orca whale , flies with the wings of the mighty thunderbird and runs on the strong furry legs of the black bear .
Quatchi is a young sasquatch who comes from the mysterious forests of Canada .
Quatchi is shy , but loves to explore new places and meet new friends .
Miga is a young sea bear who lives in the ocean with her family pod , beyond Vancouver Island , near Tofino , British Columbia .
Sea bears are part killer whale and part bear .
( Miga is part Kermode bear , a rare white bear that only lives in British Columbia . )
Our Olympic theme continues tomorrow with the Skill Challenge : Olympic Games designed to test the physical and mental limits of your PCs in organized sport .

The U.K. government faces an 80 % chance of a credit rating downgrade if its deficit reduction plans remain as they are , Scott Mather , Pacific Investment Management Co. 's head of global portfolio management told Dow Jones Newswires Tuesday .
Mather also said yields on U.K. government bonds - known as gilts - could rise by as much as 100 basis points when the Bank of England 's bond - buying program ends ,
Asked if the U.K. faced a serious risk of suffering a downgrade to its credit rating , Mather said " I think so . "
" It 's just a question of when on the current trajectory , not if , " Mather said .
" Based on what we know today about the debt trajectory and about the inability to adjust that , I think it 's greater than a 50 % likelihood for sure .
Call it more like 80 % . "
Mather said the government 's debt reduction plan " is lacking in conviction and it is lacking in details . "
He also said the end of the Bank of England 's bond - buying program will have a significant impact on U.K. gilt markets and borrowing costs .
" Common sense would tell you that if you had a buyer in the market place which was taking the majority of the sector repeatedly ... and then they disappeared , ... you would expect a reprising , and it could be quite significant , " he said in a telephone interview .
" The estimates vary .
They 're really all over the map , but it could be 50 basis points , it could be 100 basis points , in that range . "

Grocery Bill Was ' Out of Control , ' but Year - Long Meal Plan Saves Texas Woman Time and Money While grocery bill was " out of control , " a meal plan saved Leslie Chisolm money .
FRIENDSWOOD , Texas , Jan. 21 , 2010  -- FRIENDSWOOD , Texas ( KTRK ) --
Do you know what you 're cooking for dinner tonight ?
Planning ahead can be a great way to save time and money but one woman is taking it to a whole new level .
It may be hard to believe , but a Friendswood mom not only knows what she is feeding her family every single night of the week , she has it all planned out for the entire year !
She says having a plan has cut her grocery bill by more than half and she 's sharing her strategy with us .
Leslie Chisolm admits keeping up with a family of six that includes four boys is not easy .
" It 's kind of like a circus , " she told KTRK's Patricia Lopez .
" There is something going on all the time . "
That 's why dinner time has to be organized .
" They know exactly what they are having , " Chisolm explained .
" It 's easier on me because I know what we are having .
I do n't stress out and say what am I going to cook tonight , what am I going to cook tonight ? "
Chisolm and her husband came up with the idea to plan every single dinner for the entire year after trips to the grocery store were getting expensive .
She recalled , " It was two years ago and my husband looked at me and said , ' Our grocery bill is out of control . ' "
Click here to see Leslie Chisolm 's meal calendar for 2009 .
Yearly Meal Plan ' Makes My Life Easier '
Chisolm says she was doing a lot of compulsive shopping or wasting food she was n't using .
The family was also eating out a lot .
That 's when she decided to make her plan .
Chisolm 's plan works like this .
First she asked her family what they like to eat and what they do n't like .
She said , " We try and pick a different meat , with different vegetables and different sides that way we get a full balanced meal . "
Then she made a list of entrees and sides .
From that list , Chisolm made up her meal plan on a calendar .
Every single day of every month there is something different to eat , with one or two days a month built in for leftovers .
When it comes to shopping for groceries , Chisolm always takes her menu to the store .
She also builds up a stockpile when items go on sale .
" You can wait for the meats to go on sale and the vegetables to go on sale , " she said .
Finally , Chisolm buys in bulk to save money .
When she gets home she separates her servings .
" Put it on my baggies , I label it and it 's stacked in my freezer , " she said .
Then when Chisolm is ready to cook each night , it 's on her calendar and she 's fully stocked at home .
She explained , " It makes my life easier because its one less thing that I have to worry about because it 's already written down . "
While covering Facebook 's systematic elimination of privacy , we 've been deluged with questions from readers asking how to restore certain Facebook privacy protections .
Sadly , many such settings appear to be lost forever .
Here are the most glaring examples .
1 . Hide group and page memberships
Facebook changed its formal Privacy Policy to say that " pages you are a fan of ... and networks " are now totally public information ( along with many other things ) .
There 's apparently no setting to shield page and network data , which leads to terrible situation like this one , sent in as a reader plea :
All of a sudden my grandmother can see that I belong to the Queer Graduate Student Union and Open Relationships Networking Group .
Please help .
I can't bring myself to de-friend my grandmother !
UPDATE Dec. 17 : We 're not sure if this is new , but this can now be changed by going , confusingly , to " Application Settings . "
Go to the " Settings " menu at the top right of your profile page , then select " Application Settings , " then scroll down to " Groups " and select " Edit settings . "
Set to " Only me " ( click to enlarge ) :
Thanks to the tipster who walked us through this .
Sadly , even as one privacy mystery was resolved , we were made aware of another .
See below .
2. Block Facebook activity from appearing on your wall
There used to be a setting that allowed users to prevent Facebook activity from automatically showing up on their Facebook wall , thus blocking updates like " John commented on Jane 's picture , " " John is now friends with Bob , " " John is attending Uber Gay Circuit Party 2010 , " etc .
This setting is apparently gone , and you have to remove such notices one at a time .
Writes one tipster :
It is extremely annoying not to mention a complete tell of how often I use Facebook during work hours : )
3 . Prevent strangers from friending you
It used to be you could keep non-friends from sending you a Facebook friend requests , although they could confirm .
That 's not the most , well , social way to use a social network , but judging from our email , it was a frequently used and valued feature .
Wrote one Gawker regular :
Before the changes I was n't searchable on FB and hence friended only those I wanted to friend , in essence , I would initiate the request .
But ...
I am now getting friend requests from people I do n't know , or worse , from people I know but I do n't want to befriend on FB ...
Facebook now makes you offer the " Add friend " option to all friends of friends — you can't restrict any tighter than that , so strangers can still send you friend requests .

4. Completely hide friends list
Your friends list , too , is considered public information .
Though you can remove it from your profile , you can't keep friends of friends from seeing it .
They just have to pull up one of your friends ' friend list , click you name , and view your friends list .
Writes one reader : " Many of us are concerned , seeing as how there are thousands of people faced with the threat of stalkers . "
Another , right on cue :
I have been dealing with a deranged , threatening stalker ...
There is no way of keeping your Friend list private ...
I have been obsessively reading about this topic [ overall Facebook privacy ] ...
To say I 'm outraged is an understatement .
We thought Facebook might be improving this , but we continue to receive emails like these , and Facebooks written Privacy Policy still states that friends lists are now public information .
5. Block Wall announcements that you 've been tagged in a photo
You can keep photos of yourself out of the " Photos " tab on your profile , even if they 've been uploaded by other people .
But it seems you can't block from your Wall announcements that you 've been tagged in someone else 's photo , which sort of defeats the purpose :
It leaves your profile as a very convenient central location for any incriminating pictures of yourself .
You can remove each notification manually , but that becomes a game of whack - a- mole .
Wrote one Facebooker :
I 've already blocked everyone from viewing photos that I 'm tagged in , but I 'd prefer that my friends not even see that I 've been tagged in the small preview photo that gets posted to my wall every time someone tags me .
UPDATE : According to a helpful tipster , this can be disabled by going to the Settings menu at the top right of your Facebook home page , then to " Application Settings , " then the " Photos " application , then click " Edit settings . "
Then click the " Additional Permissions tab , " and there is an option to " Publish to streams . "
Uncheck this .
Like so ( click to enlarge ) :
UPDATE : 6 . Profile photo
While it 's possible to restrict your profile photo album , your main profile photo is one of the pieces of personal data that was forcibly made public by Facebook when it updated its formal Privacy Policy .
The best you can do is upload a fake pic , or remove your profile photo entirely ; there 's no way to have a profile photo that only your friends see .
And more , we 're sure
We 'd love to be wrong about any of these privacy rollbacks , so if you know of settings or workarounds we 've overlooked , do email us at tips@gawker.com .
Conversely , if we 've left out a lost privacy option you feel strongly about , let us know about that , too .
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg ( pictured ) originally said his social network 's privacy changes were intended simplify and enhance the privacy experience on the site .
Judging from our inbox , it would seem he 's achieved neither .

Obama pleads for Republican support at White House meeting
By Tom Eley
11 February 2010
In a closed - door White House meeting with top Congressional leadership held Tuesday , President Obama emphasized the right - wing character of his effort to drive down health care costs and other components of his domestic agenda and pleaded for Republican Party support .
The contours of the discussion came to light through a White House news briefing by Obama — his first since last summer — and a joint press conference held by Republican House Minority Leader John Boehner and Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell .
In his briefing , Obama reiterated his plea for bipartisanship .
“ I ’m willing to move off some of the preferences of my party in order to meet them halfway , but there ’s got to be some give from their side as well , ” Obama said .
Bipartisanship cannot mean “ Democrats give up everything they believe in ” while supporting “ the handful of things that Republicans have been advocating for , ” he added .
Reading these lines , one who knew little of US politics could be forgiven for assuming the Democrats are a small minority party .
In fact they hold a 9 - seat majority in the Senate and a 39 - seat majority in the House .
The central issue in the White House discussions is Obama ’s health care legislation , which has been thrown into doubt by Republican Scott Brown ’s victory last month for the open Senate seat left behind by Democrat Ted Kennedy , which resulted in the Democrats ’ loss of their 60 - seat , “ filibuster - proof ” majority .
Brown ran as an opponent of the legislation , tapping into widespread apprehension over the measure ’s aim of limiting medical services in the name of “ cost- cutting . ”
He also benefited from a significant decline in the turnout of traditionally Democratic voters who have become disillusioned with the policies of the Obama administration .
In his efforts to secure support from even a small number of Congressional Republicans for the legislation , Obama has jettisoned any pretense that “ health care reform ” will significantly expand coverage to the uninsured .
The focus is now entirely on cost cutting .
Any additional changes will benefit the major corporate interests in the health care industry — pharmaceuticals , insurance companies , and HMOs .
“ Not only is it deficit neutral , ” Obama said of his health care legislation , “ but the Congressional Budget Office , which is the bipartisan office that is the scorekeeper for how much things cost in Congress , says it is going to reduce the costs by $ 1 trillion . ”
Health care reform is the “ single best way to bring down our deficits , ” he added .
“ Nobody can dispute the fact that if we do n’t tackle surging health care costs , then we ca n’t control our budget . ”
Obama reiterated that he is prepared to support a Republican proposal placing new limitations on medical malpractice lawsuits , a measure that would effectively shield industry groups from the consequences of their own malfeasance , while making Democrats “ uncomfortable , ” Obama said .
The more Obama adopts an openly right - wing agenda , the more firm the Republicans become , with McConnell and Boehner now declaring that the health care bill circulating in Congress should be entirely scrapped and started over from scratch .
Congressional Republicans have little motivation to negotiate .
Republicans are able to use White House appeals as leverage to advance their own legislative agenda — including their goal of maintaining intact President George W. Bush ’s tax cuts for the wealthy that are set to expire at year ’s end .
They also sense they can capitalize on the broad popular hostility to Obama ’s reactionary health care agenda .
There will be a televised “ health care summit ” between Obama and Congressional Republicans on February 25 .
The only points of agreement that emerged from the meeting related to initiatives where Obama has largely adopted Republican proposals .
In his recent State of the Union address , Obama indicated his support for nuclear power , “ clean coal , ” and offshore oil drilling .
“ Of course , he likes that , ” Obama said of McConnell .
“ That ’s part of the Republican agenda for energy , which I accept . ”
But Republicans have said they will block Obama ’s “ clean energy ” proposals and cap - and - trade , which seeks to make carbon pollution a tradable commodity and new source of profit for some energy concerns .
Republicans have also indicated they might support Obama ’s $ 85 billion jobs bill .
In fact Obama ’s plan offers no money for direct job creation .
Its primary feature is $ 35 billion in additional tax cuts for businesses , including a waiver for employer contributions to Social Security payroll taxes for firms that hire unemployed workers .
The measure will likely extend jobless benefits through May 31 .
Included in the bill is a rider that will renew for another year the Patriot Act , which allows US spy agencies to circumvent the Bill of Rights when they claim they are investigating terrorists .
“ We ’re certainly open to it , ” McConnell said of the “ jobs ” bill .
“ I think there ’s a chance the Senate could get there with a small package . ”
In his news briefing , Obama also asked Republicans to allow his federal nominees up - and - down votes from the Senate floor .
He said he will consider using a provision that allows the president to seat nominees when Congress is in recess .
Such appointments would last through 2011 .
Senate Republicans continue to block dozens of Obama ’s appointments , including his union - backed nominee for the National Labor Relations Board ( NLRB ) , Craig Becker , a union attorney .
The NLRB has wide latitude to rule on labor disputes and supervise union elections .
On Monday , Democrats secured only 52 of the 60 votes needed to overcome a Republican filibuster against the appointment .
Two Democratic Senators , Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas , joined with Republicans in upholding the maneuver .
One Republican senator , Richard Shelby , by himself held up 70 Obama appointees until this week in a dispute over federal funding for his home state of Alabama .
Every week , one in three Americans shops at Walmart , America 's largest and busiest mega - discounter .
For some , the long lines , bargain - crazed competition , and " dehumanizing " warehouse environment are enough to transform them into monster shoppers .
Here , a roundup of otherwise sane consumers who recently succumbed to " Walmart rage " :
The bitter batsman
For reasons that are still murky , 24 - year old Westley Strellis decided that one suburban Atlanta Wal - mart had too many intact televisions on its shelves .
Using an aluminum baseball bat he'd found in the sporting goods section , Strellis went on a rampage in the TV aisle , destroying 29 flat - screen sets .
He then sat on the floor and waited quietly for the police to arrive .
The tipsy tantrum lady
When Tampa , FL , shopper Lorraine Drawe opted to crack open a beer , a Walmart staffer promptly asked her not to drink in the store .
Bad idea : Drawe , 44 , flew into an Incredible Hulk - like rage , howling insults at clerks and , eventually , ripping a phone from the wall before cops arrived to drag her away .
The vengeful redecorator
After one of the massive , ceiling - mounted signs that Walmart uses to promote " falling prices " unexpectedly dropped on his wife in 2005 , William Palmer was angered by the store 's refusal to remove them .
Four years later , Palmer , 46 , swiped pliers off the shelf of the local Dunn , NC , store 's hardware section , climbed up into the rafters , and began cutting down the threatening signs himself .
" It was like therapy , " he said , after submitting to police custody .
The conveniently forgetful conspirator
Lisa Hill was accompanying her husband Joseph through a Hamilton , TN , Walmart 's exit when he was apprehended for trying to steal $ 2000 worth of electronics .
The resourceful Hill feigned a heart attack and , while " afflicted , " told police that she " did n't know " her spouse .
A fellow shopper contradicted her claim — triggering a fracas in which the fellow shopper stabbed Hill with a knife .
The apoplectic line - cutter
Schoolteacher Heather Ellis , 24 , " went ballistic , " after a fellow shopper accused her of cutting a long line at a Kennett , MI , Walmart .
The enraged bargain - hunter thrashed out at cops , splitting the lip of one officer .
Ellis ' sneaky retail maneuvers earned her a year of probation and mandatory anger - management classes .
The highly dissatisfied terrorist
Gena Annette Banks - Bond probably regrets the day she decided to singlehandedly improve “ poor customer service ” in her Stafford , VA , Walmart with a well - meaning bomb threat :
The 25 - year - old informed staffers that if they did n't clean up their act promptly , she would " blow up " their store .
The would - be terrorist is now behind bars , and banned from Walmart for life .
The " return policy " arsonist
When sales associates at a Manatee , FL , Walmart refused to reimburse Philip Wright for items he attempted to return , the 41 - year - old expressed his disappointment by setting three racks of men's clothing ablaze , causing " thousands of dollars " in damage .
Though Wright fled the scene , he was arrested two hours later — attempting to wreak similar havoc at another local Walmart .

Shell has been hit by a massive data breach - the contact database for 176,000 staff and contractors at the firm has been copied and forwarded to lobbyists and activists opposed to the company .
John Donovan , an activist who received the database , said he had voluntarily destroyed the files .
But he warned that other copies were available online .
The email supposedly comes from 176 " concerned staff " to highlight Shell 's activities in Nigeria .
The database is about six months old and could have been released by a recently laid off staff member , or there could really be a rogue campaign group within Shell .
Richard Wiseman , chief ethics and compliance officer at Royal Dutch Shell , wrote to staff last week after the breach emerged .
He said : " The Global Address List , containing contact information of everyone in Shell and some contractors , joint ventures and other third parties , has been downloaded without authorisation and distributed to some external parties .
We do not know who did this .
We are investigating and are raising this theft of information with the relevant data protection authorities . "
The company played down the security implications of the loss - it is phone and email details rather than real - world addresses .
But if hackers have got access to Shell 's systems then they might have more mischief planned .
The Information Commissioner 's Office has launched a consultation on its new auditing powers , due to come into effect April 2010 .
The powers will allow the ICO to investigate organisations which it believes are failing to properly protect private data . ®
I ’ll leave to others to decide what the Reid remark / apology is .
But it ’s pretty clearly nothing that the incident that brought down then - Majority Leader Trent Lott , notwithstanding a lot of folks fairly tendentiously trying to suggest otherwise .
Reid ’s was an offensive remark — using race - tinged and now archaic phrases to make a point that is really not all that controversial in itself .
He apologized .
And now we ’ll have to see what the consequences turn out to be .
What happened with Lott was altogether different .
Two things in tandem ended Lott ’s career in the senate leadership .
First , Lott had a long history of support for and association with segregationist and white supremacist groups in the South .
Not in some distant past but in the year ’s just before his downfall .
( He was also a staunch opponent of virtually all civil rights legislation .
But that actually did n’t distinguish him that much for many other Southern Republicans of his generation . )
To a lot of us at the time it was always a bit of a mystery how someone with his record could have risen as high as he had .
This was all widely known in Washington , DC but it was by common agreement overlooked and excused .
( In many ways , because of this , it was a scandal of official Washington — as much as Lott . )
Then one day , Lott said this remarkable thing — if only the candidate of segregation ( Strom Thurmond ) had been elected president in 1948 , we ’d have avoided all the problems we ’ve had in recent decades .
Most other politicians could have walked away from this remark with the claim that they just had n’t thought through the implications of the statement .
The problem for Lott was that almost everything from his past suggested that he knew the implications exactly and believed them deeply .
To put it more baldly , too many past statements and actions made it clear he was a supporter of white supremacist politics and segregation .
Suddenly what official Washington had always ignored was open to intense scrutiny and his days were numbered .
Folks can make an argument for Reid ’s punishment on its own terms ; but the Lott analogy is laughable .
The colour of some feathers on dinosaurs and early birds has been identified for the first time , reports a paper recently published in Nature .
The research found that the theropod dinosaur Sinosauropteryx had simple bristles -- precursors of feathers -- in alternate orange and white rings down its tail , and that the early bird Confuciusornis had patches of white , black and orange - brown colouring .
Future work will allow precise mapping of colours and patterns across the whole bird .
Mike Benton , Professor of Palaeontology at the University of Bristol , said , " Our research provides extraordinary insights into the origin of feathers .
In particular , it helps to resolve a long - standing debate about the original function of feathers -- whether they were used for flight , insulation , or display .
We now know that feathers came before wings , so feathers did not originate as flight structures .
" We therefore suggest that feathers first arose as agents for colour display and only later in their evolutionary history did they become useful for flight and insulation . "
The team of palaeontologists from the University of Bristol , UK , the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology ( IVPP ) in Beijing , University College Dublin and the Open University report two kinds of melanosomes found in the feathers of numerous birds and dinosaurs from the world - famous Jehol beds of NE China .
Melanosomes are colour - bearing organelles buried within the structure of feathers and hair in modern birds and mammals , giving black , grey , and rufous tones such as orange and brown .
Because melanosomes are an integral part of the tough protein structure of the feather , they survive when a feather survives , even for hundreds of millions of years .
This is the first report of melanosomes found in the feathers of dinosaurs and early birds .
It is also the first report of phaeomelanosomes in fossil feathers , the organelles that provide rufous and brown colours .
These discoveries confirm the substantial body of evidence that suggests birds evolved through a long line of theropod ( flesh - eating ) dinosaurs .
It also demonstrates that the unique assemblage of characters that make a modern bird -- feathers , wings , lightweight skeleton , enhanced metabolic system , enlarged brain and visual systems -- evolved step - by - step over some 50 million years of dinosaur evolution , through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods .
" These discoveries open up a whole new area of research , " said Benton , " allowing us to explore aspects of the life and behaviour of dinosaurs and early birds that lived over 100 million years ago .
" Furthermore , we now know that the simplest feathers in dinosaurs such as Sinosauropteryx were only present over limited parts of its body -- for example , as a crest down the midline of the back and round the tail -- and so they would have had only a limited function in thermoregulation .
" Feathers are key to the success of birds and we can now dissect their evolutionary history in detail and see how each feather type -- and the fine detail of feather structure -- was acquired through time .
This will link with current work on how the genome controls feather development . "

Public School Buses
In india
At first sight these school buses may look horrifying , like miniature cattle wagons full of children .
But they are a feature of a type of culture that is different from America where yellow school buses shuttle children often over large distances .
This culture , common throughout the world is one that has grown organically , where distances are short enough to be cycled and where homebrew transportation is common .
The world 's rarest -- and most camera shy -- great ape has finally been captured on professional video on a forested mountain in Cameroon , according to the Wildlife Conservation Society and Germany 's NDR Naturfilm .
With the assistance of the Wildlife Conservation Society 's Cameroon Program , a film crew from the Hamburg - based NDR Naturfilm managed to video the elusive Cross River gorilla earlier this year in a stand of montane trees after weeks of effort in the Kagwene Gorilla Sanctuary .
The protected area was created in 2008 , with the guidance of WCS , specifically to protect the world 's rarest great ape .
" These gorillas are extremely wary of humans and are very difficult to photograph or film , " said Dr. Roger Fotso , Director of the Wildlife Conservation Society 's Cameroon Program .
" Eventually , we identified and staked out some of the gorillas favorite fig trees , which is where we finally achieved our goal . "
" It 's unbelievable that one great ape subspecies has never been filmed for TV so far , " said Jörn Röver , Head of NDR Naturfilm .
" We hope that our international production helps to raise awareness for these magnificent creatures and the work of the WCS . "
The only previous footage available of the rare apes was taken from a long distance with a shaky , hand - held camera in 2005 by a field researcher .
Due to the steep mountain terrain , tracking gorillas in Kagwene is time - consuming and sometimes treacherous .
Through the years , WCS researchers have developed an effective non-invasive monitoring system aimed at keeping track of the gorillas without disturbing them or getting them used to human presence .
After weeks with WCS 's assistance , the crew finally filmed several minutes of two gorillas feeding on figs some 30 - 40 feet above the forest floor .
" These extraordinary images are vital for the fight to save the world 's least known and rarest ape as well as the mountain rainforest on which they depend , " said Dr. James Deutsch , Director of the Wildlife Conservation Society 's Africa Program .
" Over the past twenty years , local communities , the governments of Cameroon and Nigeria , funders , and committed conservationists have laid the foundation for a great conservation success story .
We hope these pictures will introduce to the world the lead players in this story , the Cross River gorillas themselves . "
Funders for efforts to conserve Cross River gorillas include : the US Fish and Wildlife Service , Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau ( the German Development Bank ) , the Arcus Foundation , WWF , the Margot Marsh Biodiversity Foundation , the Taronga Foundation , the Kolmarden Fundraising Foundation , and the North Carolina Zoo .
Classified as Critically Endangered by IUCN 's Red List , the Cross River gorilla is the rarest of the four subspecies of gorilla , numbering fewer than 300 individuals across its entire range in Cameroon and Nigeria .
It is one of two subspecies of western gorilla , the other being the western lowland gorilla .
The eastern gorilla includes two subspecies : the eastern lowland gorilla , and the famous mountain gorillas of the Virunga Mountains and southern Uganda ( the latter of which numbers approximately 700 individuals ) .
The Kagwene Gorilla Sanctuary is a small reserve , only 19.5 square kilometers in size .
Nevertheless , it contains a genetically important segment of the entire Cross River gorilla population ; it is estimated that the sanctuary currently contains approximately 16 individual animals .
While many populations of gorillas are threatened by poachers , the gorillas of Kagwene have been protected by the local belief that the apes are people and therefore cannot be hunted or consumed .
Elsewhere , hunting continues to be one of the biggest threats to Cross River gorillas in addition to habitat destruction .
Gorillas are occasionally targeted by bushmeat hunters in the region , and genetic analysis of the population reveals a reduction in numbers over the last 200 years that is most likely due to hunting .
The fragmentation of their forest habitat is caused by farming , road - building , and the burning of forests by pastoralists to encourage new grass for their herds .

As far as I ’m concerned , springtime is Dark and Stormy season .
As the rain pummels the ground here in the Pacific Northwest , a little window of blue sky nestled between two dark clouds in the neighboring distance makes me wish I were watching the rain fall from across a dark ocean , my little Caribbean fishing boat safe and sound under that warm patch of sunlight .
I ’d fill a tall glass with ice and a generous dose of Gosling ’s Black Seal rum from Bermuda , then reach into a wooden crate and withdraw a chilly little bottle of homemade ginger beer .
I ’d sip the cloudy mixture of liquid sunshine and sweet , dark nectar while I mindlessly squeezed a fresh lime into the glass .
Feet : Up .
The problem with living in Oregon when this mood strikes is the absence of little wooden shacks that sell cases of fresh ginger beer stacked on back porches .
But with some readily - available ingredients , a recipe I ’ve been revising for several years – and a few free minutes – I can easily transport myself to that little fishing boat on the sea .
You ’re going to need a little bit of equipment to make ginger beer .
It ’s nothing too tricky ( save for one tool ) and most of it will last you a lifetime .
So follow along , and remember : I promise you that this will be easy .
You have two options for carbonating your ginger beer : you can ferment it in the bottle , or you can carbonate on - the - fly with an iSi soda siphon .
While the soda siphon is easier to use , for the sake of authenticity you might want your ginger beer fermented in the bottle .
If you ’re going to go the iSi route , pick up a soda siphon and meet me at the next step .
The rest of you , follow me .
The first thing on your list if you ’re going to be brewing in the bottle is any number of 16 - ounce “ EZ ” flip - top bottles .
You can find these on the internet , at a craft store , or at any homebrewing supply place .
Pick up a few to start .
Next , find some wine yeast .
I use Red Star Premier Cuvee champagne yeast .
It ’s sturdy , it has n’t failed me yet , and it ’s inexpensive .
I pay about a buck for a packet that will make five gallons of this stuff .
Okay , on to making the actual ginger beer .
The only tricky piece of equipment I ’m going to suggest is a juice extractor .
Pick up the Juiceman Juice Extractor if you ’re just going to be making this stuff at home , or the Breville Juicer if you plan on making a lot of it .
Sure , you can use a grater , but you ’re going to need to fine - strain your grated ginger to avoid any chunks in the final product .
For the occasional home user , a Microplaner and some cheesecloth will be fine .
But when making this by the case at work , I always turn to my juice extractor .
The money is worth it if you want to make a lot of this stuff .
Peel and juice your ginger .
I find that 1½ ounces of fresh ginger tends to work out to roughly an ounce of ginger juice .
This base recipe will make one 16 - ounce bottle of ginger beer , so multiply the proportions by the number of bottles you will be using .
If you ’re going the siphon route , note that the canister will hold 32 ounces of ginger beer .
So double the batch , duh .
1 ounce ginger juice
2 ounces fresh lemon juice , finely strained
2 ounces simple syrup
11 ounces warm water ( cold if using the soda siphon )
Mix ingredients together .
If using a soda siphon , pour ingredients into canister , screw on lid , charge with CO2 , shake once , and refrigerate .
You ’re done .
If you ’re using bottles , fill each bottle with 16 ounces of your mixture and add roughly 25 granules of champagne yeast .
Seal the cap securely , shake well , and store for 48 hours – no more , no less – in a warm , dark place .
After 48 hours have passed , refrigerate immediately to halt the process .
After your bottled ginger beer is well chilled , mix up a Dark and Stormy , sit back , and imagine you ’re drifting along with me on that creaky little boat .
UPDATE : An easier and more consistent method for carbonating your ginger beer can be found here .
Cheers , friends .
Have a beautiful weekend .
By By Stephanie Dearing Jan 28 , 2010 in World Two Newfoundland women , out taking photographs of a beautiful sunset Monday evening , instead saw what they thought were missiles - headed their way .
" There is no indication that there was ever a rocket launch . "
Darlene Stewart and her neighbour , Emmy Pardy , saw the objects Monday evening .
Pardy described what she saw to " I saw a humungous bullet , silver - grey in colour and it had flames coming out of the bottom and a trail of smoke . "
Other With speculation over the sightings growing , the news that France had just tested an Liberal MP Soudas said he RCMP Sargent Wayne Edgecombe spoke to " We confirmed that it was something .
It 's nothing criminal . "
While the government has said the odd sighting does not constitute a threat to Canada , the lack of explanations has not comforted Newfoundland residents .
Harbour Mille , Newfoundland -
One of those women , Darlene Stewart , snapped photographs of the flying objects .
In subsequent interviews with media , Steward claimed the RCMP had confirmed she had photographed a missile .
However , the RCMP said they have concluded their investigation and did not find evidence of missiles .
The strange bullet - shaped objects were just UFOs .
Late Thursday , the Prime Minister 's Press Secretary , Dimitri Soudas told press Darlene Stewart and her neighbour , Emmy Pardy , saw the objects Monday evening .
Pardy described what she saw to CTV.ca , saying
Other reports have come in from Newfoundland of three objects seen in the sky , as well as sightings of a strange light seen in the sky Monday evening from Bona Vista and Fortune Bay .
Pardy told the CBC the object she saw seemed to come out of the ocean .
With speculation over the sightings growing , the news that France had just tested an M51 missile from a submarine based in the Atlantic Ocean near France had Burin Penninsula residents wondering if that is the source of the object captured by Stewart 's camera .
The Canadian government has said no missile tests were conducted Monday near Canada by any nation , including Canada .
Liberal MP Gerry Bryne , who hails from Newfoundland , has been raising questions about the safety of his constituents , agitating for answers to the mystery all week .
Soudas said he thought Stewart might have indeed photographed a missile -- a miniature one flown by a hobbyist .
RCMP Sargent Wayne Edgecombe spoke to CBC confirming the sighting was real , but he declined to divulge information about the matter saying While the government has said the odd sighting does not constitute a threat to Canada , the lack of explanations has not comforted Newfoundland residents .
Harbour Mille is a picturesque village nestled at the edge of the ocean in the south of Newfoundland .

Something ominous is ­happening in America .
What looked like a trivial rivalry between two overpaid TV hosts , Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien , is shaping up as a the twilight of the gods .
It all began last spring , when O'Brien succeeded Leno as permanent host of The ­Tonight Show , NBC 's flagship late - night ­programme .
Leno was given his own show in an earlier slot .
Then David ­Letterman 's winkie intervened : Letterman , star of the rival network CBS , confessed to a string of affairs with ­female colleagues , claiming he had been the victim of a $ 2 m ( £ 1.25 m ) plot to blackmail him .
Overnight , his talkshow turned into a must - see soap opera .
With no one watching either Leno or O'Brien , NBC panicked , and made plans to restore Leno to 11.35 and shunt O'Brien to the other side of midnight .
O'Brien started making sarcastic ­remarks on air , which culminated in him saying last Tuesday ( in Spanish ) : " NBC is run by brainless sons of goats who eat money and crap trouble . "
O'Brien is a vicious little Countdown winner of a man , all nervy smirk and Tintin quiff .
Leno is a spoon - faced eunuch with a bizarre silver afro .
So who cares whose show goes out when ?
Well , The Tonight Show has been ­going since 1954 , and has had only four ­permanent hosts .
It is the godfather of talkshows : a monolith , a whaleshark , a fixed point in the turning world of US television .
If it had effectively ­become The Tomorrow Morning Show , that was a big deal .
And those panicky ­reschedulings are seen as a symptom of something bigger : that the ­talkshow as a format , and the networks it ­sustains , are in crisis .
As if to confirm this , O'Brien finally quit NBC at the end of last week , with a reportedly $ 45 m ( £ 28 m ) exit package .
Good , I say .
If television has ­produced anything worse than the talkshow in its long history of lousy ­formats and hateful ideas , I 'd like to know what it is .
As a format , the talkshow actively works to purge everything it touches of sincerity or spontaneity , life or human joy .
The tone of engagement is one of mirthless bonhomie , a ­pantomimed five - minute friendship designed to fool neither guest , nor host , nor audience into imagining that the host has the slightest interest in what the guest is saying , or the guest the faintest interest in the questions .
When a guest has a book to plug , the host – as if to make quite clear the transaction that 's going on – reaches under his desk , pulls out a pristine hardback , and stands it upright on his desk so the camera can zoom in .
A weathervane of the insincerity is that the corniness of jokes in the host 's opening patter is positively celebrated .
Letterman finishes his joke .
It 's awful .
The band drops in a little musical sting : a rimshot , or a weary drum fill .
Letterman 's mouth twitches as if to pretend , after all these years , he 's surprised by this , and he turns his last - season 's - parsnip of a face in the direction of the bandleader to feign forbearance .
Leno 's shtick is much the same , though at this point he sometimes takes a pace back and half - raises a hand as if to say : " You guys ! "
All this reflex jadedness is , I ­suppose , intended to be ironic or knowing .
But it 's ironic without ironising anything , and knowing without knowing anything .
That constant blank smirk of directionless irony simply adds up to self - congratulation .
Presenters such as Jon Stewart , of The Daily Show , have attempted to send up the talkshow format , to wrench it into something new .
But the format proved too strong : instead of making the ­talkshow more Jon-Stewart-ish , ­Stewart ­became more talkshow - ish .
It 's often pointed out , with either ruefulness or weird pride , that the US talkshow does n't work in Britain .
The last attempt to do a wholesale Letterman – with house band and all – was Channel 5's The Jack Docherty Show , and it died a death .
I 'm not sure even Jack Docherty remembers it very well .
But it 's not as if we 've been short of awful chatshows of our own .
Think of Terry Wogan in the 1980s , bringing his beige guests on to his beige set , twitching his trousers up over his knees as he sat down and prepared to be avuncular .
Or Gloria Hunniford , her face an oasis of orange in a desert of pastels .
And Parky , a man who never asked a question that ended in a question mark when he could simply cue up a tinned anecdote with a statement : " You worked with Burton in the 60s .
And you drank with him , too .
Heh heh .
Interesting times . "
Or think of Jonathan Ross , the current king of the format , with his guests looking politely pained as he asks them about what they get up to in bed .
Ross is a talented broadcaster , Wogan a brilliant raconteur , and I 'm sure Parky is very nice in person .
­( Actually , I 'm not sure Parky is very nice in person but let that slide ; I bet Gloria is lovely . )
Chatshows still blow – and if the media landscape in which the chatshow was king is vanishing , that 's to the best .
If this puts paid to a world in which hardcore punks Hüsker Dü can find themselves being ­interviewed by Joan Rivers , we can all die that little bit happier .
Originally published in January 2010 : Guys , you are NOT going to believe this !
One of my colleagues was taking a tour of Titan Tower recently when , with nobody the wiser , he snuck into the board room of WWE ’s crack ( ed up ) writing staff , and he swiped Vince McMahon ’s hand - written script for the 2010 Royal Rumble match !
I know , I know , it would be totally unscrupulous and wrong to post it here and spoil the annual classic to the world , but come on now .
This is an incredible scoop !
So here , from the pen and mind of Vinnie Mac , to you , is what lies ahead on January 31 .
******
FORMAT
Justin Roberts does formal intros , explaining the rules .
If there ’s one thing I ca n’t get enough of , it ’s a man with a monotoned voice who whispers the first 85 % of a sentence and then grunts the last three or four words .
I have no idea why anyone misses Howard Finkel .
1. CM Punk
2. Matt Hardy
Give them ninety seconds to do some nifty reversals and false eliminations .
Let the smarks have some memorable moments , so that they ’ll be tempted to give the match no less than a *** rating when they write their blogs come Monday morning .
3. Finlay
Finlay ’s all - pro , and the fans respect him , so let him mix it up with both Punk and Hardy , playing to their strengths .
Tease some more eliminations .
It ’ll be like Christmas morning for those zit faced virgins .
4. Yoshi Tatsu
Give the impression that we ’re elevating talent by having Tatsu go hog wild with kicks and crazy flippy dippy crap .
Just for a goof , have Tatsu and Matt hit some old Hardy Boyz double team move on Punk , just to reference the Punk - Jeff Hardy feud from last summer .
Those fourteen year old wallflowers who buy the fluorescent armbands will feel really special .
5. Carlito
Continue the glorified stunt show and make those Hot Pocket snarfing smarks feel like we ’re totally changing our course .
Then have Punk toss out Tatsu after a cheap shot , just to show them who ’s boss .
If there ’s anything funnier than pulling the rug out from under the high expectations of these pale geeks , then I do n’t want to know what it is .
Morrison has a DVD coming out in February , so it ’s showcase time !
Moonlight drive for Carlito , Starship Pain for Punk .
Let Morrison and Hardy work together , despite being mortal enemies three years ago .
Like the kids at home are gonna remember .
7. Jack Swagger
Fans are n’t buying his push .
Must be the Deliverance Shuffle ™ he does on the way to the ring .
Let ’s reinforce his need to be pushed by having him dump Finlay .
Then the WCW fans that we have n’t demoralized can boo Swags .
Have Punk and Hardy keep going at it some more so that the tweener - kids can be distracted from that “ wrestling ” crap .
8. Kofi Kingston
Time to clear the dead wood !
Look , my wife ’s running for Senate .
We need a black man to go over strong , so that we can swing some votes our way .
Adios Carlito and Swagger !
Anytime the fans go “ BOOM ! BOOM ! ” , I ’m closer to a positive blurb in Jet magazine .
Credibility , here I come !
9. Dolph Ziggler
Let him wear Matt down with the sleeper hold , and have him actually knock Hardy out with it .
Then let Punk dump Hardy with ease .
Why ?
Because I ’m secretly delighted by the anguished shrieks of teenage girls , that ’s why .
It ’s the only common ground that Lawler and I have .
Also , Kofi and JoMo can tee off on Punk , because DVD sales and minority votes are a key to booking any match .
10 . Evan Bourne
Listen carefully : stuntman dive onto Ziggler and Morrison , stuntman elimination when Punk sends him flying .
Hear that sound ?
That ’s the pissed off virgins again .
Between them and the Hardyphiles , it ’s like ebb and flow .
11 . R- Truth
Yeah , like I ’m going to forget that he once made an album called “ InVinceAble ” and tried to hand out freebies in the parking lot of Raw a few years back .
Ziggler sends Grandmaster Flash out within 45 seconds .
Kofi then attacks Ziggler out of racial equality , or something .
I need to pay attention more when Linda goes on about ‘ political ethics ’ or who - what .
12 . Mark Henry
More showcasing !
Let ’s see those Connecticut Democrats call us racist if we have TWO blacks dominating at the same time !
Boom boom legdrop by Kingston on Ziggler , World ’s Strongest Slam on Punk .
Then have Morrison dance with Kofi and Henry to demonstrate that WWE promotes harmony between races .
We ’re practically civil rights pioneers at this point !
13 . William Regal
We need a plausible way to get Morrison tossed out so that he does n’t outshine DX , Show , Cena , and Batista later .
So he dumps out Regal , and then Punk dumps him moments later .
Now the fans are catching on that Punk might go the distance .
They ’ll think we ’re pushing him !
HAH !
14 . Kane
This is where Michael Cole earns his money : he screams about his record breaking year in 2001 , where he made eleven dump-outs .
Kane ’s been in a face - load of Rumbles , which Lawler can hype .
It does n’t change the fact that he ’s never once won , but who cares ?
He chokeslams everyone in the ring , saving Henry for last for the ‘ monster pop ’ .
Then he does the pyro thingie with his arms , because it ’s more important than actually tossing someone out .
The kids ’ll love it !
15 . Chris Jericho
Now the virgins can stop crying , because here comes their mascot .
We ’ll throw em a bone and let Jericho end Kofi ’s night right about here .
We ’ll even let Jericho avoid the chokeslam and hit Kane with the Codebreaker .
Note those sporadic pops from the disheveled smarks .
Remember this lesson : no matter how many times you ground your kids , you can still win their love back with ice cream .
It made me the shrewd father that I was for my three kids .
Three ?
Two ?
Right , two .
16 . Shawn Michaels
Time to make the kiddies happy again !
Shawn gets to carry four guys ( equivalent to one Nash ) , and let them bounce off of his forearm smashes .
Since Shawn ’s getting older , this can take up all ninety seconds .
Which is good , because now I ’m out of ideas .
17 . Santino Marella
Comedy spot , Shawn chucks him .
More forearm smashes .
Jeez , I wish I had n’t alienated Pat Patterson .
He was great at booking these things .
Have Shawn throw in a crotch chop too , that ’ll eat up some time .
18 . The Hurricane
Comedy spot , Shawn chucks him .
More forearm smashes .
Jeez , I wish I had n’t alienated Pat Patterson .
He was great at booking these things .
Have Shawn throw in a crotch chop too , that ’ll eat up some time .
19 . Drew McIntyre
Comedy spot , Shaw — oops , booking autopilot fail !
Ha ha , sorry , I did n’t realize that we were on someone that I wanna actually push !
Let Drew toss Mark Henry out .
Anytime you throw a 400 pounder out , the fans instantly buy you as a threat .
Remember when Cena dumped out Viscera in 2005 ?
I know I ’m not the only one !
20 . Cody Rhodes
Now we ’re in the “ take a corner , pretend to be throwing somebody out ” phrase .
That ’s when all but two guys go to the corners and ropes , and the remaining two are highlighted in the ring .
It keeps the ADD - addled fans from getting confused .
Anyway , Cody tussles with Michaels and actually hits the Cross Rhodes .
If they can stretch this out ninety seconds , we may yet get hailed as geniuses .
21 . Edge
Gotta set up Edge - Jericho for Mania , so Edge goes nuts and throws Jericho out as revenge for the heinous act of choosing a different partner after Edge got hurt for the 17th time .
To everyone in the ring : DON ’T TOUCH EDGE !
He ’s delicate !
Edge then eliminates himself by diving onto Jericho out of “ vengeance - induced madness ” .
PLEASE , Chris , make sure he does n’t hit the floor too hard ?
If his ACLs were any more frail , he ’d be on the injured list for a WNBA team .
22 . The Miz
Back to corner mode .
This time , Miz does a routine with Shawn in center ring , hitting the Skull Crushing Finale .
Look , it ’s not complicated .
If you want complicated , you should have ordered Genesis , okay ?
23 . Shelton Benjamin
Benjamin hits some crazy stuff on everyone .
This will give the guys time to lay around and sell the exhaustion of holding onto the ropes for five minutes at a time .
Then Miz can dump out Benjamin when he ’s not looking .
There ’s a metaphor in there about stuck up white people taking advantage of hard working blacks , and I ’m sure the voters will see it .
24 . MVP
MVP and Miz have a feud , unless we killed it off and I forgot .
No , it ’s still on , never mind .
Let em trade off stuff while everyone else plays dead .
No one ever wonders why fresh guys do n’t dump out the borderline comatose guys on the mat .
Never .
25 . Ted Dibiase
Legacy double team time !
Bye bye Kane !
The fans will be SHOCKED that he did n’t win it !
What a boon for this stud team to throw out a true legend of Royal Rumbles !
Rhodes and Dibiase then shake hands , because there ’s no dissension at all !
Cole and Lawler will emphasize this like they ’re selling Mighty Putty while hepped up on crank .
If I do n’t hear the phrase “ Marine - like skills ” from Cole at least twice , I will NOT be happy !
26 . Big Show
Headbutts for all !
27 . Batista
Clotheslines and spinebusters for all !
28 . John Cena
Shoulder tackles for all !
Also , he dumps Punk , because it ’s funny .
The more these brats argue on message boards and YouTube response videos , the more my stock remains stable .
Commence the whining !
29 . Zack Ryder
Ryder in , Ryder out , courtesy of Cena .
Zack ’s fresh , 24 years old , and has an interesting gimmick , but I ’m sure he ’s not worth making into a credible threat .
Also , Batista tosses out MVP for reasons that will become clear .
30 . Triple H
Ok , so we got seven heels ( Ziggler , McIntyre , Rhodes , Dibiase , Batista , Show , Miz ) against DX and Cena .
Let ’s watch the heroes overcome the odds !
First , Ziggler goes after a Pedigree ( I ’d forgotten Dolph was still in there , quite frankly ) .
Then DX and Cena can gang up on Show and send him packing .
He ’s been in there eight minutes anyway , so I ’m sure he ’s winded .
Then Rhodes and Dibiase can try dumping Cena out , but there will be a miscue and both men are sent to the floor instead !
TENSION !
Cena can then “ salute ” Dibiase , as a nod to the Marine films !
Insider references !
Finale :
That leaves Cena , Michaels , Hunter , McIntyre , Miz , and Batista .
Who ’s least important , least important , hmmm .
In any scenario , according to me , the least important person is always the Intercontinental champion .
Sorry , Drew .
The Attitude Adjustment ends your evening .
Cena will begin to celebrate , and the Miz can sneak up and chuck him out , thus making Miz a bigger heel for eliminating the crowd favorite .
Yes , I just typed that last sentence with a straight face .
DX now gangs up on Batista and Miz , keeping them at bay , using crotch chops to break up any potential fan narcolepsy .
After a false heel comeback that nobody will see coming , Hunter and Shawn collectively dump Batista .
In the blink of an eye , Hunter then dumps Shawn to prevent him from facing Undertaker at Wrestlemania !
TENSION !
Shawn stares at Hunter from the floor , making the same sad face he used to make when I ’d say “ Shawn , I really need you to put Vader over tonight ” .
Miz will then slowly rise , giving the smarks hope that he ’ll dump Hunter and that we ’ll be elevating a new star .
PSYCH !
Pedigree on Miz , goodbye Miz , HUNTER WINS !
Man , I had too much fun writing that .
Afterward , Shawn and Hunter celebrate together , because we only do happy endings for our shows now .
Besides ,
Shawn ’s such a sap these days .
Ever since we convinced him that peeing in the cup for Hunter at drug screening time was A - OK by his Savior , life ’s been easy .
Speaking of easy , I know Wrestlemania 26 will have an easy time shattering buyrate records with a Triple H -Sheamus main event for the coveted WWE Title .
The only problem will be coming up with a tagline for the event .
Is “ VOTE FOR LINDA ” too tacky ?

Last week , I was privileged to be a respondent to a lecture entitled “ The End of the World As We Know It : Neuroscience and the Semantic Apocalypse ” .
( Held at Canada ’s premier interdisciplinary department : The University of Western Ontario ’s Centre for the Study of Theory and Criticism . )
Thanks to the lecturer , Scott Bakker , and the other respondent , Ali McMillan , I ’m happy to post the entire lecture here as well as the responses .
Scott ’s lecture aimed to provoke high - minded critical theorists out of their self - contentment , arguing that the results of neuroscience have far more radical implications for philosophy , the subject , and meaning than any poststructuralist critique .
As the author of a recent fictional psychothriller ( Neuropath ) – about which Metzinger has said , “ This book has emotionally hurt and disturbed me in a way none have done in many years .
You should think twice before reading this – there could be some scientific and philosophical possibilities you do n’t want to know ! ” – Scott is well equipped to explore the apocalyptic implications of neuroscience .
My own response came next and should be somewhat familiar to readers of this blog .
It was based on an earlier post of mine , and aimed ( unsurprisingly ) to resist some of dire conclusions Scott draws .
It also , secondarily , acted as an intro to speculative realism for the uninitiated – including brief summaries of Brassier and Meillassoux ’s projects .
Lastly , I tried to broach the question of the political implications of neuroscience – but squeezed for time , only managed to briefly touch upon it .
Ali ’s response came last , and used insights from analytic philosophy to try and counter Scott ’s lecture .
He argued for a compatibilist vision of free will , and used some of Benjamin Libet ’s famous experiments as evidence for his point .
More optimistic about philosophy ’s chances than either Scott or myself , Ali tried to revive some traditional philosophical concepts , while still acknowledging the significance of neuroscience .
I believe all three lectures together present an interesting starting point for thinking about the relation between neuroscience and philosophy .
And while none of the questions between our respective positions were really resolved in the debates afterwards ( even after a few beers ) , it was clear that we all agreed neuroscience needs to be taken seriously by philosophy .
If we can minimally agree that we ’re not disembodied abstract beings , then the fundamental constraints of our material selves are of the utmost importance for philosophy .
Since the lectures are rather lengthy , they ’ve been posted below the fold …
Scott Bakker , “ The End of the World As We Knew It : Neuroscience and the Semantic Apocalypse ”
INTRODUCTION
I need to begin by saying that I am a writer , not an academic , and certainly not a researcher .
And if this was n’t enough for you to sprinkle a little sceptical salt across the salad of ideas I will be presenting , you should know that I write not literary fiction , but the lowest form of commercial fiction short of Harlequin romances , epic fantasy .
Given that epic fantasy was the genre most likely to be dismissed or lampooned by academic specialists , by ‘ serious people in the know , ’ I figured that was where the action had to be .
Because I think we ’re trapped in a game theory nightmare , because I think that we–whatever we are–are doomed even if the technological optimists are right , I see myself as a ‘ post - posterity writer , ’ as part of the first generation of writers who cannot pretend that subsequent generations will redeem the esotericism of their works .
The only literature I ’m interested in , indeed the only literature I think has positive social value , is literature that reaches beyond the narrow circle of the educated classes , and so reaches those who do not already share the bulk of a writer ’s values and attitudes .
Literature that actually argues , actually provokes , rather than doing so virtually in the imaginations of the like - minded .
Living literature .
One of the downsides of being kicked out of your philosophy PhD program is that you can no longer avail yourself of the many self - congratulatory myths provided by the academy .
I ’ve had to make up new ones .
So I ’ve become exceedingly fond of seeing myself as a ‘ thinker . ’
As much as I would love to put a capital T on the term , I ’ve yet to summon the hubris to do so .
But even still , I ’ve been telling myself that the world needs crackpots , and that institutions like yours , cleaving to outdated pseudo - cognitive scruples , are dedicated to rubbing us out .
You see , I really am free to think whatever the hell I want , so long as I continue telling rip-roaring yarns .
I can pursue any and all the ideas that used to cause me so many institutional and interpersonal headaches when I was still pursuing my degree .
So I ’m going to write as I think a thinking writer should write , as someone who can perhaps offer a fresh perspective precisely because they are an institutional outsider , unconstrained by the various path dependencies that so often deliver us to dead ends .
And as a writer and thinker both , the thing I am most interested in is this … this very moment now …
Whatever the hell it is .
NEUROPATH
I came up with the idea for my last book , Neuropath , in the course of several conversations with my wife .
She ’s never particularly cared for epic fantasy as a genre , not even the kind that features lawn ornaments for characters , so I thought it would be nice to write something in her preferred ‘ guilty pleasure ’ genre , the psycho - thriller .
I had recently finished teaching a Pop Culture course where , given my growing contempt for semiotics , I decided to take an evolutionary biological approach , to look at mass mainstream culture as a modern prosthesis for various aspects of our stone age minds .
So my head was swimming with nifty analogies and formulations .
We thought we were the centre of the universe–science showed us wrong .
We thought we were struck in God ’s image–science showed us wrong .
We still think we ’re the great ‘ meaning maker ’ –and now science seems to be showing us wrong , that this is simply another conceit of our limited perspective .
What an awesome premise for a hack - and - slash sexploitation piece .
The idea was to write something set in a near - future where now nascent technologies of the brain had reached technical , and more importantly , social maturity , a time where the crossroads facing us –the utter divergence of knowledge and experience –had become a matter of daily fact .
A time when governments regularly use non-invasive neurosurgical techniques in interrogations .
A time when retail giants use biometric surveillance to catalogue their customers , and to insure that their employees continually smile .
A time after the apocalypse .
Truth be told , this talk represents something of a homecoming for me–I am extremely grateful to Nandita Biswas - Mellamphy and the Centre for the Study of Theory and Criticism for affording me this opportunity .
Neuropath represents both how far I have and have not travelled from the things I once believed as a student here .
Man , did I think I was a radical badass .
I ’ve migrated from an odd brand of post - structuralism to an odd brand of contextualism to a downright bizarre species of sceptical naturalism .
I am half mad for interdisciplinarity .
Which is why I offer this general discussion of the novel ’s philosophical underpinnings , both as a cautionary tale and an act of provocation .
You are not so radical as you think .
In fact , you are nothing at all .
THE ARGUMENT AND THE ARGUMENTS
Ostensibly , the narrative of Neuropath is structured around something called ‘ The Argument , ’ which is simply that humans are fundamentally biomechanical , such that intentionality can only be explained away .
Rather than enter the conceptual jungle of the determinism / compatibilism debate–where interpretative ambiguity and ‘ death by a thousand qualifications ’ allows every position to think themselves right –I try to steer the dilemma away from intractable metaphysical grounds .
The dilemma simply does not need guesses regarding materialism or the fundamental nature of causation or what have you to bite .
Whatever a mechanism is ‘ fundamentally , ’ it obviously strikes us as incompatible with any number of intentional concepts .
The Argument is something that people tend to ‘ get ’ even in the absence of specialized training , such as the kind we all suffer .
Personally , I stumbled onto it as a fourteen year old .
But aside from the Argument , which I do n’t think requires rehearsing here , the narrative presents several secondary arguments , which taken as a whole seem to paint mind and meaning into an exceedingly difficult corner .
The first is a straightforward pessimistic induction .
Historically , science tends to replace intentional explanations of natural phenomena with functional explanations .
Since humans are a natural phenomena we can presume , all things being equal , that science will continue in the same vein , that intentional phenomena are simply the last of the ancient delusions soon to be debunked .
Of course , it seems pretty clear that all things are not equal , that humans , that consciousness in particular , is decidedly not one more natural phenomena among others .
The second involves what might be called ‘ Cognitive Closure FAPP . ’
This argument turns on the established fact that humans are out and out stupid , that the only thing that makes us seem smart is that our nearest competitors are still sniffing each other ’s asses to say hello .
In the humanities in particular , we seem to forget that science is an accomplishment , and a slow and painful one at that .
The corollary of this , of course , is that humans are chronic bullshitters .
I ’m still astounded at how after decades of rhetoric regarding critical thinking , despite millennia of suffering our own stupidity , despite pretty much everything you see on the evening news , our culture has managed to suppress the bare fact of our cognitive shortcomings , let alone consider it any sustained fashion .
Out of the dozen or so instructors of practical reasoning courses that I have met , not one of them has done any reading on the topic .
The fact is we all suffer from cognitive egocentrism .
We all seem to intuitively assume that we have won what I call the ‘ Magical Belief Lottery . ’
We cherry pick confirming evidence and utterly overlook disconfirming evidence .
We automatically assume that our sources are more reliable than the sources cited by others .
We think we are more intelligent than we in fact are .
We rewrite memories to minimize the threat of inconsistencies .
We mistake claims repeated three or more times as fact .
We continually revise our beliefs to preempt in - group criticism .
We regularly confabulate .
We congenitally use our conclusions to determine the cogency of our premises .
The list goes on and on , believe you me .
Add to this the problem of Interpretative Underdetermination , the simple fact that our three pound brains are so dreadfully overmatched by the complexities of the world …
Maybe we will discover Adorno ’s ‘ Messianic moment ’ –more importantly , maybe we already have .
But the fact is we simply lack the capacity to collectively recognize it .
As Richard Dawkins is prone to point out in his interviews , the thing that distinguishes scientists is that even if they disagree , they do tend to agree on what would change their minds .
We do n’t .
This is what cripples the pre-emptive and ‘ separate but equal ’ approaches that were my favourite theoretical security blankets back when I was first a Heideggerean and then a Wittgensteinian .
In the first instance , I was inclined to believe that science , since it lacked the conceptual resources to examine its own assumptions , was simply a kind of bad philosophy in desperate need of diagnostic interpretation to straighten itself out .
In the second instance , I was inclined to think that science was simply another language game which , despite the obvious power of its domain specific normative yardsticks , did n’t necessarily carry reductive water in other language games .
Now , I no longer pretend to know What Science Is .
Maybe it is a kind of bad philosophy .
Maybe it is a kind of language game or normative context or whatever your unexplained explainer happens to be .
But since we are such theoretical bunglers outside the institutional confines of science as a matter of fact , it strikes me as more than a little inconsistent to use exclusive commitments to any of these speculative interpretations to then condition my commitments to scientific claims–a little too like using a cognitive Ted Bundy ’s testimony to convict a cognitive Mother Theresa .
Some people belief the earth is flat .
Some people believe the earth is young .
Some believe that the earth is hollow and that Hitler hides within it , waiting for the day to sort things out .
Still others believe the earth is a social construct .
Beliefs are so cheap it ’s amazing they do n’t sell them at Walmart .
Cognitive Closure FAPP , the fact that we are theoretical half - wits outside of science , is what forces the issue , what closes the sophistical door .
What warrants a long , hard , and most importantly , honest look at the troubling implications of science .
CONSCIOUSNESS AS COIN TRICK : THE BLIND BRAIN HYPOTHESIS
What if we ’ve been duped , not simply here and there , but all the way down , when it comes to experience ?
What if consciousness were some bizarre kind of hoax ?
The final secondary argument offered in the novel is based on something called the ‘ Blind Brain Hypothesis . ’
Consciousness is so strange , so little understood , that anything might result from the current research in neuroscience and cognitive science .
We could literally discover that we are little more than epiphenomenal figments , dreams that our brains have cooked up in the absence of any viable alternatives .
Science is ever the cruel stranger , the one who spares no feelings , concedes no conceits no matter how essential .
In the near future world of Neuropath , this is precisely what has happened under the guise of the Blind Brain Hypothesis , the theoretical brainchild of the story ’s hero , Thomas Bible .
Consider coin tricks .
Why do coin tricks strike us as ‘ magic ’ ?
When describing them , we say things like “ poof , there it was . ”
The coin , we claim , “ materialized from thin air ” or “ appeared from nowhere . ”
We tend , in other words , to focus on the lack of causal precursors , on the beforelessness of the coin ’s appearance , as the amazing thing .
But why should ‘ beforelessness ’ strike us as remarkable to the point of magic ?
From an evolutionary standpoint , the uncanniness of things appearing from nowhere seems easy enough to understand .
Our brains are adaptive artifacts of environments where natural objects such as coins generally did n’t ‘ pop into existence . ’
Our brains have evolved to process causal environments possessing natural objects with interrelated causal histories .
When natural objects appear without any apparent causal history , as in a coin trick , our brains are confronted by something largely without evolutionary precedent .
Instances of apparent beforelessness defeat our brains ’ routine environmental processing .
The magic of coin tricks , one might say , is a function of our brains ’ hardwired abhorrence of causal vacuums in local environments .
The integration of natural objects into causal backgrounds is the default , which is why , we might suppose , the sense of magic immediately evaporates when we look over the magician ’s shoulder and the causal history of the coin is revealed .
The magic of coin tricks , in other words , depends on our brains ’ relation to the coin ’s causal history .
Expose that causal history , and the appearing coin seems a natural object like any other .
Suppress that causal history ( through misdirection , sleight of hand , etc. ) , and the appearing coin exhibits beforelessness .
It seems like magic .
I bring this up because so many intentional phenomena exhibit an eerily similar structure .
Consider , for instance , your present experience of listening .
The words you hear ‘ are simply there . ’
You experience me speaking ; nowhere does the neurophysiology –the causal history –of your experience enter into that experience as something experienced .
You have no inkling of sound waves striking your eardrum .
You have no intuitive awareness of your cochlea or auditory cortex .
Like the coin , this experience seems to arise ‘ ready made . ’
The Blind Brain Hypothesis proposes that this is no accident .
Various experiential phenomena , it suggests , are best understood as a kind of magic trick–only one that we cannot see through or around because our brain itself is the magician .
Whether or not the so - called ‘ thalamocortical system ’ turns out to be the ‘ seat of consciousness , ’ one thing is clear : the information that finds its way to consciousness represents only a small fraction of the brain ’s overall information load .
This means that at any given moment , the brain ’s consciousness systems possess a kind of ( fixed or dynamic ) information horizon .
What falls outside this information horizon , we are inclined to either overlook completely or attribute to the so - called ‘ unconscious ’ –a problematic intentional metaphor if there ever was one .
Just as the magic of coin tricks is a function of our brains ’ blinkered relation to the coin ’s causal history , the Blind Brain Hypothesis suggests that many central structural characteristics of consciousness are expressions of our brains ’ blinkered relation to their own causal histories , an artifact of the thalamocortical information horizon .
Given that our brains are in fact largely blind to their own neurophysiological processing , it seems clear that an information horizon exists in some form .
Structurally , the brain is simply too complicated to track itself .
Developmentally , the brain lacked both the time and the evolutionary impetus to track itself .
When we access our brain ‘ from the outside , ’ we ’re exploiting circuits developed over millions and millions of years of evolution .
Our brains are primarily environmental processors , exquisitely adapted to how things are in their environments .
As a result , when we access our brains as another object in our environment , we have tremendous success ‘ seeing how things are ’ with our brains .
When we access our brain ‘ from the inside , ’ however , we ’re forced to completely forgo all this powerful circuitry .
Instead , we ’re limited to what seem to be relatively recent evolutionary adaptions , the ‘ wiring of conscious experience . ’
Our brains are not primarily brain processors , and as a result , we have tremendous difficulty ‘ seeing how things are ’ with our brains–so much so that we cannot even see ourselves as anything remotely resembling the brains we encounter in our environment .
Given these structural and developmental handicaps , information horizons have to exist .
The real question is one of how they impact consciousness .
That the absence of information does affect experience becomes immediately clear if you simply attend to your visual field .
You can actually track the falling off of information from your fovea–a spot the size of your thumbnail held out arm ’s length–across your periphery and into …
Oblivion ?
In fact , the point at which your visual field trails away lies outside of the very possibility of seeing .
Sight simply does not exist on the far side of your ‘ visual information horizon . ’
We rely on other , non-visual systems to stitch successive visual fields into a coherent spatial environment , and so tend to ‘ overlook ’ the limits of our looking .
As mundane as this might sound , this example actually underscores something truly remarkable .
It seems clear that the ‘ trailing away ’ of our visual field is a basic structural feature of visual experience , a positive feature .
So does this mean it possesses neural correlates ?
Does it make sense to infer the existence of ‘ visual trailing ’ circuits ?
If not , this suggests that a neurophysiological lack can manifest itself as a positive feature of experience , in this case , the closure of our visual field .
In other words , not all experience possesses functional correlates ––at least not in the straightforward way we think .
Consider the ex nihilo character of volition , or they way want and desire simply ‘ come upon us . ’
According to the Blind Brain Hypothesis , decisions and affects simply arise at the point where they cross the information horizon and are taken up by the thalamocortical system .
Or consider the so - called ‘ transparency ’ of experience , the fact that we see trees , not trees causing us to see trees .
Since the processing involved in modeling environments falls outside the information horizon , all we access is the model and none of its constitutive neurological antecedents .
Intentionality also seems to fit .
Since the processing behind our recollection of trees , say , falls outside the information horizon , our brain substitutes an abbreviated synchronic relation , what we have conceptualized as ‘ aboutness , ’ for a diachronic one , the particular causal provenance of our recollection .
The structure of normativity provides another potential candidate : since the processing involved in the bottom - up generation of behavioural outputs largely falls outside the information horizon , the thalamocortical system can only use the ‘ tail end ’ of regularities , so to speak .
The brain only gives consciousness ‘ right ’ or ‘ wrong , ’ and nothing of the actual processing involved in testing .
Something similar might be said of purposiveness and the way teleology turns causality on its head : the information horizon encloses the circuitry involved in hypothetical modeling , but not much else , so even though our brain generates behavioural outputs bottom up , we perform actions for this or that –under the guise of bottomlessness .
‘ Goals , ’ the suggestion is , are what ’s left when the bulk of the brain ’s behavioural processing falls outside thalamocortical information horizon , save those involved in anticipation .
On this account , consciousness is a perpetual and quite impoverished middle - man , accessing , thanks to the information horizon , only opportunistic fragments of more global processes .
We ’re like a lone audience member , chained in front of the magician of our brain .
We can intellectually theorize the causal provenances that make the tricks possible , but we are ‘ hardwired into ’ our perspective , we are nevertheless forced to experience the ‘ magic . ’
Nothing , I think , illustrates this forced magic quite like the experiential present , the Now .
Recall what we discussed earlier regarding the visual field .
Although it ’s true that you can never explicitly ‘ see the limits of seeing ’– no matter how fast you move your head –those limits are nonetheless a central structural feature of seeing .
The way your visual field simply ‘ runs out ’ without edge or demarcation is implicit in all seeing–and , I suspect , without the benefit of any ‘ visual run off ’ circuits .
Your field of vision simply hangs in a kind of blindness you cannot see .
This , the Blind Brain Hypothesis suggests , is what the now is : a temporal analogue to the edgelessness of vision , an implicit structural artifact of the way our ‘ temporal field ’ – what James called the ‘ specious present ’ –hangs in a kind temporal hyper - blindness .
Time passes in experience , sure , but thanks to the information horizon of the thalamocortical system , experience itself stands still , and with nary a neural circuit to send a Christmas card to .
There is time in experience , but no time of experience .
The same way seeing relies on secondary systems to stitch our keyhole glimpses into a visual world , timing relies on things like narrative and long term memory to situate our present within a greater temporal context .
Given the Blind Brain Hypothesis , you would expect the thalamocortical system to track time against a background of temporal oblivion .
You would expect something like the Now .
Perhaps this is why , no matter where we find ourselves on the line of history , we always stand at the beginning .
Thus the paradoxical structure of sayings like , “ Today is the first day of the rest of your life . ”
We ’re not simply running on hamster wheels , we are hamster wheels , traveling lifetimes without moving at all .
Which is to say that the Blind Brain Hypothesis offers possible theoretical purchase on the apparent absurdity of conscious existence , the way a life of differences can be crammed into a singular moment .
But I ’m getting carried away .
If our brains were somehow , impossibly , wired to process themselves from the inside ( as the subject of introspection ) with the same fidelity with which they process themselves from the outside ( as the object of neuroscience ) , then one might expect the generation of ‘ action ’ to be experienced as one more thing within the great causal circuit of the environment .
Rather than experiencing desires ‘ motivating ’ those actions , our brains would simply experience the translation of environmental inputs into behavioural outputs in toto .
There would be no desire , only behaviour arising as another natural event .
Rather than experiencing norms constraining those actions , our brains would experience the processing of behavioural outputs against ongoing environmental input .
There would be no ‘ right or wrong , ’ no ‘ corrections , ’ only attenuations of behaviour in response to real - time environmental feedback .
Rather than experiencing purposes guiding those actions , our brains would experience the processing of behavioural outputs against past environmental feedback .
There would be no ‘ point ’ to our actions , only behaviour reinforced by previous environmental interactions .
But the ‘ wiring of consciousness ’ is far from complete , perhaps necessarily so .
And given evolutionary imperatives , it stands to reason that the thalamocortical system would exploit it ’s own limitations , leverage its own information horizon .
If the processing behind our environmental interventions is inaccessible , and if the ‘ ownership of actions ’ pays reproductive dividends , then the development of something like the ‘ feeling of willing ’ makes a strange kind of sense .
Since the greater brain behind the information horizon simply does not exist for the thalamocortical system , it has to cobble things together and make evolutionary due .
This , the Blind Brain Hypothesis suggests , could be the case for the ‘ feeling of aboutness , ’ the ‘ feeling of forness , ’ the ‘ feeling of rightness , ’ and so on .
None of these things feel like coin tricks , like magic , simply because they are the mandatory constant , not defections from an otherwise causal background .
But they seem to vanish when we look of the brain ’s shoulder –they share the same antipathy to causal cognition –because they are , in a strange way , artifacts of an analogous limitation of our perspective , more the result of what we lack than what we possess .
If the Blind Brain Hypothesis turns out to be true ( and heaven help us if it does ) , then consciousness could be–basically , fundamentally –a kind of coin trick .
The so - called ‘ hard problem , ’ the problem of explaining consciousness in naturalistic terms , could be insoluble simply because there ’s no such natural phenomena as ‘ consciousness . ’
The magic can only vanish as soon as the coin trick is explained .
In this case , we are the magic .
For me , this is where the plank of reason breaks .
Where things become apocalyptic .
CONCLUSION
As a former graduate of the Theory Centre , my suspicion is that many of you might interpret these speculative ramblings as a kind of naturalistic distortion / vindication of the ‘ post - modern subject . ’
The ‘ fragmentary subject ’ is old hat in circles such as these , old enough to have long ceased being radical ( though for some strange reason I still regularly encounter people who insist talking about it radical tones of voice ) .
This is the reason , I think , some are initially underwhelmed by the implications of the Blind Brain Hypothesis .
First , we need to appreciate that the institutional migration of these concerns from armchairs ( or couches , as the case might be ) to research centres is as drastic as can be .
People who do not appreciate the distinction between philosophy considering these possibilities and science considering them , it seems to me , are typically those who , despite all reason , think that their theoretical philosophical positions warrant exclusive commitment –who think they ’ve won the Magical Belief Lottery .
Since they already think the post - modern subject true , further confirmation strikes them as superfluous .
But as I said , few things are quite as cheap as belief .
Hopefully my earlier discussion of our cognitive shortcomings makes the irrationality of exclusive commitment to any of these speculative forays clear .
We are theoretical cripples .
More importantly , scientific claims tend to be socially actionable , immediately , particularly given its thoroughgoing integration with capital .
Nielsen ’s recent billion dollar plus investment in NeuroFocus is but the beginning of the so - called neuromarketing revolution .
And given that technological advantages without obvious near - term deleterious effects always seem to be exploited in capital societies , the technologization of the brain , ranging from the therapeutic to the ‘ neurocosmetic , ’ seem inevitable .
Second , I think that if you look closely at those discourses that turn on some notion of decentred subjectivity , either in various ‘ philosophies of difference ’ or elsewhere , you will notice a kind of inconsistency .
No matter how radical the revision , thinkers of difference generally treat the components of that subjectivity –affects , meanings , purposes , morals , moments–as wholes .
The fragmentation , I ’m suggesting , goes all the way down .
It ’s not that we are not the self - present subjects of early enlightenment myth–an illusion easily explained by the invisibility of ignorance .
It ’s that we are not subjects at all .
Even though I refuse to believe the Blind Brain Hypothesis , I often find myself terrified–and I mean this quite literally –by the strange , inside - out sense it seems to make once you grasp its central intuition .
Even the way it seems to confound reason possesses a peculiar explanatory force .
Consider what might be called the ‘ Bottleneck Thesis , ’ which might be expressed as : we are natural in such a way that it is impossible to fully conceive of ourselves as natural .
In other words , we are our brains in such a way that we can only understand ourselves as something other than our brains .
Expressed in this way , the thesis is not overtly contradictory .
It possesses an ontological component , that we are fundamentally ‘ physical ’ ( whatever this means ) , and an epistemological component , that we cannot know ourselves as such .
The plank in reason breaks when we probe the significance of the claim–step inside it as it were .
If we can not understand ourselves as natural , then we must understand ourselves as something else .
And indeed we do , as we must , understand ourselves as agents , knowers , sinners , and so on .
We may define this ‘ something else ’ in any number of ways , but they all share one thing in common : a commitment to a spooky bottomless ontology , be it social , existential , or otherwise , that is fundamentally incompatible with naturalism .
We can disenchant the world , but not ourselves .
Although not contradictory , the Bottleneck Thesis does place us in a powerful cognitive double - bind .
Despite the sheen of philosophical respectability , when we speak of the irreducibility of consciousness and norms as a way to secure the priority of life - worlds and language - games as ‘ unexplained explainers , ’ we are claiming an exemption from the natural .
How could this not be tendentious ?
The only thing that separates our supra-natural posits from supernatural things such as souls , angels , and psychic abilities is the rigour of our philosophical rationale .
Not a comforting thought , given philosophy ’s track record .
Moreover , these supra-natural posits are in fact fundamentally natural .
Their apparent irreducibility is merely a subreptive artifact of our natural inability to understand them as such in the first instance .
But then , once again , the only way we can assert this is by presupposing the very irreducibility we are attempting to explain away .
We simply cannot be fundamentally natural because of the way we are fundamentally natural .
Given the absurdity of this , should we not just dismiss the Bottleneck out of hand ?
Perhaps , but at least two considerations should give us pause .
First , there is a sense in which the Bottleneck Thesis is justified as an inference to the best explanation for the cognitive disarray that is our bread and butter .
Say sentients belonging to an advanced alien civilization found some dead human astronauts and studied their neurophysiology .
Say these sentients were similar to us in every physiological respect save that evolution was far kinder to them , allowing them to neurophysiologically process their own neurophysiology the way they process environmental inputs , such that for them introspection was a viable mode of scientific investigation .
Where we simply see trees in the first instance , they see trees as neurophysiological results in the first instance .
Studying the astronauts , these alien researchers discover a whole array of neuro - functional similarities , so that they can reliably conclude that this does that and that does this and so on .
The primary difference they find , however , is that our thalamocortical systems have a relatively limited information horizon .
After intensive debate they conclude that humans brains likely lack the ability to process themselves as something belonging to the causal order of their environment .
Human brains , they realize , probably understand themselves in noncausal terms .
They then begin speculating about what it would be like to be human .
What , they wonder , would noncausal phenomenal awareness look like ?
They cannot imagine this , so they shift to less taxing speculations .
On the issue of human self - understanding , the alien researchers suggest that with the early development of their scientific understanding , humans , remarkably , would begin to see themselves as an exception to the natural order of things , as something apart from their brains , and would be unable , no matter what the evidence to the contrary , to divest themselves of the intuition .
‘ There would be much controversy ’ they suggest , ‘ regarding what they are . ’
On the issue of social coordination , the alien researchers conclude that humans would be forced to specify their behaviours in noncausal terms , as behaviour somehow exempt from the etiology of behaviour , and as a result would be unable to reconcile this intuitive understanding with their scientific understanding of the world .
Given that humans are capable of scientific understanding ( the specimens were , after all , astronauts ) , the aliens assume humans would perhaps attempt to regiment their understanding of their behaviour in a scientific manner , perhaps elaborate a kind of ‘ noncausal ethology ’ ( what we call ‘ psychology ’ ) , but they would be perpetually perplexed by their inability to reconcile that understanding with their science proper .
Human understanding of their linguistic behavioural outputs , the alien researchers assume , would likewise be characterized by confusion .
Once again the human ’s intuitive understanding would be noncausal , and given the maturation of their science , they might begin to question the reality of their hardwired default assumptions –their ‘ intuitive sense ’ of what was happening as far as language was concerned .
‘ There might be some noncausal X , ’ the aliens conclude , ‘ that for them constitutes the heart of their immediate linguistic understanding , but it would seem to vanish every time they searched for it . ’
( The X here , of course , would be what we call ‘ aboutness ’ ) .
Some more daring researchers suggest humans might eventually abandon this X , attempt to understand language in thoroughly terms .
But this would provide no escape from their dilemma , since such an understanding would seem to elide obvious phenomenal features that not only seem to belong to language , but to be constitutive of it .
( And here , of course , I ’m talking about normativity ) .
And so the aliens continue speculating , all the while marvelling at the poor blinkered creatures , and at the capricious whim of evolutionary fate that perpetually prevents them from effectively rationalizing their neurophysiological resources .
Is this story that farfetched ?
Could aliens , given intact specimens , predict things like the mind / body problem , the problem of moral cognitivism , the problem of meaning , and the like ?
With enough patience and ingenuity , I suspect they could .
The Bottleneck Thesis , I think , provides the framework for a very plausible explanation of the intractable difficulties associated with these and other issues .
The theoretical uroboros of the intentional and the physical , the human and the natural , has a long and hoary history , repeated time and again in drastically different forms through a variety of contexts .
It is as though we continually find ourselves , in Foucault ’s evocative words , at once “ bound to the back of a tiger ” and “ in the place belonging to the king . ”
This apparent paradox is a fact of our intellectual history , one that requires explanation .
As an adjunct to the Blind Brain Hypothesis , the Bottleneck Thesis not only explains why we seem to have so much difficulty with intentional phenomena in general , it explains why those difficulties take the forms they do across an array of different manifestations .
The second thing that should give us pause before rejecting the Bottleneck Thesis is that it constitutes a bet made on a eminently plausible neuro - evolutionary hypothesis : that our neurophysiology did not evolve to process itself the way it processes environmental inputs–that our brains are blind to themselves as brains .
Given evolution ’s penchant for shortcuts and morphological malapropisms , the possibility of such a neurophysiologically entrenched blind - spot , although grounds for consternation , should not be grounds for surprise .
So we have evolved , and so long as we continue to reproduce , our genes simply will not give a damn .
It would be pie-eyed optimism to assume otherwise .
There are cogent empirical and conceptual grounds , then , to think the Bottleneck Thesis might be true .
And short of actually discovering intentionality in nature , there is no way to rule it out as a possibility .
Certainly the absurdity of its consequences cannot tell against it , because such absurdity is precisely what one would expect given the truth of the Bottleneck .
If we have in fact evolved in such a way that we cannot understand ourselves as part of nature , then we should expect to be afflicted by cognitive difficulties at crucial junctures in our thought .
Nick Srnicek , “ Neuroscience , The Apocalypse , and Speculative Realism ”
Clearly the scenario Scott raises is a depressing one .
So what I want to do in my response here is to try and resist these conclusions .
My general approach is not going to be to directly attack your argument at the level of neuroscience or try to redefine free will in a way that makes it compatible with the natural sciences .
Instead , I ’m going to try and indirectly undermine these arguments by arguing against the absolute validity of neuroscientific knowledge .
In the other words , I want to argue that neuroscience is incapable of being a self - sufficient body of knowledge , and it therefore crucially relies upon philosophy to complete it .
I certainly do n’t think I definitively refute your argument , but I hope to at least make it less overwhelming .
To give away the ending , I am going to argue that presently neuroscience is bound to a correlationist interpretation and that it requires a new realist interpretation in order for its full power to be realized .
The side effect of such a reinterpretation will hopefully be to also limit the epistemological certainty of neuroscience that Scott ’s argument is premised upon .
CORRELATIONISM
So to begin with , I want to outline what I mean by a ‘ correlationist ’ interpretation – a term coined by Quentin Meillassoux in his recent diagnosis of post - Kantian philosophy .
He argues that ever since Kant ’s original prohibition , philosophy has resolutely avoided attempting to know the absolute , to know the in -itself .
Since then , all that has existed for philosophy is the correlation between thinking and being .
Any thought of an object is always the thought of that object as correlated to consciousness or language .
Speaking of the object - in - itself , speaking of a reality existing independently of thought , is denounced as naïve and a return to pre-critical metaphysics .
And this prohibition has continued on throughout the continental tradition , arguably even Deleuze , with each progressive philosopher claiming to have discerned a more fundamental variant of the correlation .
The result being that the findings of science have never been taken literally .
The statements of science – which ostensibly refer to objects - in - themselves – have always been crippled by philosophy ’s interpretations of them .
The correlationist always adds ( at least implicitly ) the crucial caveat that while “ X may be true , it is true for us “ .
The explicit realism of the scientific statement is always implicitly neutered and philosophy is once again given the upper hand .
The primary problem with such a shift simply lies in its making reality centered on us , on humans .
We can see here that far from being philosophy ’s Copernican revolution , Kant ’s transcendental subject was in fact the negation of science ’s incipient inhumanism .
And we ’ve never been able to fully extricate ourselves from this since .
To escape correlationism then , what is required is to take science ’s declarations at their literal face value – science truly speaks of an inhuman world .
In doing so , though , we must be careful not to return to a naïve realism ; what is required instead is a new type of realism .
NEUROSCIENCE BOUND
With that in mind , let ’s see how neuroscience fairs .
Is it the case that the typical interpretation of neuroscience is one that subtly embeds the science into a correlationist philosophy ?
My answer will be yes , but to see why , I ’ll need to take a brief detour through Thomas Metzinger ’s work .
I take him as an exemplar because he has systematized the neurophilosophical project – specifically , the project that Scott is interested in , to reduce the self to the brain .
For Metzinger , simply put , subjectivity is nothing more than a phenomenal appearance , fundamentally the same as any other phenomenal appearance .
It has characteristics that distinguish it from other phenomena , but it ’s still an appearance , a product of the brain .
There is no subject that it appears to ; the subject simply is the appearance .
In order to account for this appearance , he attempts to show how subjectivity emerges as the product of particular constraints being fulfilled by a neuro - informational system .
What does this mean ?
An example might help .
There ’s multiple constraints , but let ’s look at a constraint he calls ‘ global availability ’ .
What this refers to simply is the ability of our brain to take information and make it available for the system itself .
This can occur on three analytically distinct levels – the behavioural , the attentional , and the cognitive .
Phenomenologically , these refer , respectively , to our ability to react to information , our ability to focus our attention on particular things , and our ability to form concepts of our experience .
Straightforward enough , but where it gets interesting is in the fact the each constraint can be fulfilled and not fulfilled , and to varying degrees .
For example , let ’s look at what ’s called blindsight .
As the result of specific lesions in their visual cortex , individuals with blindsight have lost the ability to see a particular portion of their world .
There ’s literally a blindspot in their visual field .
The visual information for that section has , in Metzinger ’s terminology , lost its global availability .
Yet , when placed into specific experimental set-ups , these same individuals can still show signs that they – on some level – still have the information from that visual blindspot .
They can , for example , correctly tell whether an object is within their blind spot .
Yet when presented with their ability to continually guess correctly , they vigorously deny it , chalking it up to luck or a hunch .
What has occurred here is a separation between the functional and the phenomenological aspects of the brain .
The phenomenology of global availability is gone , destroyed by the lesion .
Yet the sensory inputs are still importing the information into the brain .
And so long as that information bypasses the lesion , it can still be used by the system .
So while these individuals can never consciously see the object , they can still unconsciously react to it .
Blindsight , therefore , is an example of where one constraint has gone unfulfilled .
There are about 10 other constraints , but it ’s not important to outline them here .
Instead we can skip directly to what ’s interesting about this way of talking about neurophenomenology : specifically , that Metzinger ’s search for constraints mirrors Kant ’s own search for the transcendental conditions of experience .
Both Kant and Metzinger are asking what conditions are required for experience to be possible .
But of course , rather than ultimately finding the source of these conditions within a transcendental subject , Metzinger finds them in the brain .
And rather than describing experience as a single formal structure comprised of intuitions and categories , Metzinger offers a much more nuanced view of experience .
Despite these advances though , in framing the interpretation of neuroscience this way , Metzinger still seems to place neurology in the clutches of a classic Kantian problem .
And Metzinger himself even seems somewhat aware of it , as he will repeatedly argue that phenomenal immediacy is not epistemic immediacy , or as Kant might have put it – the phenomenal is not the noumenal .
What appears as immediately and intuitively given has no necessary relation with an independent world .
We have no way of verifying that our experience truthfully reproduces an external world .
And since our own subjectivity is simply an appearance , this applies to it too .
Now this claim that phenomenal immediacy is not epistemic immediacy certainly is supported by the neuroscientific evidence .
Our brain takes in sensory information and processes it in very specific ways ; our experience is simply the end - product of these subpersonal processes – a movie without an audience .
The problem is that our scientific knowledge is based upon our experiences ; yet neuroscience appears to have debunked experience as being a reliable ground for knowledge .
The very empirical grounding of neuroscience seems to be called into question by neuroscience itself .
Unlike other sciences that study phenomena ‘ out in the world ’ , neuroscience has the unique characteristic that it studies , and eventually undermines , its own empirical premises .
So our question is : if neuroscience can’t ground its own knowledge , if neuroscience alone is not self - sufficient or self - postulating , then where does this leave us ?
It seems as though we are stuck once again within the correlationist circle .
Any knowledge of the real - in - itself is forbidden , except as an empty formal postulate .
( Metzinger , for example , will insist that we are embodied beings – but he admits that we ’re incapable of knowing whether or not we ’re simply brains in a vat . )
What this entails is that contra Scott ’s argument , we can never be absolute certainty that free will is a total illusion .
We just ca n’t have knowledge of what goes on outside of our form of experience .
The thing to resist here , however , is the opposite reaction , which would be to simply say “ Aha !
Neuroscience is insufficient and therefore we can continue doing philosophy as we always have ! ”
As I tried to argue earlier , such a move is a dead - end that ignores science ’s effectiveness .
What we need to do is to find a way to escape the choice between on the one hand , the uncritical acceptance of neuroscience , and on the other hand , the idealism of correlationism .
At the very least , this means finally removing the remnants of idealist philosophy .
We must accept that we are embodied beings living in a fundamentally inhuman world – one that is indifferent both to our conceptualizations and to our needs .
There can be no recourse to a transcendental subjectivity , and there can be no recourse to a theological being .
What philosophy needs to do , is to actually carry out a Copernican revolution and to face up to the desolate and indifferent nature of reality .
This , at the very least , should be neuroscience ’s effect on philosophy .
THE GREAT ESCAPE
But what can we do to break out of the correlationist circle ?
There are two options , based on two philosophers , that I want to suggest as an alternative to your apocalyptic vision , Scott .
I ’ll have to necessarily go quickly through them , but after that I want to finish by noting the possible political implications of neuroscience .
The philosophers I have in mind are Ray Brassier and Quentin Meillassoux , two philosophers who are associated with what ’s been called speculative realism .
As is clear from that moniker , both are avowed realists , but theirs is a realism that has passed through Kant ’s critical turn .
Speaking schematically , we could distinguish them by saying that Brassier will begin his project from outside of the correlationist circle , while Meillassoux aims to open the circle from within .
I ’ll begin with Brassier , since he ’s the philosopher currently taking the nihilistic conclusions of Scott ’s presentation the furthest .
As Brassier will say in his book , “ the disenchantment of the world deserves to be celebrated as an achievement of intellectual maturity , not bewailed as a debilitating impoverishment . ”
( NU , xi ) In this attempt to take nihilism to its limits , Brassier brings together an impressive collection of philosophers to support his arguments , but for our purposes it is the French philosopher , Francois Laruelle , who is the most relevant .
Now , Laruelle is famously obscure and difficult , so I will unfortunately have to pave over some of the nuances here , but we can basically see his project as an attempt to uncover a realist ontology unbound from any humanistic conceits .
The key notion here is that instead of believing us to be stuck within the correlationist circle , where everything is already tainted by us humans , Laruelle will begin from the fact that we are already within the immanence of the real .
Our thoughts , our experiences are , like Metzinger argues , already determined by something logically and temporally prior to them .
Whereas for Metzinger , this is the physical world of neurons , brains and the evolutionary environment , for Laruelle , these objectifying entities already concede too much .
Laruelle ’s real is unobjectifiable , and moreover , foreclosed to any possible conceptual discrimination .
Rather than thought or the correlation between thought and being constituting the real , it is the real itself as an unobjectifiable immanence that unilaterally determines - in - the - last - instance thought .
This unilateralizing action is key – it destroys any idea of a reciprocal relation between thought and being , such as we find in correlationism .
The real determines thought .
Technically , we ca n’t even say there ’s a distinction between the real and the thought that it determines , since this distinction is itself a product of thought .
For Laruelle , all relationality , all distinctions , lie on the side of thought ; the real is a type of identity foreclosed to such things .
The real is , as Brassier will , argue a ‘ being - nothing ’ – a nothing even more radical than Badiou ’s inconsistent void which still requires an idealist inscription to signify it .
Contra Badiou , Laruelle ’s real qua being - nothing is entirely sufficient - in - itself ; completely indifferent to thought or any inscription .
Now , two comments on this : one , such an “ idea ” of the real has the benefit of giving neuroscience the realist interpretation we were looking for .
Much like Scott laid out , thought is determined by something outside of it ; but in this case , the foreclosed outside is also outside of science ’s empirical basis .
In that way we can escape both neuroscience ’s total validity , and correlationism ’s claustrophobic circle .
My second point , though , is that we are still left in the apocalyptic situation Scott outlined .
Thought retains no agency and phenomenal experience is a mere epiphenomenal illusion .
That does n’t discredit Brassier ’s arguments , but let ’s see if another philosopher can offer a more hopeful option .
Unlike Brassier , Quentin Meillassoux begins by accepting the correlationist problematic .
All we epistemologically have access to is the correlation between thought and being .
What distinguishes Meillassoux from the correlationist , however , is that he uses its own arguments against it , in order to show how correlationism in fact already has knowledge of the real - in - itself .
The argument is quite extensive , so I apologize in advance for having to condense it so much .
To start with , he begins from the fact that the correlationist has two adversaries : the naïve realist , and the absolute correlationist .
The latter is represented most prominently by Hegel who takes the correlation to be all that there is .
For the absolute correlationist , the postulate of an in - itself inaccessible to thought is unnecessary , and so he simply does away with it .
For the standard correlationist , however , this assumes too much .
Whereas Hegel proposes to determine the internal logic of the shifts in correlations , Kant argues that this is impossible .
All that we can do is describe the present correlation .
If even our logical categories can shift , then we have no basis for assuming that the present internal logic is the absolute internal logic .
Against the absolute correlationist , therefore , Kant will argue for the facticity of the correlation .
Facticity , in this case , states that the given correlationist form – the logical invariants that permit experience to appear – is a simple fact ; a fact that is without reason and without necessity .
This facticity of the correlation also means that there is no way we can say with certainty that the correlation wo n’t shift at some future point .
As Meillassoux will say , “ correlationism can be summed up in the following thesis : it is unthinkable that the unthinkable be impossible . ”
( AF , 41 ) But this inability to ban the unthinkable is not merely a negative limit to our knowledge .
Rather , it is the positive knowledge of the absolute that we have been looking for – the piece of knowledge that will allow us to emerge from the correlationist circle and begin to think the absolute outside .
For this contingency , this facticity of our present correlation , is a necessary feature .
And since by accepting facticity , we accept that everything is contingent , the only necessity that remains is contingency .
What does this mean ?
It means that any existing entity can pass away , and any non-existing entity can come to be .
There simply is no reason ; it is the destruction of the principle of sufficient reason and the unleashing of chaos .
Now obviously , such a philosophical idea is wildly at odds with our everyday experience .
So I ’ll mention two quick points in regards to that .
One , Meillassoux devotes an entire chapter to refuting this argument , but I unfortunately do n’t have time to cover it here .
I ’ll simply recommend it to anyone who ’s interested .
And two , it ’s important to note that this absolute chaos that Meillassoux argues for does n’t entail constant change .
Change and movement are not necessary ; they are just as contingent as stability is .
So the fact that our everyday lives are mostly stable and structured does n’t refute Meillassoux ’s philosophical point .
OK , so to sum up : from within the correlationist circle , Meillassoux has argued that the necessity of contingency constitutes knowledge of the absolute .
What does this mean for neuroscience then ?
Well , one of the intriguing side effects of necessary contingency is that it makes emergence a viable possibility .
Since anything can come from anything without reason , emergence is even in a sense required .
And since a proliferation of independent ontological levels is permitted by Meillassoux ’s realist system , the idea that the mind could be at least relatively independent of the brain is entirely plausible .
In fact , Meillassoux at one point even claims that the emergence of subjectivity is the ultimate example of contingency .
So the benefits of treating neuroscience in this framework are threefold : one , it potentially recovers a space for agency independent of the brain ; two , it offers a realist interpretation of scientific findings instead of subjecting them to yet another idealist framework ; and three , it ultimately removes neuroscience ’s certainty by making even natural laws contingent .
Of course this is all at the cost of killing off the principle of sufficient reason , but hey , you ca n’t have everything .
So that ’s the two options I see as alternatives to Scott ’s reduction of everything to neuroscience .
It is my contention that the self - reflexive gesture , whereby neuroscience cancels its own empirical basis , requires us to turn to philosophy .
Science on its own is incapable of grounding its own knowledge .
NEUROPOLITICS
Now lastly , what I want to do now is to conclude by briefly trying to take the apocalyptic tone of Scott ’s talk and invert it into a potentially hopeful and liberating politics .
I can only be very brief here , but I figure it might provide a good starting point for discussion .
My guiding intuition here is that this period of horror and revulsion at neuroscience ’s implications seems to mirror the depression and meaninglessness of the existentialist movement .
And just as post - existentialism turned to philosophies of affirmation and play and ultimately turned existentialism ’s absurdity into a positive condition for liberation , so too it seems as though future philosophers might take neuroscience as offering hope and freedom from folk psychology ’s constraints .
Where might this hope come from ?
Scott actually points to one example in his book , Neuropath , although he frames it there in a negative light .
The basic idea is that with greater knowledge of our brain and how it affects the mind , the greater capacity we will have to modify the brain .
Not merely in a therapeutic sense of healing pathologies , but in a sense of taking our existing capacities and heightening them .
Or , even more radically , we might look to experiment with the constraints that Metzinger outlines .
We could imagine undoing particular constraints in order to experience entirely new phenomena .
Or we could create entirely new constraints to form seemingly impossible experiences .
The possibilities really are endless .
Now such neurodesign is clearly an ethically precarious area , but it ’s certainly not a priori evil .
I would like to caution against one thing though .
As Catherine Malabou points out , what we must be careful to remember is that the brain is encased not only within a biological environment , but also within a cultural one .
And in our present world , this cultural sphere is dominated by the logic of capital .
In order to resist this logic , what Malabou says we must distinguish between is flexibility and plasticity .
The former – flexibility – is a capitalist value , and refers simply to the ability of something to adapt and consent to a new situation .
It is the mantra of post - industrial capitalism – constantly creating ever more flexible workers .
On the other hand , plasticity not only receives form , but also actively resists it .
Unlike flexibility , plasticity is not infinitely malleable .
The risk is that in a capitalist world , it may be too easy for us to take our neurological knowledge and simply use it to adapt to capitalist dictates without ever offering a positive resistance .
Without plasticity , without its resisting force , capitalism may end up subsuming the human , and shifting from a vampiric entity feeding off the living , to an undead self - perpetuating machine .
The semantic apocalypse , in other words , may end up being the capitalist apocalypse .

So there ’s a lot to like about this paper .
I applaud Scott for setting aside certain thorny philosophical problems and for having laid out neuroscience ’s apocalyptic line of reasoning in such an intuitive fashion .
Certainly I also appreciate the opening injunction to take the hypotheses presented with a measure of ‘ skeptical salt , ’ and most of all the fact that the implications of neuroscience for philosophy are taken very seriously .
This is true of both Scott ’s paper and Nick ’s response , of course .
But while I appreciate that Scott ’s project is to lay out provocative questions rather than take firm positions , there are a few problems that I have with his eschatological vision .
In the interest of explaining these in a rudimentary way , I ’ll take as my starting point some arguments from the conclusions of both pieces .
First , I was very interested in the connection you made , Scott , to what you call the ‘ post - modern subject ’ ; similarly , I thought Nick ’s implicit invocation of Derrida and Deleuze toward the end of the paper was rather significant .
I hope we can take this parallel up more thoroughly in the discussion to come .
While I appreciate the arguments laid out , and absolutely recognize the difference between abstract speculation and a scientific research program , I ultimately count myself among those ‘ underwhelmed ’ by the implications of Scott ’s hypotheses .
My problem is less with the neuroscientific critique of subjectivity , than with the apocalyptic tone , and with the fearful ideas of an utter ‘ end of subjectivity , ’ or ‘ selfhood , ’ or ( as the title of the paper implies ) , of ‘ meaning . ’
While I agree with Nick that the scenario as framed in the paper is rather depressing , I simply do n’t believe the conclusions we derive from neuroscience must be of this type .
There ’s a curious oscillation in this piece between a fearful eliminativism and a transcendental mysterianism : so we move from ‘ consciousness - as - hoax ’ to talk of souls and cognitive bottlenecks , as though the latter was somehow the ‘ solution ’ to the spiraling despair provoked by the first .
To me , this does n’t seem like a very productive way to think about neuroscience .
As I mentioned a moment ago , I applaud Scott for setting aside in the first place the somewhat sophistical question of compatibilism contra determinism ; yet I feel as though my own argument wo n’t make sense unless I specify that I ’m a thoroughgoing compatibilist .
I mean this not only in the strict sense of believing that our free will and the strictest physical determinism are not mutually exclusive ; I also believe a version of the same compatibility holds true with respect to the ‘ existence ’ of phenomena like minds , selves , morals and meaning .
Neuroscience should lead us to redefine these terms and reappraise their ontology , but it seems unlikely to be capable of somehow demonstrating their inexistence .
So I feel that the apparently radical hypotheses raised in this paper are no more frightening , and take us no further than the fragmented , decentred subjects already proposed by so many philosophers and theorists .
In my response I just want to unpack this assertion a bit , and explain why I think this jaded , ostensibly ‘ post - modern ’ point of view is dismissed perhaps a bit too quickly in your paper .
And in fact , I ’m going to make little reference to any of the major theorists of this version of subjectivity ;
Nick has already given us a great introduction to some really contemporary work in this area , work by philosophers who would perhaps reject any association with postmodernism .
I want to focus more on the core of the ‘ Blind Brain ’ hypothesis , and ask a fundamental question : could neuroscience ever prove that consciousness is , as you put it , “ some bizarre kind of hoax ” ?
The first , and perhaps most fundamental problem I have with your ‘ Blind Brain ’ hypothesis starts in ‘ The Argument , ’ with the imputation that we can somehow explain away intentionality through neuroscience .
Mechanism may strike us as ‘ intuitively incompatible ’ with intentional concepts , but I believe this intuition is just plain wrong .
This of course made me think right away of Dan Dennett ’s formulation of the ‘ intentional stance : ’ intentional concepts such as belief and desire , on his view , are nothing more than a interpretive stance , a level of description we use both when the physical level is unavailable to us and when it ’s simply not useful .
So Dennett claims we can interpret a thermostat from the intentional stance , as having beliefs and desires , but it ’s silly ; conversely we could in principle interpret all of a human ’s actions from a physical stance , but it ’s impracticable and in fact it misses the point in its own way .
I was particularly intrigued by your ‘ alien ’ story , insofar as it ’s very similar to a thought - experiment taken up both by Dennett and Robert Nozick , but you use it to draw very different conclusions .
So what this suggests is that at least we ‘ are ’ something in that our talk of belief and desire – ‘ folk psychology ’ as the eliminativists would have it – is in fact an very powerful , economical way of predicting the course of events and modeling possible worlds .
The idea that intentional concepts could be replaced by factual descriptions of neural states is prima facie acceptable and somewhat persuasive , but ultimately implausible .
Cognitive economy – along with many of the marginal details of Scott ’s story , the odd behaviours of the martians that seem to require intentional concepts – would seem to demand that we continue to speak as though the mind and the self were real , causally effective entities .
But of course we do n’t ‘ feel ’ like modes of interpreting a set of physical , causal mechanisms ; we feel like a unified , conscious self in full control of our own actions .
We feel like our goals and beliefs are the true , perhaps even the ‘ necessary and sufficient ’ causes of our actions .
Here , of course , is where Scott ’s ‘ Blind Brain ’ idea really has some bite .
The idea of an ‘ information horizon ’ is very sensible , and you ’re of course right to note that our beliefs and desires often seem to ‘ come to us ’ from some mysterious place on the other side of this horizon .
I disagree with few of the substantial claims in this section .
Still I believe that all they really negate is the Cartesian version of the subject as an absolutely , transcendentally free decision maker .
In fact , you ’re showing us that neuroscience is very likely to refute the assumption that our conscious self is the sovereign author of all our actions .
I completely agree .
But this assumption has been under attack since Freud and even well before that !
( And as Francisco Varela and many others have observed , this transcendental self never even was an assumption in some Eastern traditions . )
Neuroscience might give anti-subjectivity arguments a bit of new ‘ bite ’ as you put it , but the core of the argument is nothing radically novel .
We should remember that proclamations about the inexistence of free will were the norm rather than the exception in the early days of psychology , coming from both Freud and the behaviorists .
It ’s only recently , with the rise of cognitive science , that psychology has opened up once again to talk of the ‘ mind ’ !
I make this historical point only to emphasize that philosophers and scientists have had lots of time to engage with this critique of subjectivity in creative ways , and that some of these ways make being ‘ underwhelmed ’ in the face of your apocalypse a legitimate response .
In this respect I think Nick is right to point to Deleuze and Derrida ’s philosophies of affirmation and play , and I ’d like to close by noting some interpretations of neuroscientific data that leave plenty of room for an intentional self !
My cases in point are two experiments conducted by the late Benjamin Libet .
Specifically , I want to point to a radical difference between the two , and then propose an argument that resolves it .
The difference is a very interesting one , because the first experiment is usually cited as the knock - down argument for epiphenomenalism ( epi-phenomenalism being eliminativism lite : brain causes mental phenomena ; but mind itself has no causal powers ) .
The other is cited in support of precisely the opposite view , as borderline - mystical evidence for an inexplicable , irreducible capacity of consciousness .
Specifically – and sorry if I lose anyone here – the first experiment shows that the readiness potential for a volitional movement occurs about 800 milliseconds before we can consciously report that we ’ve chosen to make the movement : thus by the time we ’re fully conscious of having made a decision to move , it ’s already in a certain sense made by our brain .
The second experiment shows that when we experience a sensation , it takes about 500 milliseconds for it to enter our conscious awareness .
Consciousness , however , somehow antedates the sensory experience as having occurred much closer to the time of the stimulus : so this experiment suggests that we ’re capable of experiencing a stimulus before we ’ve really , consciously experienced it .
So these are remarkably different results , leading to diametrically opposed philosophical interpretations .
The common interpretation of the first experiment corresponds nicely with ‘ The Argument ’ proposed by Scott and its frightening conclusion ; the second by contrast leads to a rebuttal that goes much further than Scott ’s ‘ Bottleneck ’ thesis , and actually gets taken up by certain demagogues as evidence for a transcendental soul .
To me this is the greatest thing about scientific research : one guy can carry out two equally famous experiments which lead to mutually exclusive conclusions .
How many philosophers have argued for such radically different theses ?
A few , probably , but very few .
I just think that this is a great thing about science , directly tied both to Scott ’s point ( about how science subverts our naive beliefs about the ‘ Belief Lottery ’ ) and possibly also to what Nick draws out in his discussion of Brassier and Laruelle , as the stance of being in a sense always - already engaged with the Real itself .
But our engagement with reality is necessarily mediated by any number of factors .
( Perceptual , technological , linguistic , etc. ; although this invocation of the ‘ medium ’ is emphatically not to suggest that the real on the other side is any less real ! )
In the first place , what Libet ’s experiments suggest to me is that the matter of neuroscientific ‘ proof ’ is very much a matter of interpretation .
Libet himself saw the first experiment as proving that free will was an illusion , and that the only agency we could have as conscious beings was the ability to occasionally interrupt the automatic functions of the brain .
In other words , consciousness is the ‘ impoverished middleman ’
Scott describes , possessing only a kind of limited ‘ veto power . ’
Yet Libet suggests that the other experiment implies “ serious though not insurmountable difficulties ” with the physicalist theory of mind … leading naturally to the idea that consciousness and its freedom are somehow transcendent , quite simply inaccessible to neuroscience !
So the conclusions to be drawn from neuroscience with respect to the existence and causal powers of consciousness are profoundly uncertain .
Clearly , the best interpretation of these results is one that resolves the opposition between these conclusions ( and between the two equally dissatisfying poles of the oscillation I feel in Scott ’s text ) .
To my mind , Dennett offers a wonderful candidate for such an interpretation , and one that leaves plenty of room for the existence of real intentionality .
( And ‘ my mind ! ’ )
I ’ll just summarize the rough outlines of his reading .
We may , as Libet does , artificially isolate the conscious self , and in an experiment we may attempt to pin down the instant of a free decision to the level of the millisecond .
In the process , we may refute a certain concept of the self : Dennett calls it ‘ Self - Contained You , ’ but it ’s essentially the same old Cartesian self where everything important – from perception to understanding to decision – happens all in one place and all at once .
This is the same transcendental concept of the self that ’s ruled out by Scott ’s Blind Brain hypothesis , and that has been under attack for centuries .
But refuting this version of the self does n’t mean that Libet ’s results or any others prove free will to be an illusion .
As Dennett puts it , these experiments actually show us that “ our free will , like all our other mental powers , has to be smeared out over time , not measured in instants ” ( 242 ) .
Agency feels wholly unified , but it ’s actually distributed both in time and throughout the brain .
Thus in a single conceptual movement we can get a more robust version of free will than Libet ’s ‘ veto power ’ and we can account for the antedating of sense experience : all we have to do is recognize that consciousness does n’t really inhabit the ‘ specious present ’ and that it ’s not absolutely sovereign .
The intentional self , then , is not a Cartesian homunculus autonomously orchestrating all of our actions from Central Command .
Instead , it is best conceived as a diachronic assemblage of top - down and bottom - up processes situated in a brain and a body .
So by a detour through neuroscience and analytic philosophy , we ’re back to the fragmentary subject of a certain ‘ postmodernism . ’
As I see it , then , Scott ’s paper shows us that neuroscience is well on its way to refuting certain antique notions of self , freedom , intentionality , and so on .
But I still do n’t think we need to be worried about neuroscience proving that consciousness is a ‘ hoax , ’ that we ‘ ourselves ’ do n’t exist or that we ’re altogether lacking in agency .
Our ‘ selves ’ are really very different phenomena than they appear to introspection , but we can always remake our conceptual and theoretical frameworks .
This allows us to integrate neuroscientific results into refined concepts of self and subjectivity , and as Dennett puts it to ground these concepts in a way that “ metaphysical myths fail to do . ”
This to me undercuts the apocalyptic tone of the paper , and opens up precisely the space for philosophy that both of you have gestured to in your own ways …

In “ The New Mother , ” a children ’s story published by Lucy Clifford in 1882 , two previously well - behaved little girls turn so bad — dousing the fire and breaking the clock and dancing on the butter — that their mother is forced to go away , and a new mother , a demon with two glass eyes and a horrible wooden tail , comes to take her place .
At the story ’s end , the girls flee to the forest to live ; they miss their mother terribly and long in vain for the chance to redeem themselves .
Sometimes , at night , they sneak back to their old cottage , where through the window they can see the glint of the new mother ’s glass eyes .
Gaiman ’s “ Coraline ” was first thought too frightening for children .
Now , he says , it ’s a “ beloved text . ”
Photograph by Eric Ogden
Gothic horror was thoroughly out of fashion in children ’s literature when , in the early nineteen - nineties , the writer Neil Gaiman began to work on “ Coraline , ” a book aimed at “ middle readers ” — aged nine to twelve — in which he reimagined Clifford ’s demon as “ the other mother , ” an evil and cunning anti-creator who threatens to destroy his young protagonist .
“ The idea was , look , if the Victorians can do something that deeply unsettles kids , I should be able to do that , too , ” he told me recently .
Gaiman , who is forty - nine and English , with a pale face and a wild , corkscrewed mop of black - and - gray hair , is unusually prolific .
In addition to horror , he writes fantasy , fairy tales , science fiction , and apocalyptic romps , in the form of novels , comics , picture books , short stories , poems , and screenplays .
Now and then , he writes a song .
Gaiman ’s books are genre pieces that refuse to remain true to their genres , and his audience is broader than any purist ’s : he defines his readership as “ bipeds . ”
His mode is syncretic , with sources ranging from English folktales to glam rock and the Midrash , and enchantment is his major theme : life as we know it , only prone to visitations by Norse gods , trolls , Arthurian knights , and kindergarten - age zombies .
“ Neil ’s writing is kind of fey in the best sense of the word , ” the comic - book writer Alan Moore told me .
“ His best effects come out of people or characters or situations in the real world being starkly juxtaposed with this misty fantasy world . ”
The model for Gaiman ’s eclecticism is G. K. Chesterton ; his work , Gaiman says , “ left me with an idea of London as this wonderful , mythical , magical place , which became the way I saw the world . ”
Chesterton ’s career also serves as a warning .
“ He would have been a better writer if he ’d written less , ” Gaiman says .
“ There ’s always that fear of writing too much if you ’re a reasonably facile writer , and I ’m a reasonably facile writer . ”
Gaiman ’s two most recent novels , “ Anansi Boys ” ( 2005 ) and “ The Graveyard Book ” ( 2008 ) — a retelling of Rudyard Kipling ’s “ The Jungle Book , ” set in a graveyard — débuted at No. 1 on the New York Times best - seller list in their respective categories , adult and children ’s literature .
Yet Gaiman remains somewhat marginal .
The Times of London recently referred to him as “ the most famous writer you ’ve never heard of . ”
The New York Times waited to review “ The Graveyard Book ” for several months after its publication , by which time it had won the 2009 Newbery Medal , one of the highest honors in children ’s fiction , and been on the best - seller list for eighteen weeks .
“ I have at this point a critic - proof career , ” Gaiman said .
“ The fans already knew about the book . ”
The title character of “ Coraline ” is an inquisitive girl with distracted parents , living in an old house with a bricked - up door in one of its rooms .
One day , she tests the door and finds that it opens onto a passageway .
As with Alice ’s rabbit hole and Lucy Pevensie ’s closet full of furs , at the other end is an alternate world : in this case , a house that is an idealized replica of Coraline ’s own , presided over by the other mother , who , Gaiman writes , resembles her real one —
“ Only her skin was as white as paper .
Only she was taller and thinner .
Only her fingers were too long , and they never stopped moving , and her dark red fingernails were curved and sharp . ”
In place of eyes , she has two black buttons .
She entreats Coraline to stay , plying her with delicious food ( her own mother cooks from packets ) and magical toys .
But the other mother ’s world is an illusion and a trap ; what she really wants is to take Coraline ’s eyes and replace them with buttons .
Unlike its literary progenitor , “ Coraline ” resolves comfortingly : the heroine outsmarts the other mother and escapes ; in the process , she saves the souls of three ghost children — earlier victims — and frees her parents , who have also been drawn into the plot .
At home , the last night of summer vacation , Coraline drifts into a peaceful sleep , realizing “ there was nothing left about school that could scare her anymore . ”
In Gaiman , the horror is domesticated and made hygienic for contemporary tastes .
Even so , when he showed an early draft to an editor in 1991 , he was told it was unpublishable : far too frightening for kids .
( Gaiman maintains that adults are more afraid of “ Coraline ” than children are . )
The novel finally came out in 2002 .
Last year , a movie version was released , directed by Henry Selick in 3 - D stop- motion animation , with Teri Hatcher playing both mothers and Dakota Fanning as Coraline .
It won a Children ’s BAFTA and has been nominated for a Golden Globe .
The book has spent a total of seventeen weeks on the best - seller list , and is now , Gaiman says , a “ beloved text . ”
“ You mock , sir — you mock a sport storied and beloved .
I , sir , pity you . ”

In the world of science fiction and fantasy , the boundary between writers and readers is highly permeable .
Arthur C. Clarke used to go to conventions wearing a loud Hawaiian shirt — an emblem of sci - fi fandom — and mingle with the crowds .
Gaiman has adapted that relationship for the age of social media .
He was one of the first writers to have a blog — he started it in 2001 , and had , at last count , some 1.4 million readers — and he often posts to his Twitter feed a dozen or more times a day .
He attributes his recent No. 1 débuts to his ability to communicate directly with his fans : he tells them to buy a book on a certain day , and they do .
“ It means I ’m nobody ’s bitch , ” he told me .
Through the blog and Twitter , readers have a seemingly transparent window into his process .
“ Writing Metamorpho .
Trying to decide if broccoli is funnier than kohlrabi in a list of vegetables , ” he tweeted several months ago , when he was working on a new comic .
His next post on the subject read , “ So far the broccoli / kohlrabi votes are pretty much evenly split .
Although several of you think ‘ rutabaga ’ is funnier than either . ”
Eleven minutes later , he posted again : “ ( Okay .
The line now reads ) Java : ‘ Java dreams of giant vegetables .
Chiefly rutabaga and unusually knobbly turnips .
But not broccoli .’ ”
To his readers , Gaiman projects an image that is at once iconic author - hero and cozy bookworm .
“ At the age of four , I was bit by a radioactive awesome , ” he ’ll say , by way of the origin story that comics fans are conditioned to expect .
Sartorially , he is remarkably like Dream , who is one of his best - loved characters and the protagonist of a monthly series called “ The Sandman , ” which he wrote for DC Comics between 1988 and 1996 .
He wears black : black socks , black jeans , black T - shirts , black boots , and black jackets whose pockets are loaded with small black notebooks and pots of fountain - pen ink in shades like raven .
Pictures of his book collection , which contains some five thousand volumes , circulate on the Internet , propagating brainy crushes : “ How could I not fall for this guy ???
Honestly . . . look at the sheer size of his . . . library ! ”
“ Of course , he wants to become a character , ” Stephin Merritt , who is the lead singer of the Magnetic Fields and a friend of Gaiman , says .
“ He ’s not Salvador Dali , but he ’s not far off .
There ’s no hard line between his persona and his private life . ”
Jon Levin , Gaiman ’s film agent , says he recognized his client ’s popularity only when he took him to a meeting at Warner Bros .
and all the secretaries got up from their desks to ask for autographs .
Someone said , “ That never happens when Tom Cruise is here . ”
Several months ago , Gaiman was in New York for a few days and gave a reading at the Housing Works bookstore , downtown .
It was a joint appearance with Amanda Palmer , a musician from the punk - cabaret act the Dresden Dolls , who was Gaiman ’s girlfriend at the time .
( They are now engaged to be married .
He proposed on New Year ’s Day , drawing a ring on her finger with a Sharpie . )
The couple met in 2008 , when Palmer was working on a solo album and asked Gaiman , to whom she was introduced by a mutual friend , to write stories to accompany photographs of her as a corpse .
That afternoon in New York , they had been interviewed in the bath : she naked , he wearing a suit jacket that had been bought for forty bucks from a drunk in Tompkins Square Park .
Everywhere Gaiman goes , he encounters women dressed as Death , Dream ’s sister in “ Sandman ” : black clothing , elaborate black eye makeup , and , often , an ankh charm around the neck .
( Internet critics deride Gaiman ’s fans as “ Twee ‘ Bisexual ’ Goth Girls with BPD ” — borderline personality disorder — “ who are drama majors and who are destined to become cat ladies . ” )
Inside Housing Works , there was a great deal of black and much Gaiman - inspired tattoo art .
A middle - aged man wore a T - shirt printed with the text of one of Gaiman ’s tweets : “ Honestly , if you ’re given the choice between Armageddon or tea , you do n’t say ‘ What kind of tea ? ’ ”
At a little past eight , Palmer appeared onstage , wearing a military jacket and a tartan miniskirt , and sat down at a keyboard ; Gaiman stood at a microphone .
Images of Palmer — mostly naked , bloody , battered , drowned , or morosely propped up at a dinner table — were projected on the wall behind them .
Gaiman began to read in a voice that was deep and singsongy and richly theatrical , with a double edge of menace and irony , the aural equivalent of a flashlight held underneath a chin in a dark room .
“ Very young children made up songs about the different ways Amanda died , killing her happily at the end of every verse , too young to understand the horror , ” he read , and Palmer underscored his pauses with dark chords .
“ Maybe it really was how she would have wanted to go .
‘ If you see Amanda Palmer on the street , kill her , ’ said the graffiti under the bridge in Boston . ”
The audience laughed anxiously .
“ And beneath that somebody else wrote , ‘ That way she ’ll live forever . ’ ”
Like his friend Harlan Ellison , who stunt - wrote in bookstore windows to show that being an author was a form of manual labor , Gaiman does n’t mind composing live .
At Housing Works , he read a short story about a living statue ’s unrequited love .
Then , as Palmer sang a song inspired by her years performing as an eight - foot bride in Harvard Square , he dug into his jacket pocket , extracted a small notebook , and began to scribble .
Later , he and Palmer answered questions from the audience .
One person wanted to know where he got his ideas .
“ Everybody has ideas , ” he said .
“ People daydream constantly , people let their minds go walking . ”
During the performance , he explained , he had started to imagine a man who went from city to city documenting living statues the way bird - watchers check off rare species ; that was when he took out his notebook .
“ Somebody today asked me if I ’d like to make a sort of eight - minute silent movie .
And I think I now have a subject . ”
“ I ’m too tired to have sex but awake enough to argue about it for the next five hours . ”

Gaiman got his start as a journalist - for - hire , in England .
He did n’t go to college .
His first book was a Duran Duran biography he finished in three months , using a clip file from the BBC ; next , he wrote a biography of Douglas Adams , in the style of Douglas Adams .
Gaiman says that , especially in the early stages of his career , “ I was very , very good at taking a voice that already existed and just parodying it . ”
He describes his short piece “ We Can Get Them for You Wholesale ” as him doing John Collier .
“ A Study in Emerald ” is his version of Sherlock Holmes , by way of H. P. Lovecraft .
The writer Gene Wolfe says that “ Sunbird , ” Gaiman ’s story about an epicurean club that eats the mythical phoenix , “ is so much in the style of R. A. Lafferty it ’s almost as if Lafferty were dictating it from Heaven . ”
Gaiman still writes on demand , composing for anthologies ( the living - statue story was an assignment ) , birthdays , and holidays .
Now that he is widely read , he is apt to publish even the most ephemeral of these offerings , often between hard covers and with lavish illustrations .
Last spring , he released “ Blueberry Girl , ” a bit of doggerel written for his friend Tori Amos when she was expecting her first child .
( “ Help her to help herself , help her to stand , / help her to lose and to find .
/
Teach her we ’re only as big as our dreams .
/ Show her that fortune is blind . ” )
It spent five weeks on the best - seller list for children ’s picture books .
The first time Gaiman recognized his own voice was in “ Violent Cases , ” a graphic novel , with art work by Dave McKean , that was published when he was twenty - six .
The story is narrated in the first person by a character who looks , in McKean ’s illustrations , exactly as Gaiman did at the time : mullety dark hair , black T - shirt , cigarette streaming smoke up toward his face , dark aviator glasses on indoors .
The narrator recalls an episode from his childhood in which his father yanked his arm out of its socket trying to pull him up the stairs to bed .
“ Even now , my father is taller than I am — and back then he seemed huge , ” the narrator says .
“ When I read stories of giants feefifofumming their way through rocky castles , the ground echoing to their steps , sniffing for the blood of an Englishman in the way that only giants could — the giants always looked like my father . ”
In this world , the adults are unfathomable and contradictory ; they smell like strangers when they leave the house , and come home drunk and arguing in whispers .
“ The stuff that happened in the beginning of ‘ Violent Cases ’ happened to me , ” Gaiman says .
“ The building blocks were either true or fictional lies , which feel like they ’re true .
I thought , I ’m going to tell it in my voice and use actual things that happened and talk about what it is to be three and be a child who has no power .
It ’s a children ’s book for adults . ”
Gaiman was born in Portchester , in Hampshire County .
His family is Jewish , of Polish descent on his father ’s side .
As a child , he was bookish and broody ; for his tenth birthday , he asked for a shed and got a kit of pine boards , which his parents assembled at the bottom of the garden .
It was where he read : the Narnia books ; Roger Lancelyn Green ; a neighbor ’s father ’s “ Dracula ” ; Chesterton , borrowed from the library .
Instead of studying for his bar mitzvah , he persuaded his instructor to teach him Bible stories — the Behemoth , the Leviathan — and the secret teachings , about Lilith and the Lilim , which he used in “ The Sandman . ”
To his father ’s dismay , he spent his bar - mitzvah money on American comics — a good investment , as he sees it now .
The pivotal fact of Gaiman ’s childhood is one that appears nowhere in his fiction and is periodically removed from his Wikipedia page by the site ’s editors .
When he was five , his family moved to East Grinstead , the center of English Scientology , where his parents began taking Dianetics classes .
His father , a real - estate developer , and his mother , a pharmacist , founded a vitamin shop , G & G Foods , which is still operational .
( According to its Web site , it supplies the Human Detoxification Programme , a course of vitamins , supplements , and other alleged purification techniques , which Scientology offers at disaster sites like Chernobyl and Ground Zero . )
In the seventies , his father , who died last year , began working in Scientology ’s public - relations wing and over time rose high in the organization .
Gaiman has two younger sisters , both still active in Scientology ; one of them works for the church in Los Angeles , and the other helps run the family businesses .
At times , Scientology proved awkward for the Gaiman children .
According to Lizzy Calcioli , the sister who stayed in England , “ Most of our social activities were involved with Scientology or our Jewish family .
It would get very confusing when people would ask my religion as a kid .
I ’d say , ‘ I ’m a Jewish Scientologist . ’ ” Gaiman says that he was blocked from entering a boys ’ school because of his father ’s position and had to remain at the school he ’d been attending , the only boy left in a classroom full of girls .
These days , Gaiman tends to avoid questions about his faith , but says he is not a Scientologist .
Like Judaism , Scientology is the religion of his family , and he feels some solidarity with them .
“ I will stand with groups when I feel like they ’re being properly persecuted , ” he told me .
Having been brought up in two traditions , Gaiman is flexible in his devotions .
“ I ’m terribly good at believing things , but I ’m really good at believing things when I need them , ” he said .
“ Which in my case tends to be if I ’m writing about them . ”
If he had not been a writer , he says , he would have wanted to design religions .
“ I ’d have a little shop , and people would phone up or come into the shop and they ’d say , ‘ I ’d like a religion , ’ ” he said .
“ And I ’d say , ‘ Cool , O.K .
Where do you stand on guilt , and how do you want to fund it ?
And would you like sort of a belief in the universe as a huge beneficent organ ?
Or would you like something more complex ? ’
And they ’d say , ‘ Oh , we ’d like God to be really big on guilt . ’
And I ’d say , ‘ O.K. , how does Wednesday sound to you as a sacred day ? ’ ”
Writing comics afforded Gaiman his great opportunity to invent a cosmology .
He approached the work strategically .
In the early eighties , he started going to fantasy conventions as a journalist and interviewing authors he admired .
At one such event , he met Alan Moore , who , through “ Swamp Thing , ” was transforming the comic book into something literary , psychological , and self - aware .
He asked Moore to show him how to write a script ; they sat down and Moore sketched it out in a notebook : page one , panel one , FX for sound effects , and so on .
Moore ’s style shaped Gaiman ’s early work ; his scripts were fully realized texts , dense with visual information .
Gaiman says that an Alan Moore script for a twenty - four - page comic would be about a hundred pages , his own would run to fifty pages , and most other writers ’ would be half that .
“ I thought he was about to be knighted , too , did n’t you ? ” Facebook
Twitter
Email
Shopping
With Moore ’s encouragement , Gaiman sent a sample script to Karen Berger , Moore ’s editor at DC Comics ; it was called “ Jack in the Green , ” and used English folklore to tell a Swamp Thing story .
Berger did n’t publish it , but she eventually hired Gaiman to write a series based on an archival DC character named the Sandman .
In the original nineteen - thirties incarnation , the Sandman had worn a green zoot suit and a gas mask , and killed villains with a gas gun .
Gaiman ’s hero was different : remote and troubled , ironic and proud , with an archaic vocabulary and a head of hair like a blot of fountain - pen ink .
His power rests in storytelling ; he travels through human dreams .
With his siblings Destiny , Destruction , Despair , Desire , Delirium , and Death , he is one of the Endless , presiding over the universe , but is as flawed and petty as any Greek god .
The first issue of Gaiman ’s “ Sandman ” appeared in 1988 .
He gave the series a loose , intuitive structure ; dream logic prevailed .
This allowed him to tell whatever stories he wanted to , about the kinds of people he knew : pre-operative transsexuals , dysfunctional families , mixed - race couples , spurned lovers , addicts , and young adults with tattoos and brightly colored hair .
“ He ’s got incredible storytelling drive , ” the novelist Michael Chabon , who has written extensively about comics , says .
“ The stories just foliate off each other , and mythology and folklore are so confidently and freely appropriated , with such chutzpah . ”
And now we interrupt our CES 2010 programming for some new Facebook religious jibba - jabba .
We will resume the gadget spam in the next post .
Thank you , thank you .

DUBAI ( Reuters ) - Al Qaeda ’s Afghan wing has claimed last week ’s attack at a U.S. base in Afghanistan in which a double agent turned suicide bomber killed seven CIA officers , saying the attack was revenge for the deaths of their leaders .

“ He detonated his explosive belt , concealed from the eyes of those who do not believe in the Hereafter , in a gathering of American and Jordanian intelligence men , ” Mustafa Abul - Yazid , the leader of al - Qaeda in Afghanistan , said in a statement posted on a website on Thursday used by al - Qaeda linked organizations .
The suicide bombing , the second - most deadly attack in CIA history , followed a failed attempt to blow up a Detroit - bound plane on Christmas Day .
Former intelligence officials have said Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al - Balawi , a doctor , was recruited by Jordanian intelligence to try to infiltrate al Qaeda and the Taliban .
Balawi had associated with Islamists in the past , but U.S. and Jordanian spy agencies thought that Balawi had been successfully “ de-radicalized . ”
The bombing took place inside Forward Operating Base Chapman , a well - fortified compound in Khost province near the southeastern border with Pakistan .
“ He avenged our prime martyrs , and as he wrote in his final testament , may God have mercy on him :
Taking revenge for the leader the Amir Beitullah Mehsud and the leaders Abu Saleh al - Somali and Abdallah Said al - Libi and their brothers , may God have mercy on them . ”
Mehsud , the leader of the Taliban Movement of Pakistan , was killed by a missile - firing U.S. drone aircraft in South Waziristan in August .
CIA agents at the base helped oversee strikes against Taliban and al Qaeda targets along the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan , according to former intelligence officials .
The security breach was a major setback to the CIA , which has been expanding its presence in Afghanistan .
Eight CIA employees were among those killed in a bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut in 1983 .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Online retailer Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O is testing Wall Street 's patience by repeatedly touting the success of its Kindle electronic reader without providing specific sales figures .

In one press release after another in recent months , Amazon has talked up the Kindle ’s best - seller status across all product categories .
The statements have helped propel a share price already on a breathtaking rise due to Amazon ’s growing dominance in Web retail .
On the day after Christmas , the retailer said the Kindle was the most - purchased gift in its history and sales of its electronic books surpassed physical book sales on the holiday itself .
Previously , Amazon said the device had its best monthly sales ever in December , with only half of the month gone by at that point .
In neither of these most recent examples did Amazon say how many Kindles or e-books were sold , nor by how much sales rose .
In an e-mail message , a spokeswoman said Amazon does not disclose unit sales as a matter of company policy .
But investor patience with the lack of details has begun to wear thin , particularly as Amazon shares hit an all - time high in early December on expectations it will be one of the biggest winners in overall sales growth this holiday season .
That benefit of the doubt could be further tested in 2010 as more e-readers enter the market and challenge the Kindle .
“ As long as Amazon continues to have the right margins and the right profit numbers at the end of every quarter , they can probably get away with that , ” said James McQuivey , an analyst at Forrester Research .
But if the Kindle ’s streak goes cold and Amazon continues to keep investors in the dark , they could turn on the stock .
“ You may suffer a 10 to 15 to 20 percent correction because the uncertainty factor would be so high , ” McQuivey said .
“ It ensures that if there is bad news , people imagine the worst . ”
Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch also see Amazon treading a fine line with fuzzy statements on the Kindle .
“ We continue to be frustrated with the limited unit data points from Amazon in their numerous Kindle press releases , ” the analysts wrote in a note cited by The Wall Street Journal this week .
“ These press releases seem aimed at generating press buzz , not providing the most relevant information to the street or the press . ”
A RICH VALUATION
Forrester estimates that the Kindle , which was launched in 2007 , has a U.S. market share of about 55 percent , ahead of devices from Sony Corp 6758.T and Barnes & Noble Inc's BKS.N recently launched Nook .
It says 2.5 million Kindles have been sold to date , based on consumer surveys .
Investment firm Cowen & Co. expects Amazon to sell 500,000 of the devices in its holiday quarter alone .
In 2010 , Forrester anticipates consumers to buy another 6 million e-readers and the field to become more crowded .
Apple Inc AAPL.O is expected to unveil a tablet in 2010 that would have e-reader functions .
Amazon shares have nearly tripled since hitting a yearly low in January .
That performance has attracted closer analyst scrutiny on fears the stock could be overvalued .
Amazon 's shares are valued at about 72 times estimated earnings per share in 2009 , or 53 times 2010 EPS , according to Thomson Reuters data .
Google GOOG.O is trading at 27 times 2010 EPS .
Apple shares are valued at 27 times estimated EPS for its fiscal 2010 .
From a legal standpoint , Amazon is not obligated to disclose sales figures on the Kindle until it accounts for a material portion of its business , a securities lawyer said .
“ You have to look at it in context and how large the company is as a whole , ” said Stephen Fox , a partner at Herrick , Feinstein LLP .
At this point , analysts estimate the Kindle will account for less than 2 percent of Amazon ’s expected $ 8.9 billion in sales for the current holiday quarter .
So unless investors complain to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or there are irregular stock movements , regulators are unlikely to do much , Fox said .
A QUESTION OF POTENTIAL
Some veteran industry watchers see the Kindle as a sideshow to the broader Amazon story as it becomes a greater source of consumer goods from electronics to baby food .
“ If investors are buying Amazon because of Kindle they ’re making a mistake , ” said Charles Wolf , an analyst at Needham & Co . “ It ’s not inconsequential , but it ’s just not a game changer for Amazon . ”
That view could change .
Some 25 percent of Amazon ’s revenue comes from its original business selling books online .
As readers adapt to digital book formats , the Kindle and its e-book store will play a growing role in Amazon ’s future .
“ If they do n’t beat everyone else to the e-book game , they will lose revenue , ” McQuivey said .
Forrester found people who buy e-readers have increased book purchases 50 percent .
On the disclosure level , McQuivey pointed to Apple , which gave sales data for its iPod and iPhone early on .
“ Apple did n’t have a music business they needed to preserve , ” McQuivey said .
“ They needed to convince the music industry that they had a viable platform . ”
Amazon ’s fight to protect its hold on the fast - growing e-books market gives it more reason to keep specific data out of the hands of competitors .
“ If you , as an investor , invest in Amazon , you go in knowing that you ’re not going to get a significant amount of disclosure , ” said James Friedland , a Cowen & Co analyst .
“ We would all love it ( more information ) -- they wo n’t do it .
They ’ll just keep deflecting questions . ”

The first new single from Sade in almost a decade !
What are you waiting for ?!
Press play B*tches !
[ audio : http://soulculture.com/01 Soldier Of Love.mp3 ]
Moody , vibesome ( my new non-existing favourite word ) and darkly rejuvinating – Sade has just tipped me over the edge with anticipation of her forthcoming 2010 album , Soldier Of Love ( out February 8th , 2010 ) .
Judging by this first single , she is about to ‘ do a Maxwell ’ and flip the f***ing script .
( But even more so – and universally ) .
I hope the rumours of them working together are true … but either way , this album release will clearly be an event .
And with those killer drums I ’m voting Nas for the remix …
Can you wait for the new project ?
Other than the fact that you have to …
( Sidenote : you can pre-order the album from sade.com )
Major ( and naughty ) props to YK2 Daily for this one .
What do you think ??
A recent article about the FDA reversing itself on the safety of bisphenol - A [ 1 ] echoes concerns I wrote about this chemical compound in December 2007 ( " Lexan , Bisphenol - A and the Big Berky water filter " [ 2 ] )
Anyone who uses products that contact food or drink made with flexible plastic should give some thought to the bisphenol - A issue .
This includes all types of soda , soft and drink bottles , but there is much more to it .
It just might be that bispenol - A might be among the silent pathogens in our environment , responsible for the increase in cancer cases .
Smoking has greatly decreased , but cancer has not .
Science would logically indicate that in our environment must be either new carcinogens , or the public is increasingly exposed to more existing carcinogens .
What I had not considered in my article written in 2007 about Lexan and other plastic products was the impact that a bisphenol - A ban will have on numerous other plastic products .
Hospitals and doctor offices generate a staggering amount of medical waste every day all around the world .
Disposable plastics are a required medical evil in this era of endless communicable diseases .
Everywhere around you are flexible plastic products which can contain bisphenol - A. Consider the plastic wrap and foam trays used to package meat and vegetable trays in stores .
Cold - cuts are packaged in direct contact with plastics .
Chemicals with preservatives and salt are used to prolong shelf life .
What is known about bisphenol - A leaching out of plastics into food consumed by millions ?
Does this also create complex carcinogens ?
What about take - out food , such as Chinese ?
More and more Chinese food is packaged into flexible plastic containers instead of paper .
Won -Ton soup is very hot when it 's served in plastic take - out containers .
Is it possible heat from soups and hot foods accelerate the leaching of bisphenol - A into food ?
Take - home fish - fries are usually packaged Styrofoam containers .
What effects does the heat from hot fish just removed from 400 degree hot oil have on the plastic ?
How much bisphenol - A is leached out into the food ?
Ever open a container and pick up a plastic scent ?
What does the hot oil that drips from the fish do to the plastic ?
It is well - known that heat accelerates chemical reactions - and with it the breakdown of plastic compounds .
Hot coffee has been served for decades in Styrofoam cups .
Coffee is highly acidic and could rapidly leach bisphenol - A from the containers into the coffee .
If this coffee and bisphenol - A creates a carcinogen , countless millions of coffee drinkers from drivers to office workers to construction workers who consume this everyday may be unknowingly shortening their lives .
Here are a few commonly medical products used daily in doctor 's offices and / or hospitals - all made with flexible plastic : 1 . IV bags .
Everything from simple saline , morphine , anti-biotics , blood donor collection bags and many more all use flexible plastic bags .
Only a few extremely powerful drugs which have a PH level that will react with plastic , such as the anti-biotic Methicillin must be packaged in glass IV bottles .
Everything else is in plastic .
The real question is - has any company or university tested for bisphenol - A leaching out of the plastic into the medicine ?
2 . IV tubing - including the end of the IV line itself which inserts into a vein in the patient .
This tiny plastic flexible tube smaller than a regular pencil lead left in a patient 's vein after an insertion needle is used to deposit it there .
It can remain in the body in contact with the blood stream in a vein up to three days ( or more for some institutional standards ) before it must be removed .
3 . Syringes are used to inject just about every drug there is .
Inside the syringe are synthetic polymer seals for the piston .
4 . Plastic stents are used to keep veins or arteries open .
These can remain in the body for the life of the patient .
5 . Respiratory apparatus - hoses , nasal cannulas , masks , etc ... are made of flexible vinyl or other polymers and are used for administering oxygen .
6 . Numerous throw - away , one - time - use medical devices such as pre-loaded incision staplers used in operating rooms during surgery .
7 . Catheters and other tubing inserted into the body during treatment temporarily or permanent .
8 . Lens implants for the human eye for curing cataracts .
These must be flexible in order to focus light on the retina .
It 's unknown if lens implants contain bisphenol - A , but fortunately these do have a great track record in restoring eyesight .
9 . Food bags use special esophageal tubes to feed patients who cannot swallow or are in comas .
Tubing is inserted through the nose and down the esophagus into the stomach .
These remain in place for long periods of time for some patients who cannot eat .
It simply comes down to one thing - if something is made of plastic and it's flexible , it might contain bisphenol - A .
Are we facing a medical equivalent of " Do n't ask , do n't tell " with this issue ?
Certainly there are other flexible plastic medical devices used in doctor 's offices and hospitals .
For medical applications , biomedical engineers must specify plastic products for manufacturing medical devices which only use FDA approved materials .
These approved materials must withstand the salinity and various chemicals found in the human body .
It is not known at this time which medical devices contain bisphenol - A .
The impact caused by the FDA removing bisphenol - A from plastic products will be difficult to completely implement with patient care products , if not impossible .
Only scientific testing will be able to prove whether detrimental effects are taking place .
Scientific studies of the effect of cell phones on humans and animals in America all seemed to conclude there is little or no effect from microwaves on mammals .
Yet in Europe test results concluded that tumors were formed .
A connection has been found between the results of microwave radiation and who funds the studies .
If you have doubt , consider how your microwave oven cooks meat .
How many decades passed until the serious health effects of smoking were revealed ?
Logically the implication of bisphenol - A effects makes us ask the following questions :
Will the public ever be told about the effects of bisphenol - A on human beings ?
Who will fund the numerous studies and tests required to find out ?
Whether or not this is ever revealed , the safest thing is simply to limit personal exposure to flexible plastics containing any food or drugs .
I say let 's bring back glass containers .
These are highly recyclable , and when melted down are absolutely sterilized even against the most vicious diseases like prions that cause CJD , commonly known as mad cow disease .
The only drawback with glass is the extra energy required to recycle it .
But does n't that extra energy have a much lower price tag when compared to the health care costs induced by the effects of bisphenol - A? Ted Twietmeyer [ 1 ] - http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/

Genesis 1:14 - 19
“ Then God said , ‘ Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to divide the day from the night ; and let them be for signs and seasons , and for days and years ; and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light on the Earth ’ ; and it was so .
Then God made two great lights : the greater light to rule the day , and the lesser light to rule the night .
He made the stars also .
… So the evening and the morning were the fourth day . ”
According to Genesis , the sun , moon , and stars were made on the fourth day of the Creation week .
There have been many attempts to stretch the Creation days into vast periods of time in order to accommodate Scripture with secular science .
However , the problem is not with Scripture , but with our attempts to rationalize and understand the Creation week , something that can not be done by finite minds !
There are many details of God ’s creative plan that simply cannot be compromised with current scientific opinion .
Some of the unanswered questions are :
How could plants exist on the third day , before the sun was present ( Genesis 1:11 - 13 ) ?
“ Light ” existed before the sun ( Genesis . 1:3 ) .
What light source did God use to mark the first three days ?
Since the seas were also formed before the sun ( Genesis. 1:9-10 ) , why did n’t they quickly freeze ?
Why did n’t the “ water above ” fall to the ground as snow ( Genesis 1:9 ) ?
Did Earth initially move in a straight line , or did it orbit the position of the yet - to - be- created sun ?
An entire book could be filled with such questions from Genesis 1 - 2 .
All the answers would be speculative and probably wrong !
The Creation week was supernatural and therefore beyond our understanding .
God had his own reasons for the order of Creation events .
We are in no position to question them or to offer suggestions for improvement .
Yes , I believe that the days of Creation were literal 24 - hour time periods .
Scholars have shown that this is intended meaning of the text .
The week of seven , 24 - hour days , so familiar to us , had its beginning at the Creation .
God could have made everything in six microseconds or in six trillion years , but he chose literal days as a general pattern for mankind .
Exodus 20:11 — “ For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the Earth , the sea , and all that is in them , and rested the seventh day .
Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it . ”
The literal Creation days also display God ’s perfect glory and wisdom :
Does not wisdom call out ?…
I was there when he set the heavens in place …
Then I was the craftsman at his side .
I was filled with delight day after day ,
rejoicing always in his presence .
Proverbs 8:1a , 27a , 30

H. L. Mencken used to say that governments provoked moral panics and kept people in fear of “ imaginary hobgoblins ” so they would n’t notice the hand picking their pockets .
The main purpose of the Drug War is to keep us in a state of fear as a way of empowering the state and its corporate partners in crime .
The Drug War is one of the best expedients ever hit on for that purpose : it has resulted in unprecedented militarization of local police forces , turned the Fourth , Fifth and Sixth Amendments into toilet paper , and generally done more to promote authoritarianism in American society than anything but the two world wars and the so - called “ War on Terror . ”
If you consider the validity of the fear campaign itself even a serious issue , by the way , you might peruse the violent crime and addiction statistics from Amsterdam .
We ’ve handed our society over to the police state and to criminal gangs ( there ’s a difference ? ) , and did n’t even get a crime reduction .
The shade of Benjamin Franklin must be gratified : we traded liberty for security and got neither .
I previously argued in this column that the Drug War empowers organized crime , and that crooked cops are the biggest drug gang of all .
The main constituency behind the Drug War is the criminals who control the drug trade and benefit from black market prices .
It ’s the same principle that governed alcohol Prohibition .
It ’s unlikely Prohibition had a greater friend in America than Al Capone .
And whenever a dry county law comes up for a vote in the Bible Belt , you can bet the biggest supporter of staying dry is the local bootlegger — and that he ’s the biggest source of campaign funds for the teetotaling Baptist politicians .
Likewise , the biggest supporters of the Drug War are the drug cartels .
And the CIA is among the biggest drug cartels of all , using the international drug trade to finance everybody from the Khmer Rouge to the Mujaheddin to the Contras .
The government , despite the public verbal diarrhea of dimwits like William Bennett , does n’t want to defeat the drug trade any more than Oceania wanted to defeat Eurasia .
Blogger Larry Gambone has long believed , he writes , that the “ most shrill ” drug warriors “ have some financial reason to be in favour of the black market in drugs . ”
Mike Ruppert , usually dismissed as a “ conspiracy theorist , ” implicated the banking system , which he accused of laundering drug money by in massive quantities and then putting it in the stock market .
Thank God Ruppert has managed to evade Cass Sunstein ’s clutches , crazy conspiracy theorist that he is , long enough for the latest news from the nonconspiratorial professional journalists at the Guardian .
The left - leaning UK newspaper quotes Antonio Maria Costa , head of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime , to the effect that “ Drugs money worth billions of dollars kept the financial system afloat at the height of the global crisis … ”
Organized crime proceeds like drug money , he says , were “ ’ the only liquid investment capital ’ available to some banks on the brink of collapse last year . ”
Most of the $ 352 billion in drug profits were absorbed into the above - ground economy by that means .
America will always be fighting drugs , the same way Oceania was always fighting Eurasia .
Drugs are too profitable an enemy to ever defeat .

Omens of Doom : Dubai ’s Burj Khalifa Tower
Omens of Doom : Dubai ’s Burj Khalifa Tower
It is a colossus , towering over the Dubai skyline .
The company behind it claims to have made a successful return of 10 percent .
The local paper , the Khaleej Times , did not shy away from hyperbole , seeing the building as ‘ an example of human courage and man ’s ability to dream and deliver ’ , giving the world ‘ an achievement difficult to surpass ’ ( Jan 4 ) .
The Burj Khalifa Tower , renamed in tribute to Dubai ’s bailout donor , Abu Dhabi ’s Sheik Khalifa , dwarfs all that have come before it .
It is a monstrous compilation of gimmicks in some ways , another addition to the mix of Vegas - styled faux islands , shopping centres and ski runs .
Dubai portends to be a place of trickery , entertainment and massive expense accounts .
The building itself boasts 200 floors , and rises to 828 meters .
It promises to be the home of the first Armani Hotel .
Patrons are whisked between floors in elevators at the speed of 18 metres a second .
But what does this building suggest about Dubai and the architectural madness that characterizes such efforts ?
For one thing , the creation strikes deeply at the apocalyptic language of the recently concluded Copenhagen Climate Change conference .
The Sheiks seem less interested in carbon footprints than oil - financed structures of glass and steel .
They keep company with architects such as Adrian Smith , the designer of the Burj Khalifa and Cesar Pelli , who gave England the One Canada Square and Malaysia the Petronas Twin Towers .
Dubai suffers , like tyrants , from an overwhelming edifice complex .
Its spending complex resembles the efforts of the Pharaohs and their pyramid projects , or those of the medieval Catholic Church : bigger is better , huge monuments to progress , humanity and God .
Sometimes , the smaller the state , the more obsessed the efforts in building the Tower of Babel .
Megalomania is the classic byproduct of inferiority complexes , often induced by money without sense .
All of these point to a thesis formulated in 1999 by Andrew Lawrence he dubbed the Skyscraper Index .
These figures of modernity seem to precede periods of crisis .
At low points of the business cycle , these architectural Cyclops seem to rise .
The Empire State building was conceived in 1929 , the same year of Black Tuesday ( October 29 ) and the onset of the Great Depression .
The Sears Tower of the 1970s towered over a society in the grip of stagflation and oil shocks .
The monumental Petronas Twin Towers opened in 1997 , the year when Asian currencies took a pummeling , humbling Asia ’s ‘ Tiger ’ economies .
In the civilisational sense , this may also be true : the big building , or building project , is a symptom of decay .
The American novelist Henry James certainly thought so , though he was thinking of it more in the aesthetic sense .
In an economic sense , the great building project tends to forecast ruin .
Athens passed quietly into the shade after the building of the Acropolis .
Henry VIII of England and Christian IV of Denmark were builders who drained their treasuries , left magnificent buildings , yet failed consistently on the battlefield .
The building efforts of the Pharaohs , as Paul Johnson pointed out in 2005 , suggest a hubristic tendency that eventually will meet nemesis .
The Wall Street Journal ( Jan 5 ) was confident that such a building mania would not last , sniping at Dubai ’s paltry credentials on ‘ economic freedom , rule of law , hard work and sound management ’ relative to such cities as Houston and Hong Kong .
‘ Without these , nations and cities alike build nothing but foundations of sand . ’
Given the precedents set by previous failed civilizations , the omens are not good .
Dubai ’s economy is in a mess .
Sheik Khalifa has been generous to the tune of $ 10 billion .
In an age of environmental sensitivities and proliferating green fan clubs , we might well be witnessing a dying breed .
When the excitement does die down , the business of preventing Dubai from sliding into oblivion will begin .

It could be a storming year .
He 's expecting his summer truffle trees to yield between 70kg and 230kg a hectare and sell for around € 280 ( £ 249 ) per kilo ( the current price is € 400 per kilo but this varies during the year ) .
The more delicate black truffles have a lower yield but sell for four to five times that price .
" People have been growing truffles in the UK for close to 40 years .
What we have done is bring the technology up to date , making it more reliable , " says Thomas .
L.A. money manager TCW Group today filed a lawsuit against its former chief investment officer , Jeffrey Gundlach , accusing the star bond fund manager of conspiracy , unfair competition and theft of proprietary TCW information .
TCW , which fired Gundlach on Dec. 4 , says in the suit ( a PDF copy is here ) that he had become “ unfit ” to remain a senior officer , citing behavior that had become “ erratic ” and “ increasingly and openly confrontational . ”
The suit says that on the day TCW fired him , the firm found “ inappropriate contraband ” in his offices , “ consisting of marijuana , drug paraphernalia . . . and a collection of 12 sexual devices , 34 hardcore pornographic magazines and 36 hardcore sexually explicit DVDs and videocassettes . ”
A spokesman for Gundlach and his new firm , DoubleLine Capital , said Gundlach had no immediate comment , pending review of the suit .
[ UPDATE : DoubleLine issued a statement calling the suit " meritless " and accusing TCW of using " gutter " tactics .
More here . ]
The 50 - year - old Gundlach , considered one of Wall Street ’s sharpest investors in mortgage - backed bonds , had been chief investment officer at TCW since 2005 and was a 24 - year veteran of the firm .
TCW , which manages more than $ 100 billion in assets , said it terminated Gundlach because he had threatened to leave and take his staff with him .
Gundlach has said that the firm ’s French parent , bank titan Societe Generale , was intent on firing him after he sought more say - so on TCW ’s future .
Gundlach last month formed his own firm , DoubleLine , with backing from another L.A. money management titan , Oaktree Capital Management .
About 40 people on Gundlach ’s 65 - member bond team at TCW have since followed him to DoubleLine , which began operations on Dec. 14 .
TCW also has faced huge cash outflows from its flagship mutual fund , TCW Total Return Bond , which had been managed by Gundlach .
TCW ’s suit , filed in state Superior Court , alleges that Gundlach “ conspired while at TCW to steal confidential and proprietary TCW information ” and has “ solicited business from [ TCW clients ] by making false statements about TCW and its capabilities . ”
Gundlach and certain associates also named in the suit " secretly organized DoubleLine back in October 2009 and laid the groundwork for its launch , " TCW says .
" That groundwork included wholesale theft of vast quantities of TCW proprietary information , " the firm alleges .

' Hardball ' & Dumbed - Down US Politics
This past week , grappling with the twin top stories of Haiti ’s earthquake tragedy and the Massachusetts Senate race , MSNBC ’s Chris Matthews personified the strange mix of puffed - up self - importance and total lack of self - awareness that has come to define America ’s media punditocracy .
Email
Printer friendly During “ Hardball ” programs of recent days , Matthews has veered from pontificating about how the killer earthquake in Haiti might finally cause its people to get “ serious ” about their politics to explaining how Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley deserves to lose , in part , because she called ex-Boston Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling “ a Yankees fan . ”
Not only did Matthews ’s remarks about Haitian politics reflect a profound ignorance about that country and its history , but he seemed blissfully clueless about his own role as a purveyor of political trivia over substance in his dozen years as a TV talk - show host in the United States , as demonstrated in his poll - and - gaffe - obsessed coverage of the important Massachusetts Senate race .
Indeed , Matthews may be the archetype of what ’s wrong with the U.S. news media , a devotee of conventional wisdom who splashes in the shallowest baby pool of American politics while pretending to be the big boy who 's diving into the deep end .
When the United States most needed courageous journalism in 2003 , Matthews hailed the U.S. invasion of Iraq , declaring “ we ’re all neocons now ” and praising the manliness of President George W. Bush ’s flight - suited arrival on the USS Abraham Lincoln to celebrate “ mission accomplished . ”
And today , if Matthews ’s interest in political “ hardball ” were genuine – not just an excuse to position himself as a relentless front - runner – he might have used some of the hours devoted to the Haitian crisis to explain how real “ hardball ” politics works .
He also might have discussed the true merits and demerits of Coakley and her Republican rival , state Sen.
Scott Brown , not just the atmospherics of their campaigns .
Instead , regarding Haiti , Matthews detected a silver lining in the catastrophe that may have killed more than 100,000 people .
He said the horrific event might finally cause the people there to cast off their supposedly frivolous attitude toward politics .
In a stunning display of racial and historical tone - deafness , Matthews compared Haiti ’s alleged political fun-and - games with those of Louisiana in its supposed tolerance of corrupt machine politicians who left New Orleans vulnerable to the ravages of Hurricane Katrina .
Whether he intended it or not , there was the creepy implication that descendants of African slaves were at fault for their own suffering in both cases .
While not quite as weird as the remarks by right - wing televangelist Pat Robertson – blaming the earthquake and other natural disasters that have hit Haiti on the Haitians supposedly striking a two - century - old deal with the devil to drive out their French slaveowners – Matthews ’s commentary may have been even more troubling since it reflected a more mainstream U.S. media viewpoint .
Haiti’s History Matthews might have shown a touch of seriousness himself by examining some of the real history that has put Haitians in their wretched condition .
He might have talked about the ruthless efficiency of the 18th Century French plantation system that literally worked enslaved Africans to death for the enrichment of the pampered French aristocracy .
Or he might have delved into the hypocrisy of French revolutionaries ( and some of their U.S. sympathizers , like Thomas Jefferson ) for advocating equality for all while rejecting freedom for African slaves ; or Haiti ’s remarkable slave rebellion that defeated Napoleon ’s army and how that victory forced Napoleon to sell the Louisiana territories ( ironically to President Jefferson ) .
Or Matthews might have taken the story through the 19th Century , describing how the hostility of France and the slave - owning United States combined to devastate Haiti ’s hopes for a better future .
The French used military coercion in 1825 to force Haiti to agree to indemnify France 150 million francs ( about $ 21.7 billion in today ’s value ) while the United States embargoed Haiti and denied it diplomatic recognition until the U.S. Civil War in 1862 .
Or the " Hardball " host could have described how bloody U.S. military interventions in the early 20th Century were rationalized to “ restore order ” but in reality protected American economic interests .
U.S. Gen. Smedley Butler later wrote of his role in crushing a popular Haitian uprising as making Haiti “ a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in . ”
Matthews also might have explained how the United States backed the brutal Duvalier family dictatorships from 1957 to 1986 when Haiti was considered a frontline state against Washington 's Cold War fear that Fidel Castro ’s communist revolution in Cuba might spread across the Caribbean .
Or how Haiti ’s nascent moves toward democracy through the elections of popular ex-Catholic priest Jean - Bertrand Aristide were undermined by Republican distaste for “ liberation theology , ” which called on the Church to follow Jesus ’s teaching and align itself with the poor versus the rich , a position that the Reagan administration viewed as akin to communism .
Aristide ’s elections were overturned by coups in 1991 ( during George H.W. Bush ’s presidency ) and in 2004 ( with George W. Bush in the White House ) while the U.S. government either tacitly or directly sided with the coup plotters .
In 1993 , when Democratic President Bill Clinton was seeking to restore Aristide to office , I was in Haiti working on a PBS “ Frontline ” documentary .
Part of my job was to spend time with operatives of right - wing paramilitary groups supporting the dictatorship of Gen. Raoul Cedras .
Some of these operatives told me about faxes and other messages they were receiving from Republicans in Washington advising them how to frustrate Clinton ’s initiatives for restoring Aristide to power .
Those efforts , in fact , were turned back by a violent confrontation at the Port - au - Prince docks when the USS Harlan County tried to land , humiliating Clinton and the United States .
Now , that was real “ hardball ” politics : Republicans undercutting the foreign policy of a sitting U.S. President to make him look ineffectual and feckless .
A year later , Clinton saw no choice but to oust Cedras through a U.S. military invasion .
Aristide was restored to the presidency but his final months in office were tightly restricted with him serving primarily as a figurehead .
When Aristide was elected again in 2001 , he faced renewed hostility from the Haitian elite and from the second Bush administration , which helped engineer his removal from office in 2004 , airlifting him against his will to the Central African Republic .
Yet , Chris Matthews summed up this extraordinary history as a situation in which the Haitian people just did n’t take their politics seriously enough .
Massachusetts Follies Days later , without a blush for any inconsistency , Matthews was discussing the pivotal Massachusetts Senate race in the most frivolous terms , dividing his coverage between the latest poll numbers and commentary over the campaign gaffes of Democratic candidate Martha Coakley .
Beyond noting the obvious impact on health - care legislation , Matthews shed little light on the experience and policy positions of the two candidates .
Instead , watchers of “ Hardball ” got to hear Coakley ’s brief confusion over Schilling ’s allegiance in the Yankees - Red Sox rivalry and learned that Scott Brown is a photogenic guy who travels around in a truck .
Matthews dispensed with the serious stuff .
He had little interest in mentioning Coakley ’s history as an aggressive prosecutor , her central role in winning settlements from contractors of Boston ’s infamous Big Dig project and from Wall Street firms that engaged in deceptive practices , including $ 60 million from Goldman Sachs to settle allegations that it promoted unfair home loans .
Coakley also backs President Barack Obama ’s decision to try some terrorism suspects in civilian courts and his proposed tax on financial institutions to recoup taxpayers ’ assistance that bailed the banks out of the crisis of 2008 , two of Obama 's positions that Brown opposes .
Plus , Coakley has taken some more progressive stances than Obama , opposing his troop build - up in Afghanistan and seeking to overturn the federal legal definition of marriage as a union between a man and a woman .
For his part , Brown favors more Reagan - Bush - style tax cuts , supports the near - drowning interrogation method called waterboarding , and opposes same - sex marriage , even voting for a constitutional amendment to define marriage as only between a man and a woman .
However , Matthews ’s “ Hardball ” was more absorbed by the populist celebrities that have stumped with Brown , including Schilling , Massachusetts football hero Doug Flutie and actor John Ratzenberger , who played Cliff Clavin in the TV show about a fictional Boston bar , “ Cheers . ”
As the U.S. government sinks further into dysfunction – incapable of addressing the nation ’s worsening economic and social crises – as it wallows in a debt deeper than any Third World country could dream of , historians may look back on some of the empty - headed commentary of programs like “ Hardball with Chris Matthews ” for clues as to why the United States failed .

To Paul Williams , spurring more exercise out of the half of Americans who are already active is just as important as coaxing the sedentary off the sofa .
In Dr. Williams ' study of more than 100,000 runners over nearly 20 years , stepped up exercise was found to have some powerful benefits .
But his research is controversial .
While Dr. Williams is well respected by other exercise scientists , he is shunned by those in the public - health field .
Dr. Williams is routinely excluded from committees charged with formulating exercise ...
Buildapp - Create executables with SBCL or CCL
Buildapp is an application for SBCL or CCL that configures and saves an executable Common Lisp image .
It is similar to cl- launch and hu.dwim.build .
Buildapp is available under a BSD - style license .
The latest version is 1.5.6 , released on November 7th , 2015 .
Download shortcut : http://www.xach.com/lisp/buildapp.tgz
Contents
Installation
Buildapp does not require any libraries .
To compile it with SBCL you simply run make install .
To compile with a different lisp , just specify it after the make command : make install LISP= < my_favorite_lisp > .
For example , you wanted to compile it under CCL you 'd say make install LISP=ccl
By default , it is installed in /usr / local / bin ; to use another location , use make DESTDIR= / path install .
You can also create the buildapp binary by loading the buildapp system with asdf and running ( buildapp: build - buildapp ) .
Example Use
Here 's a small application :
$ buildapp \ -- eval '( defun main ( argv ) ( declare ( ignore argv ) ) ( write - line " Hello , world " ) ) ' \ -- entry main \ -- output hello - world [ undoing binding stack and other enclosing state ... done ] [ saving current Lisp image into hello - world : writing 6352 bytes from the read - only space at 0x20000000 writing 4064 bytes from the static space at 0x20100000 writing 44834816 bytes from the dynamic space at 0x1000000000 done ] $ ./hello - world Hello , world
The following creates a toy curl - like application .
( It 's not quite practical , because any errors will land you in the interactive debugger . )
$ buildapp -- output lisp - curl -- asdf - path ~/ src / clbuild / systems / \ -- load - system drakma \ -- eval '( defun main ( args ) ( write - string ( drakma : http - request ( second args ) ) ) ) '
\ -- entry main ;; loading system sb - grovel ( needed by drakma ) ;; from /usr / local / lib/ sbcl/sb-grovel / ;; loading system sb-posix ( needed by cl+ssl ) ;; from /usr / local / lib/sbcl/sb-posix / ;; loading system trivial - gray - streams ( needed by chunga , cl+ssl , flexi- streams ) ;; from /home / xach/src/clbuild/source/trivial - gray - streams / ;; loading system flexi - streams ( needed by drakma , cl+ssl ) ;; from /home / xach/src/clbuild/source/flexi-streams / ;; loading system alexandria ( needed by cffi , babel ) ;; from /home / xach/src/clbuild/source/alexandria / ;; loading system trivial - features ( needed by cffi , babel ) ;; from /home / xach/src/clbuild/source/trivial - features / ;; loading system babel ( needed by cffi ) ;; from /home / xach/src/clbuild/source / babel / ;; loading system cffi ( needed by cl+ssl ) ;; from /home / xach/src/clbuild/source/cffi/ ;; loading system cl+ssl ( needed by drakma ) ;; from /home / xach/src/clbuild/source/cl+ssl/ ;; loading system sb-bsd - sockets ( needed by usocket ) ;; from / usr / local / lib / sbcl / sb-bsd - sockets / ;; loading system usocket ( needed by drakma ) ;; from /home / xach/src/clbuild/source / usocket / ;; loading system chunga ( needed by drakma ) ;; from /home / xach/src/clbuild/source/chunga/ ;; loading system cl - base64 ( needed by drakma ) ;; from /home / xach/src/clbuild/source/cl-base64/ ;; loading system puri ( needed by drakma ) ;; from /home / xach/src/clbuild/source/puri/ ;; loading system drakma ;; from /home / xach/src/clbuild/source/drakma/ [ undoing binding stack and other enclosing state ... done ] [ saving current Lisp image into lisp - curl : writing 6352 bytes from the read - only space at 0x20000000 writing 5472 bytes from the static space at 0x20100000 writing 61722624 bytes from the dynamic space at 0x1000000000 done ] $ ./lisp-curl http://xach.com/

Here 's how the l1sp.org redirection service application is built :

CL - USER ( 1 ) :
The ( setf swank : * log - output * nil ) eval is needed to avoid problems when the image restarts .
redirector : : main looks like this :
( defun main ( argv ) ( declare ( ignore argv ) ) ( load " / opt/l1sp/etc/init.lisp " ) ( sb- impl : : toplevel - repl nil ) )
Here 's an example of the -- dispatched - entry option , which was inspired by the desire to have a dozen different small utilities embedded in one big executable and called based on the binary name .
First , the support files :
; ; ; ; utils.lisp ( defpackage #:utils ( :use #:cl ) ) ( in - package # :utils ) ( defun main ( argv ) ( let ( ( name ( pathname - name ( first argv ) ) ) ) ( format * error - output * " Unknown binary name ~S , try using cl - echo , cl- ls , or cl - true ~ % " name ) ( sb- ext: quit :unix- status 1 ) ) ) ; ; ; ; ls.lisp ( defpackage #:ls ( :use #:cl ) ) ( in - package # :ls ) ( defun main ( argv ) ( declare ( ignore argv ) ) ( dolist ( file ( directory " *.* " ) ) ( write - line ( namestring file ) ) ) ) ;; ; ; echo.lisp ( defpackage #:echo ( :use #:cl ) ) ( in - package # :echo ) ( defun main ( argv ) ( format t " ~{~A ~ ^ ~} ~ % " ( rest argv ) ) ) ; ; ;; true.lisp ( defpackage #:true ( : use #:cl ) ) ( in - package # : true ) ( defun main ( argv ) ( declare ( ignore argv ) ) ( sb- ext: quit :unix - status 0 ) )
Buliding it all together looks like this :

Overview
Here is the usage output of buildapp :
Usage : buildapp -- output OUTPUT-FILE
[-- flag1 value1 ...]
Required flags : -- output OUTPUT -FILE
Use OUTPUT -FILE as the name of the executable to create Entry - point flags : -- entry NAME
Use the function identified by NAME as the executable 's toplevel function .
Called with SB - EXT :* POSIX - ARGV * as its only argument .
If NAME has a colon , it is treated as a package separator , otherwise CL - USER is the implied package .
-- dispatched - entry DNAME
Specify one possible entry function , depending on the name of the file that is used to start the application .
The syntax of DNAME is APPLICATION - NAME / ENTRY - NAME .
If the name used to start the executable matches APPLICATION - NAME , use ENTRY - NAME as the entry point .
This can be used to choose one of many possible entry points by e.g. symlinking names to the application executable .
If APPLICATION - NAME is empty , the specified ENTRY - NAME is used as a default if no other application names match .
There may be any number of dispatched entry points , but only one default .
Action flags : -- load FILE Load FILE .
CL :* PACKAGE * is bound to the CL - USER package before loading -- load - system NAME Load an ASDF system identified by NAME -- require NAME Use CL: REQUIRE to load NAME --eval CODE Use CL:EVAL to evaulate CODE .
The code is read with CL : READ - FROM -STRING in the CL - USER package
There may be any number of load / load - system / require / eval flags .
Each is executed in command - line order before creating an executable .
Load path flags : -- load - path DIRECTORY
When handling a -- load , search DIRECTORY for files to load -- asdf - path DIRECTORY
When handling a -- load - system , search DIRECTORY for ASDF system files to load -- asdf - tree DIRECTORY
When handling a -- load - system , search DIRECTORY and all its subdirectories for ASDF system files to load -- manifest - file FILE
When handling a -- load - system , read a list of ASDF system file pathnames from FILE as possible matching systems .
There may be any number of load - path / asdf - path / asdf - tree / manifest - file flags .
They take priority in command - line order .
Other flags : -- compress - core Compress the core or executable ; requires configuration support in SBCL -- core - only Make a core file only , not an executable -- dynamic - space - size MB Pass a -- dynamic - space - size option to SBCL when building ; value is megabytes -- help Show this usage message -- logfile FILE Log compilation and load output to FILE -- sbcl PATH-TO - SBCL Use PATH -TO - SBCL instead of the sbcl program found in your PATH environment variable

Limitations
Buildapp is limited in scope .
It aims to make the following steps easy :
Define an application environment by loading files , loading ASDF systems , evaluating code , and using CL: REQUIRE
Dump an executable image with an arbitrary startup function
By design , it does not handle the following tasks :
Initialization tasks at app startup ( use SB - EXT :* INIT - HOOKS * for that )
Debugger management ( use * DEBUGGER - HOOK * for that )
for that )
Command - line processing ( use a library such as COMMAND - LINE - ARGUMENTS for that )
Obtaining libraries ( use clbuild , LibCL , cl- librarian , asdf - install , etc. for that )
Implementation
Buildapp works like this :
It processes the command - line and creates an object that captures the command - line requirements : the output file , any eval / load / load - system / require actions , the entry function , etc .
It creates a new Lisp file ( the dumpfile ) with all the commands needed to implement the command - line options .
It runs either " sbcl " with sb - ext : run - program or " ccl " with ccl : run - program .
In either case lisp is invoked with no init files ( it does n't read user or system rc files ) and loads the dumpfile :
The first few commands of the dumpfile establish a specialized loading environment :
The debugger is changed with * invoke - debugger - hook * to simply quit with a special exit code instead of entering the normal debugger ( in CCL the same behavior is accomplished using the :application and : error - handler arguments to ccl : save - application )
to simply quit with a special exit code instead of entering the normal debugger ( in CCL the same behavior is accomplished using the and arguments to )
Most output ( ASDF system compilation output , low - level error messages , etc ) is redirected to a log stream ; that stream can be directed to a file with the -- logfile argument
argument Stale compiled files are automatically recompiled with an : around method on asdf: perform
There are some sanity checks :
Is the output file writable ?
Does this version of sbcl support the required : save - runtime - options argument ?
The dumpfile performs the eval / load / load - system / require actions .
Each operation is evaluated in the cl-user package and with a fresh binding of sb - ext :* invoke - debugger - hook * in sbcl or ccl : :* debugger - hook * in ccl to the buildapp debugger function .
If the binding is modified , the new value is saved .
The dumpfile clears itself out of the environment : Remove extra ASDF methods with remove - method
Reset the debugger hook to the saved value or NIL if no value was saved .
Delete the dumpfile package with delete - package
The dumpfile then creates an executable with save - lisp - and - die in sbcl or ccl : save - application in ccl .
This ends the lisp subprocess .
It deletes the dumpfile .
The ASDF central registry is temporarily extended with the - - asdf - path and -- asdf - tree arguments at load time , and reverts back to the default central registry value after that .
To avoid conflicts with this behavior , changes to the central registry should be done at startup time instead of application load time .

There 's nothing more fear - inspiring than the prospect of an IRS tax audit .
Approximately one million taxpayers are subjected to an IRS audit each year , and while some individuals are chosen at random , the vast majority of audits are the result of an inconsistency or error on individual tax returns .
While there is no way to prevent being chosen at random , it is possible to avoid certain red flag items that may trigger an IRS audit .
Income Reporting
Unreported income is the number one factor that can result in an IRS audit .
Any income you receive must be reported to the IRS , whether it 's from your job , gambling , a side hobby , or the sale of any securities you might own .
If an employer or other entity issues you with a W - 2 , 1099 , or other income tax reporting form , then it is also being issued to the IRS .
If there is a discrepancy between how much you claim to have earned and how much the IRS knows you have earned , this can potentially trigger an audit .
Fluctuations in Income
Similar to not reporting income , reporting wide fluctuations in income from one year to the next can also raise a red flag .
For example , if you reported $ 25,000 in income one year and $ 85,000 the next , the IRS may question why your income has suddenly increased .
If your income is statistically lower than those who work in the same occupation as you , or if you make over $ 100,000 annually , your chances of being audited may increase .
Numerous Deductions
By all means , you should always take advantage of any deductions you are entitled .
The problem with IRS deductions is that oftentimes , people tend to get creative in categorizing certain expenses as deductions and this can result in an audit .
For instance , a common audit trigger is the deduction of a home office .
The IRS has specific rules regarding what qualifies as a home office and you must be sure you meet the requirements before claiming a home office deduction .
Another common trigger occurs with charitable contribution deductions .
If you make $ 40,000 per year and claim $ 15,000 in charitable contributions , this will make the IRS suspicious .
Dependents and Spousal Support .
There are a number of ways people can decrease their tax liability and one is by claiming dependents .
However , you should be aware that if you 're divorced , only one parent may claim a child as a dependent .
This is usually the custodial parent unless he or she signs a waiver allowing the other parent to claim the dependent .
If you receive spousal support such as alimony , the IRS can check the amount of support reported vs. the amount of support claimed as a deduction by the other party .
Mathematical Errors
Mathematical errors are common and if a significant mathematical discrepancy is apparent , then the IRS will likely want to double - check the information and find the source of the discrepancy .
Tax - preparation software can reduce the probability of incurring mathematical errors but it 's always best to carefully double - check your figures .
Similarly , using round numbers rather than raw figures can also trigger an audit so be cautious of using estimated figures in your tax reporting .
While no one wants to be audited by the IRS , you can reduce the chances that you will become the target of an audit by knowing what mistakes to avoid in preparing your tax return .
The key to avoiding common red flag triggers is to be honest and accurate in your tax reporting and to double - check your return carefully for errors before submitting it .

DR . STEVE BRULE'S ANSWER :
A Dutch airline passenger told The Post how he leapt into action when an alleged Muslim terrorist tried to blow up a Detroit - bound airliner packed with 300 people just moments before landing .
Chaos erupted as alleged terrorist Umar Farouk Abdul Mutallab , 23 , tried to set off a sophisticated explosive device strapped to his body .
FATHER OF TERROR SUSPECT REPORTED MUTALLAB TO US 6 MONTHS AGO

“ Suddenly , we hear a bang .
It sounded like a firecracker went off , ” said Jasper Schuringa , a film director who was traveling to the US to visit friends .
“ When [ it ] went off , everybody panicked …
Then someone screamed , ‘ Fire ! Fire ! ’ ”
Schuringa , sitting in seat 20J , in the right - most section of the Airbus 330 , looked to his left .
“ I saw smoke rising from a seat … I did n’t hesitate .
I just jumped , ” he said .
Schuringa dove over four passengers to reach Abdul Mutallab ’s seat .
The suspect had a blanket on his lap .
“ It was smoking and there were flames coming from beneath his legs . ”
“ I searched on his body parts and he had his pants open .
He had something strapped to his legs . ”
The unassuming hero ripped the flaming , molten object — which resembled a small , white shampoo bottle — off Abdul Mutallab ’s left leg , near his crotch .
He said he put out the fire with his bare hands .
Schuringa yelled for water , and members of the flight crew soon appeared with fire extinguishers .
Then , he said , he hauled the suspect out of the seat .
“ I took him in a choke to the first class and all the people were like , ‘ What ’s going on ? ! ”
“ I do n’t feel like a hero , ” Schuringa told the Post as he recuperated with pals .
“ It was something that came completely natural … It was something where I had to do something or it was too late . ”

EXCLUSIVE : Details of Lane Kiffin Car Accident
More details have surfaced about an alleged car accident and cover - up involving former Tennessee head coach
Kiffin was partying with some co-eds on the evening of September 8th , when he and several of the girls left a local sports bar in a vehicle provided by Lexus of Knoxville .
Kiffen was driving under the influence when he crashed the car into a tree , just outside his West Knoxville lakefront home in the Victoria 's Inlet subdivision .
Contrary to widely circulated rumors , Kiffin was not picked up by a neighbor , but walked the mile or so to his home on Tooles Bend Road .
A tow company was called , and the extensively damaged vehicle was returned to the dealership .
A headlight and the front bumper were ripped from the car , and the front quarter panel was smashed in .
There have been rumors that the damages were never paid for , however , when Kiffin reported the accident to Athletic Director Mike Hamilton -- claiming he was alone , he was ordered to pay for the damages out of his own pocket .
Kiffin frequently fraternized with co-eds , often at the same local sports bar that was opened after hours for the coach and several boosters .
The partying would frequently move to a downtown apartment provided by boosters .
The photo above of Kiffin chatting up a co-ed with Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin was taken at Hanna 's in downtown Knoxville on the evening of April 3 .
Several other photos were taken of Kiffin dancing with the unidentified blonde woman , however , when his crew realized what was going on , they snatched the camera and deleted the pictures ... missing this one .
That same night , a picture was taken of Kiffin , Tomlin and Kiffin 's brother - in - law David Reaves at a party that allegedly took place at the apartment .
( See photo )
UPDATE : Lexus of Knoxville confirms Kiffin car crash
CORRECTION : The accident occurred on August 12 , 2009 .
Almost three decades ago , Richard Feynman — known popularly as much for his bongo drumming and pranks as for his brilliant insights into physics — told an electrified audience at MIT how to build a computer so powerful that its simulations “ will do exactly the same as nature . ”
Not approximately , as digital computers tend to do when facing complex physical problems that must be addressed via mathematical shortcuts — such as forecasting orbits of many moons whose gravities constantly readjust their trajectories .
Computer models of climate and other processes come close to nature but hardly imitate it .
Feynman meant exactly , as in down to the last jot .
Now , finally , groups at Harvard and the University of Queensland in Brisbane , Australia , have designed and built a computer that hews closely to these specs .
It is a quantum computer , as Feynman forecast .
And it is the first quantum computer to simulate and calculate the behavior of a molecular , quantum system .
Much has been written about how such computers would be paragons of calculating power should anybody learn to build one that is much more than a toy .
And this latest one is at the toy stage , too .
But it is just the thing for solving some of the most vexing problems in science , the ones that Feynman had in mind when he said “ nature ” — those problems involving quantum mechanics itself , the system of physical laws governing the atomic scale .
Inherent to quantum mechanics are seeming paradoxes that blur the distinctions between particles and waves , portray all events as matters of probability rather than deterministic destiny , and under which a given particle can exist in a state of ambiguity that makes it potentially two or more things , or in two or more places , at once .
Reporting online January 10 in Nature Chemistry , the Harvard group , led by chemist Alán Aspuru - Guzik , developed the conceptual algorithm and schematic that defined the computer ’s architecture .
Aspuru - Guzik has been working on such things for years but did n’t have the hardware to test his ideas .
At the University of Queensland , physicist Andrew G. White and his team , who have been working on such sophisticated gadgets , said they thought they could make one to the Harvard specs and , after some collaboration , did so .
In principle the computer could have been rather small , “ about the size of a fingernail , ” White says .
But his group spread its components across a square meter of lab space to make it easier to adjust and program .
Within its filters and polarizers and beam splitters , just two photons at a time traveled simultaneously , their particle - like yet wavelike natures playing peek - a- boo in clouds of probability just as quantum mechanics says they should .
Quantum computing ’s power stems from the curiosity that a qubit — a bit of quantum information — is not limited to holding a single discrete binary number , 1 or 0 , as is the bit of standard computing .
Qubits exist in a limbo of uncertainty , simultaneously 1 and 0 .
Until the computation is done and a detector measures the value , that very ambiguity allows greater speed and flexibility as a quantum computer searches multiple permutations at once for a final result .
Plus , not only do the photons have this mix of quantum identities , a state formally called superposition , they are also entangled .
Entanglement is another feature of quantum mechanics in which the properties of two or more superposed particles are correlated with one another .
It is the superposition of superpositions , in which the state of one is connected to the state of the other despite the particles ’ separation in distance .
Entanglement further increases the ability of a quantum computer to explore simultaneously all possible solutions to a complex problem .
But with just two photons as its qubits , the new quantum computer could not tackle quantum behavior involving more than two objects .
So , the researchers asked it to calculate the energy levels of the hydrogen molecule , the simplest one known .
Other methods have long revealed the answer , providing a check on the accuracy of doing it with qubits .
Corresponding to the two wavelike photons rattling fuzzily along in the computer , the hydrogen molecule has two wavelike electrons chemically binding its two nuclei — each a single proton .
Led by first author to the paper Benjamin Lanyon , who is now at the University of Innsbruck in Austria , the Queensland team programmed the equations that govern how electrons behave near protons into the machine by tweaking the arrangement of filters , wavelength shifters and other optical components in the computer .
Each such piece of optical hardware corresponded to the logic gates that add , subtract , integrate and otherwise manipulate binary data in a standard computer .
The researchers then entered initial “ data ” corresponding to the distance between the molecule ’s nuclei — a driver of what energies the electrons might be able to take on when the molecule is excited by an outside influence .
The photons are each given a precise angle of polarization — the orientation of the electric and magnetic components of their fields — and for one of the photons the angle was chosen to correspond to that datum .
On the first run of a calculation , the second photon then shared this datum via its entanglement with the first and , going at the speed of light , emerged from the machine with the first digit of the answer .
In an iteration process , that digit was then used as data for another run , producing the second digit — a process followed for 20 rounds .
By following — some would say simulating — the same weird physics as do the electrons of atomic bonds themselves , the computer ’s photons got the permitted energy correct to within six parts per million .
“ Every time you add an electron or other object to a quantum problem , the complexity of the problem doubles , ” says James Whitfield , a graduate student at Harvard and second author on the paper .
“ The great thing , ” he added , “ is that every time you add a qubit to the computer , its power doubles too . ”
In formal language , the power of a quantum computer scales exponentially with its size ( as in number of qubits ) in exact step with the size of quantum problems .
In fact , says his professor , Aspuru - Guzik , a computer of “ only ” 150 qubits or so would have more computing power than all the supercomputers in the world today , combined .
Whitfield is near completion of his studies to be a theoretical chemist .
A goal is , eventually , to be able to calculate the energy levels and reaction levels of complex molecules with scores or even hundreds of electrons binding them together .
Even in problems with just four or five electrons , the challenge of computation by standard means has grown so exponentially fast that standard computers cannot handle it .
The work is “ great , a proof of principle , more evidence that this stuff is not pie in the sky or cannot be built , ” says a University of California , Berkeley chemistry professor , Birgitta Whaley .
“ It is the first time that a quantum computer has been used to calculate a molecular energy level . ”
And while most of the publicity for quantum computers has marveled at the potential power to break immense numbers into their factors — a key to breaking secret codes and thus a possibility with national security implication — “ this has major implications for practical uses with very broad application , ” Whaley says .
These uses might include the ability , without trial and error , to design complex chemical systems and advanced materials with properties never before seen .
Scaling it up to five , 10 or hundreds of qubits will not be easy .
In the end , photons as qubits are unlikely because of the difficulty of entangling and monitoring so many of them .
Electrons , simulated atoms called quantum dots , ionized atoms or other such particles may eventually form the blurry hearts of quantum computers .
How long from now ?
“ I ’d say less than 50 years , but more than 10 , ” says White .
In a striking bit of symmetry to go with using a quantum computer to solve a quantum problem , the latest work resonates with Feynman ’s original idea in another way .
At that talk at MIT — published in 1982 in the International Journal of Physics — Feynman not only suggested the basis for such a computer , he also drew a little picture of one .
It included two little blocks of the semi- transparent mineral calcite to control and measure the photons ’ polarizations .
Looking at the diagram of the device built recently by the Queensland team reveals , sure enough , two “ calcite beam displacers . ”
Whatever shade of Richard Feynman flickers still in the entanglements of the universe , and were it made to collapse into something corporeal , perhaps it would be smiling .

Research Box Title
NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope has broken the distance limit for galaxies and uncovered a primordial population of compact and ultra - blue galaxies that have never been seen before .
The deeper Hubble looks into space , the farther back in time it looks , because light takes billions of years to cross the observable universe .
This makes Hubble a powerful " time machine " that allows astronomers to see galaxies as they were 13 billion years ago , just 600 million to 800 million years after the Big Bang .
The data from Hubble 's new infrared camera , the Wide Field Camera 3 ( WFC3 ) , on the Ultra Deep Field ( taken in August 2009 ) have been analyzed by no less than five international teams of astronomers .
A total of 15 papers have been submitted to date by astronomers worldwide .
Some of these early results are being presented by various team members on Jan. 6 , 2010 , at the 215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Washington , D.C .
" With the rejuvenated Hubble and its new instruments , we are now entering unchartered territory that is ripe for new discoveries , " says Garth Illingworth of the University of California , Santa Cruz , leader of the survey team that was awarded the time to take the new WFC3 infrared data on the Hubble Ultra Deep Field ( imaged in visible light by the Advanced Camera for Surveys in 2004 ) .
" The deepest - ever near - infrared view of the universe – the HUDF09 image – has now been combined with the deepest - ever optical image – the original HUDF ( taken in 2004 ) – to push back the frontiers of the searches for the first galaxies and to explore their nature , " Illingworth says .
Rychard Bouwens of the University of California , Santa Cruz , a member of Illingworth 's team and leader of a paper on the striking properties of these galaxies , says that , " the faintest galaxies are now showing signs of linkage to their origins from the first stars .
They are so blue that they must be extremely deficient in heavy elements , thus representing a population that has nearly primordial characteristics . "
James Dunlop of the University of Edinburgh , agrees .
" These galaxies could have roots stretching into an earlier population of stars .
There must be a substantial component of galaxies beyond Hubble 's detection limit . "
Three teams worked hard to find these new galaxies and did so in a burst of papers immediately after the data were released in September , soon followed by a fourth team , and later a fifth team .
The existence of these newly found galaxies pushes back the time when galaxies began to form to before 500 - 600 million years after the Big Bang .
This is good news for astronomers building the much more powerful James Webb Space Telescope ( planned for launch in 2014 ) , which will allow astronomers to study the detailed nature of primordial galaxies and discover many more even farther away .
There should be a lot for Webb to hunt for .
The deep observations also demonstrate the progressive buildup of galaxies and provide further support for the hierarchical model of galaxy assembly where small objects accrete mass , or merge , to form bigger objects over a smooth and steady but dramatic process of collision and agglomeration .
It 's like streams merging into tributaries and then into a bay .
These galaxies are as small as 1/20th the Milky Way 's diameter , " reports Pascal Oesch of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich .
" Yet they are the very building blocks from which the great galaxies of today , like our own Milky Way , ultimately formed , " explains Marcella Carollo , also of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich .
Oesch and Carollo are members of Illingworth 's team .
These newly found objects are crucial to understanding the evolutionary link between the birth of the first stars , the formation of the first galaxies , and the sequence of evolutionary events that resulted in the assembly of our Milky Way and the other " mature " elliptical and majestic spiral galaxies in today 's universe .
The HUDF09 team also combined the new Hubble data with observations from NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope to estimate the ages and masses of these primordial galaxies .
" The masses are just 1 percent of those of the Milky Way , " explains team member Ivo Labbe of the Carnegie Institute of Washington , leader of two papers on the data from the combined NASA Great Observatories .
He further noted that " to our surprise , the results show that these galaxies at 700 million years after the Big Bang must have started forming stars hundreds of millions of years earlier , pushing back the time of the earliest star formation in the universe . "
The results are gleaned from the HUDF09 observations , which are deep enough at near - infrared wavelengths to reveal galaxies at redshifts from z=7 to beyond redshift z=8 .
( The redshift value z is a measure of the stretching of the wavelength or " reddening " of starlight due to the expansion of space . )
The clear detection of galaxies between z=7 and z =8.5 corresponds to " look - back times " of approximately 12.9 billion years to 13.1 billion years ago .
" This is about as far as we can go to do detailed science with the new HUDF09 image .
This shows just how much the James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST ) is needed to unearth the secrets of the first galaxies , " says Illingworth .
The challenge is that spectroscopy is needed to provide definitive redshift values , but the objects are too faint for spectroscopic observations ( until JWST is launched ) .
Therefore , the redshifts are inferred by the galaxies ' apparent colors through a now very well - established technique .
The teams are finding that the number of galaxies per unit of volume of space drops off smoothly with increasing distance , and the HUDF09 team has also found that the galaxies become surprisingly blue intrinsically .
The ultra - blue galaxies are extreme examples of objects that appear so blue because they may be deficient in heavier elements , and as a result , quite free of the dust that reddens light through scattering .
A longstanding problem with these findings is that it still appears that these early galaxies did not put out enough radiation to " reionize " the early universe by stripping electrons off the neutral hydrogen that cooled after the Big Bang .
This " reionization " event occurred between about 400 million and 900 million years after the Big Bang , but astronomers still do n't know which sources of light caused it to happen .
These new galaxies are being seen right in this important epoch in the evolution of the universe .
Perhaps the density of very faint galaxies below the current detection limit is so high that there may be enough of them to support reionization .
Or there was an earlier wave of galaxy formation that decayed and then was " rebooted " by a second wave of galaxy formation .
Or , possibly the early galaxies were extraordinarily efficient at reionizing the universe .
Due to these uncertainties it is not clear what type of object or evolutionary process did the " heavy lifting " by ionizing the young universe .
The calculations remain rather uncertain , and so galaxies may do more than currently expected , or astronomers may need to invoke other phenomena such as mini-quasars ( active supermassive black holes in the cores of galaxies ) – current estimates suggest however that quasars are even less likely than galaxies to be the cause of reionization .
This is an enigma that still challenges astronomers and the very best telescopes .
" As we look back into the epoch of the first galaxies in the universe , from a redshift of 6 to a redshift of 8 and possibly beyond , these new observations indicate that we are likely seeing the end of reionization , and perhaps even into the reionization era , which is the last major phase transition of the gas in the universe , " says Rogier Windhorst of Arizona State University , leader of one of the other teams that analyzed the WFC3 data .
" Though the exact interpretation of these new results remains under debate , these new WFC3 data may provide an exciting new view of how galaxy formation proceeded during and at the end of the reionization era . "
Hubble 's WFC3 / IR camera was able to make deep exposures to uncover new galaxies at roughly 40 times greater efficiency than its earlier infrared camera that was installed in 1997 .
The WFC3 / IR brought new infrared technology to Hubble and accomplished in four days of observing what would have previously taken almost half a year for Hubble to do .

Lack of circumcision :
• Is responsible for a 10 - fold higher risk of urinary tract infections in infancy .
Risk = 1 in 20 to 1 in 50 for uncircumcised infants and 1 in 200 to 1 in 500 for circumcised infants .
Higher risk of UTI at older ages as well .
Overall lifetime cumulative prevalence of UTI = 1 in 3 for uncircumcised males compared with 1 in 12 for circumcised males , respectively .
• Confers a higher risk of death in the first year of life ( from complications of urinary tract infections : namely kidney failure , meningitis and infection of bone marrow ) .
• One in ~400900 uncircumcised men will get cancer of the penis , which occurs more than 20 times more commonly in uncircumcised men .
A quarter of these will die from it and the rest will require complete or partial penile amputation as a result .
( In contrast , invasive penile cancer never occurs or is extraordinarily rare in men circumcised at birth . )
( Data from studies in the USA , Denmark and Australia , which are not to be confused with the often quoted , but misleading , annual incidence figure of 1 in 100,000 ) .
• Higher risk of prostate cancer ( 50100 % higher in uncircumcised men )
• Is associated with 3 - fold higher risk of inflammation and infection of the skin of the penis .
This includes balanitis ( inflammation of the glans ) , posthitis ( inflammation of the foreskin ) , balanoposthitis ( inflammation of glans and foreskin ) , phimosis ( inability to retract the foreskin ) and paraphimosis ( constriction of the penis by a tight foreskin that will not return after retraction ) .
Up to 18 % of uncircumcised boys will develop one of these by 8 years of age , whereas all are unknown or much rarer in the circumcised .
Risk of balanoposthitis = 1 in 6 . Obstruction to urine flow = 1 in 1050 .
Risk of these is even higher in diabetic men .
• Means increased risk of problems that may necessitate 1 in 10 older children and men requiring circumcision later in life , when the cost is 10 times higher , the procedure is less convenient , and the cosmetic result can be not as good , as stitches or tissue glue are required , as compared with circumcisions done in infancy .
• Increases by 24 fold the risk of thrush and sexually transmitted infections such as human papillomavirus ( HPV ) , genital herpes ( HSV - 2 ) , syphilis , chancroid , Trichomonas vaginalis mycoplasma and thrush .
• Is the biggest risk factor for heterosexually - acquired AIDS virus infection in men.
2 to 8 - times higher risk by itself , and even higher when lesions from STIs are added in .
Risk per exposure = 1 in 300 .
• In the female partners of uncircumcised men lack of male circumcision is associated with an up to 5 fold higher incidence of cervical cancer ( caused by sexually transmitted HPV ) , genital herpes , Trichomonas vaginalis , bacterial vaginosis ( formerly called “ Gardnerella ” ) , and possibly Chlamydia ( which is a cause of pelvic inflammatory disease , infertility from blockage of fallopian tubes , and ectopic pregnancy ) .
Getting circumcised will result in :
• Having to go through a very minor surgical procedure that carries with it small risks .
• Improved hygiene .
• Much lower risk of urinary tract infections .
• Much lower chance of acquiring HIV , the AIDS virus , heterosexually .
• Virtually complete elimination of the risk of invasive penile cancer .
• Slightly lower risk of prostate cancer .
• More favourable hygiene for the man ’s sexual partner .
• Much lower risk of cervical cancer and Chlamydia ( and thus infertility and other problems ) in the female sexual partner , as well as lower risk to her of various other STIs , greater partner sexual pleasure , penile attractiveness and hygiene .
• More favorable sexual function and experience , with no reduction in sensation during arousal or in the sensitivity of the flaccid penis .
• A penis that is regarded by most men and women as being more attractive .

The Teachability of Mathematical Thinking .
" It is always difficult to think and reason
in a new language , and this difficulty
discouraged all but men of energetic minds . "
Charles Babbage
Whenever a next area of human endeavour is observed to be amenable to mathematical treatment , mathematics changes as a result of that discovery .
Having observed from close quarters how programming could be developed from a craft ( if not a black art ! ) into a mathematical discipline , I could n’t help wondering what impact this development might have on the rest of mathematics .
And the more I thought about it , the more I became convinced that the influence of computing science on mathematics at large may become very profound indeed .
On the whole spectrum that ranges from the crafts to the sciences , mathematics — though justly called " The Queen of Sciences " — occupies , amazingly enough , a middle position .
At the one end of the spectrum we have the crafts , implicitly transmitted from one generation to the next in the relation between master and apprentice : it is almost a transmission by osmosis .
Guild members typically keep their common craft as a well - guarded secret among themselves .
At the other end of the spectrum we have the sciences , explicitly transmitted from one generation to the next in the relation between teacher and student .
It is the tradition of the University to try to formulate knowledge as explicitly as possible , thereby bringing its treasures into the public domain .
Along this scale , however , mathematics today occupies a curious , in - between position .
Mathematical results — i.e. theorems , proofs , and theories — are taught and published quite openly ; how to do mathematics , however , is something that the members of the guild keep among themselves .
And it is exactly here that computing science might have its greatest impact on mathematics as a whole : mathematics might move at last from its middle position to where it belongs , i.e. to the scientific end of the spectrum .
Predictions are hazardous — in particular , when they concern the future — and , therefore , I shall abstain from them .
But I shall give you some of my observations on account of which I regard such a change of mathematics as a very real possibility .
I first established that , to a large extent , professors of mathematics regard themselves as craftsmen .
I did so by subjecting them to the following thought experiment .
I asked them : " Suppose that we knew how to give a solid two - semester course in Thinking , would you be in favour of including it in the first year of the mathematics curriculum ? "
One would expect that such a simple question could be answered quickly by a simple " Yes " or " No " .
Instead , they all started to argue — some of them even vehemently — that such a course in Thinking was " of course " impossible !
( " Thinking is unteachable , for , if it were , we would already have discovered how to do it . " , and " Mathematicians are not made , but born . " , and similar crap . )
Whenever a craft is in the process of being superseded by a scientific discipline , the guild members always feel themselves threatened ( and rightly so ) .
The height of the emotional barrier that I had to overcome before my colleagues were willing to consider my question was a full confirmation that I was dealing with craftsmen .
The above experiment was prompted by another observation , which explains how computing science enters the picture .
In the process of improvement of our programming ability the predicate calculus had become an indispensable tool for our daily reasoning ; almost unnoticed , we became as familiar with it as the circumstances required .
It was somewhat of a surprise to discover that , though known to all mathematicians , the predicate calculus is hardly used in most other areas of mathematics .
( When trying to explain what we were doing to others , we often found their unfamiliarity with the predicate calculus a stumbling block . )
From the fact that , in contrast to the computing scientists , the other mathematicians can get away without using that effective tool for formal reasoning I can draw only one conclusion : in some way or another , the intellectual challenge that the computing scientist faces is without precedent in our mathematical culture .
The computing scientist has to learn how to cope with vast , subtly intertwined , discrete universes , which , indeed , provide a totally new environment for mathematical thought .
The environment seems so new and in a peculiar way so demanding that it evokes novel thinking habits and novel modes of exposition , both of which are more effective than the traditional ones .
It should be noted that they are more effective in a very objective sense , that is , in a sense as objective as in which we can state that decimal arithmetic is much simpler than computing in Roman numerals .
There is another circumstance why for mathematics the time to evolve from craft to science may have come , and why the doing of mathematics — i.e. thinking effectively — may become teachable , and that is our new appreciation of notational techniques .
Mathematicians have always been aware of the vital importance of adequate notation ; some of them — notably Leibniz and Babbage ( not to mention Oughtred ) — have even paid great attention to the issue .
But the vast majority of them does not make a conscious effort to distinguish between " convenient " ( in an objective sense , i.e. independent of our personal habits as formed in our educational pasts ) and " conventional " , and continues to prefer " what they are used to " , even if their formulae are ambiguous !
They have never given very conscious thought to the topic and , when challenged , shrug their shoulders , saying : " Well , you understand what I mean , do n’t you ? " .
( As long as personal habits and resulting tastes still play such a predominant rôle in the appreciation of notational alternatives , it is not amazing that international efforts at the standardization of mathematical notations remain strikingly unsuccessful . )
As long as mathematicians continue to work with a fuzzy aggregate of notational conventions , never explicitly stated and often mutually conflicting , no wonder that they regard the doing of mathematics as unteachable .
They may shrug their shoulders and say : " Well , you understand what I mean , do n’t you ? " , but then two comments are in order .
Firstly , such a lack of system is bound to be a noticeable barrier for the novice .
Secondly , a sizeable part of the competence of the professional mathematician may well consist in the ability not to get confused by his own funny habits .
The scene has changed dramatically , however , with the introduction of recursive formal grammars and their wholesale adoption in computing science since 1960 .
This was the year of the ALGOL Report which used BNF ( " Backus - Naur Form " ) for the rigorous definition of the syntax of formal texts .
( Among computing scientists , this technique is now so much common knowledge that they find themselves shocked — and almost unable to continue reading — when , for instance , they read a text written by a contemporary logician that still tries to do without it . )
The extremely rapid propagation and wide - spread acceptance and usage of what was generally regarded — if not frowned upon ! — in 1960 as a daring novelty is a most remarkable phenomenon ; I think it would be stupid to underestimate its significance .
The notationally unaware often express the expectation that adherence to stricter notational conventions would not influence their thinking abilities .
They speak from lack of experience , and they are wrong .
The habit of only writing formulae that satisfy the rules of a rigorously defined syntax gives the mathematician a new appreciation of one of his main tools , and enables him to exploit this tool more consciously and , hence , more effectively .
It gives you a means for identifying your more clumsy thinking habits ; obviously such an identification is a prerequisite for the effort to supplant them by — now : objectively ! — more effective ones .
How profound the influence of our notations is on our thinking I learned the other day — the 4th of March 1980 , to be precise — when I took an experiment with my students .
Departing from the official topic of the course I presented to them the solution of a combinatorial problem .
They all mastered the little mathematics needed , and that was essential because neither the problem , nor the solution , but my presentation of the latter was the real subject of the experiment .
I showed them my cleanest presentation of the solution , carefully divested of all asymmetries that are only — be it traditional — notational artefacts .
( The problem was a very good carrier for the experiment , because those asymmetries , already suggested by the way in which the problem had been stated , are the main cause of the problem ’s " difficulty " . )
It was almost painful to see my students — whose training is otherwise traditional — struggle with my proof .
When I wrote down assertions of the form A ∨ B , the poor boys could only understand them by translating them into either ¬
A ⇒ B or ¬ B ⇒ A — and , of course , never knowing how to make the irrelevant choice — .
After I had carefully removed all misleading irrelevancies from my presentation , they could only cope with it by reintroducing them again !
The experiment was somewhat shattering for me , because I felt that I was addressing 25 victims of mathematical miseducation .
( I did not blame them : what can one expect from youngsters that have been taught to express so fundamental a concept as equality by the contorted " if and only if " as soon as the domain consists of truth - values ?
Needless to say , you wo n’t catch me using the symbol " ⇔ " ! )
I called the experiment shattering ; I did not call it depressing .
On the contrary , it was inspiring !
It convinced me that we are much nearer than I thought to being able to teach how to think : really educating young mathematicians to apply the techniques of scientific thought seems , as a possibility , excitingly close !
As far as the guinea - pigs are concerned , I am happy to report that , though puzzled , bewildered , or disturbed , they all made the impression of being thrilled ( though perhaps not fully understanding why ) .
None of them took the cheap exit of feeling offended .
Plans for the Robot Land theme park in Masan , on South Korea 's South East Coast , have been gaining momentum since we first took note way back in 2007 .
According to Plastic Pals , a group of private investors recently met with the city council ( probably Masan 's city council , as Robot Land 's city council has yet to be built ) to hash out details , with the result of the government ponying up some $ 229 million of a promised $ 600 million .
But not everyone is happy about all this -- indeed , organizers of Incheon City 's robot theme park are unamused by the thought of a similar attraction competing for those hard - earned tourist dollars .
Of course , there 's one way to settle any potential conflict that Engadget wholeheartedly supports :
Robot theme park fight !

Advertisement Iran has begun five days of large - scale war games to simulate attacks on its nuclear sites , officials said , warning it will retaliate if provoked .
The head of Iran 's air defence said the aim of the exercises was to thwart aerial reconnaissance and air attacks .
Another official warned Tehran would retaliate with a missile strike on Tel Aviv , if it was attacked by Israel .
Iran is under intense pressure over its nuclear programme , which critics say is intended to produce nuclear weapons .
The US and Israel have not ruled out the prospect of a military attack to prevent Iran developing nuclear bombs .
Tehran insists its programme is peaceful .
Annihilation warning
The head of Iran 's air defence , Brig Gen Ahmad Mighani , told state media the aim of the war games , which will cover an area of 600,000 sq km ( 230,000 sq miles ) , was " to display Iran 's combat readiness and military potentials .
IRAN'S NUCLEAR SITES
Iran insists that all its nuclear facilities are for energy , not military purposes Bushehr : Nuclear power plant Isfahan : Uranium conversion plant Natanz : Uranium enrichment plant , 4,592 working centrifuges , with 3,716 more installed Second enrichment plant : Existence revealed to IAEA in Sept 2009 .
Separate reports say it is near Qom , and not yet operational Arak : Heavy water plant
Key nuclear sites in detail A high - stakes game Q&A : Iran and the nuclear issue " Due to the threats against our nuclear facilities it is our duty to defend our nation 's vital facilities , " he said .
Meanwhile , Mojhtaba Zolnoor , an aide to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , warned Iran would respond to any Israeli attack .
" If the enemy attacks Iran , our missiles will strike Tel Aviv , " he was quoted as saying by the official Irna news agency .
The commander of the elite Revolutionary Guards ' air force wing said Iran 's air defence forces would " annihilate " Israeli warplanes if they attacked .
" Their [ Israeli ] F - 15 and F - 16 fighters will be trapped by our air defence forces and will be annihilated , " Amir Ali Hajizadeh told Iran 's Fars news agency .
" Even if their planes escape and land at the bases from which they took off , their bases will be struck by our destructive surface - to - surface missiles . "
Deal in doubt
The exercises come as the UN Security Council 's permanent members - Britain , China , France , Russia and the United States - plus Germany , urge Tehran to reconsider its rejection of a proposal that would see some of its nuclear material being enriched outside Iran and returned as fuel rods .
The deal - brokered by the UN 's nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency - envisages Iran sending about 70 % of its low - enriched uranium to Russia and France , where it would be processed into fuel rods for a research reactor in Tehran .
Such a process would prevent Iran enriching uranium to the degree necessary to make a bomb , the UN says .
But Iran has rejected a key part of the deal , seeking further guarantees .
The UN Security Council has called on Iran to stop uranium enrichment and has approved three rounds of sanctions - covering trade in nuclear material , as well as financial and travel restrictions .

Blackwater Settles Massacre Lawsuit , Pays Families of Dead Iraqis $ 100,000 Each
Two sources with inside knowledge of Blackwater 's settlement with Iraqi victims of a string of shootings , including the Nisour Square massacre , has confirmed to me that Blackwater is paying $ 100,000 for each of the Iraqis killed by its forces and between $ 20 - 30,000 to each Iraqi wounded .
One source said it was " an absolute bargain " for Blackwater .
Based on the number of dead and injured named in the civil lawsuits , the total amount paid by Blackwater is likely in the range of $ 5 million .
Blackwater has made more than $ 1.5 billion in " security " contracts in Iraq alone since 2003 .

Binman forced out by council ' for picking up too much rubbish '
Ousted : Albert Stewart has been moved to another round eight miles away
All Albert Stewart wanted to do was help householders keep their streets looking clean and clear of clutter .
But the binman has been removed from the round he has worked for 33 years – for picking up too much rubbish .
The 60 - year - old took away extra bin bags left beside overflowing wheelie bins , which council bosses say is against strict refuse rules .
Householders caught leaving rubbish outside wheelie bins can be fined up to £ 1,000 .
He was issued with a written warning by officers from West Lancashire Borough Council and moved from his route in Aughton to another one eight miles away .
Mr Stewart , a married grandfather - of - six from Ormskirk , Lancashire , accused the council of ‘ spying ’ on its own binmen and said bosses were motivated by money .
‘ I ’m really annoyed and upset about this , ’ he said .
‘ I ’ve been on the same round for 33 years – I ’ve seen babies born , go to school , grow up and have babies themselves .
‘ They were n’t just people I took rubbish from – they were my friends too .
I ’ve had lots of people coming up to me saying they miss me . ’
Dylan Sharpe , campaign director of Big Brother Watch , said : ‘ This case is a sad indictment of Britain .
' A man who has helped foster a nicer environment in his area is punished because the council has enforced pointless , pathetic rules designed to hit the law - abiding citizen in the pocket . ’
A spokesman for West Lancashire Borough Council said residents were asked not to put out black bags next to their wheelie bins because it attracted vermin .
Binmen were instructed not to take the bags away because it encouraged residents to break the rules .
Tylenol recall : FDA slams company
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The maker of several over - the - counter drugs , including Tylenol , Motrin and Benadryl , announced a broad - based recall of these and other drugs Friday after receiving complaints of an " unusual moldy , musty or mildew - like " odor .
The recall drew the FDA 's wrath on Johnson and Johnson ( JNJ , Fortune 500 ) for not reacting quickly to customer complaints and its failure to fix the problem .
The company has struggled to resolve the issue since it was first reported in 2008 .
" When something smells bad , literally and figuratively , you aggressively investigate and solve the problem , " said Deborah Autor , director of FDA 's compliance office .
" The company should have acted faster , " Autor said .
" All companies have a responsibility to ensure high quality , safety and effectiveness of their products and protect consumers . "
McNeil - PPC , the Johnson and Johnson division that manufactured the recalled products , said it received a " small " number of complaints of " non-serious " stomach problems , including nausea , stomach pain , vomiting or diarrhea .
However , it did not say when the complaints were received or how many .
The recalled products include junior strength Motrin , children 's Tylenol grape meltaway tablets , extra strength Tylenol , extra strength Tylenol rapid release gelcaps , extra strength Tylenol PM geltabs , Motrin caplets , extra strength Rolaids fresh mint tablets , St. Joseph Aspirin chewable orange tablets and Benedryl allergy ultratab tablets .
These products are widely sold through a number of retail stores , including large chain drug stores , independent pharmacies and supermarkets .
Autor said the FDA has issued a warning letter to McNeil , saying the company has 15 days to report back on its efforts to address the problem and prevent future violations .
In a letter , the agency said it is " concerned " about Johnson & Johnson 's response to the matter .
A warning letter from the FDA is a very serious thing , explained Ira Loss , senior health policy analyst with consulting firm Washington Analysis .
" A warning letter indicates that this is the last time that the company will get a heads - up from the agency , " said Loss .
" If things do n't get fixed , then there are other ways for the agency to make its point . "
The agency warned Johnson & Johnson that " failure to correct these violations may result in legal action , including seizure and injunction . "
Further , the agency warned that it may " withhold approval of requests for export certificates or approval of pending new drug applications " that list one of the company 's facilities as a manufacturer until the violations are resolved .
Loss said he would not be surprised if the FDA is setting out to make an example of McNeil to other companies .
Said Loss , " The FDA 's been criticized for not being aggressive enough in the past .
The goal ultimately is to make the industry police itself so that we do n't end up with situations like this . "
On Friday , the FDA said McNeil informed the agency that it had received 70 complaints and expanded its recall of over - the - counter drugs .
The company said the smell was caused by a chemical called " 2,4,6 - tribromoanisole ( TBA ) , " which is applied to wooden pallets that are used to transport and store packaging materials .
McNeil said a small number of the recalled drugs were found to contain small traces of TBA , but did not provide details about whether it changed the chemical composition of the drugs .
The FDA said the pallets were traced to a plant in Puerto Rico , and the agency is looking into whether any other drugmakers also used pallets from this plant to transport their products .
History of problems fixing a funky odor
The agency said McNeil first received complaints of an odor in its products in early 2008 , but the company did not " identify it as an issue " until September of that year .
" McNeil did not report the issue to us until a year later , " Karen Hirshfield , acting branch chief of the FDA 's Recalls and Shortages Branch , told reporters .
In November 2009 , McNeil recalled five lots of its Tylenol Arthritis Pain 100 count with the EZ - open cap product due to reports of an unusual moldy , musty , or mildew - like odor that led to some cases of nausea , stomach pain , vomiting and diarrhea .
On Dec. 18 , 2009 , McNeil expanded that recall to include all available product lots of Tylenol Arthritis Pain caplet 100 count bottles with the red EZ - open cap .
A spokeswoman for McNeil said about 500 " lots " of the products are included in the latest recall , which covers the Americas , the United Arab Emirates and Fiji .
However , the company did not specify the total number of individual units of each drug affected by the recall .
McNeil said consumers who purchased from the lots included in its recall should stop using the product and contact McNeil Consumer Health care for a refund or replacement .
Lot numbers can be found on the side of the bottle .
Consumers can call 1-888-222-6036 or log on to www.mcneilproductrecall.com.
The company said consumers with medical concerns should contact their health care provider .

Chicago court told the US president will not be able to serve on jury as he prepares for Wednesday 's state of the union address
Here 's an easy excuse for getting out of an inconvenient spot of jury duty : a meeting with the president of the Kurdistan region in Iraq .
It may not work for everyone – but it works for Barack Obama .
Late last year a summons for Barack Hussain Obama of 5046 South Greenwood Avenue , Chicago , arrived , instructing him to report for jury service at Cook County 's Bridgeview courthouse .
Obama now spends more time at his work address , 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue , Washington DC – better known as the White House – and sent word that he was otherwise engaged running the country .
Obama of course has a busy time , with his first State of the Union address on Wednesday , in which he hopes to turn around his sagging political fortunes .
But otherwise the week seems pretty clear .
Today he was meeting the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team .
And President Massoud Barzani of the Kurdistan regional government was dropping by later in the afternoon .
In many respects Obama would have made an excellent juror , with his degree from Harvard Law School and his years teaching law at the University of Chicago .
But the other jurors may have been intimidated by his presence , not to mention his ability to grant a presidential pardon if he did not like the verdict .
Yet when Chicago 's most famous resident , Oprah Winfrey , was called to serve in 2004 , she turned up and helped convict a 27 - year - old man on a charge of first - degree murder .
Like Obama , Oprah had an empire to run but that did not deter her from earning $ 17 a day for the three days she spent in court .
Obama is not the first US president to be picked for jury service .
In 2005 George Bush was called to serve in Texas , near his ranch in Crawford .
But he also skipped the chance to deliver justice .
The same month Bush 's presidential opponent , John Kerry , was also summoned .
Unlike Bush , Kerry reported for duty and was even elected foreman by his jury peers .
NBC says no deal has been made with Jay Leno regarding a new contract for an hour - long Tonight Show at 11:35 , reports USA TODAY 's Gary Levin .
( TMZ reported earlier today that a new contract had been negotiated . )
Of course , it would n't be a huge surprise if this happened .
Back in November , Leno told Broadcasting & Cable , " sure , " he'd take the 11:35 job back if it was what NBC wanted him to do .
As for a People.com report saying that Jan. 22 is " likely " Conan O'Brien 's last day , NBC had no comment .
O'Brien had months ago planned for the show to be on hiatus the week of Jan. 25 , so he will be off then .
As for whether he 'll come back and do two more weeks is unclear .
O'Brien 's personal publicist , Leslee Dart , tells TVGuide.com : " I know there 's a rumor out there that next Friday is his last show , but we do not know that to be true .
He is just moving ahead , day - to - day , doing the show , per his contract — still working . "
Dart said she did not have any update on O'Brien 's plans or negotiations , but said there are " certainly conversations going on between his people and NBC . "
She added he plans to keep hosting The Tonight show " until somebody tells him not to . "
The end of 2009 in Poland was marked with the beginning of a public discussion of on - line privacy , the government 's potential attempts to restrict access to websites and a growing awareness of TOR software supporting on - line anonymity .
On Nov. 6 , Piotr Waglawski [ PL ] , aka VaGla ( recipient of the Internet Citizen of the Year [ PL ] award in 2001 , the first person to be awarded for commitment to development of local Internet and its role in communication between citizens and the authorities ) , posted an article [ PL ] on his portal dedicated to law and Internet , mentioning Polish government 's work on telecommunications law that included an article giving Internet providers the right to block websites with dangerous content ( e.g. , gambling – hence some refer to it as the ‘ gambling law ’ ) and giving the police , special services as well as the government an ability to create black lists of websites .
Michal Trojnara , commenting on the post the very same day adds [ PL ] to the original thread :
Just a minute ago I saw a live press conference with the prime minister on TV , who stated that there are “ technical possibilities ” to stop illegal gambling on international servers .
I understand we are following countries experienced in on - line censorship [ link to Wikipedia article in Polish on Chinese Golden Shield Project ] .
On Nov. 19 , Gazeta.pl , a Polish daily , posted an article [ PL ] in which a connection was drawn between TOR software 's ability to provide web users with anonymity , paedophile activities on - line and helplessness of the police in tracking those criminal offenses .
Comments to it appeared under a post on TechnoNews.pl , reacting to the accusations .
Gość 4 states [ PL ] :
Is the cost of our privacy too high ?
I think that tools like TOR should be publicly available .
Massad points out [ PL ] :
First we will add filters you are mentioning , and then we can add any other filters , so , for instance , a human rights activist from China will not be able to inform the West about what 's going on there .
Also on Nov. 19 , Radio TOK conducted an interview with Piotr Waglawski , which was later published on Vimeo [ PL ] .
It features Piotr and another specialist , Krzysztof Młynarski , explaining what TOR is and discussing inconsistencies of the argument used by the police that allowing anonymity on the web causes increase in paedophile crimes , and thus the police find it impossible to solve those .
In response to this video posted also on Wykop [ a Polish version of Digg ] , Glosnik mentions [ PL ] :
It 's amazing how the topic of TOR started to appear in various media starting with this digg : http://www.wykop.pl/link/253302/czy-wiesz-ze-internet-ma-podwojne-dno-efekt-wczorajszych-poszukiwan
Wykop itself exposed TOR to people , and now it is accused of paedophilia .
Wykop became a venue where the public decided to express their protest [ PL ] against the accusations and propositions to restrict access to Internet .
Silencer starts it , saying [ PL ] :
Let 's show our power to fight stupidity of the authorities .
Let 's initiate connecting knots !
Baniol explains [ PL ] why he joins the protest :
I am 17 , so I myself could be a victim of a paedophile :(
I am joining this action not to help people connect but because I do not like the way of fighting paedophilia by targeting innocent people …
wm84 does not agree [ PL ] though :
I DO NOT WISH that a bunch of anonymous teenagers claim themselves to be the Internet community .
Mainly because for most of them Internet started when Wykop , demotivating sites and other services appeared – they serve nothing else than wasting of time .
I will not support – even in theory – harm of any child .
On Dec. 15 , another leading voice in this case , a specialist in on - line security , Paweł Wilk ( who , back in May 2009 , posted about the TOR project [ PL ] and has been its advocate since then ) , posted an article [ PL ] updating on the government 's propositions dated from Nov. 13 to introduce the law allowing Internet providers gather personal data of web users ( like , for instance , name and surname , ID number , address ) , creation of the so - called Registry of Banned Websites and Services .
He also mentions laws which this proposal would break and human rights that the Polish citizens would be deprived of .
A governmental press release [ PL ] from Dec. 17 confirmed that the Registry of Banned Websites and Services would indeed be created , but that the police would not receive personal data from Internet providers .
Help ‘s first reaction [ PL ] to this statement is :
Is there an organisation similar to EFF in Poland which deals with following of those cases ?
If not maybe it 's time for one , otherwise they will make us look like fools and introduce an Orwellian vision .
Simianus home opposes [ PL ] it :
You behave like real criminals !
Do you have something to hide ?
Everything is known about everyone because they have accounts on NK [ Nasza - Klasa ] and Śledzik and they describe there on - line everything they do , in their family and private life .
Later on , on Dec. 18 , Pawel Wilk posted an insightful article [ PL ] focused more on the role of TOR software in general , including an interview with TOR 's executive director , Andrew Lewman .
Pawel Waglawski also commented on it in a post [ PL ] , pointing out the lack of governmental transparency .
Gime agrees [ PL ] as to the process :
It is chaotic indeed , the idea behind it is unclear , the speed of work is surprisingly fast , a large amount of mistakes and ignorance on the way .
Arnold Buzdygan adds [ PL ] :
In a normal , democratic country similar ideas would not even enter the mind of the authorities .
On Dec. 22 , the Observatory of Media Freedom in Poland posted the opinion of Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights [ PL ] on the topic :
U.S. - China relations topped a list released by consulting firm Eurasia Group of the top 10 risks facing the world in 2010 .
The company said that the summit between U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese President Hu Jintao last November will be remembered as the peak of relations between the two countries , suggesting that the two countries ' good ties will deteriorate in 2010 .
The report said that the bone of contention is China 's global leadership .
The U.S. is looking for a greater Chinese role on the international stage , which matches the country 's rapid economic growth .
But China is avoiding taking responsibilities in international affairs .
The second risk is Iran , which has been suffering from political instability since the presidential election in June last year .
Eurasia Group said Iran has also lost its influence over neighboring countries in the region .
" Globally , Iran faces a considerably tougher sanctions regime over its nuclear program , " it said .
" A Western push for negotiations will continue , but divisive local politics and insufficient leadership coordination make it very unlikely that Iran 's leadership could reach a negotiated settlement even if it wanted one . "
The third risk is the fiscal divergence between " mature " and " emerging " markets in Europe , according to the firm .
The fourth is the U.S. government 's possible adoption of populist policies as mid-term elections approach .
A possibility that Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama may step down e arly rounds off the top five .
Other risks are the failure to seal a global treaty on climate change in Copenhagen , Brazil 's economic and political uncertainties , conflict between India and Pakistan , elections and unemployment in Eastern European countries , and Turkey 's unstable political situation as it moves away from Europe toward Iran and Syria .
State Senator Scott Brown , the Republican candidate for US Senate , endorsed yesterday the use of enhanced interrogation techniques - including the practice of simulated drowning known as waterboarding - in questioning terror suspects .
The point drew a quick rebuke from the campaign of his Democratic rival , Attorney General Martha Coakley , which said she supports President Obama ’s ban on waterboarding .
With the Jan. 19 special election two weeks from today , the clash over the rights and treatment of suspected terrorists moved the abbreviated campaign away from the domestic economic issues that have dominated their contest and highlighted a busy day of endorsements and pronouncements from the two major - party candidates in the race for the seat long held by the late Edward M. Kennedy .
After a press conference in Boston in which he called for a freeze on wages for federal employees , Brown , in response to a question , told reporters that Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , 23 , the Nigerian accused of trying to blow up a passenger jet en route to Detroit on Christmas Day , should be treated as an enemy combatant , taken to the US detention camp at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , interrogated “ pursuant to our rules of engagement and laws of war , ’’ and not be treated as a civilian criminal suspect .
Brown asserted that waterboarding does not constitute torture , but he did not specifically say Abdulmutallab should be subjected to waterboarding .
“ I do n’t support torture ; the United States does not support torture , ’’ Brown , a military lawyer in the Massachusetts National Guard , told reporters .
Obama banned the practice by executive order upon taking office last January .
Torture is illegal under the Geneva Conventions and waterboarding is prohibited under the US Army Field Manual , but during the George W. Bush administration the practice was used by the Central Intelligence Agency in interrogating high - level suspects , including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , the alleged mastermind of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , on the United States .
Brown has objected to the Obama administration ’s decision to use US civilian courts to try the purported operations chief of Al Qaeda and four others in connection with the attacks .
Coakley campaign spokeswoman Alex Zaroulis issued a prepared statement late yesterday saying : “ We find it interesting that Scott Brown did not speak out against the Bush administration ’’ when it “ chose to prosecute the ‘ shoe bomber , ’ Richard Reid , in civilian court here in Massachusetts . ’’
Coakley , Zaroulis said , “ believes that turned out to be a very effective and appropriate resolution to that case , as he is now serving a term of life in prison . ’’
Earlier , Coakley was endorsed by NARAL Pro-Choice America , the latest in a series of abortion rights groups to back her candidacy , and Veterans and Military Families for Progress , a nonpartisan organization that backed Obama ’s candidacy in 2008 .
Brown , meanwhile , picked up the endorsement of retired Red Sox star Curt Schilling , an independent who briefly considered running for the Senate seat , on his weei.com blog , 38 pitches .
Joseph L. Kennedy , a Libertarian running as an independent , is the third candidate in the special election .
The Brown and Coakley campaigns sparred on other fronts yesterday .
Coakley ’s campaign issued a critique of Brown ’s positions under the heading “ Scott Brown : The Wrong Choice on Women ’s Health Care . ’’
The release cited his oppositon to the national health care overhaul bills now pending before Congress , his backing of some restrictions on abortion rights , and his proposed changes to the state ’s 2006 health care law that would eliminate the mandate for health plans to cover things such as mammograms , minimum maternity stays , and screenings that can detect cervical cancer at an early stage .
In calling for a freeze on wages of federal government employees , Brown said “ it ’s not right that lesser - paid private sector workers suffering through a recession have to pay for expensive government salaries . ’’
Coakley , he said , “ is too beholden to union bosses to pursue the reforms necessary to restrain expanding federal worker compensation , ’’ noting the union endorsements she has won .
Brown ’s campaign also unveiled its second television spot , a 30 - second commercial titled “ Hey , Dad . ’’
It features a Brown voiceover while he drives in his GMC Canyon truck with nearly 200,000 miles on the odometer .
Brown states that voters around the state are expressing concern about the country ’s direction and the growth of government .
“ I love this old truck .
It ’s brought me closer to the people of this state , ’’ he says .
The spot ends with Brown driving at night into the two - car garage of his handsome Colonial - style home in Wrentham , decorated with Christmas lights and wreaths , then walking through the front door with the voice of one of his daughters saying “ Hey , Dad . ’’
His first spot , in which he compares his position on the benefits of tax cuts to that of John F. Kennedy , a Democrat , generated a lot of attention last week and much scorn from Democrats .
Coakley ’s campaign has declined to discuss its media strategy , and as of late yesterday , had not aired a general election TV ad .

Have You Heard The Word Is Google ?
Tech words are dominating the English language , according to The American Dialect Society .
They recently announced that the word “ google , ” as in , “ So I googled it and found out my cat should n’t be making those noises , ” was named the society ’s Word of the Decade .
I ’m not surprised .
As the internet audience went from enormous to ginormous this decade , Google searching became an important part of our every day lives .
However , I ’m sure the people Alta Vista are pissed off that “ Alta Vista- ing ” did n’t catch on .
Another tech word got high marks from the ADS .
“ Tweet ” was picked as their top word of 2009 .
There ’s no doubt that tweeting was a popular word last year , but it seems ironic to give a word award to Twitter .
After all , the whole point of Twitter is to get people to use less words .
Do n’t believe me ?
Google it .

In the same way organisms select for characteristics that favor the survival and well - being of its species over successive generations , so too do cultures .
With organisms , we call this process evolution and it represents a sort of accumulated wisdom .
There is no word for this process in cultures , but there is one for the result .
And that word is tradition .
For that past eight years , my team of scientists and National Geographic researchers have explored five parts of the world -- " Blue Zones " -- where people live measurably longer lives .
Compared to American averages , we found a bronze - age culture in Sardinia 's interior that produces about 10 times more male centenarians ; a remote peninsula in Costa Rica where 50 year - olds have a three - fold better chance or reaching age 90 ; a Greek island completely free of Alzheimer 's ( about 50 percent of Americans over age 90 suffer from dementia ) ; and islands in southern Japan where people suffer one - sixth the rate of heart disease .
How do they do it ?
The Danish Twin Studies established that only about 20 percent of average lifespan ( within certain biological limits ) is dictated by genes .
Lifestyle explains most of the rest of the longevity formula .
We found that all five Blue Zones possessed the same nine lifestyle characteristics .
Among them : a low - meat , plant - based diet ( all of them ate a lot of beans ) and a ritual of " downshifting " each day .
They experience the same stresses we do -- kids , health , finances -- but they managed it through daily prayer , meditation , ancestor veneration or city - wide happy hours ( like the Sardinians ) .
The secret to longevity , as I see it , has less to do with diet , or even exercise , and more to do with the environment in which a person lives : social and physical .
What do I mean by this ?
They live rewardingly inconvenient lives .
They walk to the store and to their friends ' homes and they live in houses set up with opportunities to move mindlessly .
They do their own yard work , hand - knead their own bread dough , and , in the case of Okinawa , get up and down off the floor several dozen times a day .
They live in strong families that keep them motivated to support loved ones .
Centenarians are still living near their children and feel loved and the expectation to love .
Instead of being mere recipients of care , they are contributors to the lives of their families .
They grow gardens to contribute vegetables , they continue to cook and clean .
This has a powerful two - fold effect : Children and grandchildren in these families benefit from their grandparents ' wisdom and care while the centenarians feel the motivation to stay active , to get out of bed in the morning , and live for a purpose .
They live in cities where it is easy to walk to their friends ' houses , to the store or to church .
So , we figured they get about 105 minutes of physical activity everyday -- and no health club membership !
We know from the Framingham studies that happiness , smoking and obesity are all " contagious . "
If your three best friends are obese , there 's a 70 percent better chance that you 'll be overweight .
People in the Blue Zones either proactively surround themselves with people who practice the right behaviors or are born into communities of people who do -- or people whose idea of fun is gardening , or bocce ball or swimming ; people who eat meat sparingly , who have faith , who are trusting and trust - worthy .
Why is this so important ?
No supplement , hormone , antioxidant or pill of any sort has been shown to reverse , stop or even slow aging .
The problem is two - fold : to do the study properly , you 'd need to follow two groups of people for life : one who takes the pill , the other that does n't .
Then you 'd have to control for all other factors and compare the average age of death for each group .
No such study has ever been done on a " longevity " supplement .
The second problem is adherence .
People in general just do n't stick to doing anything for very long .
Are you taking supplements ?
How long have you been taking them ?
I 'll bet not more than a few years .
Science ( and hucksters ) have offered us countless diets but research done by the University of Minnesota 's Dr. Robert W. Jeffrey has shown that fewer than 2 percent of people adhere to diets for more than two years .
For anything to really impact your life expectancy positively , you need to do it for most of your life .
Friends , unlike pills or diets , are much more likely to be much longer - term undertakings .
The secret to solving much of America 's health care crisis and battle with chronic diseases lies in emulating the environment in Blue Zones .
Is it possible ?
Last year , my partners and I made Blue Zones - inspired changes to the environment of an entire American town -- Albert Lea , Minnesota , ( see AARP Magazine article ) .
We made the town more walkable and bikeable , dug public gardens , made it easier for kids to walk to school and people to expand their face - to - face social networks to include more people motivated to change their health habits .
The results were astounding .
If the trends continue , life expectancy for the average participant would rise about three years and health care costs for city workers would decrease by 48 percent .
The wisdom of the world 's Blue Zones represents centuries or even millennia of observed human experience .
As Democrats and Republicans argue over how to solve the health care crisis , perhaps they should take a moment to consider the wisdom of their grandmothers .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dan Buettner .
Somali Islamists in Sweden Cartoonist Attacker Linked to Mogadishu Suicide Bomber
The man accused of trying to kill Danish cartoonist Kurt Westergaard and December 's Mogadishu suicide bomber were in Sweden together , according to a Swedish newspaper .
Last week we rolled out the new White House iPhone app , which you can download for free from the iTunes App Store .
It includes everything from the latest blog posts , to outstanding photos from the photo office , to White House videos – like the one below , for example , in which Press Secretary Robert Gibbs gives a slightly sillier take on our app than the initial blog post may have :
[ [ nid:8043 ] ]
As Gibbs explains in the video , the pride and joy of the app may be the fact that now you can watch White House live - streaming video wherever you happen to be .
For example , just today you can watch the President and the Vice President at a Middle Class Task Force meeting at 11:00 EST , even if you 're hunkered down hiding from the rain at a bus stop as a lot of people in DC are right now .
At 1:00 you can watch the selfsame Robert Gibbs take on the White House press corps , even if you ’re a White House reporter who decided to just stay in bed today .
And at 2:20 you can watch the President welcome last season 's NBA Champion Los Angeles Lakers , even if you 're at a hockey game because watching your team get beat by the Lakers over and over made you look for other sports to stir your passions .
Licence to chill :
Ice lolly shaped like James Bond star Daniel Craig goes on sale
For your ice only : A woman puts her lips to the incredibly lifelike Daniel Craig lolly
Many women would admit wanting to put their lips to James Bond star Daniel Craig ’s sculpted torso .
And this summer they can almost realise their dream - with ice lollies shaped like the 007 actor .
An ice cream company created the purple ‘ licence to chill ’ smoothie after asking more than 1,000 women which male celebrity they would like to see on the end of a stick .
Del Monte Superfruit Smoothies , who produced the limited edition replica lollies , said artists ‘ worked tirelessly ’ to recreate a sculpture of 41 - year - old Craig in the scene where he emerges from the sea in Casino Royale .
‘ Daniel Craig topped our poll of Britain ’s coolest celebrities and thanks to our Del Monte lolly replica he is officially immortalised as super smooth and licensed to chill , ’ said spokesman Matt O’Connor .
The Daniel Craig smoothie lollies are blueberry , pomegranate and cranberry flavoured and under 100 calories each .
They are to be distributed during the first National Ice Cream Week which starts today and ends on June 7 .
Ice spy : The Del Monte lolly was modelled on Craig in Casino Royale ( right )
The coolest smoothie poll was dominated by actors with Jude Law scooping second place and Hugh Grant taking third .
Welshmen Steve Jones and Tom Jones take fourth and fifth places , while Scottish film star Ewan McGregor comes in sixth .
Three Davids - Cameron , Beckham and Tennant take positions seven , eight and nine , while the top ten is completed by silver fox Philip Schofield .
2008 Chevrolet Cobalt SS Turbo - Click above for high - res image gallery
Proof that there are other automakers also under the scrutiny of the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration :
The Chevrolet Cobalt is under federal investigation for steering - related safety issues .
To date , the NHTSA has reported 1,132 consumer complaints about a sudden loss of power steering in 2005 - 09 Chevrolet Cobalt and 2008 - 09 Chevrolet Cobalt SS models .
While a loss of steering assist should not immediately lead to a crash , consumers have reported " difficulty controlling the vehicle , such as departing from the desired travel lane .
" The NHTSA has recorded 11 crashes and one injury attributed to the power steering failure , with potentially 905,000 vehicles affected by the investigation .
There have been no deaths reported .
" We are cooperating with the agency in the investigation , " said GM .
The automaker will replace the Cobalt with the Chevrolet Cruze for the 2011 model year .
Court forces health care foes ' ad off air
A federal court in Illinois today ordered that an ad opposing health care legislation be taken off the air and removed from the Internet after a leading medical group complained that the ad miscast its stance on the bill and misused its trademark .
The American College of Surgeons filed a complaint in Illinois ' Northern District alleging that the Employee Freedom Action Committee -- one of a host of groups run by lobbyist Rick Berman -- had violated trademark law and defamed the group by including the College of Surgeons on a scrolling list headed " Doctors Against the Plan . "
A plastic surgeons ' group also complained of the ad , which was based on a December 1 letter from surgical associations saying they opposed the bill as it was then written ; the groups now say they 're waiting to see its final form .
A Berman aide argued that the ad accurately characterized the groups ' positions .
Federal District Judge Charles Norgle granted a temporary restraining order to the surgeons , finding they would likely prevail on the merits in a trial , and enjoining Berman 's group from placing ads citing the group on television or the Internet .
The ad was run by the " Committee to Rethink Reform , " a 501 ( c ) 4 not required to disclose its donors .
The ad has been removed from the Internet .
A Berman aide did n't immediately respond to an email about the ruling .
UPDATE : Berman aide Sarah Longwell emails :
We are removing the two doctors ' groups who no longer want to be publicly associated with opposing the health care bill .
However , we will continue to promote the views of the many doctors ' groups who have encouraged us to highlight their public opposition to the current health reform proposal .
Why do so many things in this world share the same characteristics ?
People have come to realize that the matter of the world is made from a few fundamental building blocks of nature .
The word " fundamental " is key here .
By fundamental building blocks we mean objects that are simple and structureless -- not made of anything smaller .
Even in ancient times , people sought to organize the world around them into fundamental elements , such as earth , air , fire , and water .
You'd think they'd have taken advantage of the Force Flex© technology .

Light - enhancing combat rifle sights made by Trijicon for U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan carry an ID number on them like the one pictured above ( top center ) : " ACOG4X32JN8:12 " - which reads as " Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight , 4x32 , John 8:12 " , referring to a Bible verse with the last six characters .
That verse is " Then spake Jesus again unto them , saying , ' I am the light of the world : he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness , but shall have the light of life ' " .
After concerns were raised about about whether the inscriptions break a government rule that bars proselytizing by American troops , Trijicon has now announced that it will no longer imprint the verses on the sides of scopes intended for the U.S. military .

The calorie - free version fails to activate a reward area of the brain ( Image : Patrick Norman / Fancy / Plainpicture )
CONTAINS zero calories !
Countless soft drinks are emblazoned with that slogan as a come - on for those of us locked in a never - ending battle to rein in a spreading waistline .
Calorie - free sweeteners certainly have a lot to offer .
Food and drink manufacturers have become so good at blending sugar substitutes into their products that it can be almost impossible to tell them apart from the real thing – sucrose – in taste tests .
But while artificial sweeteners may be able to confuse our taste buds , the suspicion is growing that our brain is not so easily fooled .
Could it be that our cravings for sugary foods run deeper than a liking for sweetness ?
If so , a whole bunch of weight - loss strategies may need rethinking .
Non-sugar sweeteners have come a long way .
One of the first , and perhaps the worst , was lead .
Romans boiled grapes in lead pots , leaching the sweet - tasting metal into their food .
The practice outlived the Roman empire by many centuries , and is thought to have led to the deaths of a number of notables , including Pope Clement II , who perished in 1047 .
Indigenous peoples in South America use a herb called stevia , which contains chemicals that taste sweet but are n’t metabolised in the human gut .
These early experimenters were n’t worried about shedding the kilos – just searching for a way to sweeten food in a world where refined sugar was scarce .
Saccharin , the first of the industrially manufactured artificial sweeteners , was discovered late in the 19th century and soon became popular .

# 923 – Missing
Posted on December 24 , 2009 at 12:00 am by Chris
I had 2 bicycles stolen when I was a kid .
My parents were nice enough to purchase them for me , along with a bike lock .
I always locked it up wherever I went and never had a problem .
Unfortunately , we did n’t have a garage or any other place to lock up the bike at home so I would always leave it leaning up against the back of the house .
It turns out , that ’s not a very secure storage area .
I ’m still not sure why they did n’t come up with a new plan after the first incident .
I know everyone is making these kind of lists and that I ’ve already stated my top anime of 2009 on the podcast .
But I figured this is a good way to look back at the year and maybe help readers catch a few shows they missed before getting swamped by the upcoming Winter season .
I limited the list to five because I do n’t think I have seen enough shows to warrant a top ten list .
Even if I watched twenty shows , it ’s probably somewhere around that , picking ten is still half the shows I happened to see .
I only have one rule for this list .
The anime must have finished airing or being released in Japan or United States in 2009 .
If I have already seen the show in fansubs it becomes ineligible for the list the year it gets an R1 release .
The reason for this is because there are certain films that I have refused to see until I can get them on blu-ray .
So I do n’t want to exclude them from future lists .
At the same time I really want this to be a list of the year the shows were originally aired in Japan .
So I ’m going to try the middle ground .
On to the list :
5. Clannad After Story
I was n’t completely in love with the original Clannad .
It was a nice little series but , like all the key adaptations , it had some serious problems .
There are just some elements that do not translate from visual novel to anime well .
Clannad , and Kannon before it , get repetitive and predicable , not to mention melodramatic .
Clannad After Story was able to shed most of the limitations of an adapted light novel .
The concept of a high school love story being carried on after graduation was unique and presented in a way that felt genuine .
Things are n’t all roses and fireworks after high school .
The real world has to be tackled .
Bills have to be paid .
Clannad After Story , despite the melancholy and strange plot devices , is a well executed love story about two people who just wanted to live a normal life .
It also will destroy your soul and reconstruct it in its own image .
Just saying .
4. Casshern Sins
I have never seen a Casshern property before watching this latest iteration of the ancient franchise .
The quality of the animation alone should earn it a place on this list .
But on top of the ascetic value the show featured an incredible sound track and a solid story about the fear of death and what it means to be mortal .
The dark atmosphere of the series was balanced with characters that were able to absolutely melt your heart without being obnoxious .
The action was good , if a bit repetitive , but the real value of the show comes from the well presented themes .
What does it mean to be mortal ?
What does it mean to be immortal ?
What is the power of hope ?
3. Canaan
Canaan is one of the best action shows that has come out in a long time .
It avoids being a stoic story of bitter revenge by giving the seemingly heartless Canaan a unbelievably cheerful foil .
In fact all of the dark characters have foils which gives the show a tonal balance between light and serious .
The animation is spectacularly well done and the action is fast pasted and fluid .
The most illustrative scene is when the President of the United States proclaims “ LOVE AND PEACE ” to a gathering of diplomats before being subjected to a deadly virus .
Yes , it goes back and forth like that throughout the entire 12 episode run .
2. Ride Back
Ride Back finally blends normal animation with CG mechs that enhances , not distracts , from the overall quality of a show .
From the first scene , which features the heroine doing ballet , the audience is given some of the most beautiful art and animation I have ever seen in a television show .
The story does n’t disappoint either , bringing into question the nature of advancing military technology in civilian hands , the question of unlocking ones talent , and a frightening look into a powerful government based on fear of terrorism make this one hell of a loaded 12 episode near - masterpiece .
The only factor holding the show back from gaining the number 1 stop is an abrupt ending that was obviously rushed due to time constraints .
One more episode and this show could have been flawless .
1. Toradora !
Nothing beats a good love story .
Except a good love triangle and the only thing that beats that is a love square .
Toradora ! is the show that I watched the second it came out and immediately demanded more .
The characters were deep , including the background characters , lead by the growing friendship come relationship of Taiga and Ruiji , the two social rejects of the school who help each other to grow together to become part of the class .
The best aspect of Toradora ! is that the audience is unsure which of the three female characters to root for because each has their advantages and failings .
You want to love them all .
The dynamic love story , the excellent sound track , and beautiful art rank this show above all others this year because it was able to balance humor and drama , elation and disappointment , love and hate with a masterful command of character .
Unfortunately I was n’t able to watch everything that came out this year .
Shows that I ’ve seen rated very highly like Bakemonogatari or Eden of the East could have made this list .
But at this point I do n’t know .
If only I could devote all my time to anime .
It is interesting to note that I mainly focus on shows that have a balanced tone .
I did n’t realize it at the time but each of these shows , with the exception of Casshern Sins which is 80 % “ I wanna cut myself ” depressing , balances serious themes with periods of light hearted fun .
Those are qualities to look for in any good story not limit to just Anime .

A federal judge says the Food and Drug Administration overstepped its authority in efforts to regulate electronic cigarettes .
Regulators began halting shipments of electronic cigarettes last year .
The F.D.A. said it found cancer - causing ingredients in the products , despite manufacturers ’ claims that they are safer than tobacco cigarettes .
The agency argued that electronic cigarettes , which use a battery - operated vaporizer to produce a nicotine mist , are a combination drug - device , and therefore subject to stricter safety standards than cigarettes .
But Judge Richard Leon of Federal District Court agreed with manufacturers that electronic cigarettes are “ the functional equivalent of traditional cigarettes . ”
Travel Guide Volume Four
Travel Guide Volume Four : Kcymaerxthaere ( Discover Leddl & Parts of kNow Estrelliia )
Volume 4 of a series of travel guides to an alternative universe known as Kcymaerxthaere , specifically the portions in what we call Europe .
Kcymaerxthaere is a global work of 3 dimensional storytelling where the Geographer - at - Large has installed bronze plaques and historical sites that honor events in the fictional world in our linear world .
Leddl is largely consistent with what we call Europe and kNow Estrelliia quite consistent with what we call Britain , Ireland , Iceland and Greenland–and the surrounding waters .
With this book you can find and visit them , or sit back an enjoy the stories .
You can read from either direction .
The stories featured include the fate of the clan of Nobunaga , a samurai from what we would call Japan who was blown off course in a terrible storm after barely surviving an assassination attempt from a trusted lieutenant .

Pity poor Pluto .
The debate over its planethood has caused much consternation over the years .
Part of the problem is that it 's so dinky and so far away !
If it were closer , or bigger , we almost certainly would n't be having this debate .
But whether or not you think Pluto should be part of the gang or not , one thing is certain : it 's a world unto itself .
And to bring this point literally home , the Hubble Space Telescope has revealed the changing face of this tiny iceball :
These images , just released today ( but taken in 2002 ) , represent the most detailed surface map of Pluto ever taken .
Even in Hubble 's Advanced Camera for Surveys Pluto is only a few pixels across , but it 's possible using sophisticated image processing techniques to tease out the detail seen .
Here 's a nifty animation of Pluto rotating using these maps :
Very cool .
But these maps are more than just eye candy .
They show significant changes on Pluto 's surface since the last maps were made using Hubble 16 years ago .
Pluto 's north pole is brighter and the south pole darker , implying that material has migrated from one pole to the other , or at least that the poles are changing in different ways .
Pluto orbits the Sun " on its side " , dramatically more tilted than Earth 's mere 23.5° .
Right now , the north pole of the world is facing the Sun , meaning it 's summer on Pluto 's northern hemisphere ( as it'll remain for a long time , given Pluto 's 248 Earth - year long year ) .
Not only that , these images show that Pluto has reddened quite a bit in the past few years .
This is one reason it took so long to release the images ; Marc Buie , the astronomer who took them , saw some things in the data that were difficult to understand , and wanted to make sure they were correct .
These images are composites of pictures taken using a blue and a green filter .
During the time these observations were made , in 2000 - 2002 , Pluto got much darker in blue , which was unexpected .
Pluto 's moon , Charon , did not get any bluer , indicating that the cause was something intrinsic to Pluto and not that something weird happened with Hubble .
So why is Pluto redder now ?
That 's not clear .
In general , ultraviolet light from the Sun interacts with the chemicals on Pluto , creating reddish organic molecules ; this is seen on lots of distant , icy objects in the Kuiper Belt ( the region past Neptune where Pluto orbits ) .
Incredibly , even at the numbing distance of over 4 billion kilometers ( 3 billion miles ) from the Sun , Pluto is still strongly affected by it .
But this is happening while overall the northern hemisphere got brighter and the southern darker .
You 'd expect Pluto to get darker if it gets redder , so clearly there 's more going on here than meets the eye .
These maps will prove crucial in planning the imaging run of the New Horizons probe , which will scream past Pluto in 2015 .
Having even a crude map in advance of the encounter will help scientists plan their limited time more carefully .
Plus , these Hubble images may very well be the best view we 'll get until New Horizons gets to Pluto , for that matter .
And whether you think Pluto is the littlest planet or one of the biggest of the Kuiper Belt Objects , it 's a fascinating place worthy of a lot more study .
And in just a little more than five years we 'll see fantastic images of it , too .
I can't wait !

Verse King James Version Proposed Conservative Translation Analysis
1 And Moses answered and said , But , behold , they will not believe me , nor hearken unto my voice for they will say , The LORD hath not appeared unto thee .
Moses said in answer , " But , Sir !
They wo n't believe me , nor will they even listen to me , for they will say , ' The L ORD has not appeared to you . ' "
Excuses , excuses .
2 And the LORD said unto him , What is that in thine hand ?
And he said , A rod .
The L ORD said to him , " What is that in your hand ? "
And he said , " A rod . "
It was probably Moses ' shepherd 's crook .
3 And he said , Cast it on the ground .
And he cast it on the ground , and it became a serpent ; and Moses fled from before it .
So He said , " Throw that on the ground . "
So he threw it on the ground , and it turned into a snake , and Moses ran from it .
4 And the LORD said unto Moses , Put forth thine hand , and take it by the tail .
And he put forth his hand , and caught it , and it became a rod in his hand But the L ORD said to Moses , " Grab it with your hand , by its tail . "
So he grabbed it with his hand and held onto it , and it became a rod in the palm of his hand .
5 That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob , hath appeared unto thee .
" This will make them believe that the L ORD God of their ancestors , the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , has appeared to you . "
6 And the LORD said furthermore unto him , Put now thine hand into thy bosom .
And he put his hand into his bosom and when he took it out , behold , his hand was leprous as snow .
And the L ORD said more to him : " Put your hand inside your shirt . "
And he put his hand inside his shirt , and when he took it out , his hand was affected with leprosy , and white like snow .
Leprosy , as used here , could be the name of any of a number of skin diseases , and not necessarily Hansen 's Disease , caused by the leper 's germ Mycobacterium leprae .
7 And he said , Put thine hand into thy bosom again .
And he put his hand into his bosom again ; and plucked it out of his bosom , and , behold , it was turned again as his other flesh .
He said , " Put your hand inside your shirt again . "
And he put his hand inside his shirt again , and brought it out , and it was restored to health , like the rest of his skin .
8 And it shall come to pass , if they will not believe thee , neither hearken to the voice of the first sign , that they will believe the voice of the latter sign .
" If they happen not to believe you , and are not convinced by the first sign , they will be convinced by the second . "
9 And it shall come to pass , if they will not believe also these two signs , neither hearken unto thy voice , that thou shalt take of the water of the river , and pour it upon the dry land : and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land .
" And if they do n't believe either of these signs , and wo n't listen to you , then you shall take water from the river Nile , and pour it upon dry land , and the water you take out of the Nile shall become blood on the land . "
This prefigures the Plague Upon the Nile .
10 And Moses said unto the LORD , O my Lord , I am not eloquent , neither heretofore , nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant : but I am slow of speech , and of a slow tongue .
Moses said to the L ORD , " My Lord , I 'm not eloquent , either before now , or even now that you have spoken to me , and I speak slowly , with a slow tongue . "
The Hebrew idiomatic phrase is " even from yesterday even from three days . "
Here Moses makes yet another excuse .
11 And the LORD said unto him , Who hath made man 's mouth ?
or who maketh the dumb , or deaf , or the seeing , or the blind ?
have not I the LORD ?
The L ORD said to him , " Who made men 's mouths ?
Who makes the dumb , the deaf , or the seeing , or the blind ?
Was it not I , the L ORD ?
Never plead a lack of qualification from you you 'r made , not when you 're talking to God -- for God ought to know exactly what you 're capable of , because He made you .
12 Now therefore go , and I will be with thy mouth , and teach thee what thou shalt say .
Now go , and I 'll be with you , and guide your mouth , and teach you what you to say . "
13 And he said , O my Lord , send , I pray thee , by the hand of him whom thou wilt send .
And he said , " My Lord , please send Your message by someone else . "
Moses moves from mere excuse - making to an attempt at resignation .
14 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses , and he said , Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother ?
I know that he can speak well .
And also , behold , he cometh forth to meet thee and when he seeth thee , he will be glad in his heart .
And the L ORD grew terrifically angry at Moses .
He said , " The Levite Aaron is your brother ; I know that he can speak well .
In fact , he is coming out to meet you , and he will be very glad to see you . "
One does not resign a Divine commission !
15 And thou shalt speak unto him , and put words in his mouth and I will be with thy mouth , and with his mouth , and will teach you what ye shall do .
" You will speak to him , and tell him what to say , and I 'll be with both of you as you speak , and will teach you what to do . "
16 And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people and he shall be , even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth , and thou shalt be to him instead of God .
" He will be your spokesman to the people , almost as your mouth , and you will stand in relation to him as I stand to you . "
17 And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand , wherewith thou shalt do signs .
" Now take this rod in your hands , with which you shall do miracles . "
18 And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law , and said unto him , Let me go , I pray thee , and return unto my brethren which are in Egypt , and see whether they be yet alive .
And Jethro said to Moses , Go in peace .
So Moses returned to his father - in - law Jethro , and said to him , " I ask you , please , to let me leave , and return to my people in Egypt , and see if they are still alive . "
And Jethro said to Moses , " Go in peace . "
19 And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian , Go , return into Egypt for all the men are dead which sought thy life .
The L ORD said to Moses in Midian , " Go , return to Egypt , for all the men who wished to kill you have died . "
Amenemhet III , who had pronounced Moses ' death warrant ( see Chapter 2 ) , had died .
20 And Moses took his wife and his sons , and set them upon an ass , and he returned to the land of Egypt and Moses took the rod of God in his hand .
So Moses took his wife and his sons , and rode with them on a donkey to Egypt , with the rod of God in his hand .
21 And the LORD said unto Moses ,
When thou goest to return into Egypt , see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh , which I have put in thine hand but I will harden his heart , that he shall not let the people go .
The L ORD said to Moses , " When you go to return into Egypt , see that you do the miracles before Pharaoh , with the staff I 've put in your hand .
But I 'll harden his heart , and he wo n't dismiss the people . "
22 And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh , Thus saith the LORD , Israel is my son , even my firstborn " You will say to Pharaoh , ' The L ORD says , " Israel is my son , as my firstborn . " ' "
23 And I say unto thee , Let my son go , that he may serve me : and if thou refuse to let him go , behold , I will slay thy son , even thy firstborn . " ' " I say to you : dismiss my son , so that he may serve me : and if your refuse to dismiss him , I 'll kill your firstborn son . " ' "
A direct reference to the final Plague Upon the Firstborn .
24 And it came to pass by the way in the inn , that the LORD met him , and sought to kill him .
Now it happened by the road to the lodging - house , the L ORD encountered him and was seeking to put him to death .
Why ?
Because Moses had not circumcised his son .
God required that Moses address that remaining issue .
25 Then Zipporah took a sharp stone , and cut off the foreskin of her son , and cast it at his feet , and said , Surely a bloody husband art thou to me .
Then Zipporah took a stone knife , and cut off her son's foreskin , and touched it against his feet .
She said , " You are a bridegroom of blood to me . "
26 So he let him go then she said , A bloody husband thou art , because of the circumcision .
And so she slacked off from him , saying , " You are a bridegroom of blood to me , " on account of the circumcision .
Moses and Zipporah had their first " spat " , that would last until the Red Sea crossing .
27 And the LORD said to Aaron , Go into the wilderness to meet Moses .
And he went , and met him in the mount of God , and kissed him .
The L ORD said to Aaron , " Go and meet Moses in the desert . "
And he went , and met him in the mountain of God , and kissed him .
28 And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him , and all the signs which he had commanded him .
Moses told Aaron all the words of the L ORD
Who sent him , and all the signs with and in which He had instructed him .
29 And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel .
Moses and Aaron went and gathered all the elders of the Sons of Israel .
30 And Aaron spake all the words which the LORD had spoken unto Moses , and did the signs in the sight of the people .
Aaron spoke all the words that the L ORD had spoken to Moses , and performed the signs in front of the people .
Italian designer Cristiana Giopato has created the Hula Hoop vase for Industreal .
From Cristiana Giopato :
A series of stackable disks , which when at half it ’s height surrounds the wine bottle to become a winecooler .
When completing the tower the empty wine bottle is completely hidden and the final object becomes a vase , giving the bottle new function and appearance .
The disc elements are all different and can be both rotated and their order inverted creating a new appearance everytime it is assembled .
Welcome back to The Gav ’s walkthrough of 2009 !
We ’ve already discussed the year in terms of E3 returning , the economy finally catching up to us , and the price cuts that resulted from that .
But we have merely scratched the surface of the last twelve months , join me once more as we finish our look back at the Year that gave us all here at Elder - Geek so much to bitch about !
— –Controversy on All Fronts — –
Video Games are still the new kids on the entertainment block , and 2009 was a year that shoved our face hard into this fact .
From the smoldering demise of Six Days in Fallujah to the mass media continuing to see our hobby as a threat , there was little time left in the year were we could n’t be worked up over something .
Let ’s take these emotional hassles in order of effectiveness , shall we ?
First on the chopping block is developers and CEOs finding interviews a place to spout of their personal opinions rather than tell us about their games .
The biggest offender this year is Gearbox ’s own C.E.O. Randy Pitchford , who pissed off a lot of PC - diehards , including Tripewire Interactive President John Gibson , with his rants on Valve ’s digital distribution platform Steam .
Not stopping at a single interview tirade , he released a second one shortly after getting wind of his first one ’s responses .
But beyond simple teeth - gnashing and flame - baiting lies Activision ’s Bobby Kotick , who – in between describing how “ taking the fun out of games ” is better for the industry – threatening to wrench his company ’s support of the Playstation 3 for Sony ’s audacity to sell their systems poorly , a move which earned him more venom from the gamer community than multiple Uwe Boll movie premieres .
Oh , and David Jaffe spoke out about the mass media , but we all kind of expect that by now .
Second on the crucifix is Australia , or more specifically , it ’s ratings board .
A wholly - government owned entity , the board rejected two of 2009 ’s most high - profile releases on the perceived basis of their violence and gore , shutting out millions of possible players for some of the most anticipated games in this generation .
Left 4 Dead 2 was first to received the Aussie - Ax , only to have it be lifted after receiving a neutered version which now haunts retail shelves down under ( guess they could n’t resist at least a quasi - release after seeing the game become Valve ’s biggest pre-ordered IP ever . )
But the lion ’s share of the controversial meat went to the ever - eyebrow - raising Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 , who not only received some heat from Australia , but from Russia as well for its infamous “ No Russian ” civilian - killing mission .
Needless to say making the mission skip - able aided in the eventual dismissal of the controversy .
The board is showing signs of competence though , as towards the end of the year they were considering ( and asking arguments for ) a new M18 + mature rating .
But by far the most irritating controversies on our collected sub - dermal levels were those that the games , and sometimes we ourselves , created .
Bethsoft managed to pinch a fringe nerve with their injunction against Fallout originators Interplay – a move which they ultimately lost – but again our main cast features Left 4 Dead 2 and Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 , the former receiving hate - mail from fan ’s unhappy to seeing a full - priced sequel were they expected an expansion pack .
But once more Modern Warfare takes the proverbial cake , shooting itself in the foot enough times to earn a Tactical Nuke for their killstreak .
First we learn of the game ’s lack of a multiplayer beta followed quickly by the absence of a pre-release demo version .
But before we can get over this admittedly minor hump , the folks at Infinity Ward and Activision head - shot us by taking away the PC version ’s dedicated servers and the Xbox 360 version ’s party chat function , all in the name of making each of the game ’s multiple versions as identical as possible .
Such community rage has rarely been documented , but neither game ’s controversy was enough to daunt each title ’s bottom line , making the controversy that much sourer at the prospect that these game - makers and publishers will do this to us again .
— –2009 Delayed Until 2010 — –
I ’m assuming we ’re all on the same page when it comes to this issue , so I ’m just going to list of just SOME of the AAA games we could have been playing this year if their creators were n’t afraid of the big bad Modern Warfare wolf .
Alpha Protocol
Alan Wake
Army of Two : The 40th Day
Bayonetta
Bioshock 2
Dark Void
Darksiders
Dead to Rights : Retribution
Diablo 3
Ghost Recon 4
Heavy Rain

— –The Digital Age Hath Come — –
What was once a supplemental oddity has no become a development necessity .
With post -( and day of -) release DLC , companies can extend the shelf life of their games , and gamers can further stretch their cost - sensitive budgets with extra content at a fraction of the cost of a full release .
2009 saw the release of dozens of top-quality additional content that , in other years , would have meant another disc from the developers .
Titles like Rock Band and LittleBigPlanet continued literal years of post - release support , while some of the year ’s biggest contenders kept their legs with some astonishingly gameplay - strengthening downloads .
Both last year ’s favorites ( Fallout 3 ’s five downloadable excursions , Grand Theft Auto IV ’s Liberty City Episodes ) and this year ’s biggest releases ( Batman : Arkham Asylum ’s challenge rooms , Borderlands ‘ Zombie Island of Dr. Ned , Dragon Age : Origins ’ Day - One adventures , and F.E.A.R. 2 : Project Origin / Killzone 2 map packs , among others ) came back with some extra goodies for those that kept the disc spinning in their drive .
We even got the 20 month - delayed downloadable content for Mass Effect , but the less said about that the better .
But our hard drives were n’t clogged with expanded missions alone , as 2009 over - stepped all years before it will some spectacular download - only releases , most of which blur the gap between a digital and disc game .
The great releases are too many to list , a feat which seems to finally indicate the ever thinning margins between distribution methods and development .
The Playstation Network came into its own against the ever - strong Xbox Live Arcade , and even WiiWare had enough variety to keep any gamer occupied in between trips to the game store .
And with the digital distribution platform expected to reach $ 10 billion in cash revenue by 2015 , the future has never been brighter for the install bar .
The only way it could be even better is if we were confident in the PSPGo ’s success .
If .
— –2009 : In Review — –
And that ’s the past twelve months of gaming in a very condensed nutshell .
As alas , I have not yet become master of the multi-verse , my fallibility may have lead me to miss an important event or news items that made your year .
To those that find fault with my work here , I offer you the included comments section below to leave your complaints and grievances .
I ’m the Gav , and on behalf of all the staff at Elder - Geek.com , here ’s to an even better 2010 !
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
A late burst of selling left stocks with a hefty loss Thursday as traders took cash off the table at the end of a banner year , highlighted by the biggest annual percentage gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in six years .
The Dow DJIA , +1.19 % ended near its intraday low , down 120.46 points , or 1.1 % , at 10428.05 .
The blue - chip measure ended 2009 with an 18.8 % gain , though it is still down 26.4 % from its all - time record set in October 2007 .
The selling was set off by interest - rate jitters but gathered momentum in the last half - hour of trading , which had been thin throughout the day .
The lack of participation allowed a relative few participants to have an outsized influence at day 's end , apparently through the use of automated trading programs , traders said .
" There 's just no liquidity out there right now ; guys have totally backed off , " said Don Bright , a partner at the Chicago proprietary trading firm Bright Trading .
" That makes it easier for a few people to push the market around . "
In the day 's most closely watched economic announcement , the Labor Department said that weekly jobless claims fell by 22,000 to their lowest level in 18 months .
Economists had expected a rise of about 3,000 .
Visit MarketWatch's Economy and Politics home page .
The report reinforced Wall Street 's belief that a U.S. economic recovery is taking hold , but it also spurred some speculation about when the Federal Reserve might raise its key rate target to prevent inflation .
That Catch - 22 is likely to remain a key consideration for traders well into 2010 .
" People are looking at these claims numbers and thinking that maybe the [ monthly ] payroll numbers due out next week might show an increase in jobs , " said Peter Cardillio , chief market economist at Avalon Partners in New York .
If that happens , it would snap a streak of 23 consecutive declines in U.S. employment and perhaps clear an important hurdle for the Fed , which is bound by its charter to encourage both price stability and maximum employment .
Earlier this month , the report of an unexpected drop in the U.S. unemployment rate to 10 % stoked fears that a rise in interest rates was coming sooner than had been expected .
The fears ebbed after the Fed reaffirmed its plans to keep to its easy - money stance for some time , but Thursday 's better - than - expected claims report has brought the interest - rate worries back .
Nevertheless , Karl Mills , chief investment officer at Jurika , Mills & Kiefer , was pleased with Thursday 's report .
" It 's a trend in the right direction , " he said .
" You have to have a strong economy to have a strong market , so we look at it as a positive on an otherwise quiet and nonrepresentative day . "
Other stock indicators fell Thursday amid scant volume .
The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP , +0.74 % fell 1 % to 2,269.15 , up 43.9 % on the year .
The Russell 2000 RUT , +0.19 % was down 1.3 % to 625.39 , up 25.2 % on the year .
The Standard & Poor 's 500 index SPX , +0.82 % was off 1 % to 1,115.10 , up 23.5 % on the year .
The broad index was hurt Thursday by declines in every sector , led by pullbacks of more than 1 % each in technology , industrials , materials , utilities , consumer staples , and health care .
Investors digested reports that the U.S. Treasury this week officially ended the bank recapitalization portion of its Troubled Asset Relief Program , the massive bailout launched at the height of the financial crisis to prevent a wider meltdown .
The Treasury this week provided a combined $ 29.26 million in capital to 10 small banks across the country , it said in a report released Thursday .
A Treasury spokesman said the banks would be the last to receive capital under the effort , dubbed the Capital Purchase Program .
Through the program , launched in October 2008 , the Treasury has provided 707 U.S. banks with $ 204.9 billion in capital .
Composite turnover in New York Stock Exchange - listed companies hit 2.3 billion shares , a new full - day low for the year .
Decliners outnumbered advancers by more than two to one .
Thursday marks the end of what has been the worst calendar decade for stocks since the 1820s , when reliable stock - market records began , according to data compiled by Yale University finance professor William Goetzmann .
Get more details in Market Pulse .
However , the rally from the stock market 's 12 - year low in March represents the strongest rebound since 1933 .
The Dow has risen 61 % over that span .
Meanwhile , Treasurys have handed investors a loss of 3.30 % through Wednesday in 2009 , on pace for the second - worst annual return since at least 1973 , according to the latest data from Barclays Capital .
In 1994 , Treasurys posted a loss of 3.38 % .
In 2008 , the government bond market saw hefty returns of 14 % .
In recent action Treasury prices slipped .
The benchmark 10 - year note was off 11/32 to yield 3.837 % .
See Bond Report .
The dollar strengthened against the euro and Japanese yen .
Crude - oil futures and gold futures were higher .
Phil Jones is director of the Climatic Research Unit ( CRU ) at the University of East Anglia ( UEA ) , which has been at the centre of the row over hacked e-mails .
The BBC 's environment analyst Roger Harrabin put questions to Professor Jones , including several gathered from climate sceptics .
The questions were put to Professor Jones with the co-operation of UEA 's press office .
A - Do you agree that according to the global temperature record used by the IPCC , the rates of global warming from 1860 - 1880 , 1910 - 1940 and 1975 - 1998 were identical ?
An initial point to make is that in the responses to these questions I 've assumed that when you talk about the global temperature record , you mean the record that combines the estimates from land regions with those from the marine regions of the world .
CRU produces the land component , with the Met Office Hadley Centre producing the marine component .
Temperature data for the period 1860 - 1880 are more uncertain , because of sparser coverage , than for later periods in the 20th Century .
The 1860 - 1880 period is also only 21 years in length .
As for the two periods 1910 - 40 and 1975 - 1998 the warming rates are not statistically significantly different ( see numbers below ) .
I have also included the trend over the period 1975 to 2009 , which has a very similar trend to the period 1975 - 1998 .
So , in answer to the question , the warming rates for all 4 periods are similar and not statistically significantly different from each other .
Here are the trends and significances for each period : Period Length Trend
( Degrees C per decade ) Significance 1860 - 1880 21 0.163 Yes 1910 - 1940 31 0.15 Yes 1975 - 1998 24 0.166 Yes 1975 -2009 35 0.161
Yes B -
Do you agree that from 1995 to the present there has been no statistically - significant global warming Yes , but only just .
I also calculated the trend for the period 1995 to 2009 .
This trend ( 0.12C per decade ) is positive , but not significant at the 95 % significance level .
The positive trend is quite close to the significance level .
Achieving statistical significance in scientific terms is much more likely for longer periods , and much less likely for shorter periods .
C - Do you agree that from January 2002 to the present there has been statistically significant global cooling ?
No .
This period is even shorter than 1995 - 2009 .
The trend this time is negative ( - 0.12C per decade ) , but this trend is not statistically significant .
D - Do you agree that natural influences could have contributed significantly to the global warming observed from 1975 - 1998 , and , if so , please could you specify each natural influence and express its radiative forcing over the period in Watts per square metre .
This area is slightly outside my area of expertise .
When considering changes over this period we need to consider all possible factors ( so human and natural influences as well as natural internal variability of the climate system ) .
Natural influences ( from volcanoes and the Sun ) over this period could have contributed to the change over this period .
Volcanic influences from the two large eruptions ( El Chichon in 1982 and Pinatubo in 1991 ) would exert a negative influence .
Solar influence was about flat over this period .
Combining only these two natural influences , therefore , we might have expected some cooling over this period .
E - How confident are you that warming has taken place and that humans are mainly responsible ?
I 'm 100 % confident that the climate has warmed .
As to the second question , I would go along with IPCC Chapter 9 - there 's evidence that most of the warming since the 1950s is due to human activity .
F - Sceptics of anthropogenic global warming ( AGW ) suggest that the official surface record paints a different story from the actual station records .
To restore trust , should we start again with new quality control on input data in total transparency ?
First , I am assuming again that you are referring to the surface record from both land and marine regions of the world , although in this answer as you specifically say " station " records , I will emphasise the land regions .
There is more than one " official " surface temperature record , based on actual land station records .
There is the one we have developed in CRU , but there are also the series developed at NCDC and GISS .
Although we all use very similar station datasets , we each employ different ways of assessing the quality of the individual series and different ways of developing gridded products .
The GISS data and their program are freely available for people to experiment with .
The agreement between the three series is very good .
Large numbers of the CRU e-mails were posted on the web Given the web - based availability of the Global Historical Climatology Network ( GHCN ) , which is used by both NCDC and GISS , anyone else can develop their own global temperature record from land stations .
Through the Met Office we have released ( as of 29 January 2010 ) 80 % of the station data that enters the CRU analysis ( CRUTEM3 ) .
The graphic in the link below shows that the global land temperature series from these 80 % of stations ( red line ) replicates the analysis based on all 100 % of stations ( black line ) .
http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climatechange/science/monitoring/data-graphic.GIF
The locations of the 80 % of stations are shown on the next link in red .
The stations we have yet to get agreement to release are shown in grey .
http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climatechange/science/monitoring/locations.GIF
I accept that some have had their trust in science shaken and this needs the Met Office to release more of the data beyond the 80 % released so far .
Before all the furore broke we had begun discussions with the Met Office for an updated set of station temperatures .
With any new station dataset we will make sure we will be able to release all the station temperature data and give source details for all the series .
G - There is a debate over whether the Medieval Warm Period ( MWP ) was global or not .
If it were to be conclusively shown that it was a global phenomenon , would you accept that this would undermine the premise that mean surface atmospheric temperatures during the latter part of the 20th Century were unprecedented ?
There is much debate over whether the Medieval Warm Period was global in extent or not .
The MWP is most clearly expressed in parts of North America , the North Atlantic and Europe and parts of Asia .
For it to be global in extent the MWP would need to be seen clearly in more records from the tropical regions and the Southern Hemisphere .
There are very few palaeoclimatic records for these latter two regions .
Of course , if the MWP was shown to be global in extent and as warm or warmer than today ( based on an equivalent coverage over the NH and SH ) then obviously the late - 20th century warmth would not be unprecedented .
On the other hand , if the MWP was global , but was less warm that today , then current warmth would be unprecedented .
We know from the instrumental temperature record that the two hemispheres do not always follow one another .
We cannot , therefore , make the assumption that temperatures in the global average will be similar to those in the northern hemisphere .
H - If you agree that there were similar periods of warming since 1850 to the current period , and that the MWP is under debate , what factors convince you that recent warming has been largely man-made ?
The fact that we can't explain the warming from the 1950s by solar and volcanic forcing - see my answer to your question D. I - Would it be reasonable looking at the same scientific evidence to take the view that recent warming is not predominantly manmade ?
No - see again my answer to D. J - Are there lessons to be learned for society or scientists about the way we see uncertainty and risk ?
Yes - as stated by Sir John Beddington - the government chief scientist .
And this does n't just apply to climate science .
K - How much faith do you have - and should we have - in the Yamal tree ring data from Siberia ?
Should we trust the science behind the palaeoclimate record ?
First , we would all accept that palaeoclimatic data are considerably less certain than the instrumental data .
However , we must use what data are available in order to look at the last 1,000 years .
I believe that our current interpretation of the Yamal tree - ring data in Siberia is sound .
Yamal is just one series that enters some of the millennial long reconstructions that are available .
My colleague Keith Briffa has responded to suggestions that there is something amiss with the Yamal tree - ring data .
Here is his response : http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/people/briffa/yamal2009/
L - Can you confirm that the IPCC rules were changed so lead authors could add references to any scientific paper which did not meet the 16 December 2005 deadline but was in press on 24 July 2006 , so long as it was published in 2006 ?
If this is the case , who made the decision and why ?
This is a question for the IPCC .
M - What advice did you seek in handling FOI requests ?
The university 's policy and guidelines on FOI and the Environmental Information Regulations are on our website and the information policy and compliance manager ( IPCM ) takes responsibility for co-ordinating responses to requests within that framework .
We also have colleagues in each unit and faculty who are trained in FOI to help in gathering information and assessing any possible exceptions or exemptions .
I worked with those colleagues and the IPCM to handle the requests with responses going from the IPCM .
He also liaises with the Information Commissioner 's Office where necessary and did so on several occasions in relation to requests made to CRU .
Where appropriate he also consulted with other colleagues in the university on specific issues .
N - When scientists say " the debate on climate change is over " , what exactly do they mean - and what do n't they mean ?
It would be supposition on my behalf to know whether all scientists who say the debate is over are saying that for the same reason .
I do n't believe the vast majority of climate scientists think this .
This is not my view .
There is still much that needs to be undertaken to reduce uncertainties , not just for the future , but for the instrumental ( and especially the palaeoclimatic ) past as well .
O - Can you tell us about your working life over the past decades in climate science .
Paint a picture about the debate with your allies and scientific rivals etc .
I have been at CRU since November 1976 .
Up until 1994 , my working life was almost totally in research .
Since 1994 , I have become more involved in teaching and student supervision both at the postgraduate and undergraduate level .
I became a Professor in 1998 and the director of the Climatic Research Unit in 2004 ( I was joint director from 1998 ) .
I am most well known for being involved in the publication of a series of papers ( from 1982 to 2006 ) that have developed a gridded dataset of land - based temperature records .
These are only a part of the work I do , as I have been involved in about 270 peer - reviewed publications on many different aspects of climate research .
Over the years at scientific meetings , I 've met many people and had numerous discussions with them .
I work with a number of different groups of people on different subjects , and some of these groups come together to undertake collaborative pieces of work .
We have lively debates about the work we 're doing together .
P - The " Climategate " stolen emails were published in November .
How has your life been since then ?
My life has been awful since that time , but I have discussed this once ( in the Sunday Times ) and have no wish to go over it again .
I am trying to continue my research and supervise the CRU staff and students who I am responsible for .
Q - Let 's talk about the e-mails now :
In the e-mails you refer to a " trick " which your critics say suggests you conspired to trick the public ?
You also mentioned " hiding the decline " ( in temperatures ) .
Why did you say these things ?
This remark has nothing to do with any " decline " in observed instrumental temperatures .
The remark referred to a well - known observation , in a particular set of tree - ring data , that I had used in a figure to represent large - scale summer temperature changes over the last 600 years .
The phrase ' hide the decline ' was shorthand for providing a composite representation of long - term temperature changes made up of recent instrumental data and earlier tree - ring based evidence , where it was absolutely necessary to remove the incorrect impression given by the tree rings that temperatures between about 1960 and 1999 ( when the email was written ) were not rising , as our instrumental data clearly showed they were .
This " divergence " is well known in the tree-ring literature and " trick " did not refer to any intention to deceive - but rather " a convenient way of achieving something " , in this case joining the earlier valid part of the tree-ring record with the recent , more reliable instrumental record .
I was justified in curtailing the tree-ring reconstruction in the mid-20th Century because these particular data were not valid after that time - an issue which was later directly discussed in the 2007 IPCC AR4 Report .
The misinterpretation of the remark stems from its being quoted out of context .
The 1999 WMO report wanted just the three curves , without the split between the proxy part of the reconstruction and the last few years of instrumental data that brought the series up to the end of 1999 .
Only one of the three curves was based solely on tree - ring data .
The e-mail was sent to a few colleagues pointing out their data was being used in the WMO Annual Statement in 1999 .
I was pointing out to them how the lines were physically drawn .
This e-mail was not written for a general audience .
If it had been I would have explained what I had done in much more detail .
R - Why did you ask a colleague to delete all e-mails relating to the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC ?
This was an e-mail sent out of frustration at one FOI request that was asking for the e-mail correspondence between the lead authors on chapter six of the Working Group One Report of the IPCC .
This is one of the issues which the Independent Review will look at .
S - The e-mails suggest you were trying to subvert the process of peer review and to influence editors in their decisions about which papers to publish .
Do you accept that ?
I do not accept that I was trying to subvert the peer - review process and unfairly influence editors in their decisions .
I undertook all the reviews I made in good faith and sent them back to the editors .
In some e-mails I questioned the peer - review process with respect to what I believed were poor papers that had appeared .
Is n't this called freedom of speech ?
On some occasions I joined with others to submit a response to some of these papers .
Since the beginning of 2005 I have reviewed 43 papers .
I take my reviewing seriously and in 2006 I was given an editor 's award from Geophysical Research Letters for conscientious and constructive reviewing .
T - Where do you draw the line on the handling of data ?
What is at odds with acceptable scientific practice ?
Do you accept that you crossed the line ?
This is a matter for the independent review .
U - Now , on to the fallout from " Climategate " , as it has become known .
You had a leading role in a part of the IPCC , Working Group I .
Do you accept that credibility in the IPCC has been damaged - partly as a result of your actions ?
Does the IPCC need reform to gain public trust ?
Some have said that the credibility in the IPCC has been damaged , partly due to the misleading and selective release of particular e-mails .
I wish people would spend as much time reading my scientific papers as they do reading my e-mails .
The IPCC does need to reassure people about the quality of its assessments .
V - If you have confidence in your science why did n't you come out fighting like the UK government 's drugs adviser David Nutt when he was criticised ?
I do n't feel this question merits an answer .
W - Finally , a personal question :
Do you expect to return as director of the Climatic Research Unit ?
What is next for you ?
This question is not for me to answer .
Some brief answers have been slightly expanded following more information from UEA .

Cover - up claims as David Kelly post mortem set to stay under wraps for 70 years
Medical records which would shed light on the death of government scientist David Kelly will be kept secret for 70 years , it emerged yesterday .
The unprecedented move has been ordered by Lord Hutton , who chaired the inquiry which controversially concluded that the mysterious death was suicide .
It means vital evidence , including the results of Dr Kelly 's post - mortem examination - which have never been made public - will remain under wraps until 2073 , by which time anyone involved in the case will almost certainly be dead .
Whistle - blower : Dr Kelly died after casting doubt on Government claims about Saddam 's weapons
The body of 59 - year - old UN weapons inspector Dr Kelly was found in July 2003 in woods near his Oxfordshire home .
Days earlier he had been revealed as the source of a BBC story claiming evidence against Iraq had been ' sexed up ' to justify invasion .
No coroner 's inquest has been held into the death .
Last night , Dr Michael Powers QC , a doctor campaigning to overturn Lord Hutton 's findings , told the Daily Mail : ' I can not understand why this extraordinary move has been taken .
Tragic : Forensic experts at work in the Oxfordshire woods where Dr Kelly 's body was found in 2003
' It does give rise , perhaps unnecessarily , to a suspicion that information relevant to these circumstances was kept out of the public eye .
' The surprising thing to me is that if this report supports the conclusion that the medical cause of death was suicide , why does it need to be locked up for 70 years ?
' If on the other hand it does n't , and supports other means of death , then why was n't this evidence investigated by the Hutton inquiry ?
The move will stoke fresh speculation about the true circumstances of Dr Kelly 's death
' It is very difficult to understand what is so precious and important about the medical reports and tests which stops any of us having sight of this until everyone with any knowledge or interest in the case is dead . '
Liberal Democrat MP
Norman Baker , who has also cast doubt on the official version of events , said : ' It is astonishing this is the first we 've known about this decision by Lord Hutton and even more astonishing he should have seen fit to hide this material away . '
Lord Hutton 's restrictions - which were imposed immediately after his inquiry in 2004 - came to light in a letter from Oxfordshire County Council to a group of 13 doctors , led by Dr Powers , challenging the Hutton verdict .
It revealed that an order had been imposed which placed a 30 - year ban the release of records that were provided to the inquiry but not used in evidence - believed to be witness statements .
In addition , the letter said that medical reports and photographs of Dr Kelly 's body would remain classified information for 70 years after his death .
Nicholas Gardiner , chief coroner for Oxfordshire , said the restriction may have been used to protect Dr Kelly 's children .
Dr David Halpin , another of the group of 13 doctors , said last night : ' I am shocked but not surprised by this .
' It fits in with the subversion of due process we have seen for six years .
It is extraordinary . '
Order : Lord Hutton has secretly barred the release of all medical records , including the results of the post mortem
Both Dr Halpin and Dr Powers said they would like to see the Chilcot panel ask why the ban was imposed .
Dr Powers said : ' We would like to know the part government ministers played in the decision . '
The Ministry of Justice has not explained the legal basis for Lord Hutton 's order .
A spokesman said : ' Any decision made by Lord Hutton was entirely a matter for him . '
Lord Hutton was unavailable for comment .
2009 IPv6 Address Use Report Correction : the number 39395.56 ( total /32 equivalents given out ) in an earlier version of this page and in the emails I sent out is incorrect , the initial 1 was left out .
The correct number is 139395.56 .
Since 2005 , I 've been compiling an IP v4 address use report every year .
With the start of the new decade , this is a good moment to start doing the same thing for IP v6 .
This page shows the amount of IP v6 space given out by RIR and by year , while this page shows the amount of IP v6 address space by country .
Both these pages are updated weekly from the delegation data that the RIRs publish on their FTP servers .
2008 saw a huge increase in the amount of IP v6 space given out and then a big drop in 2009 ( amounts of IP v6 address space in the equivalent of /32s ) : 1999 10.88 /32s in 17 blocks 2000 19.75 /32s in 32 blocks 2001 33.13 /32s in 61 blocks 2002 156.75 /32s in 271 blocks 2003 261.38 /32s in 290 blocks 2004 13340.63 /32s in 295 blocks 2005 26985.00 /32s in 245 blocks 2006 9798.00 /32s in 243 blocks 2007 6687.01 /32s in 491 blocks 2008 81012.02 /32s in 886 blocks 2009 1091.03 /32s in 1280 blocks
However , this is not the complete picture .
The large number for 2008 is the result of two unusual events .
The first one is LACNIC 's delegation of the 2804::/16 block to the Brazilian national internet registry ( NIR ) .
At some point in the future , the delegation records will not show such blocks as " used " in their entirety anymore .
Also , ARIN delegated 14 / 22 blocks within the range 2608::/13 to the US Department of Defense .
With these two artifacts removed , the amount of IP v6 space given out per year looks like this : 1999 11.00 /32s in 17 blocks 2000 20.00 /32s in 32 blocks 2001 33.00 /32s in 61 blocks 2002 157.00 /32s in 271 blocks 2003 261.00 /32s in 290 blocks 2004 13341.00 /32s in 295 blocks 2005 26985.00 /32s in 245 blocks 2006 9798.00 /32s in 243 blocks 2007 6687.00 /32s in 491 blocks 2008 1140.00 /32s in 871 blocks 2009 1091.00 /32s in 1280 blocks
So the number of blocks given out keeps increasing , but their size is going down .
There are two reasons for this : roughly between 2004 and 2006 , RIPE and APNIC gave out some very large blocks to some very large ISPs .
They mostly stopped doing that .
And provider independent blocks started to be allowed and are getting more and more popular .
These are the /32 - /35 allocations .
/32 is the minimum block size given out to ISPs , this used to be /35 .
So this view shows the numbers of small - to - medium sized ISPs obtaining IP v6 address space : 1999 11.00 /32s in 17 blocks 2000 20.00 /32s in 32 blocks 2001 33.00 /32s in 55 blocks 2002 157.00 /32s in 254 blocks 2003 223.00 /32s in 251 blocks 2004 235.00 /32s in 241 blocks 2005 217.00 /32s in 217 blocks 2006 186.00 /32s in 186 blocks 2007 351.00 /32s in 351 blocks 2008 734.00 /32s in 734 blocks 2009 1011.00 /32s in 1013 blocks
These are the blocks larger than /32 that go to large ISPs ( excluding the BR NIR and DoD blocks ) : 2003 38.00 /32s in 3 blocks 2004 13106.00 /32s in 9 blocks 2005 26768.00 /32s in 13 blocks 2006 9612.00 /32s in 14 blocks 2007 6336.00 /32s in 8 blocks 2008 406.00 /32s in 7 blocks 2009 80.00 /32s in 4 blocks
And these are the blocks smaller than /35 , which are now mostly provider independent blocks , but also " critical infrastructure " , such as root servers get a / 48 block : 2001 0.00 /32s in 6 blocks 2002 0.00 /32s in 17 blocks 2003 0.00 /32s in 36 blocks 2004 0.00 /32s in 45 blocks 2005 0.00 /32s in 15 blocks 2006 0.00 /32s in 43 blocks 2007 0.00 /32s in 132 blocks 2008 0.00 /32s in 130 blocks 2009 0.00 /32s in 263 blocks
So after a small dip in 2006 , the number of small - to - medium sized ISPs obtaining IP v6 address space shows a steady upward trend , but apparently the very large ISPs either already got their IP v6 address space , are not focussing on IP v6 right now , are starting with a small block ( or several small blocks ) , or a combination of all of these factors .
Even with the BR NIR and DoD blocks included , the ( equivalent of ) 139395.56 /32s given out in 4111 blocks is only 0.026 % of the 536870912 possible /32s in the currently defined global unicast space ( 2000 ::/3 ) .
For comparison , the number of IP v4 blocks given out is 99562 .

Today I found out that Twinkies have a shelf life of only 25 days .
The popular notion that they “ last forever ” or for some ridiculously large amount of time is incorrect .
Here are two other popular myths concerning Twinkies :
Myth : Twinkies are n’t baked ; the sponge cake instead is made from a chemical reaction that causes a cake - like material to foam up .
It is then colored dark brown at the bottom to give the appearance of being baked .
( Twinkies are in fact baked and their primary ingredients are flour , sugar , and eggs . )
Myth : Twinkies contain a chemical used in embalming fluid which helps account for some of their extreme longevity .
( Twinkies contain no such chemical . )
Here are some actual real Twinkie facts :
Twinkies were created in 1930 as ladyfinger - shaped spongecakes .
They were first thought up by James A. Dewar , the Vice President of Continental Bakeries that sold under the Hostess brand .
Dewar was trying to come up with a way to utilize the machines used to make cream filled strawberry shortcake when strawberries were out of season and the machines normally sat idle .
So he got an idea to create a banana cream filled cake .
That ’s right .
Originally , Twinkies were filled with banana cream , which I suppose explains why they chose to make them look as they do .
During World War II , bananas became scarce .
Hostess then decided to switch the cream inside Trinkies to vanilla cream .
This ended up being much more popular than the banana filled version .
So when bananas became readily available again , they chose not to switch back .
The name “ Twinkie ” was also thought up by James Dewar .
On the way to a marketing meeting , he saw a billboard advertising “ Twinkle - Toes Shoes ” and thought up the name “ Twinkies ” .
When Twinkies first came out , they not only were banana filled , but they also had an incredibly low shelf life .
This was due primarily to the dairy products contained in Twinkies giving them only a two day shelf life on average .
This obviously cut into the profit margins .
With the need for longer shelf life , they started substituting ingredients in the original recipe with artificial ingredients .
Among those artificial ingredients is cellulose gum , which gives Twinkie cream its smooth feel .
Another place you can find this cellulose gum is in rocket fuel .
But that ’s not the only fuel based ingredient in a Twinkie .
The chemicals that make up the artificial butter flavor are themselves derived from petroleum .
Another interesting ingredient is corn dextrin .
This gives Twinkies their sticky crust .
Another place you can find this wonderful ingredient is in various glues ; for instance , the glue that you find on the back of envelopes .
Interestingly though , of the 39 ingredients that make up a Twinkie , only one of them is strictly a preservative , or rather , its only purpose in being included is because it ’s a preservative .
Some of the other chemicals in Twinkies have preserving side effects , but their use is primarily as substitutes for the dairy ingredients .
The lack of these dairy ingredients and the air tight plastic wrap are the primary reason that the Twinkie can last the 25 days on the shelves and can out last so many of its other baked brethren in that respect .
Despite their slightly unhealthy nature ( 150 calories each ; with quite a dose of fat included ) , Hostess now churns out more than 1000 Twinkies per minute or about 500 million per year .
The cakes are each baked for 12 minutes ; injected with cream ; flipped over so the round bottom is now the top ; then packaged for shipping .
Bonus Twinkie fact : According to Hostess , it takes about 45 seconds to explode a Twinkie in a standard powered microwave .
Try this at home kids …
Seriously , anybody want to try this and report back on the results ?

Melody Petersen has been writ­ing about the phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal indus­try for more than 10 years , includ­ing as a staff reporter for the New York Times .
Her recent book , Our Dai­ly Meds : How the Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal Com­pa­nies Trans­formed Them­selves into Slick Mar­ket­ing Machines and Hooked the Nation on Pre­scrip­tion Drugs ( Far­rar , Straus and Giroux , 2008 ) , should be required read­ing for any­one who ’s seri­ous about health­care reform .
The drug companies focus on maladies like depression and high cholesterol and anxiety — they are not interested in cures .
What is the most out­ra­geous thing you have seen while cov­er­ing the drug industry ?
I went to a con­fer­ence where the title of one talk that jumped out at me was ​ “ Cre­at­ing a Dis­ease . ”
A drug com­pa­ny exec­u­tive got up on stage with a Pow­er­Point pre­sen­ta­tion and explained how his com­pa­ny had cre­at­ed a dis­ease – over­ac­tive blad­der .
The com­pa­ny owned a pill for incon­ti­nence , but the mar­ket for incon­ti­nence is very low because most­ly elder­ly peo­ple suf­fer from it , and doc­tors try to man­age this in a non-phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal way .
Even though this drug works on your blad­der , it is very hard on your brain .
It can cause severe mem­o­ry prob­lems .
But the com­pa­ny want­ed to expand the mar­ket so it cre­at­ed this dis­ease called ​ “ over­ac­tive blad­der ” or ​ “ OAB , ” which it defined as need­ing to go to the bath­room more than nine times a day .
And now you see ads for this drug , Detrol , for over­ac­tive blad­ders .
It became a blockbuster .
As you say in the title of your book , it ’s all a huge mar­ket­ing machine .
In Europe and Cana­da they pay less for drugs and take few­er .
Two - thirds of men , women and chil­dren in the Unit­ed States take at least one pre­scrip­tion drug .
And chil­dren in the Unit­ed States are three times more like­ly to take anti-depres­sants and psy­chi­atric drugs as chil­dren in Europe .
We spend at least $ 300 bil­lion a year on pre­scrip­tion drugs .
That is about twice than what we spend on high­er education .
The Unit­ed States ranks 50th in life expectan­cy , accord­ing to the CIA .
Today a 65 - year - old Mex­i­can man will live longer than a 65 - year - old Amer­i­can man .
How impor­tant are those inter­na­tion­al comparisons ?
We are pay­ing more in health­care per per­son than any oth­er coun­try .
In our econ­o­my , almost one out of every five dol­lars is spent on health­care , and it con­tin­ues to rise at a rate greater than infla­tion .
You would think that with us spend­ing so much , we would be at the top of the life expectan­cy ranking .
The implic­it argu­ment is that in addi­tion to all the oth­er prob­lems , we are suf­fer­ing from an excess dosage of drugs .
This goes back to the mar­ket­ing .
What does the bulk of the mar­ket­ing go into ?
Most of the mar­ket­ing dol­lars are spent on physi­cians .
When the drug ads on tele­vi­sion say , ​ “ Ask your doc­tor about this drug , ” the drug com­pa­nies have already been to your physi­cian and made sure he or she was ready to pre­scribe it .
A sur­vey of physi­cians a cou­ple years ago found that more than nine out of ten had recent­ly tak­en some sort of gift or cash from the drug com­pa­nies .
And many doc­tors are tak­ing hun­dreds of thou­sands of dol­lars a year from these drug com­pa­nies , work­ing as con­sul­tants and advisers .
You write that these drug com­pa­nies are not devel­op­ing drugs that could be more use­ful in the world , but drugs that could be more prof­itable here at home .
That is one of the tragedies about this sit­u­a­tion .
The drug com­pa­nies focus on mal­adies like depres­sion and high cho­les­terol and anx­i­ety – things that impact large por­tions of the Amer­i­can pub­lic .
They are not inter­est­ed in cures , because if you cure some­body of the dis­ease they do n’t take the drug for long peri­ods of time .
And they are not inter­est­ed in trop­i­cal dis­eases like malar­ia .
Peo­ple in Africa des­per­ate­ly need med­i­cine , but the drug com­pa­nies know Africans are too poor to pay for the med­i­cines .
They want to sell drugs to Americans .
There is no incen­tive to dis­cov­er tru­ly great med­i­cines .
To get a drug through the FDA you do n’t have to prove the drug is bet­ter than a drug already on the mar­ket .
All you have to prove is the drug is bet­ter than a placebo .
In 1992 , the law changed to allow the drug com­pa­nies to pay large fees to the FDA so their drugs can be approved faster .
Before 1992 , the FDA had one cus­tomer and that was the pub­lic .
Now the FDA has two cus­tomers : the pub­lic and the drug executives .
Is the sys­tem corrupt ?
Some of these cas­es are incred­i­bly out­ra­geous .
Like Vioxx , a pain reliev­er that 20 mil­lion Amer­i­c­as took before Mer­ck took it off the mar­ket because it increased the risk of a heart attack and stroke .
The FDA esti­mat­ed that as many as 50,000 Amer­i­cans may have died from that drug .
Are there lawyers out there fight­ing the big phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal companies ?
Thou­sands of law­suits have been filed against the drug com­pa­nies .
The fed­er­al gov­ern­ment has col­lect­ed bil­lions of dol­lars from the indus­try to set­tle charges of ille­gal mar­ket­ing .
But the drug com­pa­nies just raise their prices , so they can pay out half a bil­lion dol­lars on law­suits , and con­tin­ue doing exact­ly what they have been doing .
It ’s an end­less cycle .
I think some of the top phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal exec­u­tives should face crim­i­nal charges , so they would think twice about allow­ing these fraud­u­lent practices .
There is the sug­ges­tion of sim­ply ban­ning the phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies from pay­ing off doctors .
The rule now is that the FDA will approve a drug for a cer­tain con­di­tion .
A drug can be approved for depres­sion , for instance .
And , the drug com­pa­nies are not sup­posed to mar­ket that drug for any­thing oth­er than depres­sion .
But the doc­tor can pre­scribe the drug for what­ev­er they want .
That is the loop­hole the drug com­pa­nies have tried to exploit .
For exam­ple , exec­u­tives at Warn­er - Lam­bert , which is now part of Pfiz­er , decid­ed they want­ed the doc­tors to pre­scribe the epilep­sy drug Neu­ron­tin for atten­tion deficit dis­or­der , rest­less leg dis­or­der , bipo­lar dis­or­der .
Just about any­thing that is relat­ed to the brain .
So what Pfiz­er did was invite doc­tors to din­ner .
The doc­tors were paid $ 500 to come to the din­ners and lis­ten to a speech by anoth­er physi­cian who would talk about how , even though Neu­ron­tin was approved for epilep­sy , they could also pre­scribe it for bipo­lar dis­or­der .
Neu­ron­tin was soon a bil­lion - dol­lar drug , and 90 per­cent of the pre­scrip­tions were writ­ten for things oth­er than epilepsy .
Do you know of anoth­er indus­tri­al coun­try that does not nego­ti­ate with drug com­pa­nies for bet­ter prices ?
No , the Unit­ed States is the only coun­try in the world that allows the drug com­pa­nies to charge what­ev­er they want .
You write that there are two phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal lob­by­ists for every mem­ber of Con­gress .
What are they doing on Capi­tol Hill ?
The phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal indus­try fights against any mea­sure that threat­ens its prof­its .
Present law gives the drug com­pa­nies a 20 - year patent on each drug .
Dur­ing that time , they have a monop­oly in the mar­ket .
They can charge what­ev­er they want for that drug .
They have fought against any mea­sure to allow more rea­son­able drug prices .
There was this deal report­ed , and denied , that they met with Mr. Oba­ma and he agreed to help them .
Yes , the indus­try said they met with the pres­i­dent this past sum­mer and that in this meet­ing the com­pa­nies agreed to put $ 80 bil­lion on the table .
But the drug com­pa­nies have been increas­ing prices like mad this year , so nobody is quite sure what this “ $ 80 bil­lion ” real­ly amounts to .
In exchange for this $ 80 bil­lion , the drug exec­u­tives say that the pres­i­dent agreed not to change the law to allow Medicare to use its pur­chas­ing pow­er to nego­ti­ate drug prices and also agreed not to allow drugs to come from Cana­da , which are much low­er priced .
Just for com­par­i­son , the Vet­er­ans Admin­is­tra­tion does nego­ti­ate prices .
And it gets a bet­ter deal than Medicare .
Yes , a much , much bet­ter deal .
But with that off the table , the drug com­pa­nies are set up once again .
If this health­care leg­is­la­tion pass­es they are going to get mil­lions of new patients and con­tin­ue to charge what­ev­er they wish .
Where do you think health­care reform is headed ?
We need every­one to have access to health­care .
But there is noth­ing in these bills that would con­trol costs .
It ’s not just the cost of drugs that is the prob­lem , it is the cost of every­thing .
There have been stud­ies that show one - third to as much as one - half of the costs in our health­care sys­tem are unwar­rant­ed .
Not only are many of those drugs not need­ed , they have side effects that can make peo­ple sick­er – but noth­ing in the pro­posed leg­is­la­tion makes our health­care sys­tem less expen­sive or safer .
Our whole health­care sys­tem is just dri­ven by this prof­i­teer­ing , and it ’s not just the drug com­pa­nies .
If we could get some mem­bers in Con­gress to stand up and say , ​ “ We have had enough , ” and if the pub­lic would get up and say , ​ “ We have had enough , ” maybe , Wash­ing­ton would listen .

Google support forums are awash with people looking for help for problems with their Nexus One phones — and unable to find it .
The volume of complaints points to a problem that Google faces now that it has decided to try to push a new cell - phone - buying model in the U.S.
Since most people buy subsidized phones from a mobile operator , they turn to the operator when they have problems .
But Google is selling the phone directly to end -users .
That means many users are turning to it first , and the search giant does n’t have the kind of customer support that mobile - phone users are accustomed to .
Google appears to be only accepting e-mail customer queries , to which it pledges to reply in one to two days — far too long , say most people who are complaining online .
Many people are also turning to T - Mobile and HTC , but getting little help there .
T - Mobile is often referring people back to either Google or HTC for answers to questions .
HTC is often referring people back to T - Mobile , according to complaints online .
One customer going by the name Roland78 said he was transferred between T - Mobile and HTC four times , spending a total of one - and - a - half hours on the phone with customer service .
“ T - Mobile also said Google has n’t provided them with any support documents for the phone .
Welcome to direct sales Google ! ” he wrote .
Another using the name SouthFlGuy was also sent back and forth between HTC and T - Mobile after finding no help from Google .
“ I guess I was under the wrong impression but I thought Google would handle the service on the phone , ” he wrote .
Several people on one thread regarding poor 3G performance on the phone report being told by HTC customer service people that the Nexus One does n’t support 3G , although the phone does .
Another got an e-mail response in five hours from Google suggesting that the user try restarting the phone to see if that solves the problem .
More than 425 comments are listed on a thread about service eligibility issues .
Some of them are from people who say that they ought to be eligible for the subsidized price of the phone but the Google sales site says they are n’t .
Many others are simply complaining of a policy that requires even longtime T - Mobile customers to pay more for the phone than new customers .
Yet others on the site complain about placing an order and failing to get even an order confirmation three days later .
Google , T - Mobile and HTC did not immediately reply to requests for comment .
Not So SWIFT European Parliament to Reject Bank Data Agreement with US
The European Parliament is likely to spike a deal which would allow US terrorism investigators access to European bank transfer data .
Privacy advocates oppose the deal and Germany 's Federal Criminal Police Office says the data profiling is ineffective in counterterrorism efforts .
The news reported from Haiti describes a great chaos that was to be expected , given the exceptional situation created in the aftermath of the catastrophe .
At first , a feeling of surprise , astonishment , and commotion set in .
A desire to offer immediate assistance came up in the farthest corners of the Earth .
What assistance should be sent — and how — to a Caribbean nation from China , India , Vietnam , and other countries that are tens of thousands of kilometers away ?
The magnitude of the earthquake and the poverty that exists in that country generated at first some ideas about probable needs , which gave rise to all types of pledges about possible resources , which people then tried to bring to Haiti through every possible way .
We Cubans understood that the most important thing at that moment was to save lives , and we are trained not only to cope with catastrophes like that , but also to cope with other natural catastrophes related to human health .
Hundreds of Cuban doctors were working there , along with quite a number of young Haitians of humble origin , who had become well - trained health professionals , an area in which , for many years now , we have been cooperating with that neighboring sister nation .
Some of our compatriots were on vacations , while other Haitians were being trained or studying in Cuba .
The destruction caused by the earthquake exceeded all calculations : the humble clay and adobe houses — in a city with almost two million inhabitants — could not withstand .
The solid government facilities collapsed ; entire blocks of houses crumbled over their tenants who , at that time of the day — almost at dusk — were inside their homes ; and they were all buried , dead or alive , under the rubble .
The streets were filled with people clamoring for help .
The MINUSTAH — the UN contingent — the government and the police were left without leaders or headquarters .
Soon after the earthquake , the main task of those institutions made up of thousands of personnel was to know who were still alive and where they were .
The immediate decision adopted by the dedicated Cuban doctors who were working in Haiti , as well as by the young health professionals from Haiti who had graduated in Cuba , was to establish contact among them , know about each other ’s fate , and figure out what were the resources available to assist the Haitian people in the midst of that tragedy .
The Cuban doctors who were on vacation in Cuba as well as the Haitian doctors who were taking specialized courses in our homeland immediately readied themselves to leave for Haiti .
Other Cuban surgery experts , who had accomplished difficult missions , volunteered to accompany them .
Suffice it to say that in less than 24 hours our doctors had already assisted hundreds of patients .
Today , January 16 , only three and a half days after the tragedy , there are thousands of injured people who have already been assisted by them .
Today , Saturday , at noontime , the head of our medical brigade reported to us , among other data , the following :
“. . .
[ T ]he work that is being done by our comrades is really commendable .
The general opinion is that the Pakistani earthquake has been put in the shade — that was another huge earthquake , and some of these doctors worked there .
In that country , many a time our doctors assisted patients with fractures , including poorly consolidated fractures , or patients who had been crushed .
But here reality has exceeded the imaginable : amputations abound , surgeries are being performed virtually out in the public .
This is the image they envisaged of a war . ” “. . .
The ‘ Delmas 33 Hospital ’ is already operational .
It has three operating rooms , its own power generation plants , doctors ’ consultation rooms , etcetera , but is absolutely full . ” “. . .
Twelve Chilean doctors have joined in .
One of them is an anesthesiologist .
There are also eight Venezuelan doctors and nine Spanish nuns .
It was expected that , at any moment , 18 Spaniards , to whom the UN and the Haitian Public Health authorities had handed over the control of the hospital , would come , but they lacked some emergency supplies that had not arrived , so they have decided to join us and start working immediately . ” “. . .
Thirty - two Haitian resident doctors were sent in ; six of them were going straight to Carrefour , a place that was totally devastated .
Traveling with them were also the three Cuban surgical teams that arrived here yesterday . ” “. . .
[ W ]e are operating the following medical facilities at Port - au - Prince : The Renaissance Hospital .
The Social Insurance Hospital .
The Peace Hospital . ” “. . .
Four Comprehensive Diagnostics Centers are already working . ”
This information gives only an idea of the work that is being carried out by the medical staff from Cuba and those from other countries working with them , who were among the first to arrive in that nation .
Our medical personnel are ready to cooperate and join forces with all other health specialists who have been sent to save lives in that sister nation .
Haiti could become an example of what humankind can do for itself .
The possibility and the means exist ; but willingness is missing .
The longer it takes to bury or incinerate the corpses and to distribute food and other vital supplies , the higher the risks of epidemics and social violence will be .
Haiti will put to test how much the spirit of cooperation can endure before egoism , chauvinism , petty interests , and contempt for other nations prevail .
The whole humankind is now threatened by climate change .
The earthquake at Port - au - Prince , hardly three weeks after the Copenhagen conference , is reminding all of us how selfishly and arrogantly we behaved then .
Countries are taking a close look at all that is happening in Haiti .
The world ’s public opinion and peoples ’ criticisms will be ever harsher and unforgiving .

The presence of a hard - to - detect rootkit may have caused Windows XP machines to freeze up after applying a patch from Microsoft last week , according to preliminary analysis of the problem from Microsoft 's security team .
Microsoft 's users forums filled up with reports of Windows XP users experiencing the dreaded Blue Screen of Death ( BSOD ) after applying the 13 patches released by Redmond last week .
The problem was later linked to one specific update - MS10 - 015 - a patch for an " important " kernel flaw - and it was discovered that uninstalling this package unfroze affected machines .
The Blue Screen problem affected a minority of machines but was far from isolated , with many reported cases .
Subsequent security sleuthing by sysadmin Patrick Barnes revealed that Windows XP machines that hit a brick wall after applying the update may have been infected with the TDSS rootkit .
Microsoft 's security team has since confirmed that the malware may explain the Blue Screen issue in many cases , without ruling out other possibilities .
In our continuing investigation into the restart issues related to MS10 - 015 that a limited number of customers are experiencing , we have determined that malware on the system can cause the behavior .
We are not yet ruling out other potential causes at this time and are still investigating .
Microsoft is asking affected users to send memory dumps in order to aid its ongoing investigation .
But it acknowledges this is tricky when users who hit the problem are left with unbootable machines .
Redmond 's security team suggested on Thursday that users may want to hold off on the potentially troublesome MS010 - 015 update and apply a workaround for that particular problem instead .
Sysadmins following this advice are strongly advised to apply the other 12 patches issued by Microsoft last Tuesday . ®
When the data come , the Labor Department uses them to recalibrate the monthly jobs report , meaning that many of those statistics get revised .
That 's why analysts who used to say that the economy lost 7.2 million jobs since the start of the recession in December 2007 now say that 8.4 million jobs are gone .
Also in the mix is updated population projections from the U.S. Census Bureau .
Modern operating systems understand Unicode internally , but font support for Unicode is spotty .
For an example of the problems this can cause , take a look at these screen shots of how the same Twitter message appears differently depending on what program is used to read it .
No font can display all Unicode characters .
According to Wikipedia
… it would be impossible to create such a font in any common font format , as Unicode includes over 100,000 characters , while no widely - used font format supports more than 65,535 glyphs .
However , the biggest problem is n’t the number of characters a font can display .
Most Unicode characters are quite rare .
About 30,000 characters are enough to display the vast majority of characters in use in all the world ’s languages as well as a generous selection of symbols .
However Unicode fonts vary greatly in their support even for the more commonly used ranges of characters .
See this comparison chart .
The only range completely covered by all Unicode fonts in the chart is the 128 characters of Latin Extended - A .
Unifont supports all printable characters in the basic multilingual plane , characters U+0000 through U+FFFF .
This includes the 30,000 characters mentioned above plus many more .
Unifont is n’t pretty , but it ’s complete .
As far as I know , it ’s the only font that covers the characters below U+FFFF .

Scott Ritter denies the charges against him
A former UN weapons inspector is facing charges of unlawful sexual contact with a minor after being caught in an online sex sting , court officials have said .
Scott Ritter , an outspoken critic of the war in Iraq , is alleged to have exchanged sexual messages with a police officer posing as a 15 - year - old girl .
The 48 - year - old , who resigned in 1998 after seven years as a weapons inspector , has denied the charges .
A court official said the charges were made against Mr Ritter in January .
The charges have been filed with a local court in Pennsylvania though Mr Ritter lives in New York state .
" The allegations are that the defendant exposed himself and performed a sex act over a webcam , " Deputy Assistant District Attorney Michael Rakaczewski , of Monroe County , Pennsylvania , told the BBC .
He confirmed that Mr Ritter was freed on bail after a preliminary hearing on 17 December .
A trial is expected to begin in March , he said .
If found guilty , Mr Rakaczewski said , the former weapons inspector could face up to seven years in jail .
Officials say they traced the exchange using a mobile phone he gave them , reports say .
Mr Ritter declined to comment Thursday to reporters outside his home , AP news agency said .
Our memories are strengthened during periods of rest while we are awake , researchers at New York University have found .
The findings , which appear in the latest issue of the journal Neuron , expand our understanding of how memories are boosted -- previous studies had shown this process occurs during sleep , but not during times of awake rest .
" Taking a coffee break after class can actually help you retain that information you just learned , " explained Lila Davachi , an assistant professor in NYU 's Department of Psychology and Center for Neural Science , in whose laboratory the study was conducted .
" Your brain wants you to tune out other tasks so you can tune in to what you just learned . "
The study , whose lead author was Arielle Tambini , a doctoral candidate in NYU 's Graduate School of Arts and Science , focused on memory consolidation -- the period when a memory is stabilized after it is initially created , or encoded .
To determine if memory consolidation occurred during periods of awake rest , the researchers imaged the hippocampus , a brain structure known to play a significant role in memory , and cortical regions during periods of awake rest .
Previous studies have demonstrated regions of the brain more active during periods of rest , but their function at these times had been unclear .
The NYU experiment tested subjects ' associative memory by showing them pairs of images containing a human face and an object ( e.g. , a beach ball ) or a human face and a scene ( e.g. , a beach ) followed by periods of awake rest .
Subjects were not informed their memory for these images would later be tested , but , rather , were instructed to rest and simply think about anything that they wanted , but to remain awake during the resting periods .
The researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) to gauge activity in the hippocampus and cortical regions during the task and during the ensuing rest period .
The experiment yielded two noteworthy results .
First , the researchers found that during rest after the study experience ( after the visuals were shown ) , there was a significant correlation between brain activity in the subjects ' hippocampus and cortical regions that were active during the initial encoding of each stimulus pair .
However , this boost in brain correlations was only seen following experiences that were later memorable suggesting these parts of the brain act in tandem for a purpose -- to consolidate memories during rest .
Second , when examining each subject individually , it was found that subjects who had greater resting correlations between the hippocampus and cortex , also exhibited better performance on a subsequent associative memory test and those whose brain correlations were weaker , had worse memory -- in other words , the greater the activity in hippocampus and cortical regions , the stronger the memory .
" Your brain is working for you when you 're resting , so rest is important for memory and cognitive function , " Davachi observed .
" This is something we do n't appreciate much , especially when today 's information technologies keep us working round - the - clock . "
The study 's other co-author was Nicholas Ketz , a researcher assistant in the Department of Psychology .
The research was supported by a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health and Dart Neuroscience .
KDE 's Security Policy has had a small update .
The change is as follows :
Information about security vulnerabilities will no longer be published via the Dot at http://dot.kde.org.
This change was made to reflect actual practices .
Although the security policy has stated that security information would be published via the Dot , a review has shown that this has rarely occurred due to confusion as to whether the Dot is the appropriate venue for this information .
This can mislead users into believing that following the Dot provides them with pertinent security information .
Most users obtain KDE via distributions , which receive advance notification of security information via the private KDE Packagers mailing list .
For those that compile from source , or who are simply interested in knowing about security vulnerabilities in KDE software , this information is already disseminated via two public venues : the kde - announce mailing list and the BugTraq full disclosure list .
As always , we ask users with information about possible security vulnerabilities to responsibly disclose this information to the security team at securi[ email protected ] e.org , so that patches can be readied before public disclosure .
Microsoft is n't having an easy time of it these days .
In addition to the unpatched hole in Internet Explorer , a now published hole in Windows allows users with restricted access to escalate their privileges to system level – and this is believed to be possible on all 32 - bit versions of Windows from Windows NT 3.1 up to , and including Windows 7 .
While the vulnerability is likely to affect home users in only a minor way , the administrators of corporate networks will probably have their hands full this week .
The problem is caused by flaws in the Virtual DOS Machine ( VDM ) introduced in 1993 to support 16 - bit applications ( real mode applications for 8086 ) .
VDM is based on the Virtual 8086 Mode ( VM86 ) in 80386 processors and , among other things , intercepts hardware routines such as BIOS calls .
Google security team member Tavis Ormandy has found several vulnerabilities in this implementation that allow an unprivileged 16 - bit program to manipulate the kernel stack of each process via a number of tricks .
This potentially enables attackers to execute code at system privilege level .
Ormandy has also published a suitable exploit which functions under Windows XP , Windows Server 2003 and 2008 , Windows Vista and Windows 7 .
When tested by the The H's associates at heise Security , the exploit opened a command prompt in the system context , which has the highest privilege level , under Windows XP and Windows 7 .
No patch has become available , although Ormandy reports that Microsoft was already informed of the hole in mid 2009 .
The developer decided to publish the information regardless because , in his opinion , there is a simple workaround : to disable the MS - DOS subsystem .
The workaround requires users to start the group policy editor and enable the " Prevent access to 16 - bit applications " option in the Computer Configuration \Administrative Templates \Windows Components \Application Compatibility section .
When tested with these settings by the heise Security team , the exploit no longer functioned .
The settings reportedly do n't cause any major compatibility problems for most users while no 16 - bit applications are being used .
Update -
The above option is only available through the group policy editor on Windows 2003 systems .
Some versions of Windows do not include a group policy editor .
As an alternative , users can also create a registry key under \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \SOFTWARE \Policies \Microsoft \Windows \AppCompat with a D - Word value of VDMDissallowed = 1 . Under Windows XP , to prevent the system from being vulnerable to the exploit , users can place the following text :
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[ HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies \Microsoft\Windows \AppCompat ]
" VDMDisallowed " =dword:00000001
into a file called vdmdisallow.reg and double click the file .
Windows will then automatically import the key ( admin rights are required to perform this action ) .
Update 2 - Microsoft has now confirmed the privilege escalation hole in Windows .
The company says that it wants to complete its investigation of the vulnerability and will then decide whether , how and when to close it .

One of Glenn Beck 's favorite claims about the Tea Party movement -- and the surge of right - wing populism that he 's leading -- is that it is n't about parties , it 's about being American .
And being American , of course , means being conservative .
He was on this briefly again last night :
Beck :
Well , the media may be surprised , but I 'm not .
I think the days when people vote for Democrats or Republicans no matter what -- you know , if it 's an R or a D , I 'm just gonna pull it -- I think we 're seeing the end of those days .
For so long , we 've bought into the Rs and the Ds -- you know , we 're really at a one - party system at this point .
We needed to identify ourselves as one or the other , even though it did n't really make a difference .
And that label was much more important than the real label we all should have been wearing , and that is , American .
Progressives have put their agenda now into hyperdrive , and it is so crystal clear that their final goal is anything but American .
This claim -- to represent the real America , one that transcends political parties -- is the historic claim of right - wing populists throughout history .
Compare Beck 's rant last night with this remarkably similar rant from Father Charles Coughlin , the renowned anti-Semitic radio preacher , in 1936 :
And yes , Glenn Beck shares Coughlin 's views on the Federal Reserve , too .
A classic population explosion novel , Robert Silverberg 's The World Inside , with a contrarian point of view and lots of sex , will soon return to print — and could be the subject of an upcoming HBO series .

The writer Robert Silverberg absolutely tore through through the sf world in the early ' 70s , writing so much good stuff — Dying Inside and The Book of Skulls among them — he became hard to keep up with .
He 's fallen out of fashion , but some of this work has been slowly returning to print , and now Tor will reissue 1971's The World Inside in March .
Silverberg calls the the book " a satire or a speculation , " and told io9 :
It 's a group of interlocking stories , with interwoven characters , set in a world about 300 yes in the future , in which to provide farmland for the enormous population , everyone lives in 800 - story apartment complexes .
They have their own sexual mores :
People move from floor to floor in these giant buildings , searching for partners , and it 's improper to refuse .

In the late ' 60s / early '70s there was a slew of sf novels about population anxiety , among them Brunner 's Stand on Zanzibar , Harry Harrison 's Make Room , Make Room ( which became the 1973 film Soylent Green ) and Disch 's 334 .
Stanford biologust Paul Ehrlich became famous for his 1968 book The Population Bomb .
Continues Silverberg :
Everybody dreaded the coming Calcutta - fication of the world .
( It did n't quite work out that way , at least not in the First World . )
I said , Instead of writing an anti-population - explosion tract , I will depict a happily overpopulated world , and from the inside to let the reader see what it 's like to live there — a world in which people have adapted .

The writer 's renaissance — he says he 's still recovering from a period 20 years ago when publishers wanted nothing but " commercial schlock ... pirates in space " — may reach beyond the book world :
As for the HBO series , Silverberg is not one to get his hopes up on adaptations , but he 's optimistic about this one : " They keep paying me , so they must still be planning on making it .
It could turn into Deadwood or The Sopranos — it would find a whole new audience . "
Could your home network be taken over remotely ?
What 's going on here ?
During our development of GRC 's comprehensive DNS nameserver spoofability profiling system , we discovered something quite unexpected : A number of users were losing all Internet connectivity shortly after initiating the nameserver profiling .
Upon further examination they discovered that the test was crashing their consumer NAT routers .
The following routers are currently known to be susceptible to crashing under this test :
DNS Test “ Crashable ” NAT Routers • 3Com 3CR858-91 OfficeConnect Ethernet Broadband Router • 3Com 3CRWDR100A -72 OfficeConnect ADSL Wireless 11g Firewall Router • A - Link RR24AP ( i+ ) with latest firmware at time of crash report • Belkin F5D7234 - 4 v3 ( 01 ) Wireless G Router ( firmware 3.00.3 ) • Belkin F5D7234-4 v4 ( 01 ) Firmware v4.00.05 • Belkin F5D7630 - 4A ( rebranded as MicraDigital ) • Belkin F5D8236 - 4 v2 Wireless N Router • Belkin F5D8636 - 4 v2 Wireless N Router • Belkin F7D2301 v1 ( 01 ) Wireless N Router • Ozenda AR4505GW • Philips SNA6500 ADSL Wireless Base Station • Siemens Gigaset SX551 WLAN DSL
Okay , that 's annoying , but why is it a concern ?
What this means is that the Internet data packets entering these routers from the outside are , in some way , something that the router does not currently handle properly — so the router crashes .
The development of virtually all successful remote Internet exploits begins when someone notices that something unexpectedly crashes a system .
This is typically evidence of a previously unknown “ buffer overrun ” or “ unchecked buffer ” vulnerability in the affected device .
Armed with the knowledge of the existence of such a possible vulnerability , skilled hackers — and make no mistake about it , these people are highly skilled — are often able to refine the characteristics of the “ crashing packet ” to cause the affected system to execute code they provide in a some sophisticated version of that packet .
And , with that , the minor annoyance that once crashed a router when running
GRC 's DNS test evolves into a full blown exploit that allows a remote hacker to
take control of the network that was previously protected by that router .
PLEASE CAREFULLY NOTE what we are and are not explicitly stating about this potential for a remotely exploitable vulnerability :
We are NOT stating that any of the routers which our test causes to crash have any discoverable remotely exploitable vulnerability .

stating that any newly discovered crash , exactly like this , provides the sort of window of opportunity that talented hackers live for .
We WILL NOT be surprised to learn that this revelation results in the creation and exploitation of any of the routers listed above .
It might very well be that the inherent behavior of NAT routers , whereby they simply ignore and drop unsolicited packets coming in from the Internet , wouldmitigate any danger from the fact that expected and solicited packets — such as those occurring during our test — are able to crash the router .
In other words , your router is crashable and potentially vulnerableit is in the process of running this test which was initiated by you “ on the inside ” from behind your router 's inherent protection .
Having said that , however , it might also be that any exposed ports in a router , such as those created by explicit port forwarding or the use of a router 's “ DMZ ” forwarding capability , would once again expose the router to DNS packets it appears to be unable to safely digest .
Two Worrisome Scenarios :
You already know and trust us — that 's why you 're here .
You know that GRC are the good guys .
But imagine for a moment if we were n't :
We have a simple web - based test that currently only crashes your router .
It does so through the simplest everyday occurrence of having your web browser lookup the IP address of an unknown domain name .
Easy , right ?
And that 's as far as we have taken it , because our interest is limited to letting you know , and helping you to get your router fixed .
We have no interest in using our test to take over your router and gain unsolicited access to your network .
Really we do n't .
Really .
But even if it turns out , as currently seems likely , that crashable routers are only vulnerable to solicited DNS replies , it does appear to be very likely that additional research could turn this “ solicited crashing behavior ” into “ solicited remote exploitation . ”
Here are two worrisome ways this could be done :
You innocently visit a malicious web site that causes your web browser to solicit the IP address from a malicious DNS server that takes over your router .
No personal firewall would prevent that , since it starts as a simple and valid DNS domain name lookup .
But in soliciting the IP address of that malicious domain , the returning packet does n't crash your router , it takes it over .
Perhaps it enables remote WAN - side management , opens a port , removes the logon password , aims the router 's DMZ at your main machine , or anything of the sort .
That 's worrisome .
Now take the case of a shared public network behind a consumer - grade router such as any wireless hotspot , hotel or other shared network .
A bad guy sitting anywhere inside the network , in a cafe or hotel lobby , identifies the router by looking at its logon page or by broadcasting a UPnP ( universal plug'n play ) query .
Now he knows which router he 's dealing with and in exactly what way its vulnerable ( if it is ) to a solicited DNS reply .
So he sends his DNS server out on the Internet a DNS query . . . and when the publicly shared router receives his specially crafted reply he “ owns ” the router ( in hacker parlance ) .
That 's worrisome too .
It 's pretty clear that we need to get these
routers fixed . . . and sooner rather than later .
What can , and should , you do if you have a crashable router ?
Complain loudly to your router 's manufacturer :
One advantage of this publicly available router crashability test is that any router manufacturer can easily use it to reproduce and fix their defective router firmware .
( And yes , we realize that the downside is that the bad guys can also use it to figure out what 's happening and possibly design a potent exploit .
This is the common tradeoff when publicly and openly dealing with Internet troubles . )

Do n't panic :
Yes , there 's significant potential for trouble here , but please remember that it 's only potential at this time , even if it is significant .
That 's still very different from confirmed trouble .
Please do n't confuse the two .
At the moment , there 's every reason to believe that only solicited packets arriving during GRC's DNS test can cause a router to crash .
Unexpected ( unsolicited ) incoming packets will simply be dropped , no matter what payload they carry .
It seems quite likely that it is the act of the router actively dealing with and digesting the incoming DNS packet that 's causing trouble .
Without knowing the exact nature of the trouble for each router , it 's impossible to say for sure .
With the exception of “ evil web sites ” such as we outlined in the box above , this is not panic - worthy at this time .
Yes , there 's significant potential for trouble here , but please remember that it 's only at this time , even if it is significant .

Unexpected ( unsolicited ) incoming packets will simply be dropped , no matter what payload they carry .
It seems quite likely that it is the act of the router actively dealing with and digesting the incoming DNS packet that 's causing trouble .
Without knowing the exact nature of the trouble for each router , it 's impossible to say for sure .
With the exception of “ evil web sites ” such as we outlined in the box above , this is not panic - worthy at this time .
If your router crashes and it is NOT already on this list :
Given that so many defective routers were discovered by a relatively small testing group , we fully expect to discover that many more routers are crashable .
Therefore , if you discover a crashable router that is not listed above , please notify us immediately using our feedback page with this link or the link below .
Our best option is to bring this problem to the attention of the broader Internet community so that users can notify their router manufacturers , and those manufacturers can repeat the behavior , observe the trouble , and fix their defective firmware promptly .
The more pressure that 's brought to bear by their customers , the faster the manufacturers are likely to respond .
So please help us to list any additional routers you discover .
This will also help to protect anyone else who may be using the same router .

If your router IS on the list and DOES NOT crash :
We need to know that too , so that we can maintain an accurate list of currently crashable routers .
Once manufacturers have repaired their firmware , we 'll want to make note of that fact so that users of still - defective firmware — and then needlessly crashable routers — can update their router 's firmware then use this test to verify that their router is repaired .

If a router YOU DO NOT OWN crashes :
As we detailed in the box above , we recognize that this trouble may be widespread enough that routers on “ borrowed networks ” — such as at wireless hotspots , in hotels , or other communal settings — could unfortunately and inadvertently be brought down by the use of this inherently benign DNS - based test .
That is a risk created by a public test such as this , benign though it is .
However , this trouble was first discovered publicly through public tests on GRC 's newsgroups , so those horses have left the barn and are roaming freely .
The best course of action now is to get all crashable routers repaired — especially if this trouble does extend beyond simple crashability .
So please also let us know if you discover crashability on such borrowed networks .
We probably wo n't share the information , except very generally .
But it could be important to know that it is happening .
So now you know as much as we do about this intriguing issue .
But you may not know whether you have a crashable router .

At first , voters seemed not to be much bothered by the financial scandal because much of the money came from Mr. Hatoyama or his mother , a wealthy heiress .
But now , analysts say , it is precisely that explanation that is starting to cool public opinion of the prime minister .
By highlighting the considerable wealth of his family , the scandal is starting to raise doubts about how in touch he is with the worsening economic plight of average Japanese .
According to reports in Japanese newspapers , Mr. Hatoyama will soon deliver a written statement to Tokyo prosecutors in which he will deny knowledge of some $ 4 million in donations that prosecutors say were improperly reported , sometimes in the names of dead people .
The reports say he will also tell prosecutors that he did not know of millions of dollars more that his group received from his mother .
Mr. Hatoyama ’s office said it had no knowledge of the statement .
The reports said that prosecutors were considering whether to charge one of Mr. Hatoyama ’s former political secretaries for misreporting the funds , but that they would not charge the prime minister with a crime .
Still , just the fact that Mr. Hatoyama could get mired in such a campaign finance scandal has already hurt his credibility as a reformer , analysts say .
Polls show that Mr. Hatoyama ’s approval ratings are slipping from their highs of more than 70 percent after he took office in September .
A poll released Monday by Japan ’s national public broadcasting corporation , NHK , found that 56 percent of 1,111 voters questioned by telephone from Dec. 11 to 13 said they approved of him , with 34 percent saying they did not approve .
The poll gave no margin of error , as is customary here .
BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - General Motors GM.UL will present a plan to European governments to save struggling carmaker Opel within days , a rescue set to cost 3.3 billion euros ( $ 4.9 billion ) , those involved in talks said on Monday .

GM this month backtracked on plans to sell Opel to a consortium led by carparts firm Magna MGa .
TO -- a deal that involved government aid -- but is now turning again to European states for help to keep Opel in business .
Opel interim Chief Executive Nick Reilly travelled to Brussels on Monday to meet officials including German Deputy Economy Minister Jochen Homann and Kris Peeters , the premier of Flanders , a Belgian region where Opel has a plant .
The meeting was also attended by European Union Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes , whose blessing is needed before any state can give financial aid , as well as the bloc ’s industry commissioner , Guenter Verheugen .
Coming out of talks , Peeters said General Motors would present a restructuring plan for Opel to European governments by the end of the week and that European officials would discuss possible aid on December 4 .
GM ’s Reilly earlier put a cost of 3.3 billion euros on the rescue , saying : “ We have indicated that we will inject some GM funds into that requirement too .
“ That is quite difficult because we are also going through a restructuring of our U.S. operations and other parts of the world , ” he said .
On Monday , the EU ’s industry commissioner said that without state aid , the plan could not work .
“ General Motors made one point very clear , 100 percent clear , the restructuring plan could only be achieved when European member states with Opel plants give some financial help , ” said Verheugen .
“ So the plan works only with state aid .
The idea that General Motors can finance this on its own was not shared by General Motors , this possibility does unfortunately not exist . ”
Reilly said GM intended to disclose details of its plan to workers and has set up meetings with works councils later this week .
Opel has struggled with slumping global demand as competition in the overcrowded car market remains cut - throat , the same problems that pushed parent General Motors into bankruptcy .
GM ’s core businesses have been stripped out and moved into a holding company .
It had nearly $ 43 billion in cash in September after emerging from bankruptcy in July thanks to a $ 50 billion package that made the United States a 61 percent owner .
We spent most of yesterday converting the Olympic Weightlifting area at NorCal Strength and Conditioning to a multi-drumset , multi-media headquarters for the upcoming Guinness Book of World Records attempt .
Most of you might recall that Lou Mars has been training for over three months to prepare for his bid to break the Marathon Drumming record which is currently set at 120 hrs .
Lou has been training at NorCal , has been eating food provided by Paleo Brands and in the process has lost nearly 30 lbs while dramatically improving his fitness .
Lou wanted to do this for two reasons :
1 - He wanted to prove that scientific training and nutrition can dramatically improve the ability of musicians to perform at their absolute best .
Lou feels that he is , quite literally , in the “ best shape of his life ” .
2 - Lou was a hyper- active youth and by some stroke of genius someone set him free on a drum set .
Drumming was both an outlet and a focus which has driven his very successful life .
Lou is concerned that many kids never get an opportunity to channel their energies in the way he did so he teamed with Dixon Drums and Little Kids Rock to do something about it .
Dixon has donated a set of Dixon Demon Urban Camo drums !
This set is valued at $ 2,300 and it will be the set that Lou breaks the world record on .
Here is how you can help and have a chance to win a piece of history .
Make a Donation and get entered to win the Drums .
All proceeds go to Little Kids Rock .
It ’s that easy !
We will kick things off at 7:30 am ( PST ) , this Thursday , January 14th .
Lou will be streamed live so you can follow his progress and ask him questions or just lend your support .
I ’ll get those links us just as soon as they are live .
From the BBC , apparently Copenhagen is falling apart :
By Richard Black Environment correspondent , BBC News website , Copenhagen
Excerpts :
The African delegation is unhappy over moves by the Danish government
Negotiations at the UN climate summit have been suspended after developing countries withdrew their co-operation .
Delegations were angry at what they saw as moves by the Danish host government to sideline talks on more emission cuts under the Kyoto Protocol .
As news spread around the conference centre , activists chanted “ We stand with Africa – Kyoto targets now ” .
Informal talks continue , and the UN climate convention head said the formal agenda should resume in the afternoon .
Blocs representing poor countries vulnerable to climate change have been adamant that rich nations must commit to emission cuts beyond 2012 under the Kyoto Protocol .
But the EU and the developed world in general has promoted the idea of an entirely new agreement , replacing the protocol .
…
Last week , the Pacific island nation of Tuvalu forced a suspension after insisting that proposals to amend the UN climate convention and Kyoto Protocol be debated in full .
“ The point is being made very loudly that African countries and the wider G77 bloc will not accept non-action on the Kyoto Protocol , and they ’re really afraid that a deal has been stitched up behind their backs , ” he told BBC News .
=========
Hmmm .
Ya think ?
This story earlier on WUWT certainly suggests something was indeed “ stitched up ” :

A World Without Bernanke
On Thursday , the U.S. Senate expects to vote on whether to approve Ben Bernanke for a second term as chairman of the Federal Reserve .
President Barack Obama strongly backs the Bush appointee , the architect of the Fed ’s dramatic trillion - dollar expansion in the wake of the financial crisis .
But some members of Congress have n’t been so supportive .
A strange - bedfellows coalition of senators — everyone from social democrat Bernie Sanders to archconservative Jim DeMint , with heavyweights Barbara Boxer and John McCain in between — has said no to Ben .
At last count , not enough senators had agreed to vote for Bernanke , raising the question :
If not him , then who ?
With Bernanke ’s term rapidly drawing to a close and the U.S. economy still fragile , his supporters warn that failing to re-up the chairman would be a disaster .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner predicted Wall Street would " view [ the failure to reconfirm ] as a very troubling thing to the economy as a whole . "
But plausible replacements do exist .
Tim Duy , a University of Oregon economist and specialist on Fed policy , notes , " You ’re dragging old names out of the hat , " predicting the White House would likely choose a familiar and safe candidate to avoid a long nomination battle and placate markets spooked by the Bernanke fracas .
Two economists often mentioned for the top
Fed gig are members of the administration : Larry Summers , director of Obama ’s National Economic Council , and Christina Romer , chair of the Council of Economic Advisers ( CEA ) .
Romer is a scholar of the Great Depression , like Bernanke , and a longtime academic at the University of California , Berkeley .
Summers , a former Harvard University president and treasury secretary , has guided the president ’s economic recovery plans .
The nomination of either seems remote .
Summers , who was famously ousted by Harvard ’s faculty after musing that women are inferior at science , took a multimillion - dollar paycheck from the hedge fund D.E.
Shaw before joining the administration , making him too tainted by Wall Street to put before a confirmation hearing , particularly with Congress on an anti-bank bent .
Plus , many view Romer and Summers as too tied to the politics of the Oval Office at this time .
From the ivory tower , frontrunners include David Romer , the CEA chair ’s husband and a fellow Berkeley - ite , and Alan Blinder , a Princeton University academic and former Fed vice chair .
Both are lauded economists with experience working in and advising Washington .
Romer is a " new Keynesian " who has written extensively on the Fed and its ability to aid the economy — including a paper , co-written with his wife , on how to pick a good Fed chair .
( Both Romers say Bernanke was a perfect selection . )
Blinder also writes extensively on central banking ; Paul Krugman , the Nobel laureate and influential economic commentator for the New York Times , cited him in a recent column as a likely candidate .
Romer and Blinder are considered the most probable appointments to the two open seats on the Fed board , and thus to the powerful Federal Open Market Committee , which sets the Fed ’s interest - rate policies .
Many also look within the Fed itself for alternatives .
Janet Yellen , a former academic and the president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank , is tipped as the most likely to become Fed chair should Bernanke withdraw or fail to win confirmation .
Yellen is considered the most dovish of the governors — i.e. , more focused on the near - term problem of double - digit unemployment than she is on the longer - term problem of inflation .
Yellen , unlike some other possible candidates , wins plaudits from economic commentators on the left and the right .
Dean Baker , who co-directs the influential liberal think tank the Center for Economic and Policy Research , names Yellen as his first choice should Bernanke fail .
Kevin Hassett , director of economic policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute and a former Fed economist , also sings her praises .
" She ’s very popular , very brilliant , and often thought of " as a potential Fed leader , he says .
Another possibility is Donald Kohn , the Fed ’s current vice chairman .
The Obama administration probably would n’t nominate Kohn , who has worked for the Federal Reserve since 1970 , for Bernanke ’s job .
But the Fed veteran is likely to become chair on an ad hoc basis should the confirmation drag on .
( The regulations on Fed succession are n’t perfectly clear , but Sen. Christopher Dodd , who chairs the Senate Banking Committee , has said he supports making Kohn acting head . )
And drag on it might : Bernanke might be filibustered tomorrow , Democrats might not be able to scare up enough votes to shut off debate , and the White House might decide against spending any political capital on his nomination , no matter how much Wall Street and market experts might protest .
But Fed watchers note that his ouster would be backward - facing , punishment for missing the housing bubble rather than a statement of concern over the Fed policies he has said he will pursue in the next months , including unwinding emergency measures and leaving interest rates near zero .
Those are policies all of the candidates mentioned have supported — and policies it seems likely that , after dodging a few more javelins on Capitol Hill , Bernanke will be the man to carry on .
The New York Times reports that former Governor and vice president candidate Sarah Palin signed on as a contributor to the Fox News Channel .
Fox News ' popular hosts and contributors are part of what pulls them ahead of CNN , MSNBC and other network news sites .
Jim Rutenberg in NYT : Ms. Palin will not have her own regular program , one person familiar with the deal said , though she will host an occasional series that will run on the network from time to time .
This person would not elaborate , but the network does have a precedent for such a series .
Oliver L. North is the host of an occasionally running documentary series on the military called “ War Stories . ”
Fox News is set to officially announce the news later today .
UPDATE : In their official release , Fox News says Palin will provide political commentary and analysis for FOX News .
She will also host periodic episodes of Real American Stories , a new series that will explore inspirational real - life tales of overcoming adversity throughout the American landscape that will debut in 2010 .
Palin said in the statement :
" It ’s wonderful to be part of a place that so values fair and balanced news .
She should feel at home in front of the TV news cameras .
She was once TV sports reporter for NBC in the late 80s .
Here 's an old video of Palin 's reporting skills , from a 1988 broadcast .

CHICAGO , Ill . –
In an effort to boost local and statewide economic development Gov. Pat Quinn and U.S. Senate Majority Leader Dick Durbin , D - Ill. , said they are committed to improving passenger and freight rail operations in Illinois .
Their initiatives include high - speed rail and making Illinois an inland port and transportation hub for the Midwest .
Both Quinn and Durbin led talks at “ Beyond Transportation : The Economic Impact of Rail in Illinois , ” a summit last week where they pledged to develop high - speed rail and improving current rail infrastructure as priorities .
Both said they would continue advocating for much - needed economic development and creating green jobs across the state through plans for high - speed rail .
The event brought together experts from across the country to discuss a rail policy and economic development .
Several panel discussions were held on local development , sustainability , manufacturing and connectivity in the global economy .
“ One of the most important contributions the freight and passenger rail industries provide to Illinois is good - paying jobs that support families and help pay for college , ” said Durbin .
“ For that reason and many others , we need to invest in rail as we strengthen our nation ’s economy . ”
Durbin said the ideas shared at the summit would help keep Illinois at the forefront of the railroad renaissance the state ’s currently undergoing .
Rick Harnish is the executive director of the Midwest High Speed Rail Association , which represents Illinois , Missouri and seven other states .
Speaking to the World by phone , Harnish said he welcomes Quinn and Durbin ’s initiatives .
Quinn is the first Midwest governor to support trains that would travel at speeds of 220 miles an hour , he notes .
“ Most travel by people is done by cars these days but it ’s expensive and slow , ” said Harnish .
“ If we build faster trains people will have the advantages of lower costs and quicker travel times . ”
Harnish adds it ’s important that Quinn and Durbin are taking a strong leadership role on this issue .
“ It ’s critical to our economic future , ” he said .
“ The big picture is that we ’re very spread out and trains have the ability to bring people together . ”
Using trains rather than cars or airplanes is less expensive , better for the environment and limits travel times , said Harnish .
Plus it ’s more productive and innovative , he notes .
At the same time , trains connect people to the international community coming and going from Chicago ’s O’Hare International Airport , he adds .
“ Trains are about 10 times more efficient than using automobiles and are a lot better for the atmosphere , ” he said .
“ It really makes a huge difference when people use trains . ”
High - speed trains would build stronger local communities and allows people to walk more , said Harnish .
But we have to start planning now , he says .
“ It ’s critical to continue urging lawmakers to support investing in high - speed rail . ”
Supporters of the track and train upgrades say building faster and more efficient trains is beyond transportation , it ’s about building communities , they note .
Under the Midwest plan , Chicago would be a transportation hub connecting major cities including St. Louis , Detroit , Milwaukee , Minneapolis , Cleveland and Cincinnati .
President Barack Obama and Congress have voiced their support and recently appropriated $ 8 billion to improve rail service and another $ 5 billion for high - speed rail .
The amount of funds will be awarded to states sometime before the spring .
Illinois has submitted two rounds of applications for up to $ 3 billion in federal stimulus funding from the U.S. department of Transportation for high - speed rail .
Illinois and nearby states are hoping to receive a major portion of the funding to upgrade track and other infrastructure for 110 - mph train service starting in the next three to five years .
Additionally , through the Illinois Jobs Now !
Plan , the state is poised to make the largest investment in rail infrastructure in the Illinois ’ history .
Long - term plans in Illinois call for trains traveling at up to 220 mph .

Avatar was the landmark stereo film of the modern era , taking 3D technology to new heights , and changing the way many people thought about 3D film and visual effects .
Weta Digital developed a new generation of visual - effects techniques to realise this ambitious film .
As well as bringing about huge innovations in real - time performance capture , facial rigging , 3D animation and compositing - the scale , detail , and complexity of Avatar showed that computer generated filmmaking had reached the point where it could carry the story , and maintain suspension of disbelief , through an entire movie .
In addition to the Academy Award® for Visual Effects , the film won Weta Digital six Visual Effects Society awards , including the VES equivalent of a best picture race – Outstanding Visual Effects in a Visual Effects - Driven Feature Motion Picture .
What Weta Digital built and what they learned on Avatar changed the way Weta Digital approached visual effects , and its impact is still being felt to this day .

Recently , the " China National Defense News , " revealed the Second Artillery missile forces to build an underground cavern of the situation , the text quoted Western experts say China 's underground missile base projection can withstand hundreds of thousands of tons equivalent rounds of nuclear bombs hit a row .
This article raises the heat outside media , discussion , media analysis of China 's such a deep way of actually higher than Russia and the United States to deploy a missile more accurate .
Chinese media have dared to publish these are called " Underground Great Wall " of the strategic facilities showed that the Chinese system of its nuclear operations with unprecedented confidence and courage .
" China National Defense News "
In related news , wrote , " This is only as bright as day light and never be more than the general color of camouflage in general . "
Here is the Second Artillery Force is an engineering construction of a missile positions , it is often called here for " underground Great Wall . "
Then , directly quoting a foreign newspaper reports that Western experts had estimated that China 's Second Artillery missile positions are very strong , " if used ground - penetrating nuclear warheads to China 's missile attack positions , then we will need a few pieces of hundreds of thousands of tons equivalent Continuous nuclear warheads before they hit the same point breakdown , instead of the completely destroyed , the need for more nuclear warheads " and so on .
Ta Kung Pao , a magazine , a signed article also describes the status of the Second Artillery underground positions .
The article said that China 's early adoption of a permanent - type medium - range ballistic missiles deployed on the ground positions , while the first intercontinental missiles ─ ─ Dongfeng - 5 reinforced silo is used to deploy .
China to begin deploying in 1979 , Dongfeng - 5 missiles , its true or a total of 24 silos , but these protective measures in an increasingly sophisticated reconnaissance satellites and increasingly precise stand - off missile attacks , appeared before the no longer valid .
If the reinforced missile silo can not ensure safety , then completely buried in the launch position a few hundred meters underground , apparently the Second Artillery considered to be viable option .
As early as the summer of 1995 , " Liberation Army Daily , " a prominent message is not mentioned at tens of thousands of officers and men of the Second Artillery Corps after 10 years of bloody fighting , we finally completed a major defense projects .
March 24 , 2008 , China Central Television " military documentary " program would work in this part of the exposure of underground nuclear counterattack , outsiders called the " Great Wall Project . "
Tunnel length of more than 5000 kilometers
Analysts believe that strong and hidden " underground Great Wall " of China to save the " second nuclear strike " capability of the important means .
As China pursues a " no first use of nuclear weapons " policy , and how to ensure that minimum deterrence in the number of intercontinental missiles able to escape after the successful launch of enemy attack and successfully penetrate the enemy 's missile defense system will be thrown into the targeting of nuclear warheads on the China 's Second Artillery 's most important task .
Although the United States and Russia 's preference for low - cost land - based intercontinental missiles fired , the road mobile missile normally performed by transportation , erection , launching three cars to carry the implementation of road mobility , but such missiles are often self - positioning apparatus is relatively simple , relatively hasty pre-launch preparation time
Therefore , a precision strike missiles fired from fixed positions was significantly lower than firing missiles , such as the Russian Topol - M intercontinental ballistic missiles launched from the underground when the accuracy is about 260 meters , but the road maneuver increased to 450 meters .
The launch of the mobile security and accuracy of integrated fixed - fired a " deep deployment " approach , then the choice of China 's Second Artillery Corps .
The so - called deep deployment of strategic nuclear missiles , is usually a few hundred meters deep drilled " underground home " , the missile can be in the ground to complete all preparedness activities , war may be relying on underground network corridor from rail cars or heavy - duty trailer transporting missiles , equipment and personnel to a fixed launch sites in place , and all this only from the observations can not be found on the ground .
Experts speculate that China 's Second Artillery Corps of the most important underground missile positions may be located in a mountainous area in northern China , the internal tunnel over a total length of 5000 km , strategic ballistic missiles in this " underground labyrinth " in mobile deployment , and from hundreds of true and false mixed groups in the underground launch silo .
It is estimated that the nuclear counter - attack project , " the outermost layer of 1000 meters deep and covered with soil that does not include any artificial reinforcement layer " , " missile launch , generally not in the cave launch is to pull the hole ... ...
All firing points are fixed . "
The U.S. media said that a small number of Chinese nuclear weapons
Global Times Zhaibian the United States , " Bulletin of Atomic Scientists " ( BuletinoftheAtomicScientists ) website published December 8 , " Nuclear weapons : a modern myth , " the article , saying that China now has approximately 200 - 250 nuclear warheads , nuclear weapons , but China and Russia will not pose threat , nor will it shake the U.S. nuclear dominance .
The article said that the United States deployed a total of about 2,200 strategic nuclear warheads and 500 tactical nuclear warheads , while there are 2500 stocks of nuclear warheads .
The U.S. submarine - launched missiles and ground - based long - range missiles now under way to extend the life of the project .
For example , the Air Force will spend the next 10 years , six billion U.S. dollars to enhance the reliability of missiles and missile militias Ⅲ extend the life of 2030 .
From 1997 to 2001 , the United States has produced and deployed a new type of B6 nuclear bomb , which is known outside the B61 - 11 earth - penetrating nuclear bombs .
After the Cold War , the U.S. submarine - launched missiles to destroy the Russian missile silos the success rate of only 12 % , and now , W76 and W88 submarine - launched missiles to destroy the Russian silos , respectively , the success rate of 90 % and 98 % .
China 's nuclear arsenal includes about 200 to 250 strategic nuclear warheads .
China is also expanding nuclear arsenal , but it should be far less than the U.S. intelligence agencies estimated that the speed , the latter always like to overestimate the speed of the PLA 's modernization project and content .
China 's new delivery systems , including solid - fuel - driven DF - 31 long - range missiles , deployed in 2008 , put into DF - 31A intercontinental ballistic missiles and the JL - 2 submarine - launched nuclear missiles .
The development and deployment of these systems are surprisingly very slow pace : China in the last century , seven or eight decades decided to replace the old with the solid - fuel systems of liquid fuel systems , however , have only recently begun to deploy them .
China has a " summer class " strategic missile submarines .
In addition , the outside world believe that China in early 2008 the deployment of a new " promotion " and nuclear submarines , and another 2 - 3 " promotion " and nuclear submarines are still under construction .
However , China will be how to operate the sea - based missile defense system , is still unclear .
Chinese ballistic missile submarine had not conducted any anti-missile patrol .
And Russia , like China 's nuclear capacity is also very strong .
By inference , China may in the production of warheads for the new delivery systems .
Clearly , Russia and the slow progress of China 's strategic modernization projects , the two will not pose a threat to the United States , nor will it shake the U.S. dominance in nuclear weapons .
​ All over Facebook , Twitter , television newscasts , and radio broadcasts , reporters and ordinary folks have been encouraging relatives , friends and anyone who cares to donate $ 5 to the Yele Haiti Earthquake fund , the humanitarian relief effort spearheaded by the non-profit organization founded by Haitian - American entertainer and part - time Miami resident Wyclef Jean .
According to media reports ,
Yele is on pace to collect more than $ 1 million a day .
Well , South Floridians should know that the Refugee All - Star has profited from Yele .
Yesterday , The Smoking Gun posted Yele 's tax returns for 2005 , 2006 , and 2007 which show the foundation paid $ 31,200 in rent to a recording studio owned by Jean and a Yele board member , who together " own a controlling interest " in a company that was paid $ 250,000 by the foundation for " pre-purchased ... TV airtime and production services . "
In 2006 , Yele paid it 's founder $ 100,000 , which the tax return stated was below market value , for a musical performance at a benefit concert .
I do n’t know if this is real , but it seems perfectly reasonable that all of Facebook is stored in a huge database that someone with the proper permissions can access and modify .
And it also makes sense that developers and others would need the ability to assume anyone ’s identity .
Rumpus :
You ’ve previously mentioned a master password , which you no longer use .
Employee : I ’m not sure when exactly it was deprecated , but we did have a master password at one point where you could type in any user ’s user ID , and then the password .
I ’m not going to give you the exact password , but with upper and lower case , symbols , numbers , all of the above , it spelled out ‘ Chuck Norris , ’ more or less .
It was pretty fantastic .
Rumpus :
This was accessible by any Facebook employee ?
Employee : Technically , yes .
But it was pretty much limited to the original engineers , who were basically the only people who knew about it .
It was n’t as if random people in Human Resources were using this password to log into profiles .
It was made and designed for engineering reasons .
But it was there , and any employee could find it if they knew where to look .
I should also say that it was only available internally .
If I were to log in from a high school or library , I could n’t use it .
You had to be in the Facebook office , using the Facebook ISP .
Rumpus :
Do you think Facebook employees ever abused the privilege of having universal access ?
Employee : I know it has happened in the past , because at least two people have been fired for it that I know of .
[…]
Employee : See , the thing is — and I do n’t know how much you know about it — it ’s all stored in a database on the backend .
Literally everything .
Your messages are stored in a database , whether deleted or not .
So we can just query the database , and easily look at it without every logging into your account .
That ’s what most people do n’t understand .
Rumpus :
So the master password is basically irrelevant .
Employee : Yeah .
Rumpus :
It ’s just for style .
Employee : Right .
But it ’s no longer in use .
Like I alluded to , we ’ve cracked down on this lately , but it has been replaced by a pretty cool tool .
If I visited your profile , for example , on our closed network , there ’s a ‘ switch login ’ button .
I literally just click it , explain why I ’m logging in as you , click ‘ OK , ’ and I ’m you .
You can do it as long as you have an explanation , because you ’d better be able to back it up .
For example , if you ’re investigating a compromised account , you have to actually be able to log into that account .
Rumpus :
Are your managers really on your ass about it every time you log in as someone else ?
Employee : No , but if it comes up , you ’d better be able to justify it .
Or you will be fired .
Rumpus :
What did they do ?
Employee : I know one of them went in and manipulated some other person ’s data , changed their religious views or something like that .
I do n’t remember exactly what it was , but he got reported , got found out , got fired .
A RARE albino crocodile has been photographed in the Northern Territory after its white head " popped up " near a boat while a shocked fishing party looked on .
Belinda Trewartha and her fiance Peter Bellis were fishing with friends at a Top End river when they saw a shadow in the water and a head " popping up near the boat " .
" We thought it was a fish , but then realised it was a crocodile head - and it was all white , " the 29 - year - old told the Northern Territory News .
" My fiance has been fishing on the river his whole life , we come here at least 20 times a year , but we 've never seen anything like this . "
Ms Trewartha said the crocodile disappeared in the water , but the fishermen spotted the 2.5 m saltie again later in the day .
" It was laying on the bank and it was really white .
" It was a truly amazing sight - probably one of the most awesome things I have ever seen in the wild . "
Ms Trewartha said she believed the reptile was an albino with no pigmentation .
" It looked a bit like the white croc ( Snowy ) at Crocosaurus Cove , " she said .
There is another white - skinned crocodile on the Adelaide River .
Guides on board the Spectacular Jumping Crocodile Cruise have dubbed the 5 m saltie Michael Jackson .

TCA Tour : NBC Executive Session
I think it ’s fair to say that there was n’t a single member of the Television Critics Associate who was n’t chomping at the bit to see how this session was going to go down .
With all of the controversy breaking about the reported cancellation of “ The Jay Leno Show ” and rumors of its host moving to a half - hour slot at 11:35 PM , thereby moving the other members of the late - night line - up – “ The Tonight Show starring Conan O’Brien ” and “ Late Night with Jimmy Fallon ” back by an hour , everybody wanted to know how NBC was going to handle damage control .
“ I see we have a full house , ” said NBC Universal TV chairman Jeff Gaspin , as he walked onto the stage and stood before a ballroom filled with TV critics , many of whom were poised to pounce .
“ I heard there were some scalpers outside . ”
The levity quickly went by the wayside , however , as Gaspin went into the recitation of what one can only presume was a well - tweaked statement , confirming that , starting February 12th , “ The Jay Leno Show ” will no longer air at 10 PM .
He admitted that , although the series performed at acceptable levels for the network , it did not meet the needs of the network ’s affiliates , hence the change in programming strategy .
He also stated that NBC ’s goal was to keep all three of its hosts as part of the late - night landscape – “ The Jay Leno Show ” at 11:35 PM , “ The Tonight Show starring Conan O’Brien ” at 12:05 AM , and “ Late Night with Jimmy Fallon ” at 1:05 AM – while acknowledging that this plan was in no way a done deal and that talks are still ongoing .
“ It ’s a fluid situation , ” said Gaspin .
“ Everybody has the weekend to think about it , and we ’ll see what happens when we start the new week tomorrow . ”
While he would not confirm the hosts ’ specific reactions to the new plan , Gaspin said that all three gentlemen were “ incredibly gracious and professional ” and that they acknowledged that they knew it was a difficult situation .
As for anything else that went down during the discussions , he merely described it as a “ private conversation , ” adding , “ When it ’s all settled , you can go and ask them what their feelings were . ”
Gaspin expects that the new late - night line - up will be in place by the time NBC ’s coverage of the Olympics begins in February .
Unsurprisingly , the critics ’ claws were soon out , with one wanting to know exactly what happened with the network ’s assurances during the summer TCA tour that the success or failure of “ The Jay Leno Show ” would not be determined fully until the series had run for a full 52 - week cycle .
Gaspin maintained that the 52 - week plan still would ’ve been his preference but again cited the affiliates ’ concerns as being the driving force behind the comparatively - quick removal of the series from its prime - time berth .
“ Starting in November , the affiliates started calling , saying that local news was being affected more than expected , ” said Gaspin .
By the end of the month , the stations which utilized people meters for their ratings continued their complaints , now citing statistics where , in some cases , # 1 local news broadcasts had dropped to # 3 .
Gaspin continued his constant dialogue with the affiliates , requesting that they wait and see how the show would do against repeats …and , indeed , “ The Jay Leno Show ” did do better , but only by about a tenth of a rating point , still coming in second to either CBS or ABC on a regular basis .
When the smaller affiliates without people meters got their November book numbers , “ the drum beat started getting louder , ” Gaspin said , and as it became progressively more clear that they were only going to be getting more vocal about their displeasure , throwing around comments about possible preemption , “ we realized things were not going to go well if it was kept in place . ”
Gaspin continued to clarify , however , that despite the feelings of the affiliates , NBC did not feel that “ The Jay Leno Show ” was a disappointment on a network level .
“ It was working at acceptable levels financially , making money at 10 PM , ” he said .
“ For the network , it was not a wrong decision . ”
He also underlined that , insofar as he was concerned , the reason behind the limited viewership had nothing to do with the show or its level of quality .
“ There ’s a lot of choice at 10 PM , ” he said .
“ We thought it could be everybody ’s second choice , but there were just so many other choices that people thought were better . ”
In the end , Gaspin conceded that “ The Jay Leno Show , ” while being easy entertainment , simply was n’t the first or even second choice of enough viewers .
So now that the 10 PM slot is going to be vacated by our man Jay , what can we expect to see in its place ?
That ’s still under consideration , with details still yet to be worked out , but Gaspin ’s guess is that “ it will net at least two more hours of scripted , another reality hour , and a combination of expanded ‘ Dateline ’ episodes or repeats . ”
Angela Bromstad , the network ’s president of prime time entertainment , revealed what ’s on the slate for the future , and there ’s some stuff that sounds pretty good :
* “ Undercovers , ” wherein a domesticated husband and wife return from years in retirement and are re-activated as CIA agents .
As they work together for the first time on new cases , they discover new aspects from their past , even as they re-ignite their passion for each other .
( Oh , God , can you tell that came straight from the press release ? )
J.J. Abrams ( “ Lost , ” the 2009 feature film “ Star Trek ” ) , Bryan Burk ( “ Lost , ” “ Star Trek ” ) and Josh Reims ( “ Dirty Sexy Money ” ) are the executive producers , Abrams and Reims are the writers , and it was announced today that Abrams will be directing the pilot , his first since “ Lost . ”
* “ Prime Suspect , ” based on the award - winning BBC series , centering on a courageous female detective who investigates complex mysteries in a politically explosive big city .
Hank Steinberg ( “ Without a Trace ” ) and Erwin Stoff ( “ The Blind Side ” ) are the executive producers .
* “ Chase , ” a new action - procedural drama from executive producer Jerry Bruckheimer , based on a real - life group and set in the American Southwest , follows a crucial fugitive apprehension team comprised of U.S. Marshals that tracks down the nation ’s most notorious criminals .
Joining Bruckheimer as executive producers are Jennifer Johnson ( “ Cold Case ” ) and Jonathan Littman ( “ CSI , ” “ Cold Case ” ) .
* “ Kindreds , ” created by Emmy Award winner David E. Kelley ( “ Boston Legal , ” “ The Practice , ” “ L.A. Law ” ) , follows a curmudgeonly ex-patent lawyer and his group of misfit associates as their lives come together to form an unconventional kind of law practice .
Kelley is the writer and executive producer .
* “ The Event , ” a thriller with a unique storytelling device that features multiple points of view concerning a decent , regular fellow who battles against mysterious circumstances that envelope a larger conspiracy .
Steve Stark ( “ Medium ” ) is the executive producer , and Nick Wauters ( “ The 4400 ” ) is the co-executive producer / writer .
* “ Love Bites ” is an hour - long romantic comedy from writer Cindy Chupack ( “ Sex in the City , ” “ Everybody Loves Raymond ” ) and Timothy Bevan & Eric Fellner ( “ Love Actually , ” “ Bridget Jones ’ Diary ” ) .
* “ The Rockford Files . ”
Your worst fears are being realized , Seth Gordon : the iconic drama from the 1970s is being re-imagined by executive producers David Shore ( “ House ” ) and Steve Carell .
Yes , the one from “ The Office . ”
* And , lastly ( for now ) , there ’s the Adam Carolla comedy project , featuring Jimmy Kimmel ’s former “ Man Show ” co-host as a contractor who sets out to re-build his life following a divorce .
The executive producers are Carolla , Kevin Hench ( The Hammer ” ) , Jon Pollack ( NBC ’s “ 30 Rock ” ) , Jimmy Kimmel ( “ The Jimmy Kimmel Show ” ) , Gail Berman ( NBC ’s “ Mercy ” ) , Lloyd Braun ( NBC ’s “ Mercy ” ) , Daniel Kellison ( “ The Jimmy Kimmel Show , ” “ The Man Show ” ) and James Dixon ( “ Ace in the Hole ” ) .
There ’s also still some interest from the network about having Dick Wolf pull together a “ Law & Order : Los Angeles ” ( which Wolf has apparently taken to calling “ LOLA ” ) , but it ’s still strictly in the talking stages at the moment .
A couple of random tidbits were also offered up about a few other shows which are currently part of the NBC line - up :
* “ Heroes ” is still under consideration for a fifth season , with Bromstad planning to meet with creator Tim Kring sometime in the next few weeks to feel out what his plans would be for the series .
* David Hasselhoff is leaving “ America ’s Got Talent , ” and his probable replacement looks to be Howie Mandel .
Oh , hey , we just remembered : what ’s NBC planning to do with Carson Daly ?
( See , even we had n’t thought about where the Leno / O’Brien / Fallon brouhaha was going to leave him . )
Well , according to Gaspin , “ Carson is going to be part of NBC , regardless of what happens , ” though he admitted that leaving him in the post - Fallon timeslot would involve some “ rejiggering . ”
The problem at hand is that 2:05 AM , which would ostensibly be the new start - time for Daly ’s show , is when the affiliates are free to air whatever the hell they want …and , really , if you had a choice , would you watch Carson Daly ?

Did Toyota Hide Life - Saving Information ?
A former top company lawyer says Toyota can't be trusted .
Feb .
4 , 2010  -- Toyota , which lost six percent of its value on the U.S. stock market Wednesday , continues to be under attack , now accused of hiding information from the public that could have saved lives .
The families of the four people killed in this apparent runaway Toyota accident in suburban Dallas say quicker action by Toyota could have prevented the tragedy .
The day after Christmas , their 2008 Avalon sped off the road , through a fence and landed upside down in a pond in Southlake , Texas .
Linda
Hardy , the widow of the driver , says she took the car in to her dealer to complain of the car racing out of control three separate times between Thanksgiving and Christmas .
" I said please fix my car , " recalled Hardy .
Hardy says she was told there was no problem .
Hardy 's dealer declined to comment and referred ABC News to Toyota 's corporate offices , which also declined comment .
Said Randy Roberts ,
Hardy 's lawyer , " We 're not blaming the dealership , all they knew is what Toyota told them .
But that obviously was not enough . "
Toyota admits it knew of the sticky gas pedals in October but did not say anything publicly until four weeks after this accident .
" Money can't bring back my husband , " said Linda Hardy .
" I want Toyota to take care of these problems so no one else will die . "
But what happened in the Dallas case is one of the reasons Toyota is now facing possible civil fines from the federal government and a rare get - tough policy .
Within minutes of his advice to Toyota owners Wednesday morning to " stop driving , " Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood was backtracking , calling his remarks an " obvious misstatement . "
But LaHood did not walk back his criticism of Toyota during a Congressional hearing for its slow response to reports of runaway cars , and vowed to keep investigating other causes for random acceleration besides those offered by the car company .
Said LaHood , " Our [ National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ] people , which are safety people at DOT , will continue to hold Toyota 's feet to the fire to make sure they 're doing everything that they said they were going to do . "
Runaway Toyotas
The secretary announced a new probe of the Toyota electronics system that links the gas pedal , through a tiny computer , to the throttle .
Some experts believe there is a software glitch or that the computer is susceptible to electromagnetic waves .
" It 's the electronics , it 's not the pedal , " said Keith Armstrong , an an electromagnetic interference expert who was interviewed just this week as part of the new federal safety probe of Toyota .
Toyota 's top executives have repeatedly denied there is any electronic problem that could cause their cars to speed out of control .
Toyota's U.S. president , Jim Lentz , told ABC News on Monday that he was " confident " there is no electronic problem .
But a former top Toyota lawyer who left the company in 2007 says the company cannot be believed , that officials in Tokyo give orders to hide evidence of defects that could be damaging to the company .
" You have to understand that Toyota in Japan does not have any respect for our legal system , " said Dimitri Biller .
" They did not have any respect for our laws . "
Biller worked four years for Toyota , handling product liability lawsuits from consumers about safety defects .
Now he 's blowing the whistle .
He and Toyota are suing each other and he 's asking a federal judge to make public documents he says will prove Toyota regularly hid evidence of safety defects .
" It was a culture of hypocrisy and deception , " said Biller .
Toyota denies Biller 's charges and says he is just a disgruntled former employee who is angry he lost his job .
In a statement , Toyota said Biller had left the company in 2007 , and would not have any knowledge about current matters .
" Mr. Biller continues to make inaccurate and misleading allegations about Toyota 's conduct that we strongly dispute and will continue to fight against vigorously , " said the statement .
Toyota also said Biller did not handle unwanted acceleration cases while he worked at the company .
Biller disputes that , saying he worked as the managing attorney for Toyota on a sudden acceleration case involving Lexuses that was filed in 2005 .

For more than 50 years , the National Prayer Breakfast has served as a prime networking event in Washington , bringing together the president , members of Congress , foreign diplomats and thousands of religious , business and military leaders for scrambled eggs and supplication .
Usually , the annual event passes with little notice .
But this year , an ethics group in Washington has asked President Obama and Congressional leaders to stay away from the breakfast , on Thursday .
Religious and gay rights groups have organized competing prayer events in 17 cities , and protesters are picketing in Washington and Boston .
The objections are focused on the sponsor of the breakfast , a secretive evangelical Christian network called The Fellowship , also known as The Family , and accusations that it has ties to legislation in Uganda that calls for the imprisonment and execution of homosexuals .
The Family has always stayed intentionally in the background , according to those who have written about it .
In the last year , however , it was identified as the sponsor of a residence on Capitol Hill that has served as a dormitory and meeting place for a cluster of politicians who ran into ethics problems , including Senator John Ensign , Republican of Nevada , and Gov. Mark Sanford , Republican of South Carolina , both of whom have admitted to adultery .
College Student Says a TSA Employee Played a Prank on Her Airport screener pretended to find a baggie of drugs in a student 's bag .
Jan. 22 , 2010  --
College student Rebecca Solomon never expected to become the target of a prank orchestrated by a TSA employee .
But that 's exactly what happened when a Transportation Security Administration agent at a checkpoint at the Philadelphia International Airport held a small baggie of white powder up to the shocked 22 - year - old student and asked her , " Where did you get this from ? "
Solomon , who wrote an editorial in The Michigan Daily , her college 's student newspaper , detailing the incident , said that she was the " epitome of compliance " and was an " expert traveler " thanks to her frequent trips between Ann Arbor and Philadelphia , which is why she was so surprised at the sight of the baggie she swore was n't hers .
Her first thought when she saw the baggie , Solomon wrote , was that she had left her bag on the ground when she was looking for her license to show another security guard .
She figured that " terrorists slipped bomb - detonating powder into my bag .
" I immediately told him I had no idea where the bag came from , and that I had n't left my bags unattended -- a cardinal sin in airport security , " wrote Solomon , who did n't return messages left by ABCNews.com .
" He let me stutter through an explanation for the longest minute of my life .
Tears streamed down my face as I pleaded with him to understand that I 'd never seen this baggie before , " said Solomon .
But then , according to Solomon , the TSA employee began to smile and told her that the whole thing had been a joke -- he was " just kidding . "
The prank prompted Solomon to ask for a supervisor , who immediately removed the employee from the floor .
The TSA released the following statement regarding Solomon 's incident to ABCNews.com : " The behavior exhibited by this TSA employee was highly inappropriate and unprofessional .
" TSA can assure travelers that disciplinary action was taken by TSA management at Philadelphia International Airport , and the employee expressed remorse for his actions , " read the statement .
" This individual is no longer employed by TSA . "
Was An 8 - Year - Old on the TSA 's No- Fly List ?
But this is n't the first faux pas by the TSA to make headlines in recent weeks .
The story of an 8 - year - old boy who is frisked profusely every time he steps foot in the airport was first reported by The New York Times , and highlights an entirely different issue that even the TSA says they 're working to fix .
Mikey Hicks ' mother , Najlah Hicks , told ABCNews.com that her son has been patted down ever since he started flying .
" He was a little over 2 years when he first went through airport security , " said Hicks of her son .
" They were not overly aggressive , but they certainly frisked him up his legs and arms and stomach and back . "
" [ My husband and I ] were amused at first , we kept saying to ourselves that they look like a bunch of bumbling idiots , " she said .
" Why are they frisking a little 8 - year - old ? "
The Hicks first thought their son was on the TSA 's " no - fly list , " a program implemented to ensure terrorists do n't board plans , but later found out that was n't so .
According to the TSA , Mikey was the victim of misidentification that the family is currently working to fix .
" The TSA can confirm there are no 8 - year - olds on the no fly or selectee list , " said a statement issued to ABCNews.com .
A new program , known as Secure Flight , is currently being rolled out by the TSA on domestic flights .
It will match passenger information -- including gender and date of birth -- with government - maintained watch lists .
This way , an 8 - year - old wo n't be confused with a person who might have a legitimate reason to be on the watch list , according to the TSA .
" Initial estimates indicate that under Secure Flight , in excess of 99 percent of passengers who provided the additional data elements will be able to use Internet check - in and experience no delays in obtaining their boarding passes , " said the statement .
Transportation Security Administration Frisks an 8 - Year - Old
As for Mikey and his mom , they both hope they see the change next month when they go to the airport on their next trip .
" My son keeps asking me , ' Hey , Mom , why would they think a kid is a terrorist ? ' " said Hicks .
" Next time we fly we hope we can go right through and not be patted down like that again , " she said .
" I understand the need for security .
I know there are crazy people who want to blow us up -- but obviously the system is broken .
How can you respect the list when you have children on the list ? "
Some other number of men discover they are not biological fathers , but choose to soldier on rather than go to court , unwilling to upset their children or the relationships they have established .
Tanner Pruitt , who owns a small manufacturing business in Texas , paid child support for seven years after divorcing his wife .
His daughter never looked like him , but it was n’t until she was 12 that it began to bother him .
He told the girl he wanted to check something in her mouth , quickly swabbed some cheek cells and sent the samples off to a lab .
After the DNA test showed they were n’t related , he contacted a lawyer , figuring the lab results would release him from child - support payments and justify reimbursement from the biological father .
But the lawyer told Pruitt his only option was to take the matter to court and that doing so might mean giving up his right to see the girl at all .
It might also alert her to the truth .
Pruitt did n’t want to chance either possibility , so he stayed silent and kept paying .

After divorcing the girl ’s mother , he paid child support for years before a DNA test revealed that he was not the biological father .
He has subsequently received full custody of the girl .

“ I spent thousands and thousands of dollars , and it has n’t cost that biological father a penny , and yeah , I ’m angry , but it would have been more harm to her psychologically than it was worth , ” says Pruitt , who eventually fought for , and won , full custody .
The girl , now 15 years old , recently learned from a relative that Pruitt is not her biological father .
Afterward , Pruitt sat with her on a park bench , held her hand and told her the saga .
“ When it was all over with , she gave me a big hug and told me I ’d always be her daddy , ” he told me .
“ Even though she ’s not my blood daughter , I was there the day she was born , and I ’ve been there ever since , so she ’s my daughter , and as long as she ’s alive , she ’ll always call me Dad . ”
Mike ’s first inkling that something was amiss in his marriage was in 2000 , when he was digging through a closet looking for the source of some mice .
He did n’t find any nests , but he did come upon a plastic grocery bag of love letters to his wife , Stephanie , from her co-worker Rob .
Confronted , Stephanie confessed to a fleeting affair but assured Mike that L. , then nearly 3 , was his .
A year later , according to Mike ’s undisputed court testimony , while changing the sheets , Mike found Rob ’s photograph tucked under Stephanie ’s side of the mattress .
Despite Stephanie ’s assurances that L. was his child , Mike ’s doubts haunted him .
The marriage deteriorated , and as L. approached her 5th birthday , Mike asked Stephanie to take a DNA test with him and their child .
They told the girl that all three of them had to take a test for the doctor .
Mike remembers telling her that rolling the swab inside her cheek would n’t hurt one bit .
“ The day the results came back was the most devastating day of my life , ” Mike said , beginning to cry as he described opening the envelope from the lab and reading there was no chance he was L. ’s father .
“ This little girl , ” he whispered , his throat tight , “ is not my child .
I ran upstairs , locked myself in the bathroom and cried and dry - heaved for 45 minutes .
I felt like my guts were being ripped out . ”
Mike and Stephanie separated immediately .
Mike expected Rob to pay L. ’s support and remembers asking Stephanie if Rob would “ step up ” to be L. ’s father .
He recalls Stephanie saying no , although Stephanie , in court documents , denies that such a conversation ever occurred .
Mike would later claim that he agreed to support L. only because her rightful father would not .
After Mike moved out , the lawyers he consulted told him there was no use contesting paternity : if he denied he was the father , they said , he would n’t get to see L. at all , and the state would probably take his money anyway .
So when a clerk at the child - support office handed Mike a form confirming he was the natural father , he signed .
Since then , Mike — a human - resources analyst for an equipment manufacturer — says he has paid $ 7,500 a year in child support , child care , camp and medical insurance .
At first , whenever Mike saw Stephanie after the divorce , he felt a stabbing bitterness , but eventually , he grudgingly accepted the situation .
In 2005 , he began dating Lori , a woman he had met at his church and whom he would later marry .
Lori deeply resented the chunk of Mike ’s salary that went to another man ’s child , while she was reduced to clipping coupons .
But she accepted L. They made scrapbooks together , baked scones and pizza and picked berries at a local farm .
Neither Mike nor Lori had any idea Rob was in L. ’s life until 2006 , when Stephanie called and said she was marrying him .
It was then that Mike became consumed with resentment .
“ The courts insist on the best interest of the child , ” Mike fumes , “ but it was in the child ’s best interest for Stephanie and Rob not to do this in the first place .
So why is that burden all of a sudden put on me ? ”
I am re-publishing this diary on the encouragement of several kossacks who thought its exposure suffered from having been published during the SOTU .
It with some embarrassment that I re-publish a rescued diary .
I hope this does not offend anyone .
The response to the original convinced me that it might serve the site to see this again .
A couple of weeks ago , mem from Somerville celebrated the Boston Globe selection of Elizabeth Warren as their Woman of the Year .
Embedded in the short diary is the hour - long lecture Ms. Warren delivered in June 2007 as part of the UC Berkeley Graduate Council Lectures which inspired me to write this diary .
Relying on her own work as well as that of Jacob Hacker , Prof .
Warren has identified , quantified , and analyzed the single largest threat to the financial , political , and spiritual health of our republic — what she calls the " hollowing out " of the middle class .
Listening to her thoughts has given me a fresh template for viewing current debates .
I was amazed at the subtlety of many of the mechanisms by which risk and expense are shifted from the wealthy , and from common funds , onto the middle class .
Talk of refunds for college expenses , for example , does n’t begin to counteract the hundreds of tricks being employed to concentrate financial power in fewer and fewer hands .
Realizing that many kossacks will not have an hour to devote to this enlightening lecture , I took the time to listen and summarize .
I write up the lecture in detail at the end of this diary .
I invite you to read it through , because spending time with the details is essential for a solid intuitive feel for the forces we must combat .
But before getting into the nitty gritty , I want to mention a couple of things and make a few general points .
The Equality Trust : Unambiguous Evidence
As I pondered writing up Warren ’s lecture , I wondered if there was any solid data showing that inequality is damaging to a society .
I do n't want to be some naive , idealistic socialist or a foolish bleeding heart liberal .
Heaven forbid .
Almost magically , xaxnar appeared in an open thread , linking to his / her diary about the work of Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett .
Thirty years of data collected from various countries has enabled them to show that greater equality within a society means better results in all of the following areas : physical health , mental health , drug abuse , education , imprisonment rates , obesity , social mobility , trust and community life , violence , teenage births , and child well - being .
They further show that continued economic growth no longer brings real benefits to countries which are already wealthy .
With reference to global warming , they argue that the creation of a sustainable economic system is also dependent on greater equality .
Chart courtesy of Equality Trust
[ Sorry about the blurred chart .
Here 's a more legible view . ]
Take my word for it , that 's the " land of the freeper and the home of the brazen " almost off the chart in the upper right - hand corner .
The data is amazingly consistent throughout the areas studied -- the greater the wealth inequality within a country , the worse the problem under discussion .
If we were a self - aware people , this situation would be an extreme embarrassment to us .
We 're negative number one in most categories .
And by the way , the problems associated with inequality are society - wide .
This is not a call for rich folks to have a lower quality of life so that others can have a higher one .
Greater equality in a society results in a higher quality of living for the richest person as well as for the poorest .
Even GOP Jesus would support that .
Combating inequality has become a crusade for Wilkinson and Pickett , who along with Bill Perry established the Equality Trust in 2009 to get out the word and to work for greater equality .
Please visit their website .
Equality is a thing we can all work toward , independent of pressure on our government .
Why our fight over HCR is so difficult
I would like to use HCR as an example of what I mean by analyzing policy in terms of its relation to the issue of inequality .
This also takes us to what I see as the real fault line causing so much angst on our website of late .
To put it briefly , over the last three decades , money going into our health care industry has gone increasingly to profits , and to enormous salaries at the top , rather than to actual care .
We see this pattern in other areas as well : over a decade ago , a study found that only 25 cents of every dollar spent on education went to classroom instruction .
In industry after industry we see this top - heavy pattern .
So , our Congress was tasked with finding a way to provide health care for more Americans without offending the corporate donors who pay for the expensive campaigns , meaning without interfering with the flow of funds from the middle class to the very rich .
The result so far has been an attempt to use tax money -- which is middle class money -- and money from middle class workers by taxing so - called " Cadillac " plans .
Meanwhile , the health industry stands to become even further enriched , and further empowered to control the entire system , by the institution of mandates .
One result of this has been the impassioned , often fratricidal , debate on daily Kos .
Chris
Hayes wrote the clearest exposition of this that I have seen :
In pondering the answer , it 's useful to distinguish between two separate categories of problems we face .
The first are the human , economic and ecological disasters that demand immediate action : a grossly inefficient healthcare sector , millions un - or underinsured , 10 percent unemployment , a planet that 's warming , soaring personal bankruptcies , 12 million immigrants working in legal limbo , the list goes on .
But the deeper problem , the ultimate cause of many of the first - order problems , is the perverse maldistribution of power in the country : too much in too few hands ....
The central and unique paradox of our politics at this moment , however , is that our institutions are so broken , the government so sclerotic and dysfunctional , that in almost all cases , from financial bailouts to health insurance mandates , the easiest means of addressing the first set of problems is to take steps that exacerbate the second .
Hayes employs an enlightening analogy , evoking a community suffering at the hands of a protection racket .
Some of the poorer business owners are harassed and beaten when they ca n’t afford to make their payoffs .
If a parish priest could stop the harassment by paying the protection money for the businesses , would he be doing good by preventing beatings or doing more harm by further entrenching the hoodlums terrorizing the neighborhood ?
It is a nearly impossible question .
Lest anyone read this as an argument for taking the long view , it is not .
Hayes himself chooses the short - term solution with respect to HCR .
May we model our behavior more on that of a person willing to take a decision at the same time he is willing to clarify the weakness of his position .
Almost everyone here wants to combat climate change , put people to work , and provide health care to folks .
Some of us feel the most skillful policy is to accomplish what is doable even if it means further concentrating wealth and power ; others of us feel that wrenching power and wealth away from those who have a stranglehold on our government is an over - riding concern , rendering the brutal compromises on health care unacceptable .
I am grateful for the passionate , involved people working on both sides of this question .
The coming collapse of the middle class :
Higher risk , lower rewards , and a shrinking safety net .
Now , on to Prof .
Warren ’s analysis of the societal changes over the last three decades which have led to increasing concentration of wealth in the hands of a few .
If this is getting too long for you , please skip down to the boffo closing .
I wanted to start by talking about what I think is the single most important economic shift of the second half of the twentieth century in the United States , and that is that millions of mothers poured into the full - time paid work force .
A woman in 1970 who had a sixteen - year - old child was less likely to be in the work force than a woman in 2003 who had a six - month - old child at home .
It was a profound shift in America .
The median family in America , married couple family in America , went over a thirty - year period — median , middle - - from being a one - income household to a two - income household .
Along with most of us , Warren ’s guesses as to the effects of this change would have been largely wrong ..
The effects have been right in front of us , but we have failed to notice many of the mechanisms even after the fact .
She would have guessed that families would move away from the suburbs closer to their place of work , as no mother of a six - month - old would commute over an hour to work .
She would have been wrong .
Her second guess would have been that families would be very wealthy :
They ’re going to have lots of savings , no debt , and plenty of vacations .
They ’re going to be secure , they wo n’t have a lot of bankruptcy , there wo n’t be a lot of default , nobody ’s going to be dealing with debt collectors .
Looking at a single generation , 1970 or so to about 2005 , Warren now demonstrates that what has occurred is almost precisely the opposite of what one would have expected .
All dollar amounts are corrected for inflation .
All graphs may be found in PDF format here .
First graph :
See the second Fig. 1
Income went up for married couples , but income for a fully employed male is actually $ 800 less today than his father made a generation ago ( median earnings ) .
This flat or decreasing income for the single worker bucks the trend of the previous seventy years .
Thus , all the increase in income was a result of a second worker in the work force .
Still , it appears so far that the income of the average family has increased .
Unfortunately , the devil is in the details .
Savings went down over this time period :
The single - income family in 1970 was putting away about 11 % of their take - home pay ....
By the year 2006 , you ’ll notice the line goes below zero .
This is a concept only Alan Greenspan would love : negative savings .
The American family today puts away nothing , and frankly , has been putting away nothing for the last five or six years .
There is nothing there .
There is no savings .
So , savings did n’t go up the way I predicted .
But something went up .
And that would all be debt .
See figure 4
Choose any type of debt and you ’ll see much the same picture : revolving debt ( credit card ) , consumer debt ( car loans , pay day loans , etc. ) , or mortgages .
For example , revolving debt as a percentage of annual income : 1.4 % in 1970 up to 15 % in 2005 .
Think about what that means .
That means that over the last thirty years , in terms of a shift , the family spent everything that mom ’s income added to the family fisc , spent everything they used to save — that 11 % that they used to put away , and went into debt another 15 % of income on top of that .
They spent it all .
So , what did they spend it on ?
Ms. Warren ’s inner nerd was excited to learn that between the Commerce Department and the Labor Department , she could find the answer to this question .
Going back for over a century , one can study alcohol consumption , cracker consumption , rugs , cars , etc .
To aggregate the data with stability with respect to such factors as age and family composition , Ms. Warren analyzed data for a family of a mom , a dad , and two kids .
She compared the numbers in 1971 with those in 2003 .
The results are surprising , adding even further to the picture of a fragile middle class .
See figure 3 .
Believe it or not , we spent 32 % less on clothing .
Probable explanatory factors -- discount stores , imported clothing ( think slave wages ) , and more casual dress .
Well , what about food , especially with the family eating out more with mom at work , with the specialty items from around the globe , with bottled water ?
The 2005 family spent 18 % less on food .
Well , again we have discount stores and razor - thin profit margins , less spent on meat , and many other contributing factors .
Okay , must be appliances that are eating up our consumer dollars — microwaves , expresso machines , popcorn poppers .
This is what critics of our overspending lifestyle ( Robert Frank and Julia Shore ) would tell us .
Well , try 52 % less on appliances .
Per car cost of owning a car has gone down by 26 % ( we keep cars an average of two years longer and repair costs have dropped significantly ) .
Spending on furniture went down by 30 % in a generation .
Electronics went up , but only by $ 300 .
Dog food went up .
Baby food went down .
Cigarettes went down .
Liquor went up .
Dry cleaning went down .
The point is , there is a wash or a negative in terms of ordinary consumption .
We are not so much the overly consuming society we often see ourselves as .
So where did the extra spending go ?
Well , let ’s start with a 3 BR 1 Bath house .
See Figure 6
And there it is .
In inflation adjusted dollars , a 76 % increase in what a family spends on a mortgage .
Mortgage rates are lower than thirty years ago , but the higher price of the house more than offsets the difference .
The median - sized house did grow slightly in this period : it grew from 5.8 rooms to 6.1 rooms , and on average this median family either picked up a second bathroom or a third bedroom , but not both .
So what about the macmansions and the obligatory granite counter tops , etc . ?
All that tells us is that the new housing market has shifted from the entry level house , which is what was being built in the 1950 ’s and 1960 ’s , to on average when you buy a new house today , it is your third to fourth house purchase .
That is , you ’ve moved up and moved up until you could afford this bigger house .
In other words , housing is not being built for 70 % of American families ; it ’s being built for the top 20 % of American families .
That ’s what we see when we see new construction .
So today , they are about 50 % more likely to be in a house more than 25 years old , and have all the attendant expenses for maintenance .
But , just looking at the mortgages , 76 % more .
Health insurance .
Warren looks at her standard family , loading the dice by giving the family good health and an employer who sponsors health insurance .
Apples to apples comparison of employer - sponsored health insurance between 1970 and 2004 : 34 % more .
Cars : while expenses per car went down , the family with two workers owns on average more cars .
Child care , a non-existent expense in 1970 has gone up by whatever percentage you want to put on it —
Ms. Warren calls it 100 % .
Finally , taxes .
What happened with taxes is that , progressive tax system , as mildly progressive as it is , the first dollar that the second earner earns is taxed after the last dollar of the first earner , so it means that the tax rate for this economic unit has gone up by about 25 % .
So there it is -- downs and ups .
And I hope there are two things you notice about the downs and ups .
The first one is : the downs , frankly , are all smaller purchases than the ups are , and that ’s bad news .
And the second is , the downs are all flexible purchases , that is , lose your job , get sick , have a tough month with various expenses , you cut back on the downs .
Do n’t buy appliances this month .
You know , cut back on food ....
But look at those other expenses .
Those other expenses are big , fixed , relentless expenses .
So this gets to what I think of as the heart of what my research is about .
See figure 5 , fixed costs as a share of family income
She looks at this from her commercial lawyer perspective — if this were a little business , is it becoming more or less fiscally sound ?
In 1970 , the single - earner family brought in around $ 44,000 , out of which $ 19,560 was left for discretionary spending after fixed expenses were taken care of .
In 2005 , the dual - income family brought in about $ 73,000 , out of which only $ 18,110 is left for discretionary spending after fixed expenses .
The earlier family is spending about half of its income on fixed expenses , whereas the family today have committed 75 % of their income to these relentless expenses .
You ’ll notice , the math we ’ve done here , the two - income family , the mom , dad and two kids , the prototype of the family that is supposed to be working in America , the one that ’s supposed to making it all , by the time they pay their five basic expenses , they have less money left over , fewer total dollars , than their one - income parents had a generation ago .
Looking at it as a commercial lawyer , viewing each family as a business , one would conclude that the family of today will go broke a lot more often than the family of the 1970’s
... because they have so much less flexibility , so much more debt .
They are much more deeply leveraged and are going to have a lot harder time economically .
And in fact , that is what has happened to these families .
That ’s the economic side of it — the income and expenses and how they contribute to higher risk .
But the risk is even higher than these numbers suggest .
From the point of view of income , the family today relies on two incomes to meet its necessary expenses .
This means that , if the risk of unemployment had stayed exactly the same over these thirty years , then the dual - income family of today faces exactly twice the risk of not being able to make the mortgage payment .
This family needs to bring in 104 checks to meet the mortgage payment as compared with the 52 checks required in 1970 .
To make the same point from another perspective , the one - income family has a spare worker .
If Dad falls ill or loses his job , there is an option of Mom finding work to meet the shortfall .
She will earn less than a woman today , but every dollar she earns is additional , so that in combining this income with unemployment benefits , this family has a better chance of keeping the house .
The family of today not only lacks an extra worker , but they are also already fully budgeted , leaving them nowhere to go .
Making matters worse , the risk of losing one ’s job has not stayed steady .
In The Great Risk Shift , Jacob Hacker has analyzed a family ’s chances of a 20 percent or greater drop in income .
How about health ?
They now have double the chance that one of the two workers will be in a car accident .
But his family now faces additional risks on the health side .
The odds they wo n’t have health insurance have gone up .
Also , the world of health care has changed in the last 30 years .
In 1970 , for a non-ceasarian childbirth , the mother stayed in the hospital for 5 days after the child was born .
For a caesarian , the stay was 10 days .
In 2006 , it ’s 24 hours .
How have we made gains in hospital efficiency over the last thirty years ?
It ’s send home sick people ....
In the trade it ’s known as send them home " quicker and sicker . "
They save money by letting the family provide nursing care instead of the hospital .
And so today we witness the spectacle of my mother - in - law , a woman in her 80’s , where someone ’s trying to show her how it is that she can wash a tube and rinse things out and give injections .
My sister - in - law was asked to do this when my brother had some surgery .
We ’re going to train the family ...
So , if someone gets sick , someone else will have to take off work to take care of them .
You ’re not going to get this nursing care .
It ’s just another way to get one more push on income .
If a child or a grandparent gets sick , a generation ago there was someone at home to care for them .
Today , it often means that a working parent must miss work , often resulting in loss of a job .
Today , an illness in the family has a direct effect on income .
The child gets sick -- I read these stories over and over in my bankruptcy files -- the child gets sick ; mom stays at the hospital with the child until she loses her job .
There are income effects now for any illness anywhere in the family .
We can continue multiplying these consequences — more risk of events which have more dire consequences .
What are the odds of spending $ 10,000 in the ER compared with a generation ago ?
One more significant one that she has n’t quantified yet — insurance has changed .
Insurance itself has changed in terms of how much of the medical cost is actually covered .
We now have floating around in America , is just , I do n’t know what else to call it except faux insurance : people who think they are insured until they actually get sick .
She mentions the announcement by a state official in Utah that everyone is insured .
It turns out , the Utah insurance covers everything except hospitalization , specialists , prescription drugs , supplies , etc .
So all of this is being pushed back on the family .
Changes in jobs , changes in health insurance , changes in health care .
Finally , the special risks facing families with children .
Two points here — this is how it works for the iconic family of two parents and two kids .
Imagine how it works for a single parent and two kids .
She refers to Hacker ’s work on percentage increases in volatility in income by family type from 1970 until 2005 .
For a single person without children , a significant volatility of 35 % , single with children is in the 40’s , married without children gives 75 % increase in volatility , and married with children goes to 95 % increase in volatility over the last generation .
Also , increases in housing costs for families with children vs. families without .
We find a 50 % increase in housing costs for a family without children , a 100 % increase for families with children .
I ’ll tell you how I read this chart .
Families are buying schools .
Families without children do n’t have to buy schools , so they can buy from a wider pool of homes .
A five point increase in third grade reading scores between two side - by - side municipalities in Boston suburbs that are otherwise matched for access to public transportation , ... sidewalks , crime rates , racial composition — everything -- translates into tens of thousands of dollars of differences in housing prices .
A study in San Diego found that parents would rather live near a toxic dump than in an area where they thought the schools would be under - performing .
Parents are buying schools .
What ’s happened to the American safety net for these families ?
Personal safety net , the part you build yourself , has already been covered -- less savings , more debt , higher risk , less flexibility , more people without health insurance than ever before .
In the 1970 ’s the uninsured person was an unmarried male , no children , 23 years old .
Today modal is a 35 - year - old married person with two children ....
In 2001 , 1.4 million people lost their health insurance .
Of those , 800,000 earned more than $ 75,000 a year .
The people who have lost health insurance , who have lost that part of their safety net , are increasingly among the middle class .
Pension plans — the shift between the defined benefit plan and the defined contribution plan , meaning you put in money and you take the risk as to whether you will outlive your money , vs. the defined benefits plan , which is you ’ll get a certain amount of money until you die .
We ’ve moved very much from the latter to the former , which means higher risk of losing the safety net .
Those are on the personal side .
If you take a look at the public side , we ’ve had the same kind of erosion of the safety net .
Unemployment benefits as proportion of income are not nearly as high as they were thirty years ago .
What we pay for public education has eroded sharply .
In 1970 , it took twelve years to educate a child to go forward into the middle class , or so parents said in a Gallup Poll .
Twice as many people in America by 2002 believed that the moonshot landing was faked ... than believed you can make it into the middle class in America without a college diploma .
It means the launch , what parents have to do to get the next generation into the middle class , has shifted from something that everyone pays for ( high school ) to something that only the families with children pay for .
In 1970 , almost no one sent their children to pre-school .
Experts recommended against it .
Today , the specialists recommend two years of pre-school .
So , to launch into the middle class today , a child needs 18 years of education , a third of which is paid for by the individual family .
Just as to costs — City of Chicago launched a pre-school program with some tax dollars in it .
The tuition was larger than the tuition at the University of Illinois .
How have families responded to this ?
Percentage of families filing for bankruptcy in 2001 — unmarried men , unmarried women , and couples with no children all filed for bankruptcy at a rate of a little over 7 per 1,000 .
For a couple with children , the rate more than doubles to 15.3 per 1,000 .
For women head of household , no husband in household , the rate is 23 per 1,000 .
There are n’t enough unmarried men with children to give a statistically significant number .
Families with children are under enormous financial stress .
I watch them , I study them , from the bankruptcy end of the spectrum , which is where they end up , and let me tell you a little bit about why they file for bankruptcy .
Ninety percent of those families file for one of three reasons : job loss , medical problem in the family , ... or family breakup — either a death in the family or divorce in the family .
Nearly half the families have two of those three , and 20 % have been hit with all three .
More children live in homes that will file for bankruptcy this year [ 2007 ] than live in homes that will file for divorce .
This has been true since the late 1990’s .
Why do n’t we know more people who are filing for bankruptcy ?
There ’s an enormous stigma attached :
Do n’t use the word .
About 85 % of the families that are filing for bankruptcy are hiding it from their own parents , from their siblings , from their best friend , and in some cases , from their own children .
They make up stories — have to move in to take care of a family member — are moving across country to get a better job .
This has enormous implications for the poor .
Middle class families under enormous economic stress have fewer resources to give , and they have less appetite to give .
A middle class that looks like this has less room to bring the poor families up into the middle class .
There ’s no place for the poor to go , and not much help coming from the middle class today compared to a generation ago .
I fear we ’re moving from a three - class society to a two - class society .
America has always been one of those perfect distributions -- some poor , some rich , and a big , big solid middle class , stuck right there in the middle .
Americans identify with the middle class .
It ’s part of our democracy .
It ’s what gives us our political stability .
It affects our economy , it drives our economy , it affects our self - identity .
It affects who we are in this world .
And I fear that what ’s happening , that what these data are about , is that we ’re actually going to see a larger upper class -- we ’re seeing it , not just the rich rich but the sorta rich — the ones who have the same jobs , bringing in two incomes , who do n’t get sick , who do n’t lose a job , ... who do n’t divorce , who do n’t have a death in the family , who do n’t hit any of life ’s bumps — they stay with the upper group ....
And then the rest is just one long trail of underclass that stays on a constant debt treadmill — sometimes it ’s a little more , sometimes it ’s a little less , but they ’re never out of debt , never any real economic security .
I could change my metaphors .
People constantly living on the edge of a cliff — some falling over , some scratching back up a little — but they ’ll never enjoy the kind of security that , for the first three - quarters of the century we associated with being middle class .
I worry about what that means .
That threatens the fabric of our country .
In summary
Warren has found that in one generation , the typical working family has added a second adult to the work force and is more in debt than ever .
Families are spending all of the second income , plus what they would have saved 30 years ago plus adding debt .
Where is the money going ?
It is not going to increased spending on consumerism as many like to argue .
Rather , it is going to required fixed expenses of living a decent life -- housing , health , taxes , education and necessary transportation .
People are spending a greater percentage of their income on much older , similarly sized , houses than a generation ago .
People are spending more on lower quality health care than a generation ago .
People are spending more on education with a lower chance of their children succeeding than a generation ago .
Why is the increased spending buying less ?
Obscene profits is surely one of the sinks .
Where the middle class family lives on the edge of bankruptcy , especially the single parent family , a small percentage of Americans is more wealthy than ever before .
Families are going bankrupt all around us , and most of them are not talking about it .
Call it socialism if you like , but decent societies expect mortgage lenders to include as part of their mission supporting a stable housing market .
Instead , they have focused on schemes for siphoning off middle class equity into the hands of a few .
Any healthy culture shares the education of the next generation .
Our culture has created a profitable , top - heavy educational industry supported at great expense only by families committed to educating their own children .
If claiming to be Christian involves anything more than killing Muslims , surely it involves caring for the sick and dying .
Our health care industry has become yet another scheme for enriching a few while showing little commitment to actual health and a dismal record of compassion .
So , industries are growing obscenely wealthy off the ordinary needs of citizens .
At least with heroine , the pusher has to make a person become addicted to the product .
With housing , health care , and education , the " addiction " is inherent ; everyone needs these things .
The net result is that , compared with a generation ago , Americans are putting more energy into work , spending less time with their children , and living in much higher danger of bankruptcy than ever before .
In other words , America looks more feudal and less free , economically , than just thirty years ago .
We are not caring for our children , we are not providing housing for ourselves , and we are not getting the health care we need .
We are number one in most of the wrong ways .
If these trends are not reversed , our future is bleak .
- You can go to Equality Trust for action ideas .
- You can analyze every policy proposal as to whether it truly brings relief to the shift of wealth and risk or simply moves middle class tax money around in creative ways that do nothing to interrupt the concentration of wealth . -
You can educate yourself and others to see more clearly the shifts we are undergoing and to recognize the price we are paying .
Two comments from the original diary
For further reading of someone who has also focused on this issue , particularly with respect to the political and social instability and violence likely to result if increasing numbers of the middle class fall into poverty .

And finally , a great summary from papicek
to sum it all up ...
This huge economic expansion the leadership ( of both parties ) was so proud of was almost entirely funded by absorbing the median family 's savings and then by sending that family into debt .
There 's your history , writ large .
Final plea for compassion
I believe the painful rift on daily Kos , immaturity and incivility aside , springs from a very real and understandable difference of opinion with respect to challenging strategic choices .
Perhaps we can be more forgiving of ourselves and one another if we accept that many policy decisions today necessitate a nearly impossible choice between fixing an immediate problem or attacking structural problems .
In most cases , the choice to go either way can be justified as both ethical and practical .
We are caught on the horns of a dilemma ; here 's hoping we can become more compassionate , appreciative , and supportive of one another as we engage these issues in good faith .
Update :
Our country is failing to address this problem in large part because we are hiding it .
Our media takes a lot of the blame , but another factor is the embarrassment and shame associated with poverty .
This comment by wavpeac made me sob .
I include a part of it in the diary in hopes we can look more clearly at what folks are going through .
If we can be more aware that this is life for a lot of people , we will more likely be able to notice when our friends are in need , be more sensitive about evaluating people on the basis of wealth , and be MOTIVATED TO DO SOMETHING about his kind of suffering instead of indulging in ego battles on the internet .
The emails stolen from the University of East Anglia in November have cast an uncomfortable light on the behind - the - scenes actions of some of the most senior and respected climate scientists in the world .
The affair raises serious questions about access to data and the way scientific peer review can be used to stifle dissent .
But is the science of climate change fatally flawed by the climategate revelations ?
Absolutely not .
Nothing uncovered in the emails destroys the argument that humans are warming the planet .
None of the 1,073 emails plus 3,587 files containing documents , raw data and computer code upsets the 200 - year - old science behind the " greenhouse effect " of gases like carbon dioxide , which traps solar heat and warm the atmosphere .
Nothing changes the fact that carbon dioxide is accumulating in the atmosphere thanks to human emissions from burning carbon - based fuels like coal and oil .
Nor the calculations of physicists that for every square metre of the earth 's surface , 1.6 watts more energy now enters the atmosphere than leaves it .
And we know the world is warming as a result .
Thousands of thermometers in areas remote from any conceivable local urban influences tell us that .
The oceans are warming too .
And we have the evidence of our own eyes .
The great majority of the world 's glaciers are retreating , Arctic sea ice is disappearing , sea levels are rising ever faster , trees are climbing up hillsides and permafrost is melting .
These are not statistical artefacts or the result of scientists cherry - picking their data .
Equally , many of the most widely publicised claims from sceptics about what is in the emails are demonstrably unfounded .
There is no conspiracy to " hide the decline " in temperatures .
Nor that a lack of warming in the data is a " travesty " – still less of attempts to fix the data .
But , within the narrower confines of assembling a reliable history of global temperature , the emails have done significant damage to the credibility of scientists .
They show that in their desire to give the world a clear message that humans are heating the planet here and now , a group of scientists cut corners and down - play uncertainties in their calculations .
Their opponents charge that they then covered their tracks by being secretive with their data and suppressing dissent .
Taken with the recent revelations about shortcomings in reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , this suggests a wider problem of scientific sloppiness , but not of outright fraud .
Many scientists believe their community has to own up to that , and put its house in order .
Part of the problem is secrecy in science .
Climatologist Judy Curry of the Georgia Institute of Technology , who has been trying to make peace between her colleagues and the sceptics , says the various data sets connected to the famous " hockey stick " temperature graph and Phil Jones 's thermometer data sets " stand out as lacking transparency " .
Science is too much of a closed shop , she says .
Outsiders need to be let into the ivory towers for the good of science itself .
" Einstein did n't start his career at Princeton , but rather at a patent office . "
Bring on the bloggers .
Maybe there 's an Einstein among them .
The doors of the labs are being opened whether scientists like it or not .
The Information Commissioner 's office last week released a statement saying that the University of East Anglia had " not dealt with [ FoI requests ] as they should have been under the legislation " .
There is evidence in the emails that some scientists at the Climatic Research Unit wanted to delete files rather than hand them over – although it is not clear whether any deliberate deletions actually happened .
Probably nobody anticipated that a law intended to unwrap state secrets might end up freeing data from scientists ' computers .
But the science community now urgently needs to figure out how to respond to this altered landscape – or scientists will end up in court before long .
The need to open up science is made all the greater by the question raised in the emails about the " gold standard " , the peer review system .
In many fields of research , peer review creates serious conflicts of interest in which , as the emails have revealed , senior researchers can act in a way that could have the effect of blackballing the research papers of their critics .
The dangers are all the greater when , again as the emails show , the conventions of anonymity in peer review are not rigorously upheld .
Finally , " climategate " raises questions about the IPCC report - writing process , in which many of the emailers have been involved .
Governments set up the IPCC 20 years ago to get scientists to speak with one voice on climate change .
But often there is no clear consensus .
Scientists are trained to disagree .
That 's how science advances .
The tensions created by the pressure to agree are clear in dozens of the emails .
One of Jones 's colleagues at the University of East Anglia , climatologist Mike Hulme , says : " Climate scientists will have to work harder to earn the warranted trust of the public – and maybe that is no bad thing . "
And he thinks the IPCC may have run its course .
While science gets its house in order , we need some perspective .
In the midst of a cold winter it may be hard to convince ourselves , but the world is still warming .
Humanity is still to blame .
And we still , urgently , need to do something about it .
• This article was amended on 11 February 2010 .
A quote in the original referred to Einstein working in a post office .
This has been corrected .
While Massachusetts recipients of federal stimulus money collectively report 12,374 jobs saved or created , a Globe review shows that number is wildly exaggerated .
Organizations that received stimulus money miscounted jobs , filed erroneous figures , or claimed jobs for work that has not yet started .
The Globe ’s finding is based on the federal government ’s just - released accounts of stimulus spending at the end of October .
It lists the nearly $ 4 billion in stimulus awards made to an array of Massachusetts government agencies , universities , hospitals , private businesses , and nonprofit organizations , and notes how many jobs each created or saved .
But in interviews with recipients , the Globe found that several openly acknowledged creating far fewer jobs than they have been credited for .
One of the largest reported jobs figures comes from Bridgewater State College , which is listed as using $ 77,181 in stimulus money for 160 full - time work - study jobs for students .
But Bridgewater State spokesman Bryan Baldwin said the college made a mistake and the actual number of new jobs was “ almost nothing . ’’
Bridgewater has submitted a correction , but it is not yet reflected in the report .
In other cases , federal money that recipients already receive annually - subsidies for affordable housing , for example - was reclassified this year as stimulus spending , and the existing jobs already supported by those programs were credited to stimulus spending .
Some of these recipients said they did not even know the money they were getting was classified as stimulus funds until September , when federal officials told them they had to file reports .
“ There were no jobs created .
It was just shuffling around of the funds , ’’ said Susan Kelly , director of property management for Boston Land Co. , which reported retaining 26 jobs with $ 2.7 million in rental subsidies for its affordable housing developments in Waltham .
“ It ’s hard to figure out if you did the paperwork right .
We never asked for this . ’’
The federal stimulus report for Massachusetts has so many errors , missing data , or estimates instead of actual job counts that it may be impossible to accurately tally how many people have been employed by the massive infusion of federal money .
Massachusetts is expected to receive an estimated $ 1 billion more in stimulus contracts , grants , and loans .
The stimulus bill - a $ 787 billion package of tax breaks , expanded government benefits , and infrastructure improvements - was signed into law in February by President Obama , who said it would create and save jobs by preserving local government services and spurring short - and long - term economic development .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger will present the final budget of his governorship later this morning , calling for deep cuts to public transit , healthcare and social services , as well as pleading for billions of dollars in help from Washington to close California 's roughly $ 20 - billion deficit .
The Republican governor will renew his call to expand oil drilling off the Santa Barbara coast and extend the payroll cuts that have resulted in furloughs and a 14 % salary cut for more than 200,000 state workers .
Mostly , Schwarzenegger will deliver bad news as cash - strapped California continues to muddle through the economic downturn , despite raising taxes and cutting back services severely in 2009 .
" As bitter as the words are in my mouth , we face additional cuts , " Schwarzenegger said in his State of the State speech before lawmakers Wednesday .
" We know what that means .
We know the pain it entails .
I mean , what can we say at this point except the truth , that we have no choice ? "
First they put the planet in square brackets , now they have deleted it from the text .
At the end it was no longer about saving the biosphere : it was just a matter of saving face .
As the talks melted down , everything that might have made a new treaty worthwhile was scratched out .
Any deal would do , as long as the negotiators could pretend they have achieved something .
A clearer and less destructive treaty than the text that emerged would be a sheaf of blank paper , which every negotiating party solemnly sits down to sign .
This was the chaotic , disastrous denouement of a chaotic and disastrous summit .
The event has been attended by historic levels of incompetence .
Delegates arriving from the tropics spent 10 hours queueing in sub -zero temperatures without shelter , food or drink , let alone any explanation or announcement , before being turned away .
Some people fainted from exposure ; it 's surprising that no one died .
The process of negotiation was just as obtuse : there was no evidence here of the innovative methods of dispute resolution developed recently by mediators and coaches , just the same old pig - headed wrestling .
Watching this stupid summit via webcam ( I was n't allowed in either ) , it struck me that the treaty - making system has scarcely changed in 130 years .
There 's a wider range of faces , fewer handlebar moustaches , frock coats or pickelhaubes , but otherwise , when the world 's governments try to decide how to carve up the atmosphere , they might have been attending the conference of Berlin in 1884 .
It 's as if democratisation and the flowering of civil society , advocacy and self - determination had never happened .
Governments , whether elected or not , without reference to their own citizens let alone those of other nations , assert their right to draw lines across the global commons and decide who gets what .
This is a scramble for the atmosphere comparable in style and intent to the scramble for Africa .
At no point has the injustice at the heart of multilateralism been addressed or even acknowledged : the interests of states and the interests of the world 's people are not the same .
Often they are diametrically opposed .
In this case , most rich and rapidly developing states have sought through these talks to seize as great a chunk of the atmosphere for themselves as they can – to grab bigger rights to pollute than their competitors .
The process could n't have been better designed to produce the wrong results .
I spent most of my time at the Klimaforum , the alternative conference set up by just four paid staff , which 50,000 people attended without a hitch .
( I know which team I would put in charge of saving the planet . )
There the barrister Polly Higgins laid out a different approach .
Her declaration of planetary rights invests ecosystems with similar legal safeguards to those won by humans after the second world war .
It changes the legal relationship between humans , the atmosphere and the biosphere from ownership to stewardship .
It creates a global framework for negotiation which gives nation states less discretion to dispose of ecosystems and the people who depend on them .
Even before the farce in Copenhagen began it was looking like it might be too late to prevent two or more degrees of global warming .
The nation states , pursuing their own interests , have each been passing the parcel of responsibility since they decided to take action in 1992 .
We have now lost 17 precious years , possibly the only years in which climate breakdown could have been prevented .
This has not happened by accident : it is the result of a systematic campaign of sabotage by certain states , driven and promoted by the energy industries .
This idiocy has been aided and abetted by the nations characterised , until now , as the good guys : those that have made firm commitments , only to invalidate them with loopholes , false accounting and outsourcing .
In all cases immediate self - interest has trumped the long - term welfare of humankind .
Corporate profits and political expediency have proved more urgent considerations than either the natural world or human civilisation .
Our political systems are incapable of discharging the main function of government : to protect us from each other .
Goodbye Africa , goodbye south Asia ; goodbye glaciers and sea ice , coral reefs and rainforest .
It was nice knowing you .
Not that we really cared .
The governments which moved so swiftly to save the banks have bickered and filibustered while the biosphere burns .
The authors provide examples that will already be familiar to many readers .
But they also offer a valuable new perspective by focusing on the tragicomic miscues of the people who were ostensibly meant to “ govern ” out - of - control managements .
At Lehman , for example , the board failed to put a brake on an expanding portfolio of commercial real estate and risky securities .
Between 2000 and 2007 , while the risk committee met just twice a year , the full board approved salary , stock , options and bonuses for the C.E.O. , Richard Fuld , totaling $ 484 million .
In a September 2008 conference call , Mr. Fuld followed his announcement that the firm had lost $ 3.9 billion in the third quarter by declaring , “ I must say the board ’s been wonderfully supportive . ”
Four days later , Lehman filed for bankruptcy , costing shareholders $ 45 billion .
The authors note that Rick Wagoner , the former General Motors chairman , declared in 2008 that : “ I get good support from the board .
We say , ‘ Here ’s what we ’re going to do and here ’s the time frame , ’ and they say , ‘ Let us know how it comes out . ’ ” ( Memo to the board : your shareholders lost $ 52 billion in equity during Mr. Wagoner ’s watch . )
Mr. Gillespie and Mr. Zweig do not believe that the solution to board laxity lies solely in more regulations .
They complain that boards tend to be focused more on avoiding legal problems than on “ formulating of company strategy , identifying risks , and evaluating executive performance . ”
THE authors conclude with a list of more than two dozen recommendations for comprehensive reform .
These include creating a new class of “ public directors ” appointed to corporations by a special nonprofit organization , reform of voting procedures currently subject to manipulation by management and , simply but perhaps most important , a law prohibiting people from simultaneously holding the positions of chief executive and board chairman .
“ No one can reasonably expect a person to oversee himself or herself , ” the authors say .
“ The C.E.O. works for the board , not the other way around ; the continuation of combined roles inhibits the board in exercising its responsibilities because it creates an insurmountable imbalance of power , ” they write .
But no amount or manner of structural change can ensure that directors will step up and take responsibility for their fiduciary duties to shareholders , the authors assert .
Boards overwhelmed by the power and glory of corporate chieftains tend to commit sins of omission , like not asking probing questions and not challenging management presentations of “ fact , ” rather than sins of commission like active participation in securities fraud .
Mr. Gillespie and Mr. Zweig drive this point home with a bit of black humor as they recount their jailhouse interview with L. Dennis Kozlowski , the former Tyco chairman and chief executive who was convicted of grand larceny and securities fraud .
Asked to articulate the highest praise he could muster for his former board , Mr. Kozlowski replied , “ They did n’t slow me down . ”
Talk about money for nothing .
The biggest military operation of US President Barack Obama 's new Afghan surge will be a test not just for American troops , but also for the Afghan authorities expected to rush with them into the breach .
US Marines are planning a massive operation within days to take Marjah , a warren of canals that forms the last big Taliban enclave in the southern part of Helmand , in the first major show of force since Mr Obama ordered in 30,000 extra troops .
Washington hopes the operation will help decisively turn the momentum this year in a war that commanders accept has been going the enemy 's way .
For Afghan authorities , there is an equally big challenge : to show they finally have the capability to move in and quickly establish a government presence in a place that has been out of their grip for years .
The district governor of Marjah , Haji Zair , who has been able to visit but cannot live in the Taliban - held town , says residents repeatedly beg him to bring foreign and Afghan troops .
" The people every day ask the government for help .
The elders who I contact , educated people , influential people , every day they ask the government to come and make contact and remove the terrorists , " Mr Zair told Reuters in a telephone interview .
" Large numbers of ( Taliban ) are in Marjah .
The people of Marjah are under the control and pressure of the Taliban , they cannot so far have much contact with the government , " he said .
People in Marjah have been informed of plans to secure their town , Mr Zair said , through air - dropped leaflets , radio broadcasts and meetings with tribal elders .
Brigadier General Mohayedin Ghori , commander of an Afghan brigade that will participate in the operation , said Marjah has no police - unless some insurgents have dressed up in uniform .
" Anyone in uniform you know of , he is definitely an enemy , " he added .
The town , a network of desert irrigation canals constructed decades ago under a US - funded development plan , is one of the few places left in Afghanistan 's most dangerous province where the Taliban administers a shadow government and controls a comparatively large population of 75,000 to 100,000 people .
Under the new NATO strategy of commander General Stanley McChrystal , the main goal of US and allied troops is to secure population centres so that the Afghan government can move in .
Although commanders planning the operation do not disclose the size of the forces that will be involved , taking Marjah will be one of NATO 's biggest operations ever in Afghanistan , and by far the biggest for Afghan troops since the war started in 2001 .
Success will not only be a test of NATO 's strength but also of the credibility and effectiveness of the Afghan army , which is under pressure to expand and needs to be ready to take over security in Afghanistan so Western troops can withdraw .
" If what we 're doing today does not involves Afghan forces tomorrow , what are you doing here ?
If everything we 're doing here helps prepare them , that 's the right way to go , " said Brigadier General Larry Nicholson , commander of US Marines in southern Afghanistan .
The Marines have made little secret of their intention to take the town , which General Nicholson said should motivate some inside it to begin contemplating joining the government .
" Because of the inevitability of the operation ... people have decided that they want to talk , " he said .
" There 's a lot of influential people ... they do n't want to be on the wrong side of this operation when it flips . "
" When the Afghan flag 's flying over Marjah they do n't want to be seen as Taliban sympathisers or pariahs , they still want to be seen as people of import . "

Every cook knows the ingredients for making bread : flour , water , yeast , and time .
But what chemical elements are in the recipe of our universe ?
Most of the ingredients are hydrogen and helium .
These cosmic lightweights fill the first two spots on the famous periodic table of the elements .
Less abundant but more familiar to us are the heavier elements , meaning everything listed on the periodic table after hydrogen and helium .
These building blocks , such as iron and other metals , can be found in many of the objects in our daily lives , from teddy bears to teapots .
Recently astronomers used the Suzaku orbiting X - ray observatory , operated jointly by NASA and the Japanese space agency , to discover the largest known reservoir of rare metals in the universe .
Suzaku detected the elements chromium and manganese while observing the central region of the Perseus galaxy cluster .
The metallic atoms are part of the hot gas , or " intergalactic medium , " that lies between galaxies .
" This is the first detection of chromium and manganese from a cluster , " says Takayuki Tamura , an astrophysicist at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency who led the Perseus study .
" Previously , these metals were detected only from stars in the Milky Way or from other galaxies .
This is the first detection in intergalactic space . "
The cluster gas is extremely hot , so it emits X - ray energy .
Suzaku 's instruments split the X - ray energy into its component wavelengths , or spectrum .
The spectrum is a chemical fingerprint of the types and amounts of different elements in the gas .

The portion of the cluster within Suzaku 's field of view is some 1.4 million light - years across , or roughly one - fifth of the cluster 's total width .
It contains a staggering amount of metal atoms .
The chromium is 30 million times the sun 's mass , or 10 trillion times Earth 's mass .
The manganese reservoir weighs in at about 8 million solar masses .
Exploding stars , or supernovas , forge the heavy elements .
The supernovas also create vast outflows , called superwinds .
These galactic gusts transport heavy elements into the intergalactic void .
Harvesting the riches of the Perseus Cluster is not possible .
But researchers will mine the Suzaku X - ray data for scientific insights .
" By measuring metal abundances , we can understand the chemical history of stars in galaxies , such as the numbers and types of stars that formed and exploded in the past , " Tamura says .
The Suzaku study data show it took some 3 billion supernovas to produce the measured amounts of chromium and manganese .
And over periods up to billions of years , superwinds carried the metals out of the cluster galaxies and deposited them in intergalactic space .
A complete history of the universe should include an understanding of how , when , and where the heavy elements formed -- the chemical elements essential to life itself .
The Suzaku study contributes to a larger ongoing effort to take a chemical census of the cosmos .
" It 's a part of learning the entire history of chemical element formation in the universe , " notes Koji Mukai , who heads the Suzaku Guest Observer program at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md .
With more than 10,000 galaxy clusters known , astronomers have just barely begun their work .
" The current Suzaku result cannot answer these big questions immediately , " Tamura says , " but it is one of the first steps to understand the chemical history of the universe . "
The study appeared in the November 1 issue of The Astrophysical Journal Letters .
The Supreme Court ’s decision in Citizens United v. FEC has opened the floodgates to corporate money in federal campaigns in ways we have n’t seen for nearly a century .
While for decades corporations have been able to set up special accounts , called PACs , to accept contributions and spend them on political activities , they have not been allowed to spend money from their vast corporate treasuries in connection with federal elections .
Citizens United v. FEC has changed all that .
In this case , the Court took a narrow campaign finance issue and decided a much broader one -- whether a century of laws protecting against corruption in government , laws which have been repeatedly upheld as constitutional , should suddenly be overturned .
While the core of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act ( BCRA ) , often known as McCain - Feingold , is n’t affected by this decision , the decision does eviscerate longstanding campaign finance law .
Below are some key points about the decision , and how the Court ’s move to overrule Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce ( 1991 ) and portions of McConnell v. FEC ( 2003 ) will undermine our democratic process ...
How Unlimited Corporate Spending on Advertising May Impact Campaigns
Corporations have huge war chests that far exceed current spending in our political system .
During the 2008 election cycle , Fortune 500 companies alone had profits of $ 743 billion .
By comparison , spending by candidates , outside groups , and political parties on the last presidential election totaled just over $ 2 billion .
That is a lot of money , but it ’s nothing compared to what corporations and unions have in their treasuries .
The Supreme Court has now allowed unlimited corporate spending on campaigns .
That means , for example , that Wall Street banks and firms , having just taken our country into its worst economic collapse since the Great Depression , could spend millions upon millions of dollars on ads directly advocating the defeat of those candidates who want to prevent future economic disaster by imposing new financial services regulations .
Congress Acted to Curb Corruption for a Reason
Congress long ago placed reasonable limits on corporate spending in order to preserve the importance of individual citizens ’ votes and to curb corruption , and the appearance of corruption , in government .
Congress struck back against the power of the trusts with the Tillman Act , and passed the Federal Election Campaign Act in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal .
Then , after many other scandals in the years that followed , including the controversy surrounding overnight stays in the Lincoln Bedroom and exclusive White House coffees for big donors , it passed the BCRA .
The Court ’s decision , while it does leave the core of McCain - Feingold intact , in many ways takes us back to the era of the robber barons in the 19th century .
The Court Ignored Longstanding Legal Principles
In its ruling , the Court ignored several time - honored principles that have served for the past two centuries to preserve the public ’s respect for and acceptance of its decisions .
This decision runs contrary to the concept of “ judicial restraint , ” the idea that a court should decide a case on constitutional grounds only if absolutely necessary , and should rule as narrowly as possible .
Here , the Court did just the opposite -- it decided the constitutionality of all restrictions on corporate spending in connection with elections in an obscure case in which many far more narrow rulings were possible .
The Court also ignored stare decisis , the historic respect for precedent , which Chief Justice John Roberts termed “ judicial modesty ” during his 2005 confirmation hearing .
It ’s hard to imagine a bigger blow to stare decisis than to strike down laws in over 20 states and a federal law that has been the cornerstone of the nation ’s campaign finance system for 100 years .
Finally , the Court ignored the longstanding practice of deciding a case only after lower courts have fully examined the facts .
Here , because the broad constitutional questions raised in the recent reargument of the case were not raised in the court below , there is no factual record at all on which the Court could base its legal conclusions .
Just a little over six years ago in the McConnell opinion , the Court said that the prohibition on corporations and unions dipping into their treasuries to influence campaigns was ‘ firmly embedded in our law . ’
The only thing that has changed since then is the composition of the Court .
It is deeply disappointing that this Court , and particularly its newest members , had so little respect for precedent .
This decision will surely undermine public confidence in the Court as well as damage our nation ’s political system .
Last night we took at first look at the long anticipated corporate move , through the 5 Supreme Court judges they own -- against Democracy .
almst non-existent in that post is Russ Feingold , the author of the law that the 5 reactionary Justices cut to pieces .
That 's because we thought Russ should have a post all to himself .
Here 's his fact sheet on .
He 's relieved that wjat he calls the core of McCain - Feingold -- the ban on soft - money contributions to political parties -- still stands , he 's concerned that the decision ignored long - standing legal principles instituted under President Teddy Roosevelt and upends a century 's worth of campaign finance law designed to stem corruption in government .
As so many reform - minded progressives reminded us yesterday , the narrow decision by the far right judges turns back progress , exactly what they were put in place to do .

A teenage Virginia athlete is in a wheel chair now after suffering Guillain - Barre Syndrome within hours after receiving an H1N1 swine flu vaccine shot .
14 - year - old Jordan McFarland developed severe headaches , muscle spasms and weakness in his legs after being injected .
He will need " extensive physical therapy " to recovery , reports MSNBC .
Plus , he 'll need the help of a walker for four to six weeks .
Guillain - Barre Syndrome ( GBS ) is the name given to anyone who exhibits a particular set of neurological symptoms including muscle weakness and muscle spasms .
GBS is now increasingly occurring following H1N1 vaccine injections .
It was diagnosed in thousands of patients following the 1976 swine flu vaccine scare , and it appears to be recurring here in 2009 as the swine flu vaccine makes it into more widespread distribution .
Health authorities , however , remain adamant that H1N1 vaccines arethe cause of GBS , and that such diagnoses are " pure coincidence . "
This blatantly unscientific P.R. tactic is designed to dismiss any and all concerns over the neurological side effects of H1N1 vaccines by simply denying they exist .
To date , the CDC has received reports of five additional people being diagnosed with GBS following swine flu vaccinations , but it dismisses them all as coincidence .
" It 's much less than we 'd expect , " says CDC official Dr. Claudia J. Vellozzi .
( Which is sort of interesting all by itself , because it reveals that the CDC expects a lot more people to get GBS following vaccine injections ... )
At the same time , part of the reason the CDC is n't receiving many reports on neurological disorders caused by H1N1 vaccines is because they participated inthat prepped the population to dismiss all side effects by pre-announcing the bizarre idea that " side effects experienced after vaccine injections are not related to vaccines .
" This was an organized , nationwide media brainwashing campaign engineered by the CDC , FDA and drug companies .
It sought to pre-program health consumers to automatically dismiss serious side effects that appeared in the hours after receiving swine flu vaccine injections .
The campaign worked .
In fact , even the GBS of this young man , Jordan McFarland , was n't submitted to the CDC .
It only came to light when his step - mother submitted details to MSNBC .
com's .
In other words , this wasat work , where a parent submitted information directly to the media .
For this to occur is exceedingly rare .
Most parents would simply wait for their doctor to submit such information to health authorities , not knowing that submitting reports of vaccine - related side effectsin modern medicine .
You read that right :
There is no requirement that doctors send reports of vaccine side effects to any health authority at all .
And that raises the question :
So how do they really know how many people are suffering neurological side effects from the H1N1 vaccines ?
The answer ?
Nobody knows .
And that 's the way the drug companies ( and the CDC ) would like to keep it .
Because reports of neurological disorders tend to ( understandably ) freak people out and make them more cautious about receiving swine flu vaccines -- especially given how mild swine flu is in the first place .
As drug companies well know , the best way to sell more vaccines is to pretend the side effects do n't exist at all .
That has become the standard operating procedure of the vaccine industry :
Deny , deny , deny .
Bury the truth and pretend it does n't exist .
Keep the vaccines flowing and keep consumers guessing .
Declare all vaccines to be perfectly safe with zero side effects , and widen the target consumer base to include children and pregnant women .
This is the mantra of the vaccine industry .
Consider this :
If teen boys wound up in the hospital after taking , the FDA and media would have gone crazy over the report .
The FDA would have issued public warnings and perhaps even confiscated the products from the supplement manufacturer .
Or if these kinds of symptoms were being reported after people take , you 'd see a similar media frenzy as accusations of the dangers of the herbs appeared all over the 'net .
But somehow when the medicine is -- a vaccine that has NEVER been tested in a scientific clinical trial -- the drug industry gets a free pass !
All side effects are dismissed .
All the people hospitalized , paralyzed or killed are simply forgotten and written off as unimportant .
This is the state of the vaccine industry today :
It is corrupt , highly dishonest industry that poses a clear and present danger to the health of the People .
And yet .
No clinical trials are being done .
No cautions are being advised .
All concerns are simply dismissed out of hand , with absolutely no intelligent scrutiny or investigation .
That 's really what the vaccine industry has become today : A cabal of " untouchables . "
You can't question vaccines without being derided as a quack .
You can't demand vaccine clinical trials without being labeled a " non-believer .
"
You 're supposed to simply line up , take your vaccine shot , obey all directives ( do what you 're told ) and above all But here at NaturalNews , we refuse to stop asking questions .
In fact , all the time , like why is a healthy young boy suddenly in a wheel chair within hours after receiving a swine flu vaccine shot ?
Why have no placebo - controlled clinical trials ever been conducted on ANY flu vaccine ?
Why do we even need a shot for H1N1 when the epidemic is so mild that it has only killed a fraction of the number of people who normally die from seasonal flu ?
Why did the FDA grant approval for four H1N1 vaccines all on the same day , without any scientific testing at all ?
Why are people so easily brainwashed / scared into taking vaccine shots when all they really need is vitamin D?
And for that matter , why does there continue to be a media blackout on the use of vitamin D to prevent swine flu infections ?
These are the questions we should be asking , but these are the questions considered " off limits " by health authorities and the complicit mainstream media .
At least MSNBC had the guts to print this story about 14 - year - old Jordan McFarland .
Most media outlets would have simply canned the story right from the start .

FAREED ZAKARIA GPS
Interview With Hillary Clinton
Aired August 9 , 2009 - 13:00 ET
THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT .
THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED .
FAREED ZAKARIA , HOST : This is GPS , the GLOBAL PUBLIC SQUARE .
Welcome to all of you in the United States and around the world .
I'm Fareed Zakaria .
We have a special program for you today .
I spent some time with Hillary Clinton on her longest trip as secretary of state through Africa .
And in Nairobi , the capital of Kenya , I sat down with her for a wide - ranging conversation on everything from Iran to her relationship with Barack Obama .
And , yes , I did ask her what her husband was up to in North Korea .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
ZAKARIA : You -- famously , now -- compared North Korea to an unruly teenager demanding attention .
And you said , " I 'm not going to give them that kind of attention . "
But did n't your husband do precisely that , give them the attention they sought with this extraordinarily high - level visit ?
They were demanding attention , and he gave it to them .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
ZAKARIA : Hillary Clinton continues to fascinate , even in her role as America 's chief diplomat .
And there 's a good reason for it .
It is extremely rare to find that the chief political rival of a candidate has been offered a high post in his Cabinet .
That might be a feature of the European political system , but in America it 's rare .
In fact , one probably has to go back 150 years to find a parallel .
And the parallel is quite striking .
Then , the Republican Party 's frontrunner from the State of New York , a seasoned politician with much experience , was William Henry Seward .
But the party chose to pass over him in favor of a one - term congressman from Illinois with a reputation for soaring rhetoric and idealism -- a man named Abraham Lincoln .
Lincoln then goes and appoints Seward his secretary of state .
So , also , the seasoned Hillary lost out to a newcomer from Illinois , and Obama appointed her secretary of state .
But almost everything else is different today .
The secretary of state was once the unrivaled architect of American foreign policy .
But now , he or she competes with the secretary of defense , the national security adviser , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and others who make up the far - flung levels of America 's imperial administration .
The State Department was once across the street from the White House .
But as the White House staff grew , the department moved in the 1950s into its own insular building -- perhaps aptly named -- Foggy Bottom .
Dean Acheson , the secretary of state who approved the move , said distance would n't matter much , since the secretary was bound to be the chief adviser to the president .
It did n't turn out to be true .
And over the last 40 years , often the secretary of state has been something of a figurehead , while the national security adviser has become the personal strategist and chief diplomat of the president .
When Henry Kissinger became secretary of state , he found that the one way to end that rivalry way for a while to occupy both positions .
Now , many believe that in the Obama administration the White House is where the policy action is , not the various Cabinet agencies .
But Hillary Clinton is different , is n't she ?
She is still an enormously popular figure in the Democratic Party , still one of the most admired Americans , both at home and abroad , and still a woman of formidable talent and drive .
Can she use all that to carve out her role ?
And what distinctive mark does she want to leave in her position as secretary of state ?
What is her vision for the world ?
These are some of the questions I asked her in Nairobi , Kenya .
So , let 's get started .
( BEGIN VIDEO )
ZAKARIA : Madam Secretary , thank you very much for taking time out of this very hectic schedule to spend it with us .
HILLARY CLINTON , U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE : Thank you , Fareed .
And thank you for coming to Nairobi for this opportunity .
ZAKARIA : It 's my pleasure .
North Korea -- tell us a little bit more about it .
So , President Clinton comes back .
He spends three hours talking to the leader of North Korea , Kim Jong -il .
What was his impression of him ?
CLINTON : Well , we 're going to get a full debriefing , which we really have n't had the chance to get .
ZAKARIA : But you must have spoken to him on the phone .
CLINTON : Well , I have spoken to him on the phone .
But I have this policy : I never talk about what I talk to my husband about , Fareed .
But I think he 's going to be able to meet with a lot of our administration officials over the next days and weeks to share his impressions , along with other members of his delegation .
Obviously , what we 're hoping is that , maybe without it being part of the mission in any way , the fact that this was done will perhaps lead the North Koreans to recognize that they can have a positive relationship with us .
I mean , remember , when I first went to Japan and South Korea and China right out of the box as secretary of state , I said , look , we have to get back to the full and verifiable denuclearization of the peninsula .
But we want to take steps to move toward normalization with North Korea .
We have no designs on North Korea .
We 're not in any way intending to threaten North Korea in an offensive manner .
Our concern is what they do internally that then threatens our allies and our partners and eventually us .
You know , it 's not a good feeling to see them exporting nuclear technology as they have , or to continue to build up their own capacity .
So , we reached out to the North Koreans and made it very clear that we wanted to create that kind of engagement .
And they not only rejected it , but they began to take these provocative actions , which resulted in the entire international community -- most importantly China -- saying , wait , you can't do this .
ZAKARIA : But the Bill Clinton mission , it was unorthodox .
I mean , here you have a former president going on what appeared to be a state visit from the way in which he was greeted , being received by North Korea 's top nuclear negotiator .
CLINTON : This , as you know , came from the families .
I mean , this was a message that Laura and Euna were given by the North Koreans , which they passed on to their families and former Vice President Gore ...
ZAKARIA : Naming him specifically .
CLINTON : ... naming him specifically .
And then they passed it on , obviously , as they should , to the rest of us .
And it was not anything Bill was interested in , seeking or even contemplating .
But , of course , when Vice President Gore called , and when our administration evaluated it and began to brief him , he said , look , if you think it 's the right thing to do , and if you think I should do it , of course I will do it .
But it is a private humanitarian mission .
It was not in any way an official government mission .
ZAKARIA : But John Bolton , the former U.N. ambassador , says ...
( LAUGHTER )
ZAKARIA : Should I even go on ?
CLINTON : I 'm sorry .
No , you really should n't .
( LAUGHTER )
ZAKARIA : But he says this is rewarding hostage - taking .
CLINTON : Oh , well , you know ...
ZAKARIA : Why is he wrong ?
Because they effectively took hostages .
CLINTON : We 've done this so many times before .
I mean , we 've had former presidents do it .
We 've had sitting members of Congress do it .
It is something that -- it is absolutely not rewarding them .
It is not in any way responding to specific demands .
It is a recognition that certain countries that I think are kind of beyond the pale of the rule of law hold people and subject them to long prison terms that are absolutely unfair and unwarranted .
And maybe it 's the fact I have a daughter , but I believed that , if we could bring these young women home , we should bring them home .
And it had nothing to do with our policy .
And of course , you know , you mentioned somebody who -- heavens , if President Obama walked on water , you 'd say he could n't swim .
So , I mean , it 's just not something that I think is relevant to what we 're trying to do .
ZAKARIA : Speaking of hard negotiations , the unusual circumstances of your becoming secretary of state , you know there 's a lot of ...
CLINTON : " Unusual " is an understated way of saying it .
ZAKARIA : Well , there 's no way around talking about this partnership or this relationship with Barack Obama ...
CLINTON : Right .
ZAKARIA : ... because it is very unusual in the American political context to have the chief rival of a presidential candidate then become part of his Cabinet .
And people have often referred to the experience of Abraham Lincoln picking William Henry Seward .
CLINTON : I think that , in many ways , the policies that President Obama and I talked about during the campaign were maybe difference in degree , not kind .
We have a world view that says America should be leading by example .
You know , it 's not the -- I think my husband said it , actually -- it 's not the example of our power , but the power of our example that we want to convey .
And so , when the president asked me to consider this , I was personally very surprised .
And I became even more surprised when accounts of the campaign came out and said that he'd been thinking about it for some time .
But I also believe that what I brought to the job , the real commitment that I have to being not just effective , but being part of a team that 's effective , which the president knows -- we served in the Senate together -- has really worked out better than anybody could have predicted .
I think our personal relationship has certainly deepened and broadened over the course of the last six - and - a - half months , the time that we spend together , the difficult problems that we wrestle with .
But also , the team -- Bob Gates and I , Jim Jones and I , others who work with us -- are really open .
And Henry Kissinger said to me that he was very surprised .
It was the first administration he could remember where , if he talked to me and then he talked to somebody in the White House , he got the same story .
And it 's because we really try to hash out problems in private .
We really understand the significance of the responsibilities that we shoulder at a time of great peril and promise in American history .
And the president is a disciplined , decisive interlocutor in the meetings that we have .
So it 's been a rewarding professional and personal experience .
ZAKARIA : So , you 've watched two White Houses up close .
What would you say is the principal difference between the way Bill Clinton ran the White House and Barack Obama runs the White House ?
CLINTON : Well , I think both of them bring just enormous intelligence to the job .
I mean , obviously , I know Bill much better .
But I have seen in President Obama , as well , just an intelligence that is so compelling , to struggle with the difficult issues that are put before you .
I think that the time in which Bill served was so different from the time in which President Obama is serving .
And in the White House , I think , you know , Bill is very -- you know , constantly seeking out information , always trying to figure out where to end up .
And he does it in a very public way .
I mean , " Well , what do you think , Fareed ?
Tell me that . "
I think that President Obama is very clear about the process that he wants to lead to his decision .
I think , obviously , my husband made a lot of great decisions for our country , and I think that President Obama is doing the same .
ZAKARIA : Do you worry , though , that with a president who is very interested in foreign policy , as President Obama is , with a national security staff which has many of his old campaign aides on it , that inevitably power will move more and more closely to the White House and things will -- policy will be made there ?
CLINTON : No .
I do n't worry about that for a couple of reasons .
First of all , because I 'm not exactly a shrinking violet .
And my opinions are not only sought , but listened to .
And I appreciate that very much .
And obviously , we do our homework in the State Department so that when we tee - up something , we can both explain it and defend it .
And I have a great team , Jim Steinberg , Jack Lew , Cheryl Mills , and everybody in the political side , and then these extremely professional foreign service and civil service people .
So , we are the implementers , there is no doubt about that .
The White House cannot implement policy .
But the partnership between the White House , the State Department , the Defense Department , and occasionally other -- the intelligence departments , both the DNI and CIA , and then others coming in -- is truly a team effort .
And I think that the White House , in a complicated world with a government as big as ours , has to coordinate .
I mean , that is one of its principal roles .
And I think the NSC is really growing into an understanding of how best to fulfill its role .
It can not implement .
It can not execute .
And you need very good , solid relationships with the rest of the government to make sure that your policies and the direction you want to set are actually followed up on .
So , when it comes to making policy , I think that we 've had such a seamless , ongoing dialogue about everything that -- you know , I 've been around Washington long enough unfortunately to know that there will always be people who want to take credit wherever they are , or who want to try to take advantage over somebody 's disadvantage .
But there 's been so little of that .
And instead , it 's a really serious , professional operation .

CLINTON : And it is a sign of weakness .
It demonstrates , I think , better than any of us could ever say , that this Iranian leadership is afraid of their own people .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
( BEGIN VIDEO )
ZAKARIA : On Iran , there are a number of people , as you know , who argue that the president and you were too slow to condemn what seems to have been fraud in the elections , too slow to offer support to people on the ground , because you wanted to preserve the option of negotiating with Iran .
Can you really negotiate with Iran at this point ?
I understand , in general , one negotiates with all kinds of regimes .
But practically speaking , right now , with Ahmadinejad having been inaugurated in a very disputed atmosphere , wo n't you be legitimizing him if you negotiate with him ?
CLINTON : We did not want to get between the legitimate protests and demonstrations of the Iranian people and the leadership .
And we knew that , if we stepped in too soon , too hard , the attention might very well shift and the leadership would try to use us to unify the country against the protesters .
And that was -- it was a hard judgment call .
But I think we , in retrospect , handled it pretty well .
Now , behind the scenes , we were doing a lot , as you know .
One of our young people in the State Department got twittered , you know , " Keep going , " despite the fact that they had planned for a technical shutdown .
So , we were doing a lot to really empower the protesters without getting in the way .
And we 're continuing to speak out and support the opposition .
On the question of engagement , that has been the president 's policy .
We have made it clear .
We have communicated in a number of ways to the Iranian leadership .
But we are under no illusions .
We were under no illusions before their elections that we can get the kind of engagement we are seeking .
The president has also said , look , we need to take stock of this in September .
If there is a response , it needs to be on a fast track .
We 're not going to keep the window open forever .
But we 're not just sitting here waiting for somebody in Iran to say , well , let 's talk .
We 're working with our allies to make the case that we need to have prepared a very robust set of sanctions that we can get the international community to sign off on , the way we did with North Korea .
We are also , though , looking at an incentive package .
You know , we 've got to be able to say to the Iranians , well , here 's what is in it for you , if you get back into the good graces of the international community on your nuclear program , you forswear nuclear weapons , you take appropriate safeguards regarding any kind of civil nuclear program .
ZAKARIA : I have to ask you a question that is of personal interest .
A " Newsweek " reporter , Maziar Bahari , has been arrested , and is now going through what can only be called a kind of Stalinist show trial .
What is your reaction to that ?
CLINTON : Well , I am just appalled at the treatment that Mr. Bahari and others are receiving .
It is a show trial .
There is no doubt about it .
And it has caught up journalists and clerics and former elected officials , and even people in the current -- what was the government before the elections .
And it is a sign of weakness .
It demonstrates , I think , better than any of us could ever say , that this Iranian leadership is afraid of their own people , and afraid of the truth and the facts coming out .
We 've expressed our concern about Mr. Bahari 's confinement and now the trial .
As you know , he 's a Canadian .
And we have certainly told the government of Canada that we would be willing to do whatever is appropriate .
They have thanked us for that , thanked us for our concern .
They believe that they should take the lead on that , and we 're supporting them .
ZAKARIA : Let me ask you about Afghanistan .
It 's a little bit confusing , I think , to Americans to understand where we are , because it seems as though there was an Afghanistan strategic review .
The president made clear that he was sending troops , but also that this seemed , from a lot of the body language , to be the final increase in troops that Afghanistan would receive .
Secretary Gates on our program said , it would be a very hard sell to send any more troops .
Now , we have a new commander in the field .
There is some talk of perhaps needing more troops .
Secretary Gates has said , well , now , maybe I 'm open to it .
All this happening against a backdrop of the worst month of U.S. casualties in Afghanistan .
Why are the casualties rising ?
And is sending more troops there , in these circumstances , sending more troops into a black hole ?
CLINTON : Well , Fareed , the strategic review on Afghanistan , which set forth an approach that we 're following , made it clear that we needed to integrate military and civilian assets and try to build up the Afghan national army and an Afghan police force as quickly as possible .
What we 're finding is that that is the key .
If you read the accounts of what our Marines and soldiers are encountering , it 's tough fighting .
I mean , they are really taking it to the Taliban in areas that have been largely uncontested .
And ...
ZAKARIA : So , you think this is a little bit like the surge in Iraq , that once you start engaging the enemy , inevitably your casualties mount , and perhaps this might even be a sign of success ?
CLINTON : There are certainly military experts and analysts who believe that , who are explaining to me and to others that what we 're seeing is tragic .
And the loss of life is something that I deeply regret .
I mean , nobody is more anxious than the president and I are for us to be successful and to be able to send our young men and women home .
But not being on the sidelines , moving out of the comfort zone -- remember that British and NATO forces have also suffered their greatest losses -- is a kind of combat challenge that the Taliban has been able to avoid up until now .
But no decisions have been made about the military side of our strategy .
There is a lot of discussion going on .
And what I like about the president and the White House , and the team that we have , is that we 're always asking , " Well , what are we doing ?
Can we do it better ?
What are the costs ?
What are the consequences ? "
So , there has been no decision .
But I think it 's important for the American people to know that we have our best commanders .
We have our best civilian team .
We have an embassy headed by a former general who served in Afghanistan , but who really gets the civilian component of this , to other ambassadors who are there to run our aid program and to work on the political dynamics inside of Afghanistan .
We 're trying to make sure that there is a as free and fair and legitimate election as can be held on August 20th .
And then , once there is a winner of this election , we have some very hard asks about what we expect from the government of Afghanistan .
And first and foremost is helping us expedite the training of an Afghan national army that will help our forces hold ground and then take over that responsibility .
ZAKARIA : Is the current administration in Afghanistan being a useful partner , both in terms of trying to do this stuff and actually getting it done ?
Or could one potentially see a change in administration in Afghanistan as a good thing ?
CLINTON : Well , we 're actively impartial in what 's going on in Afghanistan in terms of the election .
I think it has surprised people that this has turned into a real election .
There are campaign rallies .
There is radio and television advertising .
I think the incumbent , obviously , as incumbents do , has an advantage .
But very vigorous campaigns are being run by several contestants .
So , we 're just going to do every we can to make sure the election is fair .
And then , once there is a winner , we will work .
Now , the previous years of the term of President Karzai has been mixed .
I mean , in some areas we 've made a lot of progress and have had a very good relationship .
In other areas it needs improvement .
So , we will work with whomever the people of Afghanistan select , but we will be very specific about what we need to see coming from the government .

CLINTON : My daughter is her own person .
She 's very independent .
So , I will convey this very kind offer .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
ZAKARIA : We 'll get back to my one - on - one with Secretary Clinton in just a moment .
But first , something I want to show you from a town hall meeting the secretary of state held at the University of Nairobi .
I was the moderator .
There were deep , insightful questions from the audience about America 's relations with the world , and whether our policies toward Africa are working -- some of which we 'll bring you next week .
And then there was one question from me , which some might say was less deep and insightful .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
ZAKARIA : This is a news report I saw while preparing for this town hall .
And it involves a woman , a young woman , a very attractive young woman .
A Kenyan city councilman says he offered Bill Clinton 40 goats and 20 cows for his daughter 's hand in marriage five years ago .
( LAUGHTER )
He is still awaiting an answer .
And I thought on this occasion , you know , Mrs. Clinton , if you think about ...
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
If you think , in the current global economic climate , where asset values have gone down , your stock portfolio is probably down , your government has had -- your husband has had to do a little bit of government work , take time off from the private sector -- it 's not a bad offer .
( LAUGHTER )
CLINTON : Well ...
( LAUGHTER )
CLINTON : My daughter is her own person .
She 's very independent .
So , I will convey this very kind offer .
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
( END VIDEO CLIP )
ZAKARIA : Alas , I 've been here for a few days , and nobody has offered me any goats or cows .
We 'll be right back .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
CLINTON : And , you know , I 'm actually cautiously optimistic that we will be able to tee - up negotiations .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
ZAKARIA : You and the president have both communicated to the government of Israel that you do not want any more settlements .
You were very clear in your statement .
You said , no exceptions .
And yet , the government in Israel seems to be making an exception .
Do you intend to , in any way , enforce that view that the United States has , to ensure that the government of Israel does not do what you do n't want it to do , which is to expand the settlements in the West Bank ?
CLINTON : Well , as you know , we 're in the midst of the very intense negotiations that Senator Mitchell is carrying out .
And I think both Israel and the United States are working from a position of friendship , a durable partnership , a commitment by the United States to the security of Israel , which is absolutely imperative and non- negotiable .
But there are steps we would like to see all the parties take , in order to maximize the chances for success of the negotiations to reach a comprehensive peace that results in a two - state solution .
And there are areas where Senator Mitchell is hammering out the details with the Israelis , with the Palestinians , with Arab countries .
And , you know , I 'm actually cautiously optimistic that we will be able to tee - up negotiations .
Now , there 's now guarantee .
These are very , very difficult issues to resolve .
But I think that , starting with Prime Minister Netanyahu 's important speech where he accepted the two - state solution and laid out ...
ZAKARIA : But placed conditions on it that the Palestinians regard as entirely unacceptable .
CLINTON : Well , but both sides do that .
I mean , you know , that 's politics .
That 's negotiations .
I mean , people are likely to end up in a place that makes neither of them happy .
And then the rest of us can say , well , that 's probably a good outcome .
But they start from maximalist positions .
That 's where people , obviously , begin .
ZAKARIA : But the relationship with Israel has been prickly .
I 'll give you one example .
You extended a kind of nuclear umbrella , the prospect of a nuclear umbrella , to Israel and potentially other countries in the Gulf .
And , I mean , we 're talking about the Iranian nuclear program .
The response from the Israeli government was to criticize you , was to say that you were giving in to -- you know , accepting an Iranian nuclear program .
Were you surprised by their response ?
CLINTON : Well , I think they misunderstood what I was saying .
I said , " defense umbrella . "
I did n't specify what kind of defensive measures might be available to those in the region .
But I clearly was sending a message to Iran .
And we 've , obviously , explained that to our friends in Israel .
But the message was to make clear to whoever is making decisions in Iran these days , particularly about something as important as their nuclear weapons potential , that if they believed that this would give them a more secure position , a greater capacity to influence events , to intimidate their neighbors , to expand the reach of their ideology , they were mistaken , that there was no chance in the world that , even if they were to obtain that -- and it was obviously prefaced and meant in that way , because our position remains the same .
We do not intend to accept nuclear weapons by Iran .
We think that is unacceptable .
But for the sake of argument , and for the sake of their calculus , if that is among their objectives , they need to think again , because they will render their position less secure .
They will trigger an arms race in the region , and they will certainly put greater pressure on the United States to extend a defense umbrella in order to hem in and contain them .
So , I just wanted to be sure that they were thinking like we were thinking .
And I think the Israeli response only looked at the fact that , oh , my gosh , well , does that mean you 're changing your policy , that now somehow it 's acceptable ?
No , of course not .
We think this influences the thinking inside Iran .
ZAKARIA : You just got through a bilateral with China , a strategic and economic set of meetings .
Do you believe that China is now assured that the United States is managing its fiscal house well ?
The concerns that they have publicly made several times about their fears of an American deficit , of management of the dollar , were those -- in those discussions , did you get a sense that they are breathing a sigh of relief ?
CLINTON : I think that it is fair to say that they are somewhat reassured .
I think Secretary Geithner and Larry Summers and the economic team have done an excellent job of keeping the Chinese informed about the steps that we were taking in our government .
I think the recent signs of stabilizing in our own economy have been reassuring .
Obviously , we are not out of the woods yet .
And neither are they .
But it is fair to say that the , in my view , the very large stimulus that both of our countries took -- ours in dollar terms bigger than theirs , but as a percentage of their economy quite significant for them -- have really helped to get the global economic engines at least beginning to turn on .
The problem , of course , is that both of us may well have been , prior to this recession , on unsustainable pathways .
We could not continue to spend the way we 'd spent on an individual level or a government level .
And now , of course , our deficit 's even greater , which the president has said is going to be addressed .
They have an export - driven approach , but at some point they 're going to have to stimulate internal demand .
So ...
ZAKARIA : Did they make any assurances that they were going to do that ?
Because right now , it is the government spending , the Chinese government and not the Chinese consumer .
CLINTON : That 's right .
Well , but they are taking some steps toward creating what we would call a safety net , some kind of health insurance program , some kind of Social Security - type program , because you have to render people secure if you expect them to spend .
Otherwise , they have to keep their own money under the mattress or in the bank , so that they can draw it down when they need it .
And American consumers have spent in a way that kept the global economy afloat for years now .
I mean , if you think of the global economy before the recession , it was like an inverted triangle resting on the shoulders of the American consumer .
But I think spending habits , at least in the short term within our country , are not going to be what they were before .
So , it is in everyone 's interests that some of the developing economies do more to generate internal demand .
So , we face our challenges .
I think we have gotten through this first period better than many had expected .
We still have some choppy water ahead , but the president 's view is that we inherited this terrible crisis .
You know , the ship of state has been stabilized , but now we have to determine what direction we go .
And I certainly believe we 're going to have to go in the direction of lowering our deficit , reforming some of our entitlement programs , encouraging more exporting of our economy , which means investing in our manufacturing sector , which is part of what I hope comes from the stimulus bill and the investment in clean energy .
So , there is a lot to be done , but I think the Chinese are breathing a little easier .
ZAKARIA : Speaking of final questions , speaking of hard negotiations , what message would you have to the Senate Democrats who seem to be holding up the passage of a comprehensive health care bill ?
Or are they amending it in ways that are useful and productive ?
CLINTON : Well , actually , I think that it 's a very healthy process that 's going on .
They are having to hammer out all of their differences .
And there are serious differences -- in viewpoint , for example .
But what the president has said , and what I believe is the right approach , is that this can't be put off any longer .
Back in '93 and ' 94 , when I was on the front lines and taking all the incoming fire on this issue , people did n't really accept in their gut that we had to do this .
They kept thinking there 's another way out of this , and it 's not that bad .
And we 'll try , you know , managed care , and we 'll try more HMOs .
We 'll try all of that .
And now , all these years later , we realize that we have some fundamental problems with our existing system that have to be addressed .
So , I actually believe that , at the end of the day , with all of this negotiation and back - and - forth , you know , we 're going to come up with something .
My hope is that it 's going to be meaningful enough to make a difference , to make a difference on the cost side , which is the paramount issue for people like us who have insurance -- OK , how do we keep affording it and making sure that it is of high quality -- assurances that what we 're going to do on the public side , the Medicaid and Medicare programs , are not going to undermine those programs in ways that they can't deliver cost - effective quality care ; getting people insured and moving as rapidly as possibly toward universal care ; changing the delivery system and the incentives so that we actually figure out ways to reward prevention , pay for prevention .
You know , in ' 93 , for example , Fareed , I had a man who became a friend of mine , but I did n't know him at the time , Dean Ornish .
He came to see me , and he said , look , I have proof ...
ZAKARIA : This is the doctor ...
CLINTON : ... who did a lot of work on cardiovascular health .
And he said , " I have proof that changes in diet , stress reduction , exercise are as effective , if not more effective , than medical interventions in lowering people 's overall threat of heart disease .
He said , " But I ca n't get Medicare to pay for somebody going to an exercise class , or to pay for a nutritionist to come to their house and talk to them . "
Well , we worked and worked on that all through the time my husband was president .
And then , finally , sometime during the Bush administration , the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid , CMS , said , " OK , fine , we 'll begin to pay for this . "
Well , it should n't be that hard .
You know , we 're more than happy to pay for a pill or pay for a procedure .
How do we change behaviors ?
How we convince the medical establishment to do that ?
There 's just a lot that needs to be at least included , even if we can't get to the finish line right away .
ZAKARIA : You 're passionate about this .
Do you ever wish that you were back in the White House running it ?
CLINTON : Well , I feel like I , you know , I gave .
( LAUGHTER )
I gave my blood , sweat and tears .
And I think we -- despite all of the difficulties of that effort -- we got people thinking , and we helped to further the debate .
It was disappointing that we did n't get it all done , but we got the Children 's Health Insurance Program done .
We got portable insurance .
We got some things accomplished in the '90s .
And actually , under the Bush administration some changes were made , so that the government said to the hospitals , we 're not going to pay for what are , you know , for what are " never events . "
Nobody should get bed sores .
People should be given an aspirin if they come in and get their pneumonia shot -- things that really should be required .
So , we made progress .
But the problem is that we just never got to a critical mass of progress , and that 's what I 'm hoping to see now .
ZAKARIA : Madam Secretary , thank you so much .
CLINTON : Thank you .
Good to talk to you .
ZAKARIA : A pleasure .

ZAKARIA : Now for our " What in the World " segment .
Here 's what caught my attention this week .
It 's a Web site .
And unless you read Farsi , you probably do n't know what it says .
So , let me explain .
It 's the Web site of the former president of Iran , Mohammad Khatami .
And he declares the ongoing trials of some 100 Iranian opposition figures , politicians , journalists , to be show trials .
It is the latest in an ever - escalating series of charges made by major leaders in Iran against the regime .
And I can safely say that Khatami's charge is true , because my friend and colleague , Maziar Bahari , is on trial .
He 's a Newsweek reporter and an award - winning documentary filmmaker .
He 's appeared as a guest on this program .
He was arrested in Tehran on June 21st .
In the six weeks since then , he has had no access to a lawyer , and he has not been able to see his family .
And over the weekend , Maziar " confessed , " saying Western media helped cause the chaos after Ahmadinejad 's disputed election .
It is a lie .
Maziar obviously knows it 's a lie .
And the Iranian government knows it 's a lie .
After all , it 's a lie that they -- those in power in Iran -- forced him to speak .
And that is what a show trial is all about .
It is a phrase usually connected with Joseph Stalin , the ruthless Soviet dictator .
In the late 1930s , Stalin tried 50 - odd men in mass trials for crimes against the state .
Sound familiar ?
In fact , the similarities between the Soviet trials of 70 years ago and the Iranian trials of today is striking .
Large rooms filled with row upon row upon row of men .
At the front , full rows of the accused , many looking weary , downtrodden .
Many of those in the front , former key government officials who helped build the revolutionary regime , only now to see it put them on trial .
And when their time comes to take the stand , they confess , saying whatever the regime wants them to , hoping that it means they will be treated less harshly , hoping that one day they might be able to be free , hoping to see their families again .
In the Soviet case , those hopes were never realized .
The Iranian government still has time to change , or else it will be remembered in history solely for its horrific use of totalitarian tactics , an example of modern - day Stalinism .
It should release Bahari and all its other political prisoners immediately .
And we will be right back .

ZAKARIA : Now our question of the week .
Last week , I asked you to cast an imaginary vote in Afghanistan 's upcoming presidential election .
I interviewed the two chief rivals to President Hamid Karzai -- one - time finance minister , Ashraf Ghani , and the former foreign minister , Abdullah Abdullah .
I asked you to choose among the three .
The clear winner was Ashraf Ghani , with Abdullah Abdullah running a pretty close second .
Most GPS viewers want to see the incumbent , Hamid Karzai , leave office .
The real election takes place August 20th , with complete results not expected until September .
Now , for this week , I want to know :
How do you think Hillary Clinton is doing as secretary of state ?
Give her a grade , and tell me why you think she deserves it .
And as always , I 'd like to recommend a book .
Having just come from Africa , I wanted to recommend a book on the topic , and this being summer , I thought a somewhat lighter book than usual .
This one is actually a classic .
It 's Isak Dinesen 's " Out of Africa , " a vivid memoir of life in colonial Africa .
You probably saw the great movie , " Out of Africa . "
It won seven Academy Awards .
But if you have n't read the book , you really should .
It 's a short story , a short read , but a great read .
Also , how closely have you been following the world ?
Test yourself .
Try our weekly quiz , the Fareed Challenge , on cnn.com / gps .
Thank you for being part of my program this week , and I will see you next week .

The team used Nasa 's Nasa 's Infrared Telescope Facility in Hawaii Astronomers have used a new ground - based technique to study the atmosphere of a planet outside our Solar System .
The work could assist the search for Earth - like planets with traces of organic , or carbon - rich , molecules .
Gases have previously been discerned on exoplanets before , but only by using space - based telescopes .
Astronomers reporting in Nature say their method of spotting methane gas on exoplanets could be extended to many other , ground - based telescopes .
Methane was first spotted on an exoplanet named HD 189733b in 2008 by a group led by Mark Swain of Nasa 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the US .
It is a " hot Jupiter " or gas giant that orbits very close to its parent star , which lies about 63 light - years away from Earth .
It marked the first time that an organic molecule had been detected on an exoplanet .
The known planets residing outside our Solar System currently number more than 400 .
Dr Swain and his colleagues have now shown that by looking at a different set of light wavelengths , methane and possibly other components can be catalogued using relatively small , Earth - bound telescopes .
They used Nasa 's Infrared Telescope Facility in Hawaii to perform measurements of the light emitted by HD 189733 b , using a version of the so - called transit method that measures an exoplanet 's " secondary eclipse " .

At its heart , the approach takes the light received on Earth when HD 189733b is behind its parent star and subtracts it from the light received when it is between its star and the Earth .
What results is the light due solely to the planet .
However , the effects of the Earth 's atmosphere , with its own atmospheric gases and passing clouds , would typically tend to overwhelm the signal from the distant star .
To overcome this obstacle , Dr Swain and his colleagues decided to look in the infrared part of the light spectrum - in a region that is not currently covered by space - based telescopes - and devised a method to get rid of the effects of Earth 's atmosphere .
These molecules ... are eventually how we 're going to answer the question of whether expolanets have a habitable atmosphere to support life
Mark Swain
Jet Propulsion Laboratory
Their approach made simple assumptions about how errors in the light detected in the telescope are related to each other in terms of the wavelength or colour that is detected , or in terms of the time at which the detection is made .
By making these correlations and correcting the signal over and over again , the overall error is whittled down .
With Earth 's swirling atmosphere effectively subtracted , the team discovered a peak in their data that corresponded to methane emitting light in a process known as fluorescence .
" Up until this point we 've not been able to use ground - based telescopes to detect molecules in an exoplanet 's atmosphere , " Dr Swain told BBC News .
" These molecules are probes of the conditions and chemistry , and since these planets are too far away for us to send a probe , they are eventually how we 're going to answer the question of whether expolanets have a habitable atmosphere to support life . "
However , the methane appears to contradict an assumption made about both stars and exoplanet atmospheres before - the existence of a so - called local thermodynamic equilibrium , or LTE .
Something is putting more energy into the methane than it can quickly get rid of .
" We do n't know what that process is in this case , " Dr Swain said .
" In our own Solar System , charged particles can cause this fluorescence ; the other possibility is some sort of [ light in the form of ] photons . "
Emission of light stimulated by charged particles bumping into atmospheric gases is exactly the mechanism behind the aurora displays seen at visible wavelengths at the Earth 's poles .
" If we could show it was charged - particle pumping , you could put constraints on the planet 's magnetic field - no - one 's been able to do that for an exoplanet before . "
Wider view
In any case , the methane emission is comparatively strong from HD 189733b , leading to two important conclusions .
Firstly , other exoplanets may well be experiencing this same process , and detecting any methane or possibly other atmospheric gases would be made easier .
HD 189733 b orbits very close to its parent star " It 's a pretty interesting discovery , " said Keith Horne , an astrophysicist and exoplanet expert from the University of St Andrews .
" The main impact is this strong emission line that stands out quite dramatically , " he told BBC News .
" You 'd be able to detect it on other objects that are farther away [ from their parent stars ] or are fainter .
So far , it 's been just the nearest , transiting ' hot Jupiters ' that are bright enough to detect this secondary eclipse . "
But more than that , the new research shows that some observations that were once only possible from space can now be done using ground - based telescopes .
That vastly increases the number of instruments - far larger than the 3 m telescope used in the Nature work - that could be trained on exoplanet atmospheres .
" Larger telescopes could look at this in more detail , because there 's so many of them .
It potentially allows many different teams to participate ; previous detections with the Hubble and Spitzer telescopes are great , but there 's only one Hubble and only one Spitzer . "
Both Dr Swain and Professor Horne agree that more detailed work is required to be certain that the peak is due to methane , and to establish how the methane violates the LTE assumption .
However , with the new results in hand , further observations in the new spectral region will be easy to justify , at least until the James Webb Space Telescope - the first space - based telescope that can " see " in this part of the infrared - takes to the skies in 2014 .
" It 's a hard measurement to do , and they seem to have succeeded , " Professor Horne said .
" The committees that decide how big telescope time is spent will be able to see it's a worthwhile measurement . "

With Google already the center of controversy worldwide over how it uses the information it gleans from its search users , red flags were almost certain to be sent up over Google Buzz , announced Tuesday .
It 's the company 's new social platform for sharing bits of Twitter - like communication , and it 's built rather cleverly on its existing Gmail platform .
The red flags concern how Google leverages Gmail to create a pre-established social network for Buzz users .
Unlike a fresh , new social network that asks incoming users to build their lists of followers from scratch , Buzz starts out by collecting a list of folks who appear to be doing the most communicating with the incoming user via Gmail .
Advertisement
If the new Buzz user simply accepts the default settings , then that list will become " public " information , at least to all the other Buzz users who opt to follow him .
And that 's the problem , because somebody who simply accepts the defaults may end up broadcasting the list of most frequented Gmail contacts to other Buzz users , perhaps with some inadvertent results .
" The people you are automatically selected to follow are other Gmail users , who may or may not have started using Buzz , " a Google spokesperson explained to Betanews .
" In order to automatically suggest people you might want to follow , Buzz looks at the contacts you e-mail and chat with the most .
It uses the same kinds of signals that Web mail programs typically use to determine which contact should come up first when you start typing an e-mail address in the ' To ' line . "
As Google 's Buzz privacy policy explains , " When you first enter Google Buzz , to make the startup experience easier , we may automatically select people for you to follow based on the people you e-mail and chat with most .
Similarly , we may also suggest to others that they automatically follow you .
You can review and edit the list of people you follow and block people from following you .
Your name , photo , and the list of people you follow and people following you will be displayed on your Google profile , which is publicly searchable on the Web .
You may opt out of displaying the list of people following you and who you 're following on your profile . "
The problem of accepting a relatively open privacy policy by default was brought to the public 's attention by Facebook , in its revision of privacy policy last December .
Originally advertised to have been a response to users ' concerns that Facebook was too open , that network created a default setting that was not only marketed for everyone , but was actually named " Everyone , " perhaps to improve its popularity .
That default setting shares all information , including the user 's contacts , not only with other Facebook members but with folks stumbling upon Facebook profiles in Web searches .
Facebook 's explanation and instructions left users baffled about how much information they may or may not be sharing with the rest of the world , and what control they may have over it , if any .
Betanews tests on Google Buzz reveal that , although inadvertently sharing other Gmail contacts may be a problem at first , a reasonable user may have far less difficulty taking control of his sharing settings than with Facebook .
In our test , we used a very seldom - used Gmail address .
Although there were messages there , no group of message senders appeared more prominently than others .
As a result , Buzz did not pull up a list of suggested contacts .
It did bring up the photo of this guy from the pre-existing Google profile , which was established in Google Talk several months earlier .
The notice on the initial dialog box reads in small print , " Your profile includes your name , photo , people you follow , and people who follow you . "
From here , it may not be clear to some users that this profile is very nearly about to broadcast the names of frequent Gmail contacts ( never mind for the moment that this guy does n't have any ) , if they were to click on Save profile and continue .
The ability for users to not only see those contacts but prevent them from being broadcast to other users , or to the world , does exist -- perhaps not obvious , but it 's there .
It 's the Edit link at the top of the dialog box .
When you click that , the dialog box expands to let you add and remove Buzz contacts manually ( we found a fellow who appears to be enjoying a cool beverage ) , as well as disable the broadcasting of the contacts list , in a check box marked Show the lists of people I 'm following and people following me on my profile .
Twitter users will be familiar with the ability to see one 's followers and whom one is following ; that 's a feature , not an option , with that service .
Can a Buzz member follow someone else privately ?
" Yes , " explains Google 's spokesperson , " but only if that user sets their list of followers to private .
By design , if you choose to follow someone in Buzz , that person will see your name in his or her profile .
Just like you get to choose whether or not to make your list of followers public , it 's up to that user to do the same .
That said , if the user chooses not to make his list private and you want to remain anonymous , one option is to not follow , but still read , any publicly available posts . "
The Buzz privacy policy states that a user 's profile is searchable from the Web .
That means that if a Google Talk user has set up a Google profile , and that profile is already searchable from the Web , then after joining Buzz , that profile may contain some Gmail contacts .
However , assuming that users know how to use this Edit link prior to formally signing up , this may not necessarily be an indicator to others that followed and following members have necessarily shared a plurality of Gmail messages with one another .
Furthermore , the ability for a Google user to make his profile searchable through the Web is turned off by default .
If you have a Google profile already , then this link will take you to it .
At the bottom of this page , you 'll find the Profile URL section , where you 'll see the URL of your public profile if it were searchable through the Web .
To turn search ability on , you click on the check box beside the URL , then click on Save changes .
As the instructions clearly explain , " To help others discover your profile , in some Google services contacts who know your e-mail address will see a link to your profile . "
That 's only if you turn this feature on .
By contrast , the whole point of using Facebook is to develop a public profile page .
Thus it is conceivable that knowledgeable users who wish to construct a limited social network may be able to do so with Google Buzz .
Next : Can other Buzz users see what you 've mailed ?

I did n’t know this at the time , but my grandmother was horrified that my parents went ahead with my trip after the accident .
She told them they were sending a little girl to her death ( I was just out of elementary school ) ; and though my mother wept with guilt in secret , she protected me from their discord , determined that I have the experience I ’d anticipated for two years , a reward for assiduous language study .
That summer abroad was the single most formative experience of my young life .
I ca n’t count the number of foreign and domestic flights I made in the ensuing two decades .
Including , in 1995 , a KLM flight from Africa to America via Amsterdam — Mr. Abdulmutallab ’s itinerary , more or less .
Since 9/11/2001 , or since
12/22/2001 ( when Richard Reid attempted to blow up a Boeing 767 between Paris and Miami by detonating his sneakers ) , how many grandmothers , how many parents , how many people of whatever age , sex , or familial connection , have avoided air travel out of fear , or cautioned their friends and relatives against it ?
The risks of air travel continue to be minuscule , even during the War on Terror era , while the advantages of exploring other countries remain precious and inarguable .
Still , a fortress mentality settles in each time a new instance of attempted airborne thuggery hits the airwaves .
In the wake of alarming headlines , an obstacle course of cumbersome but laudable security precautions unrolls at airports , leading many of the earth ’s seven - billion - odd inhabitants to resolve to remain earthbound as much as possible .
One goal of terrorists is to make ordinary people afraid to leave their homes and interact with the wider world .
Attacks on individual courage may leave no scars , but that does not mean they do no damage .
In this last decade , nobody can tally the number of flights not taken , adventures not dared , countries not visited , because of the public ’s anxieties about air travel .
In 2005 , rebelling against my own fears of traveling to sections of the globe that had come to seem perilous , I booked a flight to Syria and Lebanon to visit journalist friends who were living there .
Days before my flight left Kennedy Airport , Syria revealed it had halted military and intelligence cooperation with the United States .
My adrenalin racing , I packed , in anticipation mingled with dread .
In the waiting room at the plane ’s gate , as I sat amid women in hijab and children with stuffed animals and pink backpacks , I took half an Ambien to dim my worries .
My companion , meanwhile , was watching “ 24 ” on a laptop ; and as Kiefer Sutherland blew away one Arab “ bad guy ” after another , a family moved a few seats away from us , because we were so scary .
I ’m grateful that I overcame my cowardice and traveled to Damascus — the most fascinating , culturally diverse city I ’ve ever visited — and to Baalbek , in Lebanon , which Alexander the Great called Heliopolis and which is now home to the ruins of great temples the Romans erected beginning in the first century B.C .
Baalbek , also a stronghold for Hezbollah , is admittedly not the most welcoming destination .
All the same , how can such a monument go unseen ?
It ’s hard to assess the cost of the sacrifices an uneasy populace makes to the great idol Safety — sacrifices that have no sure reward .
Steps are already being taken to shore up air security in the aftermath of last week ’s breach .
But when will the skies again be truly friendly ?
When will Americans again be free to be curious , flight - miles - earning world citizens ?
Maybe we already are — as long as we ’re willing to get to the airport a few hours early to run the ever - lengthening security gauntlet .
In 2010 , potential dangers will attach to every flight , just as they did 10 years ago , 20 years ago , 30 years ago and before .
Does that mean everyone should just stay put ?
For more than three years , the Department of Homeland Security has ranked the threat risk of domestic and international flights at “ Code Orange ” — high .
But staying in your own house still puts you at “ Code Yellow ” — elevated risk .
How , then , to proceed ?
Perhaps there ’s only ever been one trick to keeping one ’s cool in challenging circumstances , the same one the British adventurer T. E. Lawrence offers for dealing with pain in David Lean ’s film “ Lawrence of Arabia , ” set a century ago , in another war .
The trick , he says , “ is not minding . ”
Irish Rail claimed yesterday its human resources director was a " law unto himself " amid new claims he had placed tracking devices on employees ' cars to see where they went .
Differences over the level of fraudulent practices in the company , allegedly costing up to € 8.7 m , formed the background to the suspension of the company 's human resources director John Keenan , the High Court heard yesterday .
Mr Keenan , who has been HR boss at the rail company for 15 years , sought an injunction to lift the suspension imposed on him on December 3 .
Irish Rail said it was entitled to suspend Mr Keenan as he delayed for 10 days before informing chief executive Richard Fearn about an equality tribunal award of € 189,000 to a woman who alleged gender discrimination over promotion in the company .
Mr Fearn had lost confidence in Mr Keenan as a result , it was claimed .
The company said Mr Keenan 's suspension should continue as a holding position pending investigations .
It is now also alleged Mr Keenan was involved in 32 instances of surveillance of employee computer records , incorrect accessing of sensitive medical records and the placing of tracking devices on employees ' cars to see where they went .
The company claimed yesterday that Mr Keenan used his office as a " personal fiefdom " and was a law unto himself .
Mr Keenan denied the claims and said the new allegations could be explained in terms of his role in an internal cost audit unit in Irish Rail .
He added that the company could conduct its investigation without suspension and his summary suspension was in breach of all normal procedures .
Counsel for Mr Keenan said his suspension was not based on any rational or reasonable basis and he had not delayed in informing the chief executive of the equality tribunal decision .
There was also no basis for claiming he ran a personal fiefdom within the company .
In affidavits from Mr Keenan , the court heard that there was a lengthy and controversial series of events within Irish Rail over fraudulent practices involving collusion between certain company personnel and third - party contractors .
Mr Keenan said he was responsible for the company 's cost audit committee and had recommended engaging forensic accountants to look into the matter .
Losses
In the accountants ' report in 2007 , it was found the company had made estimated losses from the fraud of around € 8.7 m over a three - year period .
Mr Keenan claimed Mr Fearn argued the estimate was outside the terms of reference of the report and wanted it removed but he ( Mr Keenan ) advised against this .
The figure was later reduced down to € 2.5 m .
Mr Keenan said he got an irate phone call from John Lynch , chairman of the CIE group of which Irish Rail is a subsidiary , in which he berated Mr Keenan for reporting the loss at such a high level .
Mr Lynch again told him to " button " his lip after accusing him of leaking the information to a newspaper .
Mr Justice John MacMenamin reserved judgment until next week .

The official truth is that voting is a glorious thing , that it may even be a democratic duty .
After all , most free countries have a history of bloodshed and war , which was the only way of finally getting rid of terror and oppression to establish Democracy : where we , the people , rule ourselves and there are no kings , lords , or absolute rulers .
In such a world , are we not obliged to show our respects to those who sacrificed their lives for our freedom ?
Voting means exercising the very core principle of the freedom their sacrifice has granted our glorious generation ; if not a legal duty , it should be a moral obligation .
We have heard it said many times in many ways :
Blessed be thee , oh voter !
And curs’d be thee , who do not honor the sacrifice of our fathers !
He who does not vote has no right to complain !
But if you are one of us who do not vote , do not despair .
Official truths are so often official lies that it is difficult to tell them apart .
And if you do not understand the evils of political power and the state , then you may easily be misled to believe in its self - proclaimed goodness and the seemingly forever repeated gospel .
Do not despair , because voters are nothing but the worst of hypocrites and despicable cowards .
Do n’t believe me ?
Then let me show you .
There are two kinds of voters : those who vote because they believe in a candidate , a party , or a program , and those who vote to stop a candidate , a party , or a program .
In either case , they are cowards and we should offer them nothing but our sincerest contempt .
Those who cast their ballots for someone or something do so out of belief that they can change the world through voting , that the system is generally just and accountable to the voting populace .
Some of them may even believe that their vote actually counts , which should make us doubt their ability to think straight .
But what they do is grant legitimacy not only to a candidate or party , but to the system of dog - eat - dog politics .
Politics is a winner - takes - all kind of game , but winners and losers alike -- they all share that they voted .
for a change want to see that change happening -- at least to some degree .
But whereas this is obviously true , we also know that these people do not go about trying to accomplish this change in some other way :
They expect voting to bring about the change through political means .
I have previously discussed what it means to vote and will not repeat myself .
But it is safe to say that those votinga change want to see that change happening -- at least to some degree .
But whereas this is obviously true , we also know that these people do not go about trying to accomplish this change in some other way :
They expect voting to bring about the change through political means .
T he people voting against some change are not different :
They do not wish to see the particular change and therefore vote for someone not supporting it .
And while doing so they automatically vote in support for some other change , unless their candidate is literally a conservative and wishes no change at all ( but then why would they run for office ? ) .
Whether the change they vote against is good or bad , they still expect their voting to make the difference .
It is true that voters sometimes use other means to bring about change and vote .
But even so , voting reveals their belief that political decisions not only matter but are important ; they deem politics so important that they prefer voting to doing something else -- and so they cast their ballot in support of a candidate , a party , or program .
This is true even if the candidate does not offer the best of solutions or even promises to work for a solution close to the one preferred by the voter .
They still cast their votes .
But of interest to us here is not primarily the rationale for casting votes , even though it is important to establish that votes are always cast for someone or something .
What is of interest here is :
What is the nature of this change for which all voters knowingly or uncomprehendingly cast their votes in support ?
The change , it must be stressed , is always of a political nature .
This is no surprise , but few seem to be able to or want to connect the dots :
The change they desire is not for themselves , but for you and me and the neighbor ’s son and the lady down the street and themselves .
Their preference is not to put in an option they lack and would choose , but for a one - system solution that we all will be forced to accept one way or the other .
The only means to establish a political solution is to do so by force and coercion : against people ’s will if there are dissenters .
It is in this sense the voter is a despicable coward : just like the person hiring brutes to beat up an enemy rather than doing it himself , or hiring a hit man rather than making the kill himself , the voter hides and lets others do his dirty work .
The voter is too lazy to try to establish the change for and by himself - - or too evil to allow others to seek their own solutions .
In either case , the voter pretends to have his hands and conscience clean while pointing murderers to their victims .
The only moral approach to change is to bring it about yourself and stand tall knowing it is your own work , whether in success or defeat .
The coward hides behind smoke screens , representatives with fancy titles , and faceless , anonymous systems that carry out their deeds .
The former is the radical , the free spirit , and the entrepreneur ; the latter is simply the cheat , the fraud , and the crook -- in democratic terms , the politician and voter .

A reader tells us that this taxi " slid and wedged itself between two parked cars at 12th and 2nd Avenue today around 8:40 a.m .
Apparently he was in there so tight that he had to wait for the drivers of the other vehicles to move in order to free himself .
Notice the cars in the intersection going the wrong way making u-turns to avoid the blocked street .
Pure wintery chaos … "
Indeed !
On that note , if you find yourself behind the wheel tonight : be safe !
[ Ziyan ] and [ Zach ] built a door entry system that uses a code entered from your wristwatch .
They ’re using the TI eZ - 430 Chronos that we saw in November .
There is a project box mounted over the deadbolt lever .
Inside , the wireless fob waits for the watch to connect .
When a watch has connected and the correct code is received ( using 128 bit encryption ) the fob actuates a servo to turn the lock .
On the user side of things the code is entered by tapping the watch .
The built - in accelerometer picks up these taps and relays them to the door unit .
It ’s a heck of a project !
Check out their demonstration video after the break .
We ’d like to see a mechanical option for escaping the apartment in case the door unit fails but otherwise we think this is perfectly executed .
We ’re looking forward to seeing more projects that tap into this TI hardware .
Yesterday Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad surprised everyone when he declared publicly that the terms of the draft third party enrichment deal Western nations have been demanding that Iran sign are perfectly acceptable .
Today , as Iranians debate the relative merits of the deal and wonder if it amounts to “ caving in ” to Western demands , Western officials are responding quite negatively to getting exactly what they have demanded for months .
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said Iran ’s acceptance of the deal , something France his repeatedly demanded , amounted to “ buying time ” and said he was “ perplexed and even a bit pessimistic . ”
His German counterpart Guido Westerwelle said the acceptance was meaningless and called for UN sanctions against Iran for “ its refusal to negotiate . ”
Iran initially proposed the third party enrichment deal in late September , but balked at the draft reached at an IAEA meeting , expressing concern at the lack of guarantees that they would ever actually get the uranium back once it was shipped abroad .
Ahmadinejad rejected the concerns , saying that Iran could simply enrich more uranium if the deal was reneged on and it would prove that the nations were not trustworthy .
Not everyone was pessimistic , however , and Russian officials said it was a “ positive sign ” and China , long the lone opponent to additional sanctions , said it was vital to reach a solution as quickly as possible .
Kun teekkarin kritiikki pett�� :
Miksi ateisti ei voi keksi� tiedett� itse ?
Luonnontieteen synnytti valistusaate : t�m� k�sitys el�� populaaritieteess � vahvana .
Esimerkiksi Galilei ja h�nen aikansa tutkijat esitet��n usein modernin uskonnonvastaisen taistelun esikuvina , oman aikansa Dawkinseina .
Argumenttia ei haittaa edes se , ett� monet muistavat 1600 - luvun tiedemiesten olleen j�rjest��n kristittyj� .
Selitysh�n on helppo : toki uskovainenkin voi tehd� tiedett� , uskostaan huolimatta , kunhan uskon lokeroi irti tieteest� .
Todellisuus oli kuitenkin toinen .
Monet luonnontieteen perustajista – kuten Galilei , Newton , Kepler ja l��k�ri William Harvey – saivat teistisen ja teleologisen uskonsa vuoksi inspiraatiota keksint�ihins� .
Esimerkiksi oletus luojajumalasta rohkaisi heit� kehitt�m��n teorioita , joita oli aikaisemmin pidetty j�rjett�min� [ 1a ] .
Tieteellisen tutkimusmetodin kehitt�mist� taas ohjasi k�sitys ihmisen lankeemuksesta ja sen aiheuttamasta ep�varmuudesta tiedonhankintaan [ 1 b ] .
Siten uskonnon lis�arvo tieteelle on historiassa hyvin suuri .
Historia on kuitenkin historiaa .
Onko sill� v�li� ?
Se osoittaa , ett� teistinen tieteenteko voi olla eritt �in menestyksek�st� , mutta miten alkuper�st� voi johtaa yht ��n vahvempia v�itteit� ?
Teistiset filosofit , kuten Tapio Puolimatka ja Alvin Plantinga , eiv�t kuitenkaan argumentoi vain sen varassa , ett� luonnontieteell� on jokin alkuper� .
P�invastoin .
Jos kirjoittaja on ymm�rt�nyt Puolimatkan uusinta teosta [ 1 ] oikein , t�m� sanoo luonnontieteen olevan suorastaan olemuksellisesti teistist� .
Tiede etsii luonnosta mitattavaa ja matemaattisina kaavoina ilmaistavaa j�rjestyst� .
Ateistille ajatus siit� , ett� t�m� l�hestymistapa toimii , on mahdollinen , mutta t�ysin summittainen .
Jos maailmalla ei ole j�rjellist� luojaa , miksi se ilment�isi mit��n logiikkaa ?
Luonnollisesti ateistinenkin tiede toimii , kunhan sen perusedellytykset on keksitty .
T�t� ei kiist� kukaan .
On kuitenkin eritt �in ep�todenn �k�ist� , ett� puhtaalta p�yd�lt� l�htenyt ateistinen kulttuuri olisi koskaan keksinyt luonnontiedett� .
Ateisti , joka ei ole ensin n�hnyt , ett� tiede toimii , ei osaisi itse p��tell� , ett� niin voisi olla .
Sen sijaan usko Jumalaan , joka nimenomaisesti loi j�rjestyksen ja luonnonlait , antaa t�h�n perustellun syyn .
Valitettavasti tieteen taustaoletukset otetaan nykyisin perustelematta tosiasioina vastaan – ehk�p� juuri siksi , ett� tiede ja tekniikka menestyv�t .
Tiede on ehtinyt tuottaa loistavia tuloksia niin paljon , ett� sen filosofiseen perustaan palaaminen vaikuttaa t�ydelt� ajanhukalta .
T�m�n ongelman kirjoittajakin on kohdannut alituisesti toisten teekkarien kanssa , riippumatta siit� , uskovatko n�m� itse Jumalaan vai eiv�t .
Koska tiede toimii , tieteen filosofia voidaan tuomita humanistiseksi huuhaa - keskusteluksi .
Samalla mik� tahansa tieteen taustaoletus – kuten ateismi – jota tiedeyhteis� pit�� itsest��nselvyyten� , p��see teekkarin " kriittisest� " ajattelusta kritiikitt� l�pi .
Humanisti huomaa t�m�n virheen helpommin .
Kirjoittaja kiitt�� inspiraatiosta Puolimatkan lis�ksi ateistiteekkarien Atheos - yhdistyst� .

That a U.S. senator must ask a federal agency to share information regarding a proposed and " classified " international anti-counterfeiting accord the government has already disclosed is alarming .
Especially when the info has been given to Hollywood , the recording industry , software makers and even some digital - rights groups .
Sen. Ron Wyden ( D - Oregon ) is demanding that U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk confirm leaks surrounding the unfinished Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement , being negotiated largely between the European Union and United States .
Among other things ,
Wyden wants to know if the deal creates international guidelines that mean consumers lose internet access if they are believed to be digital copyright scofflaws .
He also wants to know whether internet service providers could lose " safe harbor " protection for failing to police their customers ' digital content for copyright infringement violations .
Such a move would heap copyright liability onto the ISP , and fundamentally alter U.S. copyright law .
What " legal incentives , " Wyden asked Kirk in a Wednesday letter , would " encourage Online Service Providers ( OSPs ) to cooperate with copyright owners to deter the unauthorized storage or transmission of copyrighted materials . "
The questions came weeks after leaked documents from the European Union suggested the United States was taking those positions on the accord 's draft internet section .
Nefeterius Akeli McPherson , a Kirk spokeswoman , said in an e-mail that the office is " looking forward to responding " to the letter that was disclosed Thursday by human - rights lobby Knowledge Ecology International .
Wyden wrote that the " objectives behind the negotiations still remain inadequately clear to the American public . "
The administration has shared the secret treaty 's internet - section contents with more than three dozen individuals in the private sector , from the left and the right of the copyright debate .
Those individuals include Business Software Alliance attorney Emery Simon , Google copyright czar Bill Patry and president of Public Knowledge Gigi Sohn .
Lawyers for the movie studios and record labels , which stand to gain the most from the accord , were also given access .
All signed confidentiality agreements with Kirk 's office .
In response to a Freedom of Information Act claim from Knowledge Ecology International , Kirk 's office declined to divulge the accord 's working draft – maintaining that the negotiating texts were " properly classified " national security secrets .
Kirk said last month that the international community would walk away from the negotiating table if the public could see the working drafts .
The ACTA negotiating nations include Australia , Canada , European Union states , Japan , South Korea , Mexico , Morocco , New Zealand , Singapore , Switzerland and the United States .
They are to meet Jan. 25 in Mexico City .
The agreement does not require congressional approval .

i Phone / Palm Pre : Apple and / or AT&T do n't want the Google Voice service to have its own iPhone app , and we think that stinks .
Google is finally releasing the next best thing : a mobile site that basically replicates a dedicated Google Voice app .

The big advantage of Google 's new Voice app ( which is already showing up for Voice users at Lifehacker HQ ) is the direct contact access .
Rather than having to store secondary numbers or use the somewhat old - school - looking Voice mobile site to pull up your contacts , Google Voice 's new webapp provides super - quick , as - you - type access to your Google Contacts .
The interface is similar to what you see when you visit Voice in a full browser , with the same mobile look and feel as Gmail , Reader , and other products have recently received .

When you dial , it 's not the familiar experience of having Google Voice call you , then call the other person — it 's a direct dial to that person , probably using those same secondary numbers Google seems to have stockpiles of .
You 'll want to make sure your phone 's contacts are synced up with Google if you 're keen on using Google 's Voice app .
It 's a free service , and requires a Google Voice account ( which we hear they 're giving out more regularly ) .

Every few decades , there has been an engineering feat that has made us truly believe in the power of human ingenuity in sparking social change and bettering the lives of people .
Behind these achievements , there have been numerous remarkable engineers who dedicated their lives to creating these inventions .
The following engineering projects qualify as some of the most remarkable , because many of them achieved what was at one point deemed to be impossible and fulfilled the needs of modern day life by implementing audacious approaches to solving complex challenges .
This article is a celebration of all those engineers who played the crucial roles in creating these amazing engineering feats .
9. Panama Canal » 8 . Burj Dubai » 7 . Millau Viaduct » 6 . The Channel Tunnel
We invite you to participate in our survey :
Who do you believe is the greatest engineer that has ever lived ?
10 . Moon Landing
Neil Amstrong ’s famous 1969 moon landing was surely “ a giant leap for mankind , ” forever changing how we approach what other consider hard and the impossible .
The Apollo 11 mission placed two astronauts ( Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin ) onto the surface of the moon , successfully defeating Russia in the rush to the skies .
This event marked a definitive point in the 20th Century and at the time helped cement the United States above Russia as the ‘ greatest superpower ’ whilst firing the imagination of generations of children .
9. Panama Canal
Before the Panama Canal was opened on Aug. 15 , 1914 , a ship traveling from New York and San Francisco would have had to sail around Cape Horn , a 67 - day , 12,000 - mile journey .
The Panama Canal provided shortcut between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans , reducing the same New York to San Francisco by 4,000 miles .
Clearly , much the same way the Transcontinental Railroad reinvented shipping , the Panama Canal was a colossal engineering project which greatly impacted shipping between the two oceans by reducing the journey times immensely .
8. Burj Dubai
The Burj Dubai , which was christened Burj Khalifa at its Jan. 4 , 2010 opening , achieved instant engineering marvel status before it even opened .
This is not because it was long projected to achieve the world tallest building status upon completion , but because the height proposed has never before been attempted , and especially not in the type of environment it now sits on .
The construction of Burj Dubai therefore necessitated the the building be designed to withstand the tough and windy terrain , plus the projected human demands on the building .
The design of the structure is just as impressive as the height , having many of the building ’s sub-systems being record breakers themselves , such as the observatory lifts breaking the record for the longest travel distance between lowest and highest stop .
The Burj Dubai towers above the surrounding landscape at a huge 818 meters tall and has been built as a centerpiece of an urban development that will include homes , hotels and parkland .
The 160 - plus - story Burj Dubai Tower is the centerpiece of a $ 20 billion multi - tower development located just outside of downtown Dubai .
The Burj Dubai project consists of the tower itself , as well as an adjacent podium structure , and separate six - story office annex and two - story pool annex .
The 3 million - square - foot reinforced concrete multi-use tower is predominantly residential and office space .
7. Millau Viaduct
The Millau Viaduct is presently the tallest vehicular cable - stayed road - bridge that spans the valley of the river Tarn near Millau in southern France .
The height of the bridge is an impressive 1,125 feet , 62 feet taller than the Eiffel Tower .
The bridge was opened in December 2004 and crosses the Valley of the River Tarn close to Millau in the South of France .
The bridge was designed by Michel Virlogeux , a structural engineer .
The project ’s architect was Norman Foster , who was quoted as saying that the bridge looked “ impossibly delicate ” and was a “ dialogue between nature and the man made . ”
Delicate it is , because driving atop this engineering feat makes one feel as though they are suspended in the sky .
Rightfully so because the Millau Viaduct bridge deck is the highest in the world .
See a video on the construction of the Millau Viaduct .
6. The Channel Tunnel
The Channel Tunnel is the longest tunnel with an undersea section in the world .
The length of the Channel Tunnel is 32.4 miles and links Folkestone , England to Coquelles , France .
The tunnel itself was bored through a chalk marl stratum which was deemed a good material for tunneling as it is both strong and easy to excavate .
The actual tunnel consists of three separate tunnels connected together by cross -passage links .
Construction of the tunnel began in 1988 and opened in 1994 and has been rated as one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers .

Hulu soared to popularity by offering free online viewing of popular TV shows .
Now that free ride may soon end .
The Internet video site is weighing plans to charge users to watch episodes of “ 30 Rock , ” “ Modern Family ” and “ House . ”
The move would mark a sharp change of course for the venture , which was launched nearly two years ago by a consortium of studios to distribute without charge TV shows and movies over the Internet .
The site has spent months studying how to strike a balance between what people expect to watch free online and what they would be willing to pay for , said people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly .
One plan being considered would allow users to view the five most recent episodes of TV shows free but would require a subscription of $ 4.99 a month to watch older episodes .
Hulu believes it will need at least 20 TV series -- both current ones and those no longer on the air -- to make such a pay service attractive to users .
A firm pricing model could emerge within six months , the sources said .
A Hulu spokeswoman declined to comment .
Hulu ’s plan to charge for some programs comes as many publishers are similarly grappling over how to get people to pay for online content that they ’ve long gotten free .
On Wednesday , in a development that could have implications for the struggling newspaper industry , New York Times Co. unveiled a plan to charge online readers for stories .
The newspaper will adopt a “ metered ” approach , starting next year , in which users can read a limited number of articles before being charged .
Hulu and the New York Times join a growing lineup of companies that are building pay walls around their content .
Internet radio company Pandora Media Inc. , which had offered its service free , recently began charging users a monthly fee of 99 cents if they listened more than 40 hours a month .
“ The economic reality of any type of content is that you need people to put some money into the tip jar , ” said Tim Westergren , founder of the Oakland company .
That imperative has grown as advertising dollars flooding online are expected to slow .
Boxee Inc. , a company that lets people pipe Netflix movies , YouTube videos , Pandora music and other online media directly to their TVs , on Wednesday introduced a way for studios and publishers to charge for on - demand content rather than rely on advertising .
“ This lets content owners dictate the way they want to sell online , ” said Andrew Kippen , Boxee ’s vice president of marketing .
“ There will be more content available online , and there ’s not going to be one clear way to win .
What we ’re saying is , work with us to try out some different business models and see what works . ”
Analysts say Hulu may be preparing to deliver its video service through the array of Internet - connected TVs , game consoles and other devices that were on display at the recent Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas .
“ The whole reason Hulu needs to consider a subscription model is that the long - term play for online video is not to computers ; it ’s to a collection of other devices -- connected TVs , video game consoles , ” said Forrester Research media analyst James McQuivey .
Netflix has found that an increasing percentage of its subscribers use an on - demand service to watch movies through Internet - connected video game consoles , Blu-ray players and other devices connected to the TV .
Hulu , a partnership of NBC Universal , News Corp. , Walt Disney Co. and Providence Equity Partners , has emerged as an Internet darling -- and a thorn in the side of some investors , who see the site not as a defense against piracy or video phenomenon YouTube but as a threat to the economics of the television business .
Cable operators , in particular , protested Hulu ’s allowing free Internet access to shows such as FX’s “ It ’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia ” or USA Networks ’
“ Psych , ” which were previously available only to their subscribers .
Hulu responded by reining in online access to certain cable programs .
Many media analysts expect that Comcast Corp .'s plan to buy a controlling interest in NBC Universal would give it a significant say in the future of online video -- and accelerate Hulu ’s move to a subscription service .
For newspapers , the announcement by the New York Times on Wednesday could likewise accelerate a move to requiring readers to pay for online access .
But it ’s not the first time the company has tried to get readers to pony up .
It ended its Times Select online subscription program in 2007 , even though the effort generated $ 10 million a year in revenue .
“ We ’ve learned several things from TimesSelect , ” said Times spokeswoman Diane McNulty .
Among them , she said : People will pay for content online , and publishers “ have to carefully weigh the benefits of an advertising and a subscription model . ”
The company has seen the portion of its revenue from selling ads on its digital properties grow to 13.4 % in the first nine months of 2009 from 4 % in 2004 .
“ The New York Times is very smart , ” said Mike Vorhaus , president of media consulting firm Magid Advisors .
“ The person who comes once or twice for a really big news article is never going to become a payer , so let ’s not try to force them .
Let ’s not try to make a sheep into a cow .
The most frequent viewers should be paying the most . ”

The following article appears in the journal JOM , 53 ( 12 ) ( 2001 ) , pp. 8 - 11 .
Feature : Special Report Why Did the World Trade Center Collapse ?
Science , Engineering , and Speculation
Editor ’s Note : For a more complete .
updated analysis of the World Trade Center towers collapse , read “ The Role of Metallurgy in the NIST Investigation of the World Trade Center Towers Collapse ” in the December 2007 issue .
INTRODUCTION
The collapse of the World Trade Center ( WTC ) towers on September 11 , 2001 , was as sudden as it was dramatic ; the complete destruction of such massive buildings shocked nearly everyone .
Immediately afterward and even today , there is widespread speculation that the buildings were structurally deficient , that the steel columns melted , or that the fire suppression equipment failed to operate .
In order to separate the fact from the fiction , we have attempted to quantify various details of the collapse .
The major events include the following :
The airplane impact with damage to the columns .
The ensuing fire with loss of steel strength and distortion ( Figure 1 ) .
The collapse , which generally occurred inward without significant tipping ( Figure 2 ) .
Each will be discussed separately , but initially it is useful to review the overall design of the towers .
THE DESIGN
The towers were designed and built in the mid-1960s through the early 1970s .
They represented a new approach to skyscrapers in that they were to be very lightweight and involved modular construction methods in order to accelerate the schedule and to reduce the costs .
To a structural engineer , a skyscraper is modeled as a large cantilever vertical column .
Each tower was 64 m square , standing 411 m above street level and 21 m below grade .
This produces a height - to - width ratio of 6.8 .
The total weight of the structure was roughly 500,000 t , but wind load , rather than the gravity load , dominated the design .
The building is a huge sail that must resist a 225 km/h hurricane .
It was designed to resist a wind load of 2 kPaa total of lateral load of 5,000 t.
In order to make each tower capable of withstanding this wind load , the architects selected a lightweight perimeter tube design consisting of 244 exterior columns of 36 cm square steel box section on 100 cm centers ( see Figure 3 ) .
This permitted windows more than one - half meter wide .
Inside this outer tube there was a 27 m × 40 m core , which was designed to support the weight of the tower .
It also housed the elevators , the stairwells , and the mechanical risers and utilities .
Web joists 80 cm tall connected the core to the perimeter at each story .
Concrete slabs were poured over these joists to form the floors .
In essence , the building is an egg - crate construction that is about 95 percent air , explaining why the rubble after the collapse was only a few stories high .
Figure 1 . Flames and debris exploded from the World Trade Center south tower immediately after the airplanes impact .
The black smoke indicates a fuel - rich fire ( Getty Images ) .
Figure 2 .
As the heat of the fire intensified , the joints on the most severely burned floors gave way , causing the perimeter wall columns to bow outward and the floors above them to fall .
The buildings collapsed within ten seconds , hitting bottom with an estimated speed of 200 km/h ( Getty Images ) .
The egg - crate construction made a redundant structure ( i.e. , if one or two columns were lost , the loads would shift into adjacent columns and the building would remain standing ) .
Prior to the World Trade Center with its lightweight perimeter tube design , most tall buildings contained huge columns on 5 m centers and contained massive amounts of masonry carrying some of the structural load .
The WTC was primarily a lightweight steel structure ; however , its 244 perimeter columns made it one of the most redundant and one of the most resilient skyscrapers .

The early news reports noted how well the towers withstood the initial impact of the aircraft ; however , when one recognizes that the buildings had more than 1,000 times the mass of the aircraft and had been designed to resist steady wind loads of 30 times the weight of the aircraft , this ability to withstand the initial impact is hardly surprising .
Furthermore , since there was no significant wind on September 11 , the outer perimeter columns were only stressed before the impact to around 1/3 of their 200 MPa design allowable .
The only individual metal component of the aircraft that is comparable in strength to the box perimeter columns of the WTC is the keel beam at the bottom of the aircraft fuselage .
While the aircraft impact undoubtedly destroyed several columns in the WTC perimeter wall , the number of columns lost on the initial impact was not large and the loads were shifted to remaining columns in this highly redundant structure .
Of equal or even greater significance during this initial impact was the explosion when 90,000 L gallons of jet fuel , comprising nearly 1/3 of the aircrafts weight , ignited .
The ensuing fire was clearly the principal cause of the collapse ( Figure 4 ) .
THE FIRE
The fire is the most misunderstood part of the WTC collapse .
Even today , the media report ( and many scientists believe ) that the steel melted .
It is argued that the jet fuel burns very hot , especially with so much fuel present .
This is not true .
Part of the problem is that people ( including engineers ) often confuse temperature and heat .
While they are related , they are not the same .
Thermodynamically , the heat contained in a material is related to the temperature through the heat capacity and the density ( or mass ) .
Temperature is defined as an intensive property , meaning that it does not vary with the quantity of material , while the heat is an extensive property , which does vary with the amount of material .
One way to distinguish the two is to note that if a second log is added to the fireplace , the temperature does not double ; it stays roughly the same , but the size of the fire or the length of time the fire burns , or a combination of the two , doubles .
Thus , the fact that there were 90,000 L of jet fuel on a few floors of the WTC does not mean that this was an unusually hot fire .
The temperature of the fire at the WTC was not unusual , and it was most definitely not capable of melting steel .
In combustion science , there are three basic types of flames , namely , a jet burner , a pre-mixed flame , and a diffuse flame .
A jet burner generally involves mixing the fuel and the oxidant in nearly stoichiometric proportions and igniting the mixture in a constant - volume chamber .
Since the combustion products cannot expand in the constant - volume chamber , they exit the chamber as a very high velocity , fully combusted , jet .
This is what occurs in a jet engine , and this is the flame type that generates the most intense heat .
In a pre-mixed flame , the same nearly stoichiometric mixture is ignited as it exits a nozzle , under constant pressure conditions .
It does not attain the flame velocities of a jet burner .
An oxyacetylene torch or a Bunsen burner is a pre-mixed flame .
In a diffuse flame , the fuel and the oxidant are not mixed before ignition , but flow together in an uncontrolled manner and combust when the fuel / oxidant ratios reach values within the flammable range .
A fireplace flame is a diffuse flame burning in air , as was the WTC fire .
Diffuse flames generate the lowest heat intensities of the three flame types .
If the fuel and the oxidant start at ambient temperature , a maximum flame temperature can be defined .
For carbon burning in pure oxygen , the maximum is 3,200 °C ; for hydrogen it is 2,750°C .
Thus , for virtually any hydrocarbons , the maximum flame temperature , starting at ambient temperature and using pure oxygen , is approximately 3,000°C .
This maximum flame temperature is reduced by two - thirds if air is used rather than pure oxygen .
The reason is that every molecule of oxygen releases the heat of formation of a molecule of carbon monoxide and a molecule of water .
If pure oxygen is used , this heat only needs to heat two molecules ( carbon monoxide and water ) , while with air , these two molecules must be heated plus four molecules of nitrogen .
Thus , burning hydrocarbons in air produces only one - third the temperature increase as burning in pure oxygen because three times as many molecules must be heated when air is used .
The maximum flame temperature increase for burning hydrocarbons ( jet fuel ) in air is , thus , about 1,000 °Chardly sufficient to melt steel at 1,500°C .

But it is very difficult to reach this maximum temperature with a diffuse flame .
There is nothing to ensure that the fuel and air in a diffuse flame are mixed in the best ratio .
Typically , diffuse flames are fuel rich , meaning that the excess fuel molecules , which are unburned , must also be heated .
It is known that most diffuse fires are fuel rich because blowing on a campfire or using a blacksmiths bellows increases the rate of combustion by adding more oxygen .
This fuel - rich diffuse flame can drop the temperature by up to a factor of two again .
This is why the temperatures in a residential fire are usually in the 500 °C to 650 °C range .
2,3
It is known that the WTC fire was a fuel - rich , diffuse flame as evidenced by the copious black smoke .
Soot is generated by incompletely burned fuel ; hence , the WTC fire was fuel richhardly surprising with 90,000 L of jet fuel available .
Factors such as flame volume and quantity of soot decrease the radiative heat loss in the fire , moving the temperature closer to the maximum of 1,000°C .
However , it is highly unlikely that the steel at the WTC experienced temperatures above the 750 800 °C range .
All reports that the steel melted at 1,500 °C are using imprecise terminology at best .
Some reports suggest that the aluminum from the aircraft ignited , creating very high temperatures .
While it is possible to ignite aluminum under special conditions , such conditions are not commonly attained in a hydrocarbon - based diffuse flame .
In addition , the flame would be white hot , like a giant sparkler .
There was no evidence of such aluminum ignition , which would have been visible even through the dense soot .
It is known that structural steel begins to soften around 425 °C and loses about half of its strength at 650°C .
4
This is why steel is stress relieved in this temperature range .
But even a 50 % loss of strength is still insufficient , by itself , to explain the WTC collapse .
It was noted above that the wind load controlled the design allowables .
The WTC , on this low - wind day , was likely not stressed more than a third of the design allowable , which is roughly one - fifth of the yield strength of the steel .
Even with its strength halved , the steel could still support two to three times the stresses imposed by a 650 °C fire .
The additional problem was distortion of the steel in the fire .
The temperature of the fire was not uniform everywhere , and the temperature on the outside of the box columns was clearly lower than on the side facing the fire .
The temperature along the 18 m long joists was certainly not uniform .
Given the thermal expansion of steel , a 150 °C temperature difference from one location to another will produce yield - level residual stresses .
This produced distortions in the slender structural steel , which resulted in buckling failures .
Thus , the failure of the steel was due to two factors : loss of strength due to the temperature of the fire , and loss of structural integrity due to distortion of the steel from the non-uniform temperatures in the fire .
THE COLLAPSE
Nearly every large building has a redundant design that allows for loss of one primary structural member , such as a column .
However , when multiple members fail , the shifting loads eventually overstress the adjacent members and the collapse occurs like a row of dominoes falling down .
The perimeter tube design of the WTC was highly redundant .
It survived the loss of several exterior columns due to aircraft impact , but the ensuing fire led to other steel failures .
Many structural engineers believe that the weak points the limiting factors on design allowables were the angle clips that held the floor joists between the columns on the perimeter wall and the core structure ( see Figure 5 ) .
With a 700 Pa floor design allowable , each floor should have been able to support approximately 1,300 t beyond its own weight .
The total weight of each tower was about 500,000 t.
As the joists on one or two of the most heavily burned floors gave way and the outer box columns began to bow outward , the floors above them also fell .
The floor below ( with its 1,300 t design capacity ) could not support the roughly 45,000 t of ten floors ( or more ) above crashing down on these angle clips .
This started the domino effect that caused the buildings to collapse within ten seconds , hitting bottom with an estimated speed of 200 km per hour .
If it had been free fall , with no restraint , the collapse would have only taken eight seconds and would have impacted at 300 km /h .

It has been suggested that it was fortunate that the WTC did not tip over onto other buildings surrounding the area .
There are several points that should be made .
First , the building is not solid ; it is 95 percent air and , hence , can implode onto itself .
Second , there is no lateral load , even the impact of a speeding aircraft , which is sufficient to move the center of gravity one hundred feet to the side such that it is not within the base footprint of the structure .
Third , given the near free - fall collapse , there was insufficient time for portions to attain significant lateral velocity .
To summarize all of these points , a 500,000 t structure has too much inertia to fall in any direction other than nearly straight down .

WAS THE WTC DEFECTIVELY DESIGNED ?
The World Trade Center was not defectively designed .
No designer of the WTC anticipated , nor should have anticipated , a 90,000 L Molotov cocktail on one of the building floors .
Skyscrapers are designed to support themselves for three hours in a fire even if the sprinkler system fails to operate .
This time should be long enough to evacuate the occupants .
The WTC towers lasted for one to two hoursless than the design life , but only because the fire fuel load was so large .
No normal office fires would fill 4,000 square meters of floor space in the seconds in which the WTC fire developed .
Usually , the fire would take up to an hour to spread so uniformly across the width and breadth of the building .
This was a very large and rapidly progressing fire ( very high heat but not unusually high temperature ) .
Further information about the design of the WTC can be found on the World Wide Web . 58
WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE
The clean - up of the World Trade Center will take many months .
After all , 1,000,000 t of rubble will require 20,000 to 30,000 truckloads to haul away the material .
The asbestos fire insulation makes the task hazardous for those working nearby .
Interestingly , the approximately 300,000 t of steel is fully recyclable and represents only one days production of the U.S. steel industry .
Separation of the stone and concrete is a common matter for modern steel shredders .
The land - filling of 700,000 t of concrete and stone rubble is more problematic .
However , the volume is equivalent to six football fields , 69 m deep , so it is manageable .
There will undoubtedly be a number of changes in the building codes as a result of the WTC catastrophe .
For example , emergency communication systems need to be upgraded to speed up the notice for evacuation and the safest paths of egress .
Emergency illumination systems , separate from the normal building lighting , are already on the drawing boards as a result of lessons learned from the WTC bombing in 1993 .
There will certainly be better fire protection of structural members .
Protection from smoke inhalation , energy - absorbing materials , and redundant means of egress will all be considered .
A basic engineering assessment of the design of the World Trade Center dispels many of the myths about its collapse .
First , the perimeter tube design of the towers protected them from failing upon impact .
The outer columns were engineered to stiffen the towers in heavy wind , and they protected the inner core , which held the gravity load .
Removal of some of the outer columns alone could not bring the building down .
Furthermore , because of the stiffness of the perimeter design , it was impossible for the aircraft impact to topple the building .
However , the building was not able to withstand the intense heat of the jet fuel fire .
While it was impossible for the fuel - rich , diffuse - flame fire to burn at a temperature high enough to melt the steel , its quick ignition and intense heat caused the steel to lose at least half its strength and to deform , causing buckling or crippling .
This weakening and deformation caused a few floors to fall , while the weight of the stories above them crushed the floors below , initiating a domino collapse .
It would be impractical to design buildings to withstand the fuel load induced by a burning commercial airliner .
Instead of saving the building , engineers and officials should focus on saving the lives of those inside by designing better safety and evacuation systems .
As scientists and engineers , we must not succumb to speculative thinking when a tragedy such as this occurs .
Quantitative reasoning can help sort fact from fiction , and can help us learn from this unfortunate disaster .
As Lord Kelvin said ,
 I often say . . . that when you can measure what you are speaking about , and express it in numbers , you know something about it ; but when you cannot measure it , when you cannot express it in numbers , your knowledge is of a meager and unsatisfactory kind ; it may be the beginning of knowledge , but you have scarcely , in your thoughts , advanced to the stage of science , whatever the matter may be . 
We will move forward from the WTC tragedy and we will engineer better and safer buildings in the future based , in part , on the lessons learned at the WTC .
The reason the WTC collapse stirs our emotions so deeply is because it was an intentional attack on innocent people .
It is easier to accept natural or unintentional tragedies ; it is the intentional loss of life that makes us fear that some people have lost their humanity .
