CINEMA 4D PROJECT FILES
These Cinema4D project files are available under as “ open source ” concept .
They are intended for educational use but really can be used for whatever the fuck you want .
You do n’t need to credit me for whatever commercial or non-commercial use you make of them , but if you could shout me a holla with any project that do come from them , I ’d love to see it :)
SHORT FILMS PROJECT FILES
ZERO -DAY
This scene files have been broken into measure of the film as well as the opening and middle sections .
If you are looking to just download the instrument models , just download the first measure will probably be enough .
The middle section is quite large because it includes all of the video textures .
The film was rendered using Octane but you can still download the project files and redo the materials and lighting using the standard renderer .
MANIFEST DESTINY ​
Here are a few scenes from the film that cover most of the setups .
These were rendered in Octane though by replacing the lights and materials can be used with any renderer .
Some of the files are a bit bigger because they have alembics with physics sims baked in .

Guy Albert de Swindle .
Via : Bloomberg :
New York money manager Guy Albert de Chimay was indicted in New York on grand larceny and forgery charges , according to the Manhattan District Attorney ’s office .
Chimay , 47 , chairman and chief investment officer of Chimay Capital Management Inc. , was arrested yesterday in Wrightsville Beach , North Carolina , on a New York state warrant , said Adam Kaufmann , chief of the investigation division of the Manhattan District Attorney ’s office .
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Chimay yesterday , accusing him and his firm of fraud for touting investments he claimed were tied to the Chimay royal family of Belgium , and then stealing millions of dollars to pay his divorce lawyers and the mortgage on his house in the Hamptons on Long Island east of New York City .
“ He lied to investors , took their money and used it to support his lifestyle , ” Kaufmann said in a phone interview .
The SEC obtained an emergency court order to freeze the assets of Chimay and his firm .
Chimay Capital claimed to be the U.S. investment arm of the royal family based in the Chimay region of Belgium and dating to the 14th century , according to the SEC .
“ Chimay used the trappings of royalty to perpetrate the most common of frauds , ” said George Canellos , director of the SEC ’s New York regional office .
“ Chimay blatantly lied to investors about non-existent investments and then used their money to bankroll his exorbitant personal and business debts . ”

Israeli students are planning a " peace flotilla " to Turkey with humanitarian aid for nations who suffered under Turkish imperialism – the Kurds and Armenians .
The initiative comes in response to the world 's sharp criticism of Israel 's lethal raid on the Gaza flotilla which left nine activists dead and many wounded .
The organizers are currently seeking a suitable vessel and trying to recruit other students to the cause .
No date has yet been set , but a skipper has been found : Arik Ofir , a member of the navy veteran 's union and owner of a private business .
They have also obtained medical supplies , and hope that by the end of the week they will be able to set out .
Murky Waters IDF troops shown bleeding in Turkish press Ynet Hurriyet newspaper publishes photos of Israeli Commando soldiers bruised , bleeding after being beaten by activists aboard Gaza - bound Marmara aid vessel .
Report says army erased photos , but they were reproduced .
IDF : Images prove ship was carrying mercenaries IDF troops shown bleeding in Turkish press
" The whole world saw the flotilla and thought Israel is a terrible state , which comes to shoot people who call themselves peace activists , " said Chairman of the National Students Union Boaz Torporovsky , who is also involved .
" It 's absurd that they always put the Israeli occupation in the headlines and do n't talk about extreme Islamic terror .
There 's a lot of hypocrisy in the world .
" Turkey , which leads the campaign against Israel and makes all sorts of threats is the same Turkey that carried out a holocaust and murdered an entire nation of Armenians , and oppresses a minority larger than the Palestinians – the Kurds – who deserve a state , who have demanded a state for longer than the State of Israel has existed . "

" For this reason , " he continued , " we have decided to help that minority and show up the hypocrisy of the Turkish government .
We are sure that they wo n't care if we sent humanitarian aid .
It 'll be a peace flotilla without the knives or stones that hurt IDF soldiers , without violence , which is intended for all those oppressed by the Turkish government .
" If ( Prime Minister Recep Tayyip ) Erdogan 's heart is where his mouth is , which we all know is n't so , he has no reason to prevent the flotilla from arriving . "
And what about the practicalities ?
" For the flotilla to work , we need three elements : Money , logistics and balls , " he said .
" We 're bringing the balls and some of the logistics , but we need lots of money . "
The National Student Union has been active in PR for a long time .
Torporovsky even infiltrated into a UN conference once , and slammed Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , an incident which received extensive coverage around the world .
Student representatives even got in contact with Iranian students oppressed by the regime in an attempt to raise awareness about what is happening in Iran

The BP oil disaster is now at day 43 , and it ’s still not known how much longer this gusher will continue hemorrhaging oil into the Gulf of Mexico .
But one fact has become clear beyond a doubt , and that ’s BP ’s incompetence and irresponsibility — both before and after the spill .
Because it ’s getting hard to keep track of the company ’s screw - ups , here ’s a list of the top ten :
1 . From the top hat to the top kill :
In the past six weeks , it ’s become obvious that BP has no idea how to fix a hole a mile below the sea .
First there was the failure of the containment dome ( a contraption that had to be constructed after the blast , since BP did n’t think to have one ready ahead of time ) .
We waited for the second , smaller dome ( the top - hat ) , which BP decided would n’t work either .
Next came “ junk shots , ” in which BP unsuccessfully attempted to plug the hole with golf balls , chunks of rubber and other detritus .
Then BP promised the so - called “ top - kill ” would be the best fix .
That failed last weekend , and now BP is moving on to its next trick , another containment dome option that looks much like the others , except this method could actually increase the amount of oil leaking into the Gulf by 20 percent .
And if that does n’t work , the spill will likely continue at least through August , until a relief well can be completed .
2. Tony Hayward , PR genius : BP ’s tousle - haired CEO has a remarkable penchant for saying the wrong thing at the wrong time .
First , he attempted to argue that the spill was “ tiny ” compared to the “ very big ocean . ”
Last week , he said he wants the spill to end because , “ I would like my life back . ”
( Probably not as much as the 11 workers who died in the blast . )
How long until this guy gets canned ?
3. Dirty dispersants :
In a desperate attempt to contain the growing disaster it has created in the Gulf , BP has been spreading chemical dispersants on the sea and at the spill site a mile below the surface .
But BP ’s dispersant of choice , Corexit , has raised concerns at the Environmental Protection Agency about its potential harmful effects on marine life — and it ’s now being dumped in the Gulf in record volumes .
The EPA ordered BP to find a safer option .
But BP is sticking with Corexit , despite the fact that the EPA has a long list of approved , less harmful alternatives .
4. Oil ?
What oil ?
The dispersants that BP has pumped into the Gulf prevent the oil from hitting land , where it can cover coastal critters and sensitive wetlands — not to mention cause a massive PR crisis for the oil firm .
But by driving the oil under water , the dispersants are creating a different kind of environmental disaster in the sea .
Independent scientists have discovered massive plumes of dispersed oil forming under the water , extending up to 22 miles long .
Nevertheless , Hayward is doing his best to convince us that if we ca n’t see the plumes on the ocean ’s surface , they ca n’t possibly be real .
5 . Size matters :
In the days following the explosion , BP tried to convince the public that only 1,000 barrels of oil were leaking into the Gulf every day .
On April 29 the company reassessed that figure to 5,000 barrels , in line with an assessment from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
Now the government ’s spill team says the actual figure is more likely between 12,000 and 19,000 barrels per day — and possibly as high as 25,000 .
It ’s no surprise BP wants to play down the size of the catastrophe , as the company is likely to face penalties based on the amount of oil spilled .
6 . Oppressing the press : Blocking fly - overs , barring press from beaches , sending reporters on wild - goose - chase - missions in search of the “ BP liaison , ” and making workers sign contracts promising not to talk to the media ?
Low , BP , low .
And then they made it worse by bussing in hundreds of fake workers for a photo - op with President Obama .
Did BP really think it could get away with these heavy - handed tactics ?
7. Disastrous planning :
The emergency plan BP put together for its Gulf exploration was a joke .
In addition to listing animals that have never lived anywhere near the Gulf — such as sea lions and walruses — the plan lists a random Japanese home - shopping website as one of its “ primary equipment providers for BP in the Gulf of Mexico Region [ for ] rapid deployment of spill response resources on a 24 hour , 7 days a week basis . ”
This document would be funny if the consequences of the company ’s sloppy safety procedures were n’t so tragic .
8. Misleading Congress : Just last September , David Rainey , a vice president at BP America in charge of Gulf of Mexico exploration , appeared before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee , where he assured legislators that drilling is totally safe .
New technology enables “ safe and reliable production ” of offshore oil and gas , he said , and “ any release from our operations is unacceptable ” and “ rare . ”
9. Beyond Perfunctory : Remember when BP spent hundreds of millions of dollars on its massive “ Beyond Petroleum ” rebranding , in which it attempted to convince consumers that it was really devoted to clean energy investments and just happened to dabble in the oil business on the side ?
Too bad BP did n’t spend that money on safety measures .
Or on actually moving away from oil ; its investments in alternative energy have declined in recent years .
In March , just weeks before the spill , BP closed down a solar plant in Maryland , one of its few investments in clean energy in the US .
10 .
Plus all those other accidents :
If we were to list all of the disastrous exploits in BP ’s recent history , this list would run a lot longer than a top 10 .
Here are a few of the worst hits .
A 2005 explosion at the company ’s Texas City refinery killed 15 workers and injured 170 others .
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined the company $ 21 million for safety failures that led to that explosion , and the Department of Justice fined the company another $ 50 million .
But even after that , the company continued to flout safety precautions — prompting OSHA to levy another $ 87 million fine last year .
DOJ also fined BP $ 20 million for Clean Water
Act violations stemming from a March 2006 major oil pipeline spill that dumped 200,000 gallons of oil into Alaska ’s Prudhoe Bay .
OSHA fined BP another $ 3 million just last March for safety violations at an Ohio refinery .
And since the Deepwater explosion , it ’s emerged that the company cut corners and ignored warnings about the rig before the disaster , in which 11 workers died .
But BP still has n’t learned its lesson :
It ’s exposing clean - up workers to dangerous chemical dispersants without adequate safety equipment .

Chris Pronger does n’t want you to be happy .
After losing consecutive one - goal games to the Chicago Blackhawks in the Stanley Cup Finals , Flyers defenseman Pronger was seen picking up the game puck and carrying it back into the locker room .
The same game puck that rookie goaltender Antti Niemi would probably like to have .
“ He was picking up the puck .
I told him he could keep it , ” said Chicago forward Ben Eager , who along with Pronger , received a game misconduct with no time on the clock .
When asked what Eager said to him , Pronger retorted , “ I do n’t speak whatever language Eager was speaking .
“ Apparently , it got him upset .
So I guess it worked , did n’t it ?
It ’s too bad .
I guess little things amuse little minds . ”
But it was n’t the first time Pronger was seen high - tailing a disc off the ice .
According to CBC , Pronger also stole the puck in game 1 , specifically to keep it away from the Hawks , and as rumor has it , unceremoniously tossed both in the garbage .
“ It ’s in the garbage , ” Pronger told CSNphilly.com .
“ Where it belongs . ”

The Guinness Widget .
Note the cavity near the center of the ball , the tiny hole is located within the cavity .
To answer this question first we need to discuss what makes beer fizzy and how a head forms .
Most beers are carbonated with carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) .
When the beer is in the can some of this CO 2 is dissolved in the beer and some is at the top of the can .
The CO 2 that is dissolved in the beer is what makes it fizzy .
When the can is closed the pressure inside is higher than the pressure outside , so that when you open the can the sudden drop in pressure and the agitation of pouring causes some of the CO 2 to bubble out of solution , forming a head on your beer .

A stout like Guinness has a creamier , longer lasting head than a canned lager beer .
In addition , Guinness is less fizzy than a regular lager beer .
Guinness is canned with a mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen .
Nitrogen is not absorbed into the beer nearly as well as carbon dioxide , so even though a can of Guinness may be at the same pressure as a can of lager , it contains less CO ( and is therefore less fizzy ) because the nitrogen makes up some of the pressure .
Because a beer like Guinness contains less dissolved CO 2 , if you poured it from a can with no widget , the head not be very thick because most of the CO 2 would stay dissolved .
The purpose of the widget is to release the CO 2 from some of the beer in the can to create the head .
The widget is a plastic , nitrogen - filled sphere with a tiny hole in it .
The sphere is added to the can before the can is sealed .
It floats in the beer , with the hole just slightly below the surface of the beer .
Just before the can is sealed a small shot of liquid nitrogen is added to the beer .
This liquid nitrogen evaporates during the rest of the canning process and pressurizes the can .
As the pressure increases in the can , beer is slowly forced into the sphere through the hole , compressing the nitrogen inside the sphere .

Sure , the detail is n't the same you 'd get were there actual Mass Effect LEGO sets available , but the effect he 's managed with nothing but 1040 translucent orange pieces and some black bricks is remarkable .
The whole thing took only a few days to build , but then ... it broke , so he had to build it again .
A precursor to the events of Mass Effect 3 , perhaps ?

Business Insider has laid out the news that Google will finally be answering some users ’ prayers .
I ’m personally a huge fan of the “ conversations ” style of threading in Gmail .
I find it to be better for workflow .
However , some users ( I ’m going to take a guess and say that people who have used Outlook for years ) find it horribly difficult to deal with , and blame it for their missing of messages .
Google , after a recent shift in leadership for Gmail , will be answering the call of those users .
Vic Gundotra , former VP of Engineering for Google , has taken the reigns at Gmail and says that Google should have answer the call sooner .
Look for “ normal ” options for Gmail to come in the next few months .
Will you switch ?
Or are you , like me , simply too addicted to Gmail conversations to ever go back ?

You Up
On a recent warm Friday night , I had the good fortune to while away the time in the company of friends out on their deck .
The theme for the evening was a Man - B - Q , a barbecue in which , as our host announced , " No girly things , such as vegetables , utensils , or napkins , " were allowed .
Guests were encouraged to bring side dishes to the Man - B - Q , as long as they were " meaty comestibles " to accompany the meat that would be grilled throughout the evening .
What to bring to a Man - B - Q ?
The men I know love things like smoked ribs and beefy steaks , but then again , so do I .
As I stood before my refrigerator and contemplated what to do , it dawned on me that the only logical thing to bring to a Man - B - Q is some part of a man .
As luck would have it , I just happened to have a pair of testicles sitting in my freezer .
The testicles are also referred to as testes ; the singular is testis .
In Latin , the word testis means " witness " ; in ancient Rome it was the custom for men to place one hand on a testicle when taking an oath in court .
Not all gentalia is good to eat .
As some readers may recall , in February I wrote the Valentine 's Day edition of the Nasty Bits in which I tried my best to make bull penis palatable , but to no avail .
Penis is often made into chew toys for dogs because it is nearly impossible to digest unless it 's stewed for a long time , in which case the vascular tissue breaks down into a gluey , flaccid mess of a dish with virtually no flavor .
Testicles , on the hand , are extremely good to eat .
Bigger is not always better .
Duck testicles , which take the size and general shape of kumquats , are more tender and delicately flavored than those of lamb , which are more like small avocados .
While duck testicles do not taste particularly ducky , lamb testicles are unmistakably lamby with a pungent , grassy smell and a offal - intensive taste that 's akin to stomach .
Their texture is almost identical to that of a succulent scallop .
There are two main options to consider when cooking lamb testicles .
If you are primarily concerned with flavor , then grilling the testicles imparts a smokiness that complements the gamey undertone of the glands .
Grilling also offers the advantage of retaining the testicles in their whole form .
The outer membrane not only crisps and chars on the grilll , it also keeps the testicles juicy as they cook .
If you 're seeking more textural contrast , batter them in eggs and panko crumbs .
They can either be deep - fried for classic Rocky Mountain oysters , or pan - fried in a heavy skillet .

Abstract Background
The cerebellum is a complex structure that can be affected by several congenital and acquired diseases leading to alteration of its function and neuronal circuits .
Identifying the structural bases of cerebellar neuronal networks in humans in vivo may provide biomarkers for diagnosis and management of cerebellar diseases .
Objectives
To define the anatomy of intrinsic and extrinsic cerebellar circuits using high - angular resolution diffusion spectrum imaging ( DSI ) .
Methods
We acquired high - resolution structural MRI and DSI of the cerebellum in four healthy female subjects at 3T .
DSI tractography based on a streamline algorithm was performed to identify the circuits connecting the cerebellar cortex with the deep cerebellar nuclei , selected brainstem nuclei , and the thalamus .
Results
Using in - vivo DSI in humans we were able to demonstrate the structure of the following cerebellar neuronal circuits : ( 1 ) connections of the inferior olivary nucleus with the cerebellar cortex , and with the deep cerebellar nuclei ( 2 ) connections between the cerebellar cortex and the deep cerebellar nuclei , ( 3 ) connections of the deep cerebellar nuclei conveyed in the superior ( SCP ) , middle ( MCP ) and inferior ( ICP ) cerebellar peduncles , ( 4 ) complex intersections of fibers in the SCP , MCP and ICP , and ( 5 ) connections between the deep cerebellar nuclei and the red nucleus and the thalamus .
Conclusion
For the first time , we show that DSI tractography in humans in vivo is capable of revealing the structural bases of complex cerebellar networks .
DSI thus appears to be a promising imaging method for characterizing anatomical disruptions that occur in cerebellar diseases , and for monitoring response to therapeutic interventions .

Introduction
The cerebellum is a complex structure that plays a major role in motor control [ 1 ] as well as in cognitive - emotional processing [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] .
Knowledge regarding structure of the human cerebellum is essential for understanding the functional consequences of congenital and acquired neurological diseases of the cerebellum including sporadic and hereditary ataxias , the consequences of focal lesions such as stroke , and the cerebellar component of neuropsychiatric diseases including schizophrenia , Asperger 's syndrome and autism [ 4 ] – [ 8 ] .
Investigations of the gross anatomy of the human cerebellum date back to the 18th century [ 9 ] – [ 11 ] and have been further elaborated upon in recent human MRI atlases [ 12 ] – [ 15 ] .
In contrast , knowledge of intrinsic neural circuits of the cerebellum and extracerebellar connections with spinal cord , brainstem and cerebral hemispheres has been derived exclusively from tract tracing studies and physiological investigations in animals because there has been no method available for the study of these pathways and circuits in the human brain [ 16 ] – [ 22 ] .
Recent developments in MRI technology , however , have enabled the study of the anatomical basis of cerebellar circuits in humans using diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) methodology .
Some advances have been made using DTI [ 23 ] but the underlying diffusion tensor model has intrinsic limitations that permit only partial visualization of cerebellar white matter tracts , and limited capability to reveal complex anatomical details of the cerebellar circuits [ 23 ] .
In contrast , diffusion spectrum imaging ( DSI ) , a high angular resolution diffusion technique [ 24 ] , is able to define more complex structures such as crossing fibers .
DSI has proven useful in studying the fiber tracts and connections of the human cerebrum and cerebellar systems in vitro [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] .
We hypothesized that DSI would yield new insights into the organization of the human cerebellum in vivo .
Specifically , we tested the hypothesis that the connections of the human cerebellum in vivo would reflect those identified in the experimental animal , and be consistent with findings of the limited published post mortem studies to date .
Methods Image acquisition and DSI tractography reconstruction
Four healthy female participants ( age : 26±4 yrs ) underwent magnetic resonance DSI in a commercial 3T scanner ( Trio a Tim System , Siemens , Erlangen , Germany ) using a 32 - channel head helmet coil .
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Siemens AG , Healthcare Sector , Imaging , Magnetic Resonance , Process Lifecycle Management ( H IM MR PLM , Erlangen , Germany ) .
All subjects provided written informed consent prior to the imaging session .
DSI was performed using a single - shot spin - echo echo - planar imaging ( EPI ) product sequence and the following parameters : TR / TE = 6600 / 138 , FoV = 212 mm , 34 slices , 2.2 mm isotropic resolution , GRAPPA = 2 , 258 diffusion directions covering a half q - space 3D grid with radial grid size of 5 , b( max ) = 8000 s/mm2 and one image acquired at b = 0 s/mm2 ( referred to here as b0 - image ) , total acquisition time = 28:44 min.
DSI scans centered in the cerebellum were acquired twice and averaged subsequently .
Diffusion encoding was performed using a bipolar encoding scheme to minimize distortion effects due to residual eddy - current effects introduced by the diffusion gradient pulses [ 27 ] .
High and low b-value scans were interleaved to qualitatively assess subject motion .
For anatomical reference a whole brain high - resolution MPRAGE was acquired using the parameters described in the ADNI protocol ( http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI/Research/Cores/ADNI_Siemens_3T_TrioTimVB13.pdf)
( TR : 2400 ms , TE : 3.59 ms , 0.8 mm isotropic resolution , FOV256×256 ) .
DSI reconstruction was performed with Diffusion toolkit [ 28 ] using data from single DSI acquisitions and from the averaged raw images .
Subsequently , DSI tractography was performed based on a FACT - like streamline algorithm [ 29 ] using the Track Vis software [ 28 ] .
We seeded a path for every orientation density function ( odf ) max vector at every voxel , extending the path along the vector of least curvature in a new voxel , and stopping the process if this curvature ≥35° .
The colour - coding of the obtained fibers is based on standard RGB code applied to the vector at every segment of each fiber .
Blue indicates the rostro- caudal direction ; red the medio- lateral plane ; and green the dorso- ventral orientation .
Region of interest ( ROIs ) selection
We used the Track Vis 3 - D tool to select the ROI in b0 images .
The anatomical structure corresponding to the desired ROIs was initially localized in MRI atlases of the cerebellum [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , subsequently identified in the MPRAGE images , and then selected in the co-registered b0 dataset .
The following regions were defined as seed - point for the analysis : 1 ) the inferior olivary nucleus ; 2 ) deep cerebellar nuclei ; 3 ) ventrolateral region of thalamus ; 4 ) red nucleus ; and 5 ) the superior cerebellar peduncle ( SCP ) , 6 ) middle cerebellar peduncle ( MCP ) , and 7 ) inferior cerebellar peduncle ( ICP ) .
The pathways identified by performing tractography through the ROIs were compared with known anatomical pathways as defined in human gross anatomy texts [ 30 ] and in connectional studies in experimental animals [ 31 ] – [ 33 ] .
Discussion
In this study , we used Diffusion Spectrum MRI to test whether it is feasible to examine the intrinsic and extrinsic cerebellar circuits in the living human brain .
Such ability represents a necessary step in defining pathological anatomy of the spinocerebellar and other ataxic disorders , in describing the cerebellar component of neuropsychiatric illness , and developing biomarkers for disease progression and modifying interventions .
We show , for the first time in humans , that DSI has the capacity to elucidate the structural basis of neural circuits in the human cerebellum in vivo .
We improved the intrinsic low - sensitivity of the DSI method by optimizing the acquisition protocol and by using a 32 - channel head coil array at 3T to a level that allowed us to reconstruct and visualize cerebellar circuits and pathways .
The study of cerebellar connectional networks is only partially possible with DTI techniques , because DTI suffers from the limitation of being unable to resolve the convergence of multiple fiber bundles / connections into relatively small structures , as occurs in the white matter in the medullary core of the cerebellum , and within the cerebellar cortex itself [ 23 ] , [ 36 ] .
DSI , a high angular resolution method which images complex distributions of intra-voxel fiber - orientations , overcomes this limitation of the DTI technique and has the demonstrated capability of identifying fiber crossings within neural structures [ 24 ] .
This is exemplified by the DSI demonstration of long association fibers pathways in the monkey cerebral hemisphere , observations that were supported by comparison with the results of tract tracing studies using the autoradiographic technique [ 25 ] .
Further , DSI is sufficiently powerful to map regions of fiber - crossing not only in cerebral white matter , but also in the basis pontis and the cerebral and cerebellar cortices in monkey and human brains post - mortem [ 26 ] .
It is noteworthy that related techniques such as q - ball imaging may lead to very similar results [ 37 ] , [ 38 ] .
However , since DSI represents the most general approach to disentangle complex structures it was used in this investigation .
To our knowledge , no attempt has been made to map cerebellar connectivity networks with DSI in humans in vivo .
Combining the ROI - based DSI tractography with high - resolution anatomical images , we were able to visualize the olivo - cerebellar circuits in humans in vivo .
The fiber tracks that we demonstrated linking the inferior olivary nucleus with the cerebellar cortex and with collaterals to the deep cerebellar nuclei ( olivary - cerebellar nucleus - olivary loop ) , likely correspond to the course and connectional patterns of the climbing fibers that originate in the inferior olivary nucleus .
We were also able to identify essential elements of the intrinsic cerebellar circuitry : the cortico - nuclear projection between deep cerebellar nuclei ( fastigial , interpositus and dentate ) and the cerebellar cortex ; and the intrinsic cerebellar cortical circuitry , characterised by fiber solutions corresponding to the granule cell axons ' parallel fibers that traverse the long axis of the cerebellar folium , intersecting with the perpendicularly arranged fiber - tracks consistent with climbing fibers of the olivocerebellar system traced from the ROI in the inferior olive [ 39 ] .
From tract tracing studies and physiological investigations in animals [ 16 ] –[ 18 ] , [ 34 ] , it is known that climbing fibers ( CF ) originate from neurons in the inferior olivary nucleus and terminate around the proximal dendrites of the Purkinje cell ( PC ) .
Parallel fibers ( PF ) , axons of the granule cells , synapse with the distal dendrites of the PC .
The CF and PF thus constitute part of the connectivity substrate of the molecular layer in the cerebellar cortex .
DSI cannot reach to the level of the synapse , but it does identify the perpendicular orientation of these two cerebellar afferent fiber systems that intersect in the cerebellar molecular layer , and it does so in vivo .
We show the extracerebellar pathways that are linked with the deep cerebellar nuclei in the SCP , MCP and ICP .
The capability of the DSI method to resolve crossing fibers also makes it possible to provide a visualization in human in vivo of the complex fiber intersections between the three cerebellar peduncles , previously shown in tracing studies [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 19 ] .
Such a demonstration has not been possible using DTI .
We have also provided evidence of the ability using DSI to identify the thalamo - cortical pathway in humans by seeding the ventrolateral region of thalamus , and the rubro - cerebellar connection by placing the ROI seed in the red nucleus .
Advantages and limitations of the methodology Optimizations of the acquisition protocol and the use of a dedicated 32 - channel coil with excellent SNR properties based on Wiggins et al . [ 40 ] , aimed at compensating for some of the unfavorable SNR properties in high b-value diffusion MRI , including averaging of consecutive scans [ 41 ] .
Using this state - of - the - art methodology and TrackVis 3D for interactive visualization of fiber trajectories , we could map complex cerebellar tracts and connectional pathways .
We note that accuracy of the tractography method is user dependent because reconstruction threshold , turn angle , and mask threshold have to be adapted according to scan parameters and image properties .
To address this limitation , we applied identical tracking parameters to all the data processing .
Further , despite the advanced technology and methods used for DSI acquisition , in some cases we could only partially map the cerebellar circuit of interest .
For example , we could visualize only a subset of the fibers tracks connecting the dentate nucleus ROI to the cerebellar cortex .
We hypothesize that this could have happened for three reasons : first , the dentate nucleus is located deep within the cerebellum .
Due to the coil design the highest sensitivity and SNR is provided in the superficial layers [ 40 ] , whereas regions closer to the center of the brain , such as the deep cerebellar structure are imaged with a lower SNR rendering our method less sensitive in these regions .
Second , the dentate nucleus is a small structure where fiber trajectories potentially diverge at smaller angles than the angular resolution power of our DSI acquisition scheme .
For similar reasons , we could not track the complete path connecting the ROI in thalamus and brainstem to the cerebellar cortex via the deep cerebellar nuclei .
Two separate fiber bundles belonging to these pathways had to be delineated : first from the ROI in thalamus and brainstem to the cerebellar deep nuclei , and then from the deep nuclei to the cortex .
Third , subject motion as well as brain pulsation originating from cardiac and respiration cycles may limit DSI tracking .
Future iterations of this DSI approach could be enhanced by combining specific higher SNR and angular resolution at reduced scan times , as well as adding image registration methods .
It is notable that all subjects tolerated the scan protocol with minimal or no evidence of motion according to qualitative visual inspections of the low b-value images , i.e. motion is evaluated to be in the sub - voxel regime and thus of minimal influence for our analysis .
In sum , we were able for the first time to visualize human cerebellar circuits in vivo non-invasively using DSI .
We demonstrate pathways and connections that are in general agreement with histological tract tracing studies in animal models .
In vivo DSI of the cerebellum has the potential to introduce new insights into the pathophysiology of neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases , and to provide anatomical and connectional biomarkers of cerebellar disease .

UFC fighters are given two cardinal rules when they enter the UFC ’s octagon .
The first is , ‘ protect yourself at all times ’ .
The second and most important is , ‘ do n’t mess with ‘ Big’ Dan Miragliotta ‘ .
Paul Daley clearly forgot that rule when he threw a sucker punch at Josh Koscheck after the bell at UFC 113 and suffered the consequences as the 6ft 4 ″ , 295lb referee grabbed him by the neck and rag - dolled him around the octagon .
Now admittedly the punishment in that instance fit the crime , but do n’t start thinking just because you ’ve committed a minor misdemeanor that your going to be treated any differently .
Fair warning – If Big Dan tells you to stop the fight you ’d better damn well do it right there and then son , or you ’ll end up getting steamrollered into next week like Akihiro Gono at UFC 89 .
It ’s not just the little guys that Big Dan is laying down the law to either .
Renowned backyard brawler or not , ifdoes n’t let go when he ’s told to then by god he ’d better be prepared to experience The Wrath Of Dan .
Despite his size he can be more subtle about dishing out punishment though .
Watch in the clip below as he let ’s Heath Herring know who ’s boss prior to his bout with Brock Lesnar by “ accidentally ” jabbing him in the eye .
He ’s a crafty one , make no mistake .
Thankfully most fighters know not to step out of line when Miragliotta ’s around or else we ’d quickly end up with another injury crisis and potentially the first ever fatality in the octagon .
Instead usually all it takes is a quiet word from Dan to put the kybosh on any untoward antics .
Take John Salter ’s out - of - character buffoonery in the prelims at UFC 113 for instance .
After Jason MacDonald broke his leg accidentally during a takedown attempt , Salter started celebrating like he ’d just knocked out Muhammad Ali in his prime with a stiff jab .
Totally uncalled for under the circumstances , and being the professional that he is Big Dan recognized it and put an end to his shenanagins ASAP simply by having a quick word in his shell - like .
I ’m no lip reader so do n’t quote me on this , but after careful analysis of the clip below I believe that what he says here is , “ cut that sh!t out Salter or I ’ll break your legs with my bare hands . ”
That ’s it Dan , you tell ’em .
That ’s the thing about Dan – he ’s not afraid to speak his mind , and he ’ll even call out the biggest stars in the sport if they step out of line .
At UFC 112 Anderson Silva spent the closing rounds of his fight with Demain Maia in cruise control , preferring to dance around the cage rather than actually fight .
Like most people watching Big Dan did n’t take too kindly to that approach , and so he decided to call a halt to the fight to let him know .
Again I ’ve went to the trouble of translating what he said , word for word to the middleweight champion .
“ There ’ll be none of that Kalib Starnes sh!t here Silva – not on my watch !
Pound - for - pound fighter on the planet or not , if you do n’t get your act together I ’ll take you down to Chinatown .
Did you see what I did to Kimbo Slice ?
That could be you next . ”
At the conclusion of the fight Dan ’s disgust at his antics was clear for all to see .
In the clip below it looks like Big Dan is raising Silva ’s hand in victory , but in actual fact he ’s just letting everybody know which limb he ’s going to rip off if he tries anything like that again in the future .
So there you have it .
Big Dan Miragliotta , not just a referee – he ’s the UFC ’s very own judge , jury and executioner .
Do n’t mess !

New York ’s New Bullying Law
Via Miriam at Feministing comes word that the New York state legislature has passed a bill called the Dignity for All Students Act , which protects students from sexual orientation - related bullying .
However , DASA does something just as important and far more rare : it protects gender expression .
Protections for sexual orientation are narrow and can be circumvented .
It ’s easy for bigots to say , “ I have no problem with gays and lesbians , as long as they do n’t act all flamboyant , ” and then claim to be discriminating on the basis of gender nonconformity instead of sexual or romantic orientation .
In the real world , that leaves the protections inapplicable to the folks who need them most .
Real protection means protection that covers both orientation and gender expression , so that it helps people who are gay , lesbian , bi , pan , queer , asexual or who identify in some other way , and so that it helps people whatever they were assigned at birth , whether they have a trans history or not , whether they conform their gender presentation to expectations or not , and whether they even fit on a binary gender scheme at all or not .
Depending on how it ’s interpreted , this appears to have that .
It ’s not a GLBT specific bill , either .
It covers race , national origin , weight and a host of other areas where students who do n’t fit the norm are often singled out and harassed .
This is a major step in the right direction .
Bullying is a tough nut to crack .
Following the tragic suicide of Phoebe Prince in Massachusetts , the Boston Globe is running a series on bullying and the first installment is up here .
Schools need a mandate to put a stop to it , and they need the tools to do it .
They also need an institutional commitment , which is not as simple as a piece of legislation .
But this helps .
You can create a folder that is hidden from the default Finder GUI view by taking advantage of Mac OS X ’s unix underpinnings .
That probably sounds a lot more complex than it is however , and it turns out it ’s actually really easy to make a completely hidden folder on the Mac .
This walkthrough details how to both make the hidden folder , and then how to access it yourself in Mac OS .
First let ’s create the hidden folder , then we ’ll access the secret folder on the Mac , and also show how to make it visible again if you change your mind .
All of this relies on placing a period in front of the file name .
How to create the secret folder
* Launch the Terminal ( located in / Applications / Utilities )
* At the command line , type :
mkdir .hiddenfolder
Feel free to replace the name hiddenfolder with anything else , leaving spaces and special characters out of the name will make it easier to deal with in the future .
How to access the secret folder
* Now click back to the Finder , and hit Command + Shift +
G to bring up the ‘ Go to Folder ’ dialog box
* Type in the full path to the folder you just created , replacing ‘ username ’ and ‘ hiddenfolder ’ with your username and folder name , respectively :
/users/username/.hiddenfolder/
* Your hidden folder will now be opened in the Finder , you can drag and drop whatever you want into the directory
Making existing folders hidden and making hidden folders visible again
You can actually make any folder invisible from the Finder ( and most apps ) just by adding a period to the front of the name , you can do this with existing folders via the command line :
mv Folder .
Folder
And you can make any invisible or hidden folder visible again by reversing this and removing the period from the front :
mv . Folder Folder
Note that you ca n’t enter a period in front of a folder or file name in the Mac OS X Finder , if you try you will be presented with this dialogue box telling you the dot “. ” is reserved for the Mac OS X system software :
Setting Mac OS
X to display hidden folders
You can actually set Mac OS X to show hidden files by issuing a command in the Terminal .
This will expose your hidden folder completely within the Finder , but you ’ll also see tons of other important system files and folders .
This is generally not recommended to keep activated as it is both confusing to many users and it makes it easy to accidentally delete important files .
Notes on hidden folders
Remember that these folders are not hidden completely , they are just not visible from the Mac OS X Finder .
Many applications wo n’t see the folder either , but various FTP programs like Transmit have the option to show invisible files and the folder would be visible to those applications .
Likewise , the folder would always be visible via the command line to anyone who typed the ls command and added the - a flag , signifying to display all files , like so : ls - a
If you have Apple ’s Developer Tools installed you can use a utility called ‘ setfile ’ which allows you to set any directory or file as invisible , you can read more about hiding files and folders with setfile in Mac OS X , but the limitations on visibility are practically identical to the above technique : file is invisible from the Finder but visible with ls - a or certain applications .
OTTAWA–Will the Supreme Court of Canada have to step in to sort out the power struggle between the House of Commons and Prime Minister Stephen Harper ’s government ?
It ’s a solution that some parliamentary experts and observers believe is possible after Commons Speaker Peter Milliken issues his historic ruling on whether Parliament or the government have the right to control the documents in the Afghan detainee controversy .
“ On this one , I think that ’s something the government certainly could do , ” said Ned Franks , professor emeritus at Queen ’s University and one of the country ’s leading parliamentary scholars .
Milliken is expected to announce as early as Thursday his verdict in a serious , five - month - old standoff between the Harper government and the opposition , which forms a majority in the Commons .
Milliken ’s ruling could have significant implications for how power is exercised in parliamentary democracies – not just in Canada , but beyond .
In December , the three opposition parties banded together and passed a parliamentary order , compelling the government to produce all documents related to Canada ’s treatment of detainees captured by Canadian forces in Afghanistan .
The order has the force of law , but the government has argued that other laws , protecting national security for instance , weigh against wholesale compliance with the parliamentary dictate .
In many ways , this is a sequel to another constitutional crisis – specifically , the standoff immediately after the 2008 election , when the opposition parties banded together in a coalition that threatened to unseat Harper ’s government .
The Liberals and New Democrats put together a coalition - government proposal , with tacit agreement from the Bloc Québecois .
But the Conservative government , in a massive public - relations campaign , argued that the coalition was undemocratic and a sop to separatists .
Governor General Michaëlle Jean granted Harper a request to prorogue Parliament , but reportedly made clear , in a two - hour discussion with the Prime Minister , that the government was being granted the stay of execution on condition that it co-operate better with the majority opposition in the Commons .
Now , a little more than a year later , Harper ’s refusal to co-operate with this parliamentary order could be viewed as defiance of the governor general ’s instructions .
In that case , if this dispute lands in front of Jean again , she may have no choice but to dissolve Parliament , recognizing that it has become dysfunctional .
The Supreme Court , however , could represent a compromise of sorts .
If Milliken sides with the argument that Parliament prevails over government , the Justice Department may well draft a formal reference to the Supreme Court – in the form of a constitutional , not a political question – about which laws have precedence in the case of a dispute .
In other words , rather than going to the governor general , and almost certainly an election , the problem would head to the Supreme Court , where everyone could buy some time .
It ’s not unheard of .
Former prime minister Jean Chretien asked the Supreme Court to sort out the rules of secession in the late 1990s and the current , Conservative government is asking the Supreme Court to issue an opinion on whether the federal government has the authority to establish a national securities regulator .
The provinces and Liberal senators have also been urging Harper to put his Senate - reform ideas to the Supreme Court .

Franks said this is n’t an ideal situation in the current standoff .
In a perfect world , Parliament would n’t defer to the Supreme Court to sort out its own powers .
Franks suspects and hopes that Milliken is able to issue a ruling that treads somewhere down the middle , allowing the government and the Commons to sit down and solve this standoff themselves .
“ I would far rather see the two sides in Parliament sort this out than have it go to the Supreme Court , ” Franks said .

The spring of 1989 saw the largest pro-democracy demonstration in the history of China 's communist regime .
The following timeline tracks how the protests began in April among university students in Beijing , spread across the nation , and ended on June 4 with a final deadly assault by an estimated force of 300,000 soldiers from People 's Liberation Army ( PLA ) .
Throughout these weeks , China 's top leaders were deeply divided over how to handle the unrest , with one faction advocating peaceful negotiation and another demanding a crackdown .
Excerpts from their statements , drawn from The Tiananmen Papers , reveal these internal divisions .
Mourners flock to Tiananmen Gate .
Tens of thousands of university students begin gathering spontaneously in Tiananmen Square , Beijing , the nation 's symbolic central space .
They come to mourn the death of Hu Yoabang , former General Secretary of the Communist Party .
Hu had been a symbol to them of anti-corruption and political reform .
In his name , the students call for press freedom and other reforms .
Unrest Spreads Demonstrations escalate in Beijing and spread to other cities and universities .
Workers and officials join in with complaints about inflation , salaries and housing .
Party leaders fear the demonstrations might lead to chaos and rebellion .
One group , lead by Premier Li Peng , second - ranking in the Party hierarchy , suspects " black hands " of " bourgeois liberal elements " are working behind the scenes to undermine the government .
A minority faction , led by Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang , believes that " the student mainstream is good " and that their patriotism should be affirmed , " although any inappropriate methods of action should be pointed out to them . "
Li argues that the protests should be " nipped in the bud ; " however , Zhao convinces them to wait , stating , " Our main task right now is to be sure the memorial service for Comrade Yaobang goes off smoothly . "
More than 100,000 university students assemble outside the Great Hall of the People , where Hu's memorial service is being held .
Three students carry a petition of demands up the steps of the Great Hall and insist on meeting Li Peng ; he does not respond .
Over the next days , the students boycott classes and organize into unofficial student unions -- an illegal act in China .
Chinese Premier Li Peng With Zhao Ziyang on a state visit to North Korea , Li Peng calls a meeting of the Politburo , a meeting dominated by Party members antagonistic to the students .
They convince Party elder Deng Xiaoping , the de facto head of state , that the students aim to overthrow him and the Communist Party .
Deng decides the Party has thus far been " tolerant and restrained , " but the time has come for action .
" We must explain to the whole Party and nation that we are facing a most serious political struggle .
…
We 've got to be explicit and clear in opposing this turmoil . "
Editorial Denounces the Students " The Necessity for a Clear Stand Against Turmoil , " ( read the full translation ) appears in the state - run newspaper , the People 's Daily .
This editorial closely follows the opinions expressed by Deng at the meeting the day before .
" This is a well - planned plot … to confuse the people and throw the country into turmoil , " it reads . " …
Its real aim is to reject the Chinese Communist Party and the socialist system at the most fundamental level . "
Members of the Chinese navy demonstrate in Beijing .
The editorial sets off more demonstrations in other cities .
In Tiananmen Square the ranks of protestors now include a cross-section of society .
" In Beijing one in 10 of the population was joining in … all of the old people , all the little children , so it was massive , " explains Jan Wong , a foreign journalist in Beijing at the time .
" You had doctors and nurses and scientists and army people demonstrating .
The Chinese navy was demonstrating , and I thought , ' This is extraordinary because who 's left ?
It 's just the top leaders who are n't out there . ' "
The World Is Watching Party leaders are aware of the growing foreign press coverage of the demonstrations , but remain split over how to stop the protests and get the students to return to classes .
Zhao Ziyang 's camp advocates negotiation and stresses the government should address legitimate complaints , such as the need for political reform .
Li Peng and his allies argue that social stability must be restored before any reforms can be considered .
Student demonstrators mark the anniversary of " May Fourth . "
Tens of thousands of students march into Tiananmen Square to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the 1919 " May Fourth Movement , " which also took place in the square .
They pledge to return to classes the next day but intend to keep pressing for reforms .
Zhao Ziyang , in a speech to foreign bankers , expresses support for the students ' " patriotism " and essentially contradicts the government 's April 26 editorial .
This angers senior Party members .
Many students return to classes , and the movement is in flux and lacks clear leadership .
Certain factions plan more demonstrations and a hunger strike .
Meanwhile , tensions escalate within the Party as they prepare for Soviet Party Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev 's historic visit to Beijing .
Deng Xiaoping wants to settle things peacefully , but insists the students must be out of the square before Gorbachev arrives .
Zhao , unable to convince the students to call off the demonstrations , begins to lose favor with the senior Party members .
Hunger Strike Anticipating Soviet Party Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev 's visit , about 160 students begin a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square , citing the government 's failure to respond to their requests for dialogue .
One of the printed manifestos reads : " The nation is in crisis -- beset by rampant inflation , illegal dealing by profiteering officials , abuses of power , corrupt bureaucrats , the flight of good people to other countries and deterioration of law and order .
Compatriots , fellow countrymen who cherish morality , please hear our voices ! "
Their hunger strike draws broad public support ; many important intellectuals pledge their help .
" There 's such a feeling in China about food because of the thousands of years of famines that they 've had , " explains Jan Wong . " …
So when the students went on their hunger strike , it really moved people to tears . "
" Loss of Face " Mikhail Gorbachev arrives in Beijing for the first Sino - Soviet summit since 1959 , but the hunger strike forces the government to cancel plans to welcome him in Tiananmen Square .
His escort is blocked by protestors on nearly every street in Beijing . " [ F ] or the Chinese government , [ this was ] a big loss of face , very scary , " says Jan Wong . " …
They were aware of what was happening in the Soviet Union -- and so were the Chinese people -- that the Communist Party in the Soviet Union was more or less imploding .
[ The Party leaders ] were very frightened in China . "
Divided Politburo
More than 3,000 people are now participating in the hunger strike .
The embarrassing protests during Gorbachev 's visit further polarizes the Politburo .
During an emergency meeting , Zhao maintains that the way to end the strike is for the government to retract its April 26 editorial , accept the students ' demand for dialogue and begin reforms .
" [ T ] he vast majority of student demonstrators are patriotic and sincerely concerned for our country .
We may not approve of all of their methods , but their demand to promote democracy , to deepen the reforms and to root out corruption are quite reasonable , " says Zhao .
Li Peng insists the government cannot capitulate : " It 's more and more clear that a tiny minority is trying to use the turmoil to reach its political goal , which is repudiation of Communist Party leadership and the socialist system . "
Li says .
" Their goals are to topple the Chinese Communist Party … to completely repudiate the people 's democratic dictatorship . "
Plans for Martial Law
When the case is put to Deng Xiaoping , he decides against Zhao 's recommendations and proposes instituting martial law to end the hunger strike .
" The aim … will be to suppress the turmoil once and for all and to return things quickly to normal , " he is reported to have said .
" This is the unshirkable duty of the Party and the government . "
Zhao expresses his problems with this position but concedes : " I will submit to Party discipline ; the minority does yield to the majority . "
Li Peng Meets With Students Zhao Ziyang visits hospitalized hunger strikers and tries to convince them to call off their fast .
Afterward , he is reported to have drafted a letter of resignation to the Politburo , but it is never sent .
Li Peng holds a televised meeting with student leaders in the Great Hall of the People ( see a map of Tiananmen Square ) .
It ends without any progress .
( Read the translated transcript of the meeting . )
That evening a meeting of Party elders and Politburo members , including Deng Xiaoping and Li Peng , approves the declaration of martial law .
Zhao Ziyang does not attend .
Martial Law Declared Zhao Ziyang makes a final plea to the students .
Student leaders learn of the plan to declare martial law and call off their hunger strike .
Instead , they stage a mass sit-in in Tiananmen Square that draws about 1.2 million supporters , including members of the police and military and industrial workers .
Zhao Ziyang appears in Tiananmen Square in a final , unsuccessful effort to appeal for compromise .
It is his last public appearance .
He is soon removed from office and replaced by Jiang Zemin .
That evening , Li Peng appears on state television to declare martial law .
" We must adopt firm and resolute measures to end the turmoil swiftly , to maintain the leadership of the party as well as the socialist system . "
( Read a translation of his speech . )
The Army Is Sent Into Beijing Beijing citizens appeal to the PLA .
For the first time in 40 years of Communist rule , the PLA troops attempt to occupy Beijing .
A huge number of civilian protestors block their convoys on the streets .
Beijingers begin a dialogue with the soldiers , trying to explain to them why they should n't be there .
" You had these … touching moments of the people appealing to the army to join them , and feeding them , and giving them water , and saying , you know , ' Could be your son .
Could be your daughter , ' " says Orville Schell , who was in Beijing at the time .
" And [ you have ] these sort of doe - eyed , puzzled soldiers , who were mostly country people , were n't experienced with big city life , just wondering what was going on here .
And not wanting to hurt anybody . "
The soldiers have been ordered not to fire on civilians , even if provoked .
They are stuck -- unable to reach the protestors in Tiananmen Square and unable to withdraw from the city -- for almost three days .
The PLA Withdraws
The troops finally are able to leave , but the government views the whole episode as another humiliation and challenge to its power .
" The party leaders feared that the whole edifice of communism was going to collapse , " says journalist John Pomfret .
" They needed to make a stand , and a bloody stand , to show their population , and in effect , to cow their population , back into submission . "
A New Offensive
Over the next week , the demonstrations continue , and Beijing operates with no real police presence and with a virtually free press .
In Tiananmen Square , the atmosphere is jubilant , but at government headquarters , Deng Xiaoping is devising a new offensive to end the protest .
Armed troops will be sent in from every military district in the country .
" I think the leaders felt that they had been thwarted in the most obvious and humiliating manner , " says Orville Schell . " [ A ] nd the second time around they brought in troops from far away who did n't have connections to Beijing , whose kids were n't in the square .
And they decided they would brook no obstacle . "
The Party elders approve the decision to put down the " counterrevolutionary riot " and clear the square with military force .
Most hope it can be done without casualties .
Unaware of what was about to happen , Hou Dejian , a Chinese rock star , and three prominent intellectuals start a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square .
Demonstrators continue their sit-in and their calls for democratic reforms .
The Assault Begins The PLA clashes with Beijingers .
As word spreads that hundreds of thousands of troops are approaching from all four corners of the city , Beijingers flood the streets to block them , as they had done two weeks earlier .
People set up barricades at every major interstion .
At about 10:30 p.m. , near the Muxidi apartment buildings -- home to high - level Party officials and their families -- the citizens become aggressive as the army tries to break through their barricades .
They yell at the soldiers and some throw rocks ; someone sets a bus on fire .
The soldiers start firing on the unarmed civilians with AK - 47s loaded with battlefield ammunition .
" The first rounds of fire catch everybody by surprise , " recalls human rights observer Timothy Brook .
" The people in the streets do n't expect this to happen . "
The wounded are taken to nearby hospitals on bicycles and pull - carts , but the hospital staff are unequipped to deal with the severe wounds .
Muxidi sees the highest casualties of the night ; an untold number of people are killed .
The Massacre Continues
The last protestors leave the square .
At about 1:00 a.m. , the People 's Liberation Army finally reaches Tiananmen Square and waits for orders from the government .
The soldiers have been told not to open fire , but they have also been told that they must clear the square by 6:00 a.m. -- with no exceptions or delays .
They make a final offer of amnesty if the few thousand remaining students will leave .
About 4:00 a.m. , student leaders put the matter to a vote : Leave the square , or stay and face the consequences .
" It was clear to me that they stay votes were much , much , much stronger , " recalls eyewitness John Pomfret , who was near the students .
" But Feng Congde , who was a student leader at the time , said , ' The go 's have it . ' "
The students vacate the square under the gaze of thousands of soldiers .
Later that morning , some people -- believed to be the parents of the student protestors -- try to re-enter Tiananmen Square via Chang 'an Boulevard .
The soldiers order them to leave , and when they do n't , open fire , taking down dozens of people at a time .
According to eyewitness accounts , the citizens seem not to believe the army is firing on them with real ammunition .
" [ A ] fter a little while , like 40 minutes , people would gather up their nerve again and would crawl back to the corner and start screaming at the soldiers , and then the commander would eventually give another signal … and they 'd shoot more in the backs , " remembers journalist Jan Wong , who watched it all from her hotel room above the boulevard .
" And this went on more than half a dozen times in the day . "
When rescue workers try to approach the street to remove the wounded , they , too , are shot .
No one knows for certain how many people died over the two days .
The Chinese Red Cross initially reported 2,600 , then quickly retracted that figure under intense pressure from the government .
The official Chinese government figure is 241 dead , including soldiers , and 7,000 wounded .
A Moment That Fascinated the World An unidentified man stops the tanks .
By the morning of June 5 , the army is in complete control of Beijing .
But when all protest in the city seems silenced , the world witnessed one final act of defiance .
About midday , as a column of tanks slowly moves along Chang 'an Boulevard toward Tiananmen Square , an unarmed young man carrying shopping bags suddenly steps out in front of the tanks .
Instead of running over him , the first tank tries to go around , but the young man steps in front of it again .
They repeat this maneuver several more times before the tank stops and turns off its motor .
The young man climbs on top of the tank and speaks to the driver before jumping back down again .
Soon , the young man is whisked to the side of the road by an unidentified group of people and disappears into the crowd .
To this day , who he was and what became of him remains a mystery .
Epilogue •
In the weeks following the Tiananmen massacre , Chinese officials stick with the party line that hordes of " counterrevolutionaries " rampaged in Beijing and throughout China and the government had been justified in forcefully ending the rebellion .
Tens of thousands are arrested , many are imprisoned , and an unknown number are executed .
The government states " not one person " was killed in Tiananmen Square and only 241 people died when PLA troops and " rioters " fought in the streets .
•
In September 1989 , Beijing officials set up an exhibit at the city 's military museum to explain why they had to forcefully end the " anti- government riot . "
It features more than 4,000 exhibits : burned out tanks and armored personnel carriers , photographs of soldiers who had been burned to death or hanged from overpasses , and photos of burning buses and clashes between students and police in riot gear .
There is also a film depicting the army 's efforts to restore order .
The exhibit features some essays on democracy written by dissident Fang Lizhi , exhibited as an example of the misguided beliefs about Chinese communism that led to the demonstrations .
It was one of the most popular sections of the exhibit because Fang 's writings were banned .

Why Would He , He Could Just Walk Over Them ...
Thule Air Base
Location : Qaasuitsup , Greenland
Background : Thule Air Base sits within 800 miles of the Arctic Circle , making it the northernmost U.S. military installation .
Among the many challenges posed by the region 's climate is that the base 's port is only accessible for three months each year , so major supplies need to be shipped during the summer .
The base may be frozen and remote , but the 12th Space Warning Squadron operates an early warning system for Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles from Thule , while the 21st Space Wing is in charge of space surveillance operations .
How It 's Unique : Brad Schulz , vice president of federal architecture at HNTB , who recently worked on a dormitory replacement project at Thule , explains that construction crews essentially need to build on the most stable layer of permafrost they can get to .
With temperatures dropping below minus - 60 F , keeping troops warm is crucial .
One of the more interesting weather - specific features is that all of the utilities are above ground , because it would be too hard to quickly access them if something went awry .
" You do n't bury any waterlines , communication lines or even sanitary lines , " Schulz says .
" They 're all insulated and triple - heat - taped . "
Schulz also notes that all the buildings on the base are equipped with so - called arctic vestibules , which provide 24/7 access to shelter while ensuring the buildings remain secure .
So , last week .
Last week !
We had a Theme Post Party !
I was called a militant radical misandrist lesbian recruiter by ( some of ) the readers of The Atlantic , for disagreeing somewhat on the finer points of Ms. Caitlin Flanagan ’s Boyfriend Story !
My gentleman caller and / or a puppy arrived in my living headquarters , and it was very exciting !
Also , in Things That Happened Last Week : I ended up giving not one , but two interviews .
And filming a panel .
And at a certain point in this process , Dear Reader , I began to flip the fuck out .
It did n’t help that I read the Lynn Hirschberg profile of M.I.A. that ran in the New York Times Magazine recently .
That piece :
It got under my skin .
It disturbed me , in many visceral and icky ways .
It seemed , to me , exemplary of the ways and means by which women who use their voices politically are knocked down , knocked over , and fucked up for the public ’s entertainment .
And people liked it .
People I like , people I admire , at least one person I ’m particularly close to :
They responded , joined in the group - kick , were eager to denounce M.I.A. as a liar and a fake and a fraud and a bitch and a bad activist .
And over what ?
Over passages like this :
Unity holds no allure for Maya — she thrives on conflict , real or imagined .
“ I kind of want to be an outsider , ” she said , eating a truffle - flavored French fry .
The fact is , valuable things were uncovered in that piece .
M.I.A. has been inconsistent , and misleading , about her father ’s involvement with the Tamil Tigers .
And I appreciated that voices other than M.I.A. ’s were given the chance to speak out , in a widely read forum , about Sri Lankan politics and the Tigers ; the allegation that she ’s being overly and dangerously simplistic , in her unconditional support of the Tigers , is probably true .
What I do n’t appreciate , however , is the fact that these things were only brought up as a means of destroying M.I.A. ’s political credibility — shortly before attacking her credibility on more or less every other front .
M.I.A. is a fake , the article more or less says ; no matter what she says or writes or records about global capitalism being a bad thing , no matter how fiercely she would seem to defend marginalized people , she ’s just a shallow , narcissistic , bossy , stupid woman who only wants your attention , only wants to be famous , only wants to be a star .
And did you hear that she was having contractions when she sang “ Paper Planes ” at the Grammys ?
Shocking !
Provocative !
Fame - whorey !
Regular - whorey !
Unfeminine !
Selfish !
Bad mother !
Although her publicist had a wheelchair ready and a midwife on call , Maya , who has a deep and instinctive affinity for the provocative , knew that this Grammy moment was not to be missed .
It had everything : artistic credibility , high drama , a massive audience .
The baby would just have to wait .
The combination of being nearly naked , hugely pregnant , singing incendiary lyrics and having the eyes of the world upon her was too much to resist .
Granted , there are a few common - sense things to be pointed out here :
That it ’s not unusual for women to work throughout their pregnancies , that lots of women go to work on the day that they ’re scheduled to go into labor , that labor itself is a long process ( the profile even notes that M.I.A.’s son was n’t born until three days after the performance ) and so many women often continue to work throughout the early stages of labor , especially if they ’re doing something important or time - sensitive that ca n’t be re-scheduled — like , say , performing at the Grammys .
Or , for that matter , the fact that implying that a woman ought to neglect her job because she ’s knocked up is the flip - side of the rationale that says it ’s okay to not hire or promote women because they will have to neglect their jobs once they get knocked up .
But never mind all that : I mean , the wheelchair was right there , but instead M.I.A. was up on stage , almost naked , singing her violent lyrics about murdering people , because she cares more about performing and being famous than she does about her poor little helpless baby boy .
What a monster .
In fact , the same common - sense issues keep cropping up , as you read the article .
For example :
Is it really that surprising that a performer , signed to a major label , wants attention ?
Is it surprising or exceptional that such a person has money ?
Is it surprising that a person subjected to constant scrutiny from millions of people has crafted a public face , a version of herself that she puts on when she ’s being observed by strangers that is noticeably different and more suited to mass consumption than the one she wears when she ’s alone , or with her husband and child , or with her best friends ?
And :
If you were trying to get attention at all costs , if you were coming up with a fake personality that was guaranteed to garner acceptance and approval from the largest possible number of people , would “ radical woman of color allied with militant groups ” really be the one you ’d pick ?
Because I can think of a ton of more palatable personas .
I really can .
In fact , it seems to me that M.I.A. ’s radicalism — which is pretty much guaranteed to earn her much blowback , from many different people , at many points along the line — might be something that she does because she cares about it .
It might just , conceivably , be for real .
Because I imagine that it ’s a fuck of a lot harder to live with than many of her other options .
But not according to the profile .
The profile presents a series of choices , a standard of purity , which almost invariably excludes and diminishes the perspective of the woman it claims to be telling us about .
I always read M.I.A. ’s Grammy performance as a goddamn beautiful piece of synthesis : half - naked , hardcore , and pregnant , telling the world that she could function as a sexual person , as a political person , as a mother , and as someone who was better at her job than anyone else .
She was n’t giving up anything ; she did n’t have to ; she could be all of it , at once .
But no , she can ’t , says the article :
She had to make a choice , and she made the wrong one , the bad one , the one that makes her a bad woman .
I read M.I.A. as a person in a difficult and contradictory position : Someone who ’s come into a huge amount of privilege , after growing up without it , someone who ’s benefiting from the very system she condemns , and is attempting to use her position of power to bring attention to the problem .
But the article says there is no contradiction :
She ’s privileged , full stop , and as such is a hypocrite if she even attempts to care or speak about people who are in her former position .
As the sub - hed apparently runs : “ Is the Sri Lankan musician ’s political rap more than just radical chic ? ”
You never ask that sort of question if you want your audience to answer “ yes . ”
If it ’s okay to do this to M.I.A. , it ’s okay to do this to anyone .
And the good news is , you basically could do it to anyone .
Speaking out about politics is tricky ; as anyone with even marginal self - awareness knows , it requires you to be more or less constantly opining on morals and an ideal future world , while also being a person with moral failings ( I have them , God knows ) who has made plenty of compromises or choices about how to live in the world as it presently exists .
Hence , my flip - the - fuck - outery over being interviewed ; being regarded as an authority is a little hard to take , given how familiar I am with my own imperfections .
But lots of people on this here planet are privileged in one way or another , including people who speak out against privilege .
Lots of people are inconsistent , incapable of being hardcore moral vegans at all times ; pretty much everyone has unpleasant aspects to her personality .
If we make personal perfection a prerequisite for speaking out , the result will be silence .
It simply will be .
There will be one woman , living alone and off - the - grid in a yurt , eating nothing but pickles , interacting with no - one but the squirrels , who walks out to her favorite pooping tree every morning and delivers a brief monologue to it about social justice .
She will be the Perfect One , the Chosen One ; she will be allowed to speak .
And it wo n’t be a problem .
Largely because no - one will actually hear her .
I learned … years ago that women had always been divided against one another , self - destructive and filled with impotent rage .
I thought the Movement would change all that .
I never dreamed that I would see the day when this rage , masquerading as a pseudo - egalitarian radicalism , would be used within the Movement to strike down sisters singled out …
I am referring … to the personal attacks , both overt and insidious , to which women in the Movement who had painfully managed any degree of achievement have been subjected .
These attacks take different forms .
The most common and pervasive is character assassination : the attempt to undermine and destroy belief in the integrity of the individual under attack …
If you are [ an achiever ] you are immediately labeled a thrill - seeking opportunist , a ruthless mercenary , out to make her fame and fortune .
That ’s Anselma Dell ’ Olio , giving a speech on the state of the women ’s movement .
In 1970 .
If things have changed at all , it seems , it ’s only insofar as the lingo has penetrated the mainstream .
You ca n’t attack M.I.A. head - on .
You ca n’t say that it ’s a problem that she is being heard .
But what you can do is attack her reasons for making herself heard ; you can take her to task for being selfish , for being ambitious , for not being pure or authentic or poor or unknown or selfless enough :
Call her a thrill - seeking opportunist , a ruthless mercenary , out to make her fame and fortune .
I should be clear : I do n’t think that Hirschberg was somehow doing this on purpose , trying to silence M.I.A. or shut her down because she consciously perceived her as a political threat .
I just think it was inevitable that our cultural discomfort with someone like M.I.A. would eventually surface , in a piece that looked very much like Hirschberg ’s .
She was the one to write it — and to get her phone number Tweeted , which : BOOOO , bad pool Maya — but it had been a long time coming .
It was inevitable .
And that ’s what makes me sad .
Because no -one , in the wake of this piece , is talking about the Tamils .
No -one ’s talking about Sri Lanka .
No -one ’s talking about M.I.A. ’s most provocative belief , the one that ’s really threatening :
The idea that violent oppression can and should be met with violent resistance , which is a complicated and scary proposition , one that people have been evaluating and fighting over for a long - ass time , one that we ’re nowhere near figuring out as yet .
No -one is talking about that ; no - one , to be blunt , really cares .
What we ’re talking about , instead , is a plate of fucking fries .
The Epsilon Eridani Factor
When I was a kid , interstellar destinations were sharply defined .
It seemed obvious that you did n’t even consider Alpha Centauri , because a double - star primary system surely would n’t allow stable planetary orbits .
So you looked around for single stars .
Moreover , these should be stars a lot like the Sun , so that when Frank Drake began SETI with Project Ozma , it made all the sense in the world to focus on Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani .
Both were similar enough to our own star to suggest that they would have planets , and maybe one like ours .
For that matter , we had no idea in those distant days whether the Sun was a statistical fluke in having planets or simply a garden - variety star with a system that was all but inevitable .
These days we keep finding interesting planets , but so far ( other than perhaps in the Gliese 581 system ) we have n’t found anything enough like the Earth to consider any nearby system an obvious target for an interstellar probe .
All that may change , and swiftly , when we learn more about Alpha Centauri ’s system , and if WISE finds a close brown dwarf .
The latter two possibilities are going to be resolved within a few short years .
The Closest Probe Targets
The Project Icarus team — the interstellar probe study , not JAXA ’s IKAROS sail — has been considering potential targets for their creation , just as the Project Daedalus crew did back in the ’ 70s ( the glorious era of starship creation in the Mason ’s Arms pub — there were giants in those days ) .
Ian Crawford studies the matter in the Icarus blog , noting that a realistic maximum distance for an early probe is about 15 light years .
This assumes a fusion starship design capable of 0.15 c going after a target allowing a mission duration of no more than 100 years .
These are interesting numbers .
As Crawford ( University of London ) notes , at present we know about 56 stars in 38 different stellar systems within this range .
We have to be careful here , for not all stars within this volume of space have been discovered , and moreover , there are discrepancies , if slight , between the various catalogs of nearby stars .
Crawford leans toward the RECONS ( Research Consortium on Nearby Stars ) catalog of one hundred nearest stars .
Now we find out just how tricky the target choice is .
Let ’s assume just for argument that the hunt for Alpha Centauri planets comes up dry .
What ’s the next possibility ?
It turns out that among the 56 closest stars , we have one spectral type A , which is Sirius , and one F ( Procyon ) .
Two G - class stars are available , Centauri A and Tau Ceti .
Five K stars are possible , including Centauri B .
But the overwhelming majority of nearby stars , 41 out of the 56 , are M - class dwarfs .
We round out the list with three white dwarfs and three probable brown dwarfs , although these numbers should increase with further WISE data .
The Case for ϵ Eridani
So far we know of planets around two of the 56 nearest stars , Epsilon Eridani ( a K2 at 10.5 light years ) and the M - dwarf GJ 674 , which pushes our distance limit at 14.8 light years .
So how about Epsilon Eridani ?
Crawford writes :
The planet orbiting epsilon Eri is a giant planet , with a mass about 1.5 times that of Jupiter .
It has a highly eccentric orbit , which brings it as close to its star as 1.0 AU ( i.e. the same distance as the Earth is from the Sun ) , to as distant as 5.8 AU ( i.e. just beyond the orbit of Jupiter in our Solar System ) , with a period of 6.8 years .
Although this would span the habitable zone ( i.e. the range of distances from a star on which liquid water would be stable on a planetary surface given certain assumptions about atmospheric composition ) for the Sun , this orbit lies wholly outside the likely habitable zone for a K2 star like epsilon Eri .
From an astrobiological perspective , then , Epsilon Eridani b does n’t seem promising :
… being a gas giant , this planet itself it not a likely candidate for life , and its eccentric orbit would n’t help in this respect either ( although it is possible that the planet may have astrobiologically interesting moons , perhaps similar to Jupiter ’s moon Europa , which could in principle support sub- surface life ) .
Other planets in the Epsilon Eridani system ?
Maybe .
An unconfirmed sub -Jupiter mass planet in a distant ( 40 AU ) orbit may be there , and perhaps the system houses more Earth - like worlds .
We ’ll find out with further exoplanet investigation , and it should also be mentioned that Epsilon Eridani is circled by an interesting dust and debris disk .
So we have to keep this young star on our list , even as we hold our thinking open about Alpha Centauri , and we have to realize how many other stars may soon be shown to have planets .
Crawford again :
Clearly it would be of great interest if planets were discovered orbiting closer stars .
Currently there have been no such planets discovered , but they are very likely to exist .
Based on the detection rate to - date , and allowing for the known biases in the detection methods , it has been estimated that roughly 30 % of main - sequence stars will have planets with masses less than 30 Earth masses .
Thus , we might expect 16 or 17 of the nearest 56 stars to be accompanied by planets and , given the current lack of data on very low mass planets , it could easily be more .
Although not targeted at any of the nearest stars , statistical results from the Kepler mission ( which is looking for low - mass planets orbiting solar - type stars by the transit method … will greatly improve these estimates within the next few years .
Image :
This artist ’s diagram compares the Epsilon Eridani system to our own solar system .
The two systems are structured similarly , and both host asteroids ( brown ) , comets ( blue ) and planets ( white dots ) .
Epsilon Eridani is our closest known planetary system , located about 10 light - years away in the constellation Eridanus .
Its central star is a younger , fainter version of our sun , and is about 800 million years old — about the same age of our solar system when life first took root on Earth .
Observations from NASA ’s Spitzer Space Telescope show that the system hosts two asteroid belts , in addition to previously identified candidate planets and an outer comet ring .

Finding Out Where We ’re Going
When I first started thinking about unmanned robotic flight to a nearby star , my unexamined assumption was that any such probe would deliver the first data we had about the presence of planets in that system .
But that was twenty - five years ago , and now we ’re in the exoplanet era .
We ’re building equipment of such sophistication that we can talk about detecting exoplanets from the ground , and future space - based missions will certainly do spectroscopic analysis looking for biosignatures on interesting nearby worlds .
And all this will happen long before a true interstellar probe can be built , so we have plenty of time to work with .
Unlike Daedalus ( whose team chose Barnard ’s Star because of a mistaken detection of planets there ) , the Icarus team knows enough to keep the parameters tight and wait for more information .
Crawford ’s money is on Alpha Centauri in the end , not only because of its proximity but because it ’s not a single target but three ( assuming a sufficiently ingenious mission trajectory ) , each of a different stellar class .
As for me , I ’ll agree with Crawford most of the way , though I still hedge my bets by keeping an eye on WISE and the possibility of a brown dwarf within three light years .
The beauty of all this , as I said above , is that we ’ll have hard answers very soon .
Hubble captures bubbles and baby stars [ heic1011 ]
22 June 2010
The Large Magellanic Cloud contains many bright bubbles of glowing gas .
One of the largest and most spectacular has the name LHA 120 - N 11 , from its listing in a catalogue compiled by the American astronomer and astronaut Karl Henize in 1956 , and is informally known as N11 .
Close up , the billowing pink clouds of glowing gas make N11 resemble a puffy swirl of fairground candy floss .
From further away , its distinctive overall shape led some observers to nickname it the Bean Nebula .
The dramatic and colourful features visible in the nebula are the telltale signs of star formation .
N11 is a well - studied region that extends over 1000 light - years .
It is the second largest star - forming region within the Large Magellanic Cloud and has produced some of the most massive stars known .
It is the process of star formation that gives N11 its distinctive look .
Three successive generations of stars , each of which formed further away from the centre of the nebula than the last , have created shells of gas and dust .
These shells were blown away from the newborn stars in the turmoil of their energetic birth and early life , creating the ring shapes so prominent in this image .
Beans are not the only terrestrial shapes to be found in this spectacular high resolution image from the NASA / ESA Hubble Space Telescope .
In the upper left is the red bloom of nebula LHA 120 - N 11A .
Its rose - like petals of gas and dust are illuminated from within , thanks to the radiation from the massive hot stars at its centre .
N11A is relatively compact and dense and is the site of the most recent burst of star development in the region .
Other star clusters abound in N11 , including NGC 1761 at the bottom of the image , which is a group of massive hot young stars busily pouring intense ultraviolet radiation out into space .
Although it is much smaller than our own galaxy , the Large Magellanic Cloud is a very vigorous region of star formation .
Studying these stellar nurseries helps astronomers understand a lot more about how stars are born and their ultimate development and lifespan .
Both the Large Magellanic Cloud and its small companion , the Small Magellanic Cloud , are easily seen with the unaided eye and have always been familiar to people living in the southern hemisphere .
The credit for bringing these galaxies to the attention of Europeans is usually given to Portuguese explorer Fernando de Magellan and his crew , who viewed it on their 1519 sea voyage .
However , the Persian astronomer Abd Al - Rahman Al Sufi and the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci recorded the Large Magellanic Cloud in 964 and 1503 respectively .

MAYBE HE’S STUCK IN AN UNDISCLOSED LOCATION ….
About a month ago , the lead story at The New Republic had a provocative headline : “ Is Dick Cheney To Blame for the Oil Spill ?
Signs Point to Yes . ”
The fairly brief piece raised some important points , which still tend to go overlooked , including the fact that the Deepwater Horizon rig did not have a remote - control acoustic shutoff switch , routinely used by rigs elsewhere , because Cheney ’s secretive energy task force decided the $ 500,000 price tag was too great a burden on BP .
Major media outlets have generally been reluctant to dwell on Bush / Cheney administration failures and how they relate to the oil spill disaster , but the fact that Cheney has received at least a modicum of blame should have been enough to inspire the former V.P. to schedule a few media interviews .
Indeed , what usually happens in a case like this is predictable —
Cheney faces criticism , Cheney calls Politico and / or Fox News , Politico and / or Fox News run lengthy pieces with scathing Cheney quotes attacking the U.S. leadership , run without scrutiny or fact - checking .
But Ravi Somaiya notes that we just have n’t heard much from the former vice president lately , even after some limited public criticism .
Frank Rich , in The New York Times , pointed out that the Interior Department degenerated into a “ cesspool of corruption , ” under Bush and Cheney , and that the pair bequeathed Obama “ a Minerals Management Service as broken as the Bush - Cheney FEMA exposed by Katrina . ”
His ears ringing with the cries of “ Cheney ’s Katrina , ” a title many are striving to bestow on the gulf oil spill , one might expect the former VP to convene journalists for a speech , like he did in May last year at the right - wing American Enterprise Institute to talk about national security … .
The closest we have this time is Liz Cheney , Dick ’s daughter , arguing with Arianna Huffington on ABC’s This Week .
We wondered why .
Are the claims too substantial to refute ?
Is Cheney so incensed that he cannot trust himself to speak ?
Or , conversely , is he perhaps so sanguine about the entire issue that he does n’t feel it merits comment ?
Cheney ’s bound to pop up one of these days , attacking the nation ’s elected leaders for something or another , though his silence of late is kind of interesting .
But I ’d just add that of all the possible explanations for Cheney ’s absence from the political stage , there ’s simply no way the claims being “ too substantial to refute ” is part of the explanation .
This guy has manufactured his own twisted reality for years ; there ’s no reason to think now would be any different .
The White House on Monday strongly denied any involvement in the timing of the high - profile fraud case against Goldman Sachs , after Republicans suggested Democrats were exploiting the charges to build the case for their financial regulatory overhaul .
Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said the White House " absolutely " did not have advance notice that the Securities and Exchange Commission would announce its case on Friday .
" The SEC does n't notify the White House of its enforcement actions and certainly did n't do so in this case , " Gibbs said .
The White House was facing questions about the timing of the announcement , since it coincided with a ramping up of the public campaign for the Senate to pass the Wall Street regulation bill .
Obama 's campaign arm , Organizing for America , released a statement shortly after the SEC announcement calling for action on the Wall Street bill .
Administration officials over the weekend confirmed the president will soon launch a series of outside - the - Beltway rallies and town hall events to build support for the financial package .
Gibbs said that will begin Thursday with a trip to Wall Street , where the president will " call for swift Senate action . "
Rep. Darrell Issa , R - Calif. , ranking Republican on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , accused the administration of using " theatrics and tactics . "
" It must be nice for the Democrats that the SEC 's filing against Goldman Sachs so conveniently fits into their political agenda , " Issa said in a written statement .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said in a statement Friday that cases like the one against Goldman are " why we need to pass strong Wall Street reform this year . "
Rep. Barney Frank , D - Mass. , told CNBC on Monday that the SEC charges should build the case for the financial bill .
Sen. Chris Dodd , D - Conn. , said the finance bill " would have prevented " the kind of fraud allegedly committed by Goldman Sachs .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , in an interview with NBC's " Meet the Press , " would not discuss the particulars of the SEC case but said " reforms with teeth " are needed " to prevent these things from happening . "
Republicans also accused the administration of biting the hand that fed it , since Goldman Sachs was President Obama 's top Wall Street contributor during the 2008 campaign , with employees donating nearly $ 1 million , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
A number of top Goldman executives gave the maximum contribution to Obama 's campaign during the presidential race .
Among them were President and Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn , Chief Financial Officer David Viniar and Global Head of Compliance Alan Cohen , each of whom gave $ 2,300 .
" Just whose side is President Obama on ? "
House Republican Leader John Boehner said in a statement drawing attention to the donations and questioning the announcement from the Securities and Exchange Commission that it 's going after the banking behemoth .
The SEC is accusing Goldman Sachs of defrauding investors by failing to inform them that certain mortgage investments were devised with help from someone who was betting on their failure .
Gibbs said Monday that there was " plenty of evidence " before the SEC announcement Friday that Wall Street needs " new rules of the road . "
While some questioned the timing of the announcement , others said it 's nevertheless important for the SEC to remain vigilant in cases like this .
" We want banks to be banks , we do n't want them to be casinos .
And I 'm glad the SEC is doing their job , " Sen. Scott Brown , R - Mass. , said on CBS ' " Face the Nation " Sunday .
" And they should bring those charges because it 's wrong and we should do something about it . "
Brown , though , is one of 41 Senate Republicans opposed to the current Wall Street bill that passed out of the Senate Banking Committee .
President Barack Obama says that the Gulf of Mexico oil spill disaster “ echoes 9/11 ” in its power to change the course of American history .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ In the same way that our view of our vulnerabilities and our foreign policy was shaped profoundly by 9/11 , I think this disaster is going to shape how we think about the environment and energy for many years to come , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Obama said in an interview with Politico ’s Roger Simon .

Politico reports :
Obama Ã¢â‚¬â€ facing mounting criticism of his handling of the BP gusher , even from longtime allies Ã¢â‚¬â€ vowed to make a Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ boldÃ¢â ‚
¬
Â  push for a new energy law even as the calamity continues to unfold .
And he said he will use the rest of his presidency to try to put the United States on a course toward a Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å “ new way of doing business when it comes to energy .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â 
In his firmest declaration yet that he views the calamity as an impetus to push Congress afresh to pass a major energy and climate bill , Obama vowed to Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ move forward in a bold way in a direction that finally gives us the kind of future - oriented , Ã¢â‚ ¬
Â¦ visionary energy policy that we so vitally need and has been absent for so long .. Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ One of the biggest leadership challenges for me going forward is going to be to make sure that we draw the right lessons from this disaster , Ã¢â‚ ¬ Â  he said .
The White House announced Sunday that the president will hold a televised address to the nation on Tuesday evening to discuss the oil spill .
It is comparatively rare for presidents to use the formal setting of a prime - time televised address from the White House .
Such addresses are often reserved for moments of national crises , including wars and disasters .
Obama has yet to give an Oval Office address to the American people , though it has not been decided yet whether he will appear at the presidential desk flanked by US flags in that setting on Tuesday evening .

The Obama administration also stepped up the pressure on BP , demanding it set up an escrow account to pay individuals and businesses hit by the disaster and calling for an independent panel to oversee the claims process .
Obama ’s address and the more stringent demands of BP suggest a concerted effort to be more aggressive on the disaster as angry Americans are confronted by disturbing images of oiled birds and toxic crude spoiling fragile wetlands .
BP has failed several times to seal the flow and the first relief well that could provide a permanent solution is not predicted to be ready until the second week of August at the earliest .

A containment system is siphoning up some 15,000 barrels of oil a day to the surface via a mile - long pipe but flow estimates indicate the same amount of crude could still being leaking into the Gulf and feeding the giant spill .
The US Coast Guard has given BP until Sunday to fine - tune plans to increase the capacity of its “ top hat ” oil capture system amid fears of a time lapse while oil processing vessels are rotated .

Businesses in the Gulf region , ranging from fishing to tourism , are suffering .
Some workers are finding temporary employment with BP to help in the clean - up effort , but longer - term prospects are bleak .
— With AFP
Somehow , the word “ spill ” does n’t quite capture the tragedy that is unfolding in the Gulf of Mexico .
As the father of two young children , I have experience with spills .
They seem to happen every time my wife and I give our son a glass of milk .
What I saw flying over the gulf waters Wednesday , and what we ’ve all been watching on television the last two weeks , is no spill .
It ’s an endless explosion of toxic muck , a sickening creep of poisonous sludge that may soon blanket a national park , more than a dozen wildlife refuges and hundreds of miles of coastline , perhaps even oozing into the fragile Florida Keys and up the Eastern Seaboard .
This catastrophe may also prove to be one of those rare events that rivets attention , bolsters resolve and encourages pivotal change — in this case , a national commitment to stop the expansion of offshore drilling immediately and end our dependence on oil and the other dirty fuels that are fouling our planet in a slow - motion environmental disaster every day .
In western Canada , monstrous earthmoving machines rip up forests and pollute freshwater supplies to produce dirty oil from Alberta ’s “ tar sands . ”
In Ecuador , billions — with a “ b ” — of gallons of oil - contaminated waste were dumped into the Amazon watershed by Texaco , now owned by Chevron .
And here in the U.S. , 90 million Americans live near 150 - plus oil refineries .
These refineries release into the air and water millions of pounds of cancer - causing chemicals , such as benzene , butadiene and formaldehyde , along with nickel , lead and other pollutants linked to heart disease , asthma and other health threats .

Even before this spill , the gulf ’s wetlands and habitat were under siege from oil operations .
Offshore pipelines crossing coastal wetlands are estimated to have destroyed more salt marsh in the region than can be found in the entire coastline from New Jersey to Maine .
Even more significant , our use of oil and other dirty fuels , including coal , continues to pollute the atmosphere with carbon dioxide , accelerating climate disruption and its potential legacy of ongoing environmental disaster for generations .
I ’m 38 years old , and U.S. corporate and political leaders have been talking about ending our dependence on oil for most of my life .
Progress has come in fits and starts .
The Arab embargo and the twin oil crises of the 1970s helped our country almost eliminate the use of oil to produce electricity .
More recently , the Obama administration has given the nation clean - car rules that will increase vehicle efficiency , save consumers money and conserve more than a million barrels of oil every day by 2020 .
The gulf tragedy is an urgent alarm , alerting us that we can no longer accept the plodding pace of our transition to a clean - energy future .
Luckily , the time is ripe for transformational change .
When the Exxon Valdez went aground in 1989 , ruining vast expanses of pristine Alaskan coast , there was n’t much alternative to powering our nation with the fuel that ship carried .
Now there is .

High - performance hybrid vehicles are already serving as a bridge to the largely electrified transportation system of the future .
In a decade , a majority of all new vehicles should be powered by plug - in hybrid and fully electric engines .
Making deeper investments in mass transit , electrifying our railroads and converting heavy - duty trucks to natural gas will help produce an even more dramatic decline in our oil use .
And in late April , the Obama administration approved our country ’s first offshore wind farm — an important milestone .
Clean - energy companies are putting people in good - paying jobs that will create a more prosperous future .
Flying over the gulf , I found myself unable to speak as we stared out at marinas filled with oyster boats that should have been out working and masses of nets sitting idle as a filthy spew spread over waters swarming with stingrays , dolphins and sharks , as well as the shrimp , oysters and fish that make this the richest seafood habitat in the Lower 48 .
It ’s almost more painful to think about what ’s happening 5,000 feet down , where a “ gusher ” has been spouting 200,000 gallons of sticky ooze a day .
In the coming days , let ’s make sure our leaders demand that BP , which just announced first - quarter profits of nearly $ 6.1 billion pay for every last nickel it takes to clean up this mess and compensate those gulf residents who will be devastated by it .
The Obama administration and Congress must also declare a national moratorium on expanded oil drilling .
They must seize this moment to announce that the U.S. will end its dependence on petroleum as a fuel quickly — say within 20 years .
Then they must at long last take a serious stand against climate change by moving our economy away from all dirty fuels at a significantly accelerated pace .

No one can predict how devastating this disaster will be , how much it will cost or how long it will take to recover .
We can , however , make sure that it does n’t happen again by uniting in a common purpose to create the clean - energy future that we need .
Let ’s not pass this challenge to yet another generation .
Because 20 years from now , the only mess I want to be cleaning up is the spilled milk of my grandkids .

Every Christmas
Eve ( and not a day sooner ) , I attempt to wrap gifts for my friends and family .
It usually concludes as follows : This is , of course , shockingly bad .
Part of it is because selective laziness knows no limit .
Part of it is because I wrap gifts precisely once a year , have never really tried to improve on the art of gift - wrapping , and generally have craft skills that rival a five year - old .
I am OK with this , though my friends and family have sort of made it a running joke to mock whatever I wrap and preemptively point it out under the Christmas tree .
I think the first part of that is the important one .
It 's not something I do often , so I never have a chance at improving .
Hockey writing 's been different .
I 've written here every day for the past five years or so .
In the last couple of years , I 've sort of shifted that writing -- mostly the stats stuff -- towards larger platforms .
I look back on some of the stuff that I wrote in 2009 and 2010 and wonder how I was able to even dress myself in the morning .
I look at some of the stuff I 've produced in the last two years , and I think it 's pretty good .
( I have no doubt in my mind that , four years from today , I 'll look back at 2014 writing with horror . )
My writing here has been a daily gift - wrapping process ( tape everywhere ; that 's always the answer ! ) .
We 've come up with some fantastic ideas and flushed out some terrible ones .
We 've had some fascinating discussions spanning months , and we 've had some awful discussions that really want you to bring out the old SCALR error message that used to pervade this site in years past .
It 's kind of nuts to think about it , but the number of posts actually filed here has to be well into the thousands .
And the word counts -- I do n't even want to think about it .
Before putting a bow on the final gift here , I did want to thank the many of you who have read my posts daily .
And a special thanks to those who interacted in the applicable comments sections , or circulated the content when I produced it .
You guys kept the hamster on the wheel .
But it 's not goodbye !
It 's see you later :) .
The activists aboard the Gaza flotilla that was raided by Israeli security forces Monday may have believed that breaking the Gaza blockade was at its core forcing Israel to address an issue the activists see as moral blindness .
Yet the situation is far more complex than they would like people to believe .
The story of the flotilla crisis begins from the time Israel withdrew from Gaza in August 2005 .
Israelis were told that if they stopped occupying foreign land , they would be more secure .
Between their withdrawal and the Gaza war of December 2008 , however , Israeli citizens absorbed 3,335 rockets aimed at their homes .
Their border towns became uninhabitable , as mothers had 45 seconds to hear a siren , gather their kids , and pray they would make it to a shelter .
Some of the rockets were Iranian - made Grad rockets and others were Fajr - 3s that had a 27 - mile range .
The range of the rockets grew with each passing month after Israeli forces left .
Moreover , since Israel withdrew from Gaza , it no longer controlled the Egyptian - Gazan border , where all of the rocket smuggling was taking place .
There was never a single UN Security Council session to discuss those attacks .
That 's why Israel insisted on a naval blockade of the Gaza Strip :
It was the only way to curb the Palestinian rocket attacks on its people .
While critics like to say that Israel retains forms of air and sea control , it ceded the area that counted in the withdrawal and exposed its citizens to rocket attacks .
The lessons from that pullout will make a potential withdrawal from the West Bank much harder .
There will be those who say , " If you did n't like the book , why would you see the movie ? "
Now , in the wake of the confrontation between the flotilla and Israeli forces , the international community is calling on Israel to lift the blockade .
Could Hamas , the radical militant organization that effectively rules Gaza , be trusted to adhere to a lifting of the blockade ?
While much has been made of the fact that Israel does not talk to Hamas ( both Jerusalem and Washington deem it a terrorist organization ) , it is also true that Hamas has no interest in talking to Israel .
Hamas does not recognize Israel at any size -- even the area of a telephone booth on a Tel Aviv beach .
Just last week in Damascus , Syria , PBS talk show host Charlie Rose kept asking Hamas leader Khaled Meshal if he would accept Israel if it withdrew to the pre-1967 borders ; Mr. Meshal refused to answer .
He indicated that Israel should agree to the right of millions of Palestinians to relocate in Israel and not just a new Palestinian state , and then this should be put forward to a referendum of all of the world 's Palestinians ( not just the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza ) , and then who knows .
Not much hope there .
So who would ensure that a lifted blockade from Gaza would not permit more rockets to come into Gaza ?
No countries have volunteered to be peace enforcers on Gaza 's borders .
The European Union agreed to monitor a crossing point in Rafah , which is easier than enforcement as it requires no robust military presence but only computers -- proverbial pencils -- to issue reports .
Yet , even this is a pale challenge to the 12 - kilometer southern border with Egypt , where smuggling has occurred .
Yet , even at the Rafah crossing alone , the EU monitors repeatedly fled the scene when the going got rough during the past few years .
Complicating the situation further is the fact that reporting does not suggest that Gaza is on the verge of catastrophe .
This is what the Financial Times 's Tobias Buck wrote from Rafah just last week , alluding to the tunnel smuggling : " [ T ] he prices of many smuggled goods have fallen in recent months , thanks to a supply glut that is on striking displays across the [ Gaza ] Strip . "
The tunnel smuggling , Mr. Buck writes , has " become so efficient that shops all over Gaza are bursting with goods .
Branded products such as Coca - cola , Nescafe , Snickers and Heinz ketchup -- long absent as a result of the Israeli blockade -- are both cheap and widely available . "
This suggests that the blockade has certainly not led to Gaza being on the brink of starvation .
The unspoken argument for the blockade is that it has been effective .
In the past two years , Hamas leadership continually trails the popularity of the Palestinian Authority and Fatah in the West Bank as people understand that Hamas has not been able to declare business as usual .
Moreover , Israel has a silent partner in supporting the blockade : Egypt .
Though Egypt announced a lifting of the blockade today , past gestures by the Mubarak government suggest this move will be equally short - lived .
Cairo was willing to withstand protests at its embassies in the Arab world during the 2008 - 09 Gaza war , but still refused to open up its Rafah border crossing to Hamas .
While there is probably an argument to be made that the terms of the blockade should be adjusted at least somewhat to minimize social pain and cope with the reality of the tunnels , this should not be confused with normalizing the role of Hamas itself .
The Obama administration has reiterated criteria that the United States , United Nations , EU , and Russia established as a prerequisite for Hamas to play a constructive role : disavow violence , accept Israel , and adhere to previous agreements .
President Obama had made clear that the onus is on Hamas to change its ways before it becomes a legitimate peace partner .
It has accepted the logic that an unreconstructed Hamas will spoil peace talks more from the inside rather than the outside , as Obama pursues a policy of seeking success in George Mitchell 's West Bank proximity talks .
There is a reason for this view .
Hamas has made clear that its condition for joining a united Palestinian government is abandoning peace talks with Israel and agreeing at best to some form of a cease - fire in return for many concessions that they know Israel cannot accept .
Like the Gaza flotilla , solving the issue of Gaza and Hamas does not look like smooth sailing .

International Day of Slayer - June 6 , 2010
Back in 2006 , the " National Day of Slayer " launched as an alternative to the " National Day of Prayer . "
Holidays commemorate events of great importance or things that bring us great joy .
Slayer qualifies as both , and as an excellent spokesperson for the heavy metal movement worldwide .
It 's unclear how many metalheads exist on earth , but a tentative number of 100 million seems likely .
And when we see metalheads listing heavy metal as their religion on the census , it 's clear that an international holiday for metal is not a far - fetched idea .
This year on June 6 , as every year on June 6 , help advance the cause by publicly demonstrating that you are a metalhead who appreciates the subtle genius of Slayer :
How to Celebrate
Listen to Slayer at full blast in your car .
Listen to Slayer at full blast in your home .
Listen to Slayer at full blast at your place of employment .
Listen to Slayer at full blast in any public place you prefer .
DO NOT use headphones !
The objective of this day is for everyone within earshot to understand that it is the National Day of Slayer .
National holidays in America are n't just about celebrating ; they 're about forcing it upon non-participants .
Taking that participation to a problematic level
Stage a " Slay - out . "
Do n't go to work .
Listen to Slayer .
Have a huge block party that clogs up a street in your neighborhood .
Blast Slayer albums all evening .
Get police cruisers and helicopters on the scene .
Finish with a full - scale riot .
Spray paint Slayer logos on churches , synagogues , or cemeteries .
Play Slayer covers with your own band ( since 99 % of your riffs are stolen from Slayer anyway ) .
Kill the neighbor 's dog and blame it on Slayer .
If you 'd like to help us prepare for the big event , go to the following social networking sites and stir up some noise !
For media contact and interviews , see here .

Grade schoolers given anti-medical pot propaganda
A controversial anti-medical marijuana flyer forced upon elementary school students in Billings , Montana , is causing an uproar .
About 300 Newman Elementary School students went home with the propagandistic flyer Tuesday afternoon .
The flyer asks people to " take action " against the medical marijuana business , reports KAJ18 .
With the headline " Medical Marijuana Crisis , " the bright - yellow flyers call marijuana a " gateway drug " and urge parents to " take back control " by contacting local officials , attending public meetings or volunteering time , reports the Billings Gazette .
" Our community and our children are at risk , " the flyers read in capital letters .
The inaccurate and often alarmist information on the flyers is not credited to any source , and an email address listed at the bottom does not work .
This comes in the wake of the " This comes in the wake of the " Not in our town " firebombing a few weeks ago .

Aquaria has gone open source under the GPL !
Now all four of the games that pledged to open in the Humble Indie Bundle are officially open source -- the others are Lugaru , Gish , and Penumbra Overture .
I am especially excited about the modding possibilities for Aquaria because of its excellent level editing tools .
Here 's a video showing an early version of the editor :
I show off their editor more in the beginning of the I show off their editor more in the beginning of the Aquaria Design Tour
This kind of freeform layer - based manipulation is the basis for most modern 2D games , so it 's important to have good tools .
Having access to a user - friendly editor like this could be a big head start both for Aquaria modifications and for separate total conversion projects .
I would like to thank the developers of Aquaria , Gish , and Penumbra for releasing the source code to their awesome games , as well as Ryan Gordon for handling all of the logistics and details to make it actually happen .
There have already been a lot of work done on the games , and we are going to be highlighting some of the coolest patches from the early contributors over the next few weeks -- and hopefully more as they come !
Details from Ryan Gordon
Aquaria is now open source , rounding out the Humble Indie Bundle !
If you want to explore this codebase , here 's what you need to know :
Getting the source :
You can grab the source from the Mercurial repository here :
http://hg.icculus.org/icculus/aquaria/
Everything you need to know about Mercurial can be learned from Joel Spolsky 's tutorial at http://hginit.com/
... it 's a fast read , and funny , too .
While many Mercurial and git clones will likely pop up , this repository will be updated with good patches , changes , fixes , and improvements from the community .
Getting the game data :
The game data is not shipping with the source code .
Please buy a copy of the game ( your copy from the Humble Indie Bundle will work just fine ) .
The code :
... this is almost the exact code that shipped for the Mac OS X version in the Humble Indie Bundle , with the ( disabled anyhow ) Steamworks and DRM code stripped out .
The Linux version was built from a slightly older version of this code , but this code still builds on Linux .
This has n't been tested on Windows , and Ryan likely broke it in ( hopefully ) small ways .
There 's little doubt that any issues will be corrected within a few hours , though .
Mailing list :
There 's a mailing list that can be used for discussion of the Aquaria source code .

Things worth doing right away :
Diesel Power was a revolution that still inspires new innovations even today .
Bridging the gap for Industry and Transportation as they seek out a sustainable Future .
Check the Green History of Diesel !
Upon operating his first successful engine design back in 1897 Rudolph Diesel changed the world in ways that most people still do n’t fully appreciate today .
Especially now , as we begin the long process of moving out of the petroleum - powered era , we should pause to take lessons from visionaries like Tesla and Diesel , and consider how they harnessed natural forces and physical phenomena to revolutionize existing technologies , and enabled enormous leaps into the Future by allowing others to build upon the solid foundations that they laid .
The venerable diesel engine was an innovation of the internal combustion engine that continues to be improved upon even today , with the new methods and materials that are offered by modern science .
Many of us associate diesel power with loud smelly trucks and buses , so it might come as a great surprise that Diesel technology is actually still being improved upon after all this time .
In fact , in just the past few years we ’re seeing a level of improvement to efficiency and emissions that are actually positioning diesel as a sustainable interim solution for our transportation needs …
While other options continue to be researched for that quantum leap in technology that will slingshot both Industry and Society towards the next century .
So If you ’re ready to see how diesel power still holds a few tricks up it ’s sleeve , then let ’s start exploring , by looking at railway locomotives as our prime motivator !
BTW : If you ’re curious about Rudolf Diesel ’s sense of environmental and social responsibility , as it was well over a century ago … Just pop-open another window by clicking HERE for further insights .
But hey …
Why not just use electric locomotives !?!
Like electric cars , electric locomotives do n’t actually eliminate emissions , they simply displace them from the vehicle , to a larger power plant via the electrical grid …
A grid which is itself in great need upgrading itself , to avoid it ’s own growing inefficiencies and wasteful shortcomings .
Electric generation capacity is already severely challenged by current consumption levels , and with the only available means to add large and dependable capacity to the system currently being limited to nuclear or fossil - fuel powered plants , the enormous increases in production required for electric trains and cars would just lead to even more coal fired plants being put online in North America .
In the absence of an alternative baseload capacity ( since solar and wind are n’t up for that big job at present ) , we would need to find other efficiencies in the today ’s existing methods …
As we await the laying of plans to realize a truly sustainable and electrically powered future for automotive and rail transport .
Luckily for our environment in general , and rail transport in particular , the predominant and pervasive technologies that provide us with Diesel power are still finding impressive new efficiencies – even over a century after they were first designed !
Keep in mind that Diesel engines were not only an astounding leap in technology when they were first invented , but have also continued to evolve and develop ever since .
The historical strengths of Diesel Power
From the outset , and to this very day , Diesel engines offer the highest thermal fuel efficiencies of any internal combustion engines ( 20 - 40 % less fuel consumption ) , thus they produce less Carbon Dioxide ( CO2 ) for the same work done by a petrol / gas powered engine .
Due to their much higher compression design , and longer bore cycles they also run cooler ( both engine and exhaust ) , and produce very minimal carbon monoxide , thus the reason why they ’re used underground in mines .
Diesels are not only built more solidly to run and last longer ( again due to inherent design requirements ) , they also do n’t require rare or heavy metals for electrical / electronic controls and components , nor spark systems for combustion , thus they ’re also highly reliable in wet conditions , and place no excessive burdens upon new resource development and mining for rare earths and metals .
Diesel engines can also run on any number of alternative fuel formulations without any modifications to the basic engine design .
In short diesel engines remain the most rugged , reliable , adaptable , and thus sustainable source of petrol - powered mechanical energy currently available today , but that ’s only the start of it ’s future potential .
The Little Engine that Could
Historically , there ’s always been trade - off between ‘ performance ’ and ‘ fuel efficiency ’ , where higher particulates ( or “ soot ” ) resulted from higher diesel performance levels , as a result of excess fuel present in the compression cycle , not being allowed to burn completely .
Fortunately , advanced new technologies such as electronic controls , common rail fuel injection , variable injection timing , improved combustion chamber configuration and turbocharging have all made diesel engines much cleaner , quieter and much more powerful than ever before .
Just as the removal of lead from gasoline allowed for catalytic converters to become possible in the 70’s , the removal of sulfur from diesel fuels ( see below ) allowed for many new advances in diesel exhaust controls as well .
For example , particulate filters that not only capture these partially combusted particles , but actually feed them back into the fuel cycle are now possible , and reduce particulate emissions by 80 - 90 % .
In fact , you ’ll really only ever see a diesel engine running wasteful ( and polluting ) levels on occasions like competitive tractor pulls ( where “ efficiency is a non-factor ) , or on a MUCH smaller scale , if someone were to operate a poorly maintained truck , or drive it away at full throttle before letting the engine warm up properly .
Future Forms of Fuel
On the subject of emissions , the sulfur - oxides that have plagued the emissions of diesel designs for decades have now been addressed through new standards for Ultra - low sulfur diesel ( ULSD ) , which as of 2006 is the standard for all petroleum - based diesel sold in Europe and North - America … With more world - wide regulation on the way hopefully .
These newer fuel formulations have also enabled the much higher emissions control standards that went into effect for vehicles in the USA in 2007 .
Most people do n’t realize it , but Rudolf Diesel envisioned a world where his engines could be used by Farmers and Craftsmen who could grow their own fuel - stock locally .
His first successful test ran on peanut - oil , and he was a proponent of plant based fuels from the very start .
Today , we ’re seeing a “ back - to the future ” scenario being played out with new bio - diesel fuel sources being derived from specialized plant crops which effectively lower the net CO2 emissions of diesel engines even further by absorbing existing CO2 from the environment initially and re-emitting this during combustion , rather than simply releasing more “ new ” ( or ancient ) CO2 from petroleum - based fuel sources underground .
Although there are significant doubts about the sustainability of crop based bio-fuels ( due to the displacement of food crops ) , we ’re seeing some exciting new developments in modified algae - based fuel production as well , which promise to have a very positive effect on water based CO2 levels , and therefore overall PH of oceans as a positive side - effect .
Well Regulated Results
Meanwhile , in Canada the concentrations of sulfur from diesel fueled engines have been regulated down from 500 PPM to 15 PPM starting in 2010 models , and since the timing and levels of these reductions have been aligned with those set forth by the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , we see every indication that further EPA mandated reductions for marine and rail transport will also be applied by Canadian regulators as well .
As far as mass transport and travel goes , we ’ve yet to see any steady indications of new emissions regulations for the airline industry , but we can at least look to our railways to lead the charge to a much more environmentally responsible and sustainable modes of transport with the Tier 2 standards that have reduced Nitrous - Oxide emissions by %60 , and particulate matter by %50 .
What ’s more is that we do n’t have to wait for this to happen , as we are already seeing a whole new generation of locomotives on the rails today that are operational proof that Diesel Power still has a great deal to offer modern society …
Look at the impressive cycle of improvements for Diesel Locomotion !
To conclude … Rudolf Diesel was n’t just a brilliant mechanical engineer , he was deeply fascinated by efficiencies in thermo-dynamics in order to free human ingenuity and independent craftsmanship from the mass production of industrialized Society !
LEARN MORE about why the social ideals held by Rudolf Diesel were actually a serious threat to multinational Coal and Oil interests , the Big Banks , and even European governments

When thinking of the cost of retirement , it is natural for one to think of the cost in financial terms .
But what is the cost in non-financial terms ?
The image at left is from a Kiplinger article , The Cost of Retirement ( via The Big Picture ) and represents a typical example of the conventional thought that has misguided people for decades .
The image ( click to enlarge ) is intended to illustrate the recently reduced savings rates of Americans , resulting from The Great Recession , and highlights what Kiplinger refers to as " Dreams Postponed . "
This implies that " dreams " can only be realized after a lofty monetary goal has been reached .
Is this implicit message accurate ?
Is there any doubt that conventional thought about retirement and financial freedom revolves around the fact that these objectives can only be achieved by monetary means ?
Why is it that a shortfall of money translates into " dreams postponed ? "
That money does not provide meaning ;
The nothingness of not working hastens death ( of both the spiritual and physical self ) ;
And finding work that makes good use of an individual 's skills is self - fulfilling , which is actually true freedom , and could have been obtained long before the conventional " retirement " is realized .
In other words , it is more " troubling " if people continue to believe , as Kiplinger would have it , that life must be used as a tool for a money plan , than to realize , rather , that money must be made a tool for a life plan .
People are searching for meaning and purpose and they find it in some form of fulfilling work .
The day is not for surviving -- it is for living !
" What is important in life is life , and not the result of life . " ~ Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe
The Kiplinger article also states how " troubling " it is that 41 % of women and 32 % of men have to work in retirement " just to make ends meet . "
This idea entrenches itself in the conventional thought that work in retirement is for the sole function of producing money .
This statement is a complete contradiction to truth , which is not usually discovered until retirement has been reached , if it is ever reached :
In The New Retire - Mentality : Planning Your Life and Living Your Dreams . . . at Any Age You Want , author Mitch Anthony cites evidence that an over - whelming majority of retirees view work as a source of vitality , energy and fulfillment .
Lowest on the list of reasons to continue working in retirement is money and health insurance .
If so many people who are actually in retirement have discovered that a happy retirement consists of working in a job that is self - fulfilling , should n't retirement planning therefore consist primarily of career planning or , even better , of life planning ?
What if the conventional retirement savings , in the form of putting money aside and investing it for later , was only a portion of the retirement plan ?
If meaning and purpose is what people are truly seeking , would n't it be more prudent to spend greater time and energy on discovering and finding a meaningful career ( and starting the search earlier in life ) than on conventional retirement savings strategies ?
If this search for meaning and purpose stared sooner in life , at the same time that people begin learning about 401 ( k ) 's and IRA 's , why could n't someone find themselves " retired " at age 40 or even 30 , if money is only a small part of the retirement equation ?
What if you were so happy with your work that you did n't want to stop working ?
The fear of being forced to work , as Kiplinger states , " just to make ends meet , " would be replaced by the fear of not being able to work anymore .
" Money often costs too much . " ~ Ralph Waldo Emerson
The real tragedy of conventional retirement planning is not that , as a result of a financial shortfall , people will be forced to work , but that millions of people continue to believe that fulfillment and freedom can only be procured by financial means .
This is simply not true .
The cost of retirement is not just financial -- there is an opportunity cost that goes far beyond money -- the non-financial cost of sacrificing life now for an illusory life later .
Is your life a tool for money or is your money a tool for life ?
It is time to start searching for meaning -- not for money .

The Five Minute Retirement Plan
By Bethany Bell
BBC News , Madrid
It is hoped the deal to rescue Greece 's embattled economy will prevent other eurozone countries , with large deficits , from facing similar crises .
But there are fears that countries like Spain and Portugal could be dragged into the financial turmoil .
Thousands of protesters took to the streets of Madrid on Labour Day On May Day in Madrid , several thousand people marched through the centre of the city to mark Labour Day .
Figures from the first quarter of 2010 showed that Spain has 20.05 % unemployment - the highest in the eurozone .
With the country still in recession , jobs are a key worry for these marchers .
Martin , who works for an airline , said he was worried about losing his job " like many people in this country " .
He said the government should be providing help .
" I think we are mature enough that we understand the depth of the problem - to understand that we are getting into deep trouble and that we may have to take steps that not everybody will like but may be necessary .
" I do n't think the government is doing the right job right now , " he said .
Carla says she has gone back to study because it was hard to find a job .
" I would like to be working right now , " she said .
" Even before I finished my studies , I was working as a social worker .
I studied social work .
" But it is impossible right now , because I think the government is forgetting those people who are not profitable for the economy . "
She said she was lucky because her parents help to support her .
" But what about those people who do n't have that support ?
It is the government that must do that , " she said .
Economic stagnation Spain 's jobless rate has doubled since 2008 - a dramatic development for a country that was one of Europe 's biggest job creators .
And unemployment complicates the government 's struggle to reduce the deficit in its finances .
I am afraid that we may see a long period of economic stagnation in Spain , which will provoke a rather difficult social situation
Prof Fernandez
IE Business School Fernando Fernandez Mendez de Andes , a professor of economics at the IE Business School , says Spain 's problems are not nearly as bad as those in Greece .
" That is a very different situation - there is no doubt about the quality of the Spanish fiscal statistics , for instance .
However that does n't mean that Spain has n't been affected by the Greece developments , " he said .
" Certainly Spain has a debt problem and certainly Spain now is under scrutiny by financial markets over its ability to compete within the euro . "
But Prof Fernandez says Spain has to " restore its credibility " and " convince the markets that it can grow at a decent rate " .
For that to happen , Prof Fernandez says , " significant things have to change in Spanish economic policy " .
Nearly half of under 25s are unemployed in Spain
He says : " I am concerned , that I see little movement and speed in this direction , so I am afraid that we may see a long period of economic stagnation in Spain , which will provoke a rather difficult social situation . "
And financial markets are worried .
Last week , a major credit rating agency downgraded Spain 's status , because of the country 's weak growth prospects .
But Spain 's Socialist government says it wo n't need to ask for help like Greece .
It has announced a 50bn euro ( £ 43 bn ; $ 65 bn ) austerity package to bring down its deficit .
Spain 's Secretary of State for the Economy Jose Manuel Campa told Spanish radio that the country has " an institutional context which also gives us the strength to tackle the crisis with great calm " .
" Spain has great strengths in the economy : we have an economy in which of course , in terms of wealth , we are richer than ever , " he said .
Call for action
But there is concern in Spain 's business community .
Trade at Miguel Angel Galan 's sports shop in Madrid has slowed over the past few months .
He says the government 's austerity package wo n't be enough to pull the country through .
" The government has taken measures and policies that wo n't create jobs or reduce unemployment , " he said .
He said the government should n't be raising taxes , but trying to lower them to give more money to families .
Mr Galan also said labour reform was important .
It should be cheaper , he said , to fire workers .
On May Day , a few protesters began chanting for a general strike , but they were in the minority .
So far the trade unions have gone along with the government austerity plans , and there has been little social unrest .
More people seemed to be interested in hanging out in Madrid 's tapas bars than joining the marchers .
But if the cuts get more painful , the calls for action could become louder .

A Las Vegas man who held a temporary job at Walmart says he was stripped of all his responsibilities and made to wear a yellow vest after telling his manager that he ’s gay .
Fernando Gallardo has filed a complaint with the Nevada Equal Rights Commission claiming that his boss at a Vegas - area Walmart confronted him about his sexuality , and then began treating him rudely and alienated him from co-workers after learning Gallardo was gay , reports The Advocate .

“ I was completely ignored and shunned , ” he wrote in a complaint to the rights commission .
“ I had nothing to do all day but wander around the store wearing a yellow vest no one else had to wear , much like Jews had to wear a yellow star of David in Hitler ’s Germany . ”
The Advocate reports that within two months of Gallardo ’s forced admission , “ his supervisor and two other managers stopped talking to him completely . ”
Gallardo , who no longer works at the Walmart location , also claims the store management attempted to “ bribe ” some of the other temporary workers at the location with permanent jobs in exchange for claiming that Gallardo had offered up the information about his sexual orientation voluntarily .
A Walmart spokesman , Phil Keene , said that Gallardo ’s yellow uniform may have been nothing unusual .
“ It is my understanding that the former associate was a temporary hire while the store is under remodeling , ” Keene told The Advocate .
“ Between the 50 or so temporary associates in that store , there is a rotation through the position of ‘ May I Help You ’ associate .
The several associates in this role wear a vest so customers can identify them and ask for help in finding products that may have been temporarily moved to a new spot . ”

However , Gallardo claims he was the only one made to wear the vest , and that he was only told to wear it after his sexual orientation became known to his superiors .
While Walmart has an official policy against discrimination , the world ’s largest retailer has recently been embroiled in a massive lawsuit accusing it of gender bias .
A federal court recently allowed a class - action suit to go forward against the company .
Lawyers for the plaintiffs say Walmart systematically paid its female employees less than their male counterparts , and put fewer women up for promotion .

It ’s estimated that anywhere from 500,000 to 1.6 million women could potentially be plaintiffs in the suit .
If successful , the lawsuit could force Walmart to pay billions in compensation .

BP shares plummet around the world
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Shares of BP tumbled in U.S. and overseas stock markets Tuesday after its latest attempt to stop the Gulf of Mexico oil leak failed .
BP's ( BP ) stock sank 15 % in U.S. trading , down $ 6.40 to $ 36.55 .
It also fell 14 % on the London Stock Exchange .
The British oil giant 's stock has plummeted nearly 40 % since the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded on April 20 , losing $ 74.9 billion of shareholder value .
BP 's market capitalization fell by $ 20 billion on Tuesday alone .
The company on Saturday announced the failure of its " top kill " solution , an effort to use mud to slow down the flow of oil into the Gulf .
Similarly , BP 's " junk shot " solution did not work , after attempts to slow the leak with garbage failed .
Shares fell farther at the end of the day , after Attorney General Eric Holder announced that he has launched a criminal investigation into the Gulf of Mexico oil spill .
Meanwhile , oil continues to spill into the Gulf at a pace of about 19,000 barrels a day , according to government estimates .
The oil spill is now officially the worst in U.S. history , surpassing the Exxon Valdez spill off the coast of Alaska in 1989 .
BP is currently working on a new solution , in which robots will saw off the " lower marine riser package " on the gushing oil well , preparing for the placement of a custom - made cap on the package .
But even if that cap works , it would not completely stop the leak .
A long - term solution to the oil leak -- the drilling of a relief well -- will not be completed until August .
The company said Friday its spill - related costs have totaled $ 930 million to date , but that figure could soar higher , even if the leak is soon contained .
Hurricane season officially started Tuesday , and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecasted an unusually severe storm season .
Meteorologists worry that strong hurricanes could hinder the oil - containment efforts or blow oil into coastal areas , causing catastrophic damage to Gulf economies .
BP also has to pay for the wildlife killed by the spill , and could be subject to lawsuits .
The Obama administration has pledged that BP will be responsible for all cleanup costs .
Analysts have thrown out a wide range of estimates -- from $ 4 billion to $ 25 billion -- on how hard the incident will hurt the company 's bottom line .
Exxon ( XOM , Fortune 500 ) paid $ 3.4 billion in cleanup costs , but ultimately only paid $ 507.5 million for the legal settlement , in addition to $ 500 million in interest payments .
An earthquake rocked Southern California on Monday night , shaking the Los Angeles area and forcing a brief pause in the Toronto Blue Jays ' baseball game against the Padres in San Diego .
The 5.7 - magnitude quake was centred eight kilometres southeast of Ocotillo near the U.S. - Mexico border .
It struck at about 9:30 p.m. PT , the U.S. Geological Survey said .
The quake was initially reported as a 5.9 temblor .
It was felt as a gentle rolling motion in Los Angeles , Long Beach and Orange County .
San Diego's Petco Park swayed during the earthquake , and the public address announcer asked that everyone remain calm .
The crowd cheered .
David Eckstein of the Padres had just grounded out in the bottom of the eighth inning when the stadium began shaking .
The next batter , Chase Headley , stayed out of the batter 's box for a few seconds , then stepped in .
San Diego Sheriff 's dispatch supervisor Becky Strahm said some of her colleagues reported things falling off their shelves , but there were no immediate reports of significant damage or injury .
The quake follows a series of temblors that struck Southern California over the weekend , including a pair of moderate earthquakes that rattled a desert area east of San Diego .
Residents in downtown San Diego said they felt the ground rumbling during at least one of the Saturday quakes .
There are no immediate reports of damage or injuries from Monday night 's earthquake .
Victims of the Tal Afar attack were moved to several nearby hospitals A suicide bombing at a football stadium in northern Iraq has killed 10 people and injured 120 others , police say .
An attacker detonated explosives hidden inside a vehicle at the entrance to the stadium in Tal Afar , a mainly Shia Turkmen town west of Mosul .
Witnesses said the blast was followed by at least one other .
Some said up to three suicide bombers were involved .
Earlier , the militant umbrella group , the Islamic State of Iraq , warned Shias of " dark days soaked with blood " .
" What is happening to you nowadays is just a drizzle , " said Al - Nasser Lideen Allah Abu Suleiman , the group 's so - called minister of war .
Abu Suleiman succeeded Abu Ayyub al - Masri , the leader of al - Qaeda in Iraq who was killed along with ISI leader Abu Omar al - Baghdadi in a joint operation by US and Iraq forces in April .
Political stalemate
No group has yet said it carried out the bombings in Tal Afar , but correspondents say the method was similar to past al - Qaeda attacks and the group remains active in the area .
" Many people were gathered to watch the match , " Hussein Nashad , who attended the game , told the AFP news agency by telephone from a hospital in Tal Afar where he was being treated for shock .
" We heard a loud explosion and the people behind me shielded me from the shrapnel .
I ran away , but then I heard someone shout ' Allahu Akbar ' , and then there was another explosion , " he said .
Another spectator , Ali Jaafar , told the Reuters news agency : " Suddenly we saw a pick - up in the middle of the field .
The players were suspicious so they ran and as expected it turned out to be a suicide car bomber .
The spectators began to run away but two suicide bombers were in the crowd . "
On Monday , more than 100 people were killed in a series of apparently co-ordinated attacks blamed on al - Qaeda and its allies .

International efforts to avert a full - blown crisis on the Korean peninsula were given greater urgency today after a leaked UN report claimed that North Korea is defying UN sanctions and using front companies to export nuclear and missile technology to Iran , Syria and Burma .
The report , by a panel that monitors sanctions imposed after Pyongyang conducted nuclear weapons tests in 2006 and 2009 , said the regime was using shell companies and overseas criminal networks to export the technology .
The revelations came just hours before the Chinese premier , Wen Jiabao , arrived in South Korea for a three - day visit certain to be dominated by mounting tensions between Seoul and Pyongyang .
At a meeting today , Wen told the South Korean president Lee Myung - bak that China would not " harbour " anyone over the sinking of a South Korean warship in March , in which 46 soldiers died .
But he added that China has not yet concluded that North Korea was responsible .
Pyongyang has denied involvement
According to a South Korean official , Wen said : " China objects to and condemns any act that destroys the peace and stability of the Korean peninsula . "
China , the North 's closest ally and main benefactor , has so far refused to condemn the Pyongyang regime after a multinational investigation concluded that a North Korean torpedo sank the Cheonan .
Analysts say Beijing is unlikely to support any UN security council moves against North Korea , but might be persuaded to abstain on a resolution rather than wield its veto .
Wen and Lee will continue talks tomorrow , at a three - way summit that will also include the Japanese prime minister , Yukio Hatoyama .
A spokesman for Lee said South Korea was " fully concentrating on diplomatic efforts to hold North Korea responsible " .
However , experts said China 's options were limited , given its desire to defuse tensions and avoid sparking a political and humanitarian crisis in its own backyard .
" China has its own strategic stake in the Korean peninsula , and if North Korea is further isolated or sanctioned , that would escalate tensions and risk serious instability , " said Prof Wei Zhijiang of Zhongshan University in southern China .
The sanctions report , leaked to journalists in New York , said UN bans on nuclear and ballistic missile technology , and on all arms exports and most imports , were having an effect .
But it conceded the North had found ways to circumvent sanctions using companies and individuals who are not subject to asset freezes and travel bans .
The 47 - page report contains a long list of sanctions violations reported by UN member states , including four cases of arms exports .
Pyongyang , the panel said , had used " a number of masking techniques , " including falsely labelling the contents of shipping containers and giving inaccurate information about their origin and destination .
North Korea was using " multiple layers of intermediaries , shell companies and financial institutions " to get around sanctions , it added .
An unnamed western diplomat based at the UN said : " The details in the report are not entirely surprising .
Basically it suggests that North Korea has exported nuclear and missile technology with the aid of front companies , middlemen and other ruses . "
The report said the regime had tried to conceal arms exports by sending items in kit form to be built at their destination , and called on recipient countries of North Korean cargo to act with " extra vigilance " .
Pyongyang is also suspected of using overseas criminal groups to transport and distribute " illicit and smuggled cargoes " , possibly including parts for weapons of mass destruction .
In response to the sinking , South Korea froze trade with the North , resumed propaganda broadcasts across the border and announced joint naval exercises with the US .
The North retaliated by severing ties with its neighbour , expelling South Korean officials from a joint industrial venture and banning the country 's aircraft from its airspace .
It also ditched an agreement designed to prevent naval clashes and threatened to attack any South Korean vessel entering its waters .
Yesterday , we ran Part 1 of my interview with Michelle Crumm , co-founder and chief business officer for fuel cell manufacturer Adaptive Materials of Ann Arbor , MI .
We discussed how it took a decade of old - fashioned hard work to get to a point where the company is signing deals to supply the military with the fuel cells needed for unmanned aerial vehicles and robots helping to fight the war in Afghanistan .
Today , in Part 2 , Crumm talks about how , despite the 7,100 resumes she received for nine open engineering positions , the company has had difficulty finding workers who fit her company ’s culture .
Xconomy : I ’ve not only been reading about these recent contracts Adaptive Materials has been getting , but also the fact that you ’re hiring new engineers .
Michelle Crumm :
If you can put that in there , I ’d love to have a great systems engineer .
X : Absolutely .
You know , the way I first heard about your company was that it had been Tweeted a few times that you were on a resume - gathering blitz , looking to hire nine new engineers .
How many resumes have you collected ?
MC : We had 7,100 resumes during that resume blitz .
We pulled in 90 people to come in for short interviews , then we pulled in 20 of those to come in for day - long interviews , and we ended up hiring five people .
So , we still have four open positions that we ’re trying to fill .
X : You must have a pool of a lot of qualified candidates .
There are a lot of talented engineers in the area who are out of work .
How was the quality of the resumes ?
MC : Well , I think the biggest challenge is that there are a ton of really smart engineers out there — and some of them are employed and some of them are not employed , unfortunately .
The biggest challenge is can we find the right cultural fit , and that is a lot harder than just having a smart engineer that ’s out of work .
You know , it ’s so much bigger than that .
Do they have the right attitude ?
Can they come in and make decisions ?
Are they an empowered thinker ?
How quickly can they learn ?
So , it ’s all those things that we ’re interviewing for .
It ’s the core values of the company that ’s our weed - out process .
They ’re all intelligent , they all have their plaques on their walls , there are great , talented , wonderful people out there , but just because they ’re great , talented , wonderful people does not mean that they ’re a great cultural fit for our organization .
We ’re still small enough that every single person , you know , they have to fit in culturally .
Otherwise , they can tip over the apple cart .
X : Sounds like you still have that startup mentality .
People have to be flexible , think on their feet .
MC : Yes , that ’s the way we hire .
Our technicians out on the floor , they may have a high school diploma but they need to have a strong enough personality to push back to the engineers and say , “ This is not a manufacturable design .
Let ’s work on this together to try to get something that I can actually put together a lot easier . ”
I do n’t need a technician .
I need a technician that ’s confident enough that they can stand up for themselves , that they can talk to the engineers and work together to get these products so they design for manufacturability .
So much of it is just a personality issue .
X : Let me broaden the conversation a little more and talk about the funding environment .
Venture capital in this area has been pretty dismal for a while .
It ’s improving a little bit , maybe for early stage companies or companies right out of academia .
But you ’ve mentioned before that there is gap for companies like yours .
What needs to be done , culturally , to change that in this area ?
MC : I ’ve never thought that it made sense to have venture capitalists — we always call it OPM around here , Other People ’s Money .
Well , Other People ’s Money , to me , is something that you take … Next Page »

Some may say Ruby is a bad rip - off of Lisp or Smalltalk , and I admit that .
But it is nicer to ordinary people .
— Yukihiro “ Matz ” Matsumoto , LL2
When I heard the Smalltalk traits of Ruby , I was intrigued .
When I learned more , I enjoyed Ruby ’s similarities with one of the most beautiful and powerful languages I ’ve known .
As I dug deeper , I enjoyed more of its wonderful metaprogramming abilities , which makes Ruby ’s classes a lot more dynamic and easy to declare than Smalltalk’s .
After reading this in - depth comparison of both , and Kent Beck ’s article on the incompatibilities of Smalltalk ’s VM implementations , I realized that I was generally more in favor of Ruby than Smalltalk ( even though I fear that What Killed Smalltalk Could Kill Ruby , Too ) .
But Ruby is not perfect .
In all fairness , its creator claims that it ’s just plain impossible to design a perfect language .
But I do believe it could be a bit better .
People do point out some controversial rough edges , but these seem a bit trifle when compared to what really bothers me :
No scoped open classes .
It is an issue that is actually being considered to be solved on 2.0 ( and there are some branches of ruby that enable it ) , but , for the time being , there is no way to make the changes made by opening an existing class only apply to objects while being used on the a lexical scope .
This is not the same as adding and removing the changes as , in this case , calls that fall out of scope ( such as to another module or file ) still see the changes .
It would be nice to have both ways of open classes : scoped and not scoped .
Method arguments do not interleave with the method ’s name ( like in Smalltalk ) .
Example : Instead of calling : File.fnmatch (‘*’ , ‘/’ , File :: FNM_PATHNAME ) you ’d be to call it like : File .fn match : ‘*’ path : ‘/’ flags : File :: FNM_PATHNAME .
This seems weird , but it is a very powerful feature that allows method invocation to be descriptive , similar to Python ’s named arguments or even Ruby ’s named arguments with a hash .
On the other hand it has a cleaner syntax than the former , and does not require checking hash keys as the later ( the later is still useful for methods that want to receive an arbitrary list of named arguments ) .
It would change a bit of the syntax of method_missing and how to deal with varargs and blocks for each parameter , but these can be dealt with as Scala does with its parameter lists .
There is no method called ( ) .
Procs ( who are the obvious beneficiaries of such change ) use the method call , but one could be an alias to the other .
There would be a mild ambiguity here , when you call the function that was just returned .
For instance , imagine func is a method that receives no arguments and returns a function ( that is : an object that implements the ( ) method ) wich also receives no arguments .
Then func ( ) could mean 1 . call func , and 2 . call the function returned by func .
I am aware this is kinda of a sensitive topic , but the Scala approach to this issue is very simple : func and func ( ) are the same ( provided func can be called with no parenthesis ) .
If you want to call the returned function in the same expression , use func ( ) ( ) .
With the alias , you ’d be able to call it like func.call ( ) , func ( ) .call ( ) or even func.call
No way to create simple blocks .
It would be nice to have something similar to Scala ’s underscore or Groovy ’s it , which allows method invocations like : collection.map(get_square_of(_ ) ) in Scala and collection.map( get_square_of( it ) ) in Groovy .
Ruby ’s symbol coercion to proc ( & : method ) does not really work on anything besides methods of the arguments of the block .
Difficulties of composing callback methods .
You could be sure to always invoke super on them , and even meta - program all the classes / objects that do not do such thing .
However , it is not easy to actually see which methods will be called , or even manipulate / re-prioritize the blocks of code on runtime ( kinda like a Chain of Responsibility ) , which can be very bad , as these methods can modify a lot of behaviour throughout the Object Space .
The reflection API could be more thorough .
For instance , you ca n’t get the source code of a method / class , etc ( as you can in Python ) .
You can use Parse Tree and Ruby2 Ruby to do it , but Parse Tree is not portable ( does not even work on ruby 1.9 ) and the output can be formated differently than the actual source code ( which can be critical on DSLs ) .
Also , methods added do not have information on which line of code they were added ( which is less important when adding methods the recommended way : extending / including Modules ) , and properties created with class methods ( such as those created by attr_reader , or some other libraries equivalents ) ca n’t be discovered on runtime ( they are like any other method , with no other meta - data whatsoever ) .
Ruby also seems to be missing some helper methods , such as #metaclass .
No support for immutability .
This is kinda nitpicking , but using recursive freeze ( as noted by Dean Wampler ) is not really practical ( as it is really slow ) .
Neither does it encompass immutable local variables .
This is not only useful for concurrency and functional programming issues , but is also useful when writing code that is side - effect free so that it is easier to reason about .
The return value of a setter method ( that is : one that ends with the equals symbol ) is the argument , not the return value of the method .
This is an issue that matters more when using immutable objects , as the only way for them to “ mutate ” is to return a new object .
Therefore you ca n’t use a setter method on an immutable object , as , even if it returns a new one , the runtime will ignore the return value and set to the variable the argument that was received .
On the other hand , I do n’t think this can be changed without breaking a lot of existing code .
Several of this annoyances can be solved with a heavy dose of open classes , s- expressions manipulation ( using Parse Tree ) and meta- programming in general .
Knuth has said that : Language designers also have an obligation to provide languages that encourage good style , since we all know that style is strongly influenced by the language in which it is expressed .
Fully agreeing with such Sapir - Whorf - esque sentence , I feel it would be a good thing if the underlying listed solutions were built into the language itself ( and supported across implementations , such as JRuby , Iron Ruby , Rubinius , Maglev ) , as it would not only improve , even if a little bit , the language itself , but also they way its users write code .
Update : Thanks Michael Fellinger for noting that ruby blocks are fully adherent to method definitions on 1.9 , as they allow both default parameters and blocks as arguments .
Before we were assigned to the failing body of an old man , before we were playing our own father and before we were forced to be an effeminate blonde with a nagging girlfriend , we were Solid Snake .
With the fast approaching Metal Gear Solid : Peace Walker for the PSP , we will once again take up the mantle of Big Boss .
Because of this dilution of the MGS universe , we sometimes forget to look back and remember the hero we originally came to idolize .
He was a take - no - prisoners espionage agent in a blue sneaking suit with a penchant for snapping necks .
Solid Snake did n’t always go horse yelling “ Liquuuiiiid ! ”
No , he used to spend his free time mouthing off to huge Inuits wielding chain guns and assuring us that love can bloom on the battlefield right after he shoots your soul mate with a Nikita missile .
Now I know what you ’re all thinking , you ’ve already saved the free world from destruction with every variation of Snake there is .
Maybe so , but there might have been a little mission you neglected to take part in .
Metal Gear Solid for the Game Boy Color is not a remake ; it is a brand new mission featuring Solid Snake seven years after the events of the first game in a pseudo - alternate timeline .
Snake must return to Outer Heaven to stop a new prototype Metal Gear from falling into the hands of a guerrilla separatist group called the Gindra Liberation Front , and it ’s up to you to guide him through it .
The game itself is played from a top - down perspective much like the original Metal Gear for the NES .
Surprisingly , the game manages to bring back almost all of Snake ’s tricks from the first Playstation ’s MGS to the foray .
You can press yourself against walls , knock on surfaces to distract guards , sneak via cardboard box and all of it is beautifully animated on the 8 - bit screen .
Even Colonel Cambell and Mei Ling make an appearance .
Yes , almost all of Snake ’s weapons , comrades and techniques are at your disposal in this incarnation of the MGS franchise .
The only downside is that all these tricks are n’t entirely necessary when the enemy AI is pretty much what you would expect from a Gameboy Color game .
You can literally kill a guard while he ’s having a smoke right next to his partner without alerting anyone .
Snake is pretty much breaking into a nursery and punching newborns left and right , but somehow the games intelligently designed levels and traps keep this from becoming an issue .
The game does veer away from the mainstream Metal Gear titles in some aspects .
For instance , you cannot backtrack through previously visited areas .
Instead , the game is divided into 13 missions which rank you on your performance once completed .
Do n’t worry though ; you can relive your favorite moments at any time by selecting a chapter at the mission screen .
Speaking of favorite moments , the game sports some of the most bizarre and interesting villains of the MGS series in the form of the oddly familiar Black Chambers , a group of mercenaries with animal codenames .
From the creepy serial killer with a love for puppets , Marionette Owl , to the grossly underrated flame - thrower wielding Pyro Bison , you ’ll find the villains in this game as memorable as any other .
At the very least , you ’ll find them more interesting than the villains from Sons of Liberty …
I mean seriously , they had to use half of Guns of the Patriots to make those characters even moderately presentable .
Once you ’ve completed the main story , the game offers a ton of extras .
There ’s new mission objectives for each chapter , 180 puzzling VR mission and a versus mode if you can find a friend who has a Gameboy and link cable .
But more importantly it ’s a return to classic Snake .
The one who would taunt his enemies with witty repartee , and although there ’s obviously no voice acting in this installment , the music and story are of a caliber unseen on many other handheld titles .
So if you ’re a fan of the Metal Gear series and have n’t played MGS for the Gameboy Color , get to your local used game store and find this gem .
It ’s an experience that will remind you of what Snake used to be before we started swapping more characters than Dr. Sam Beckett ( Anyone ? Quantum Leap ?
C’mon that was classic ) .
With great 8 - bit graphics , an involving story , a surprising good soundtrack and more extras than you can wave an SMG at , you ’ll be happy you did .
Buy it .
This is the new Zelda - inspired video from Mark Ronson .
His new album , Record Collection , will be out in September .
The track is called Circuit Breaker and Im not really sure if it should be on a Mark Ronson album or in a classic SNES game that you can get for $ 5 on Amazon .

I ’m not going to talk much about the yacht ’s interior although as you can see it ’s outstanding , but its technical sheet is quite impressive .
The motor yacht is powered by twin MTU 16V4000 engines that help it cruise at 45 knots , or you can add the optional Rolls - Royce KaMeWa boosters for a total 14,000 hp that helps it achieve 55 knots .
And now that I ’ve mentioned the supercar “ thing ” , it ’s probably the most interesting .
Apparently the Strand Craft 122 is going to be delivered together with a sleek four wheeler powered by a 880 hp twin turbo V12 engine , that reaches a top speed of 345 km / h , a four wheeler that will be housed in the built - in garage we previously mentioned .
No word if the Strand Craft 122 will see the light of day , when or for how much , but we can tell you for sure that this looks sick .
We ’re game !

HOUSTON 
The chief executive of Anadarko Petroleum , a BP partner , accused BP late Friday of recklessness in the way the company managed the gulf well project before it ended in environmental disaster .
“ The mounting evidence clearly demonstrates that this tragedy was preventable and the direct result of BP ’s reckless decisions and actions , ” Jim Hackett , Anadarko ’s chairman and chief executive , said in a statement .
“ Frankly , we are shocked by the publicly available information that has been disclosed in recent investigations and during this week ’s testimony . ”
Anadarko owns a 25 percent stake in the well , which means it could potentially be liable for that percentage of the total damages .
BP owns 65 percent of the project , with the Japanese company Mitsui owning the remaining 10 percent .
Anadarko ’s share price had dropped more than 40 percent since the April 20 accident .
In its statement , Anadarko said that under its joint operating agreement , “ BP is responsible to its co-owners for damages caused by its gross negligence or willful misconduct . ”
The big news in the fashion world was the exit of Jean Paul Gaultier from Hermès after seven years .
Gaultier ’s exit was n’t a shock – and had been rumored for months – but the selection of his successor did surprise many .
Replacing Gaultier will be Christophe Lemaire , who has been designing for Lacoste since 2000 .
He has worked for a variety of French design houses , including Yves Saint Laurent , Jean Patou and Christian Lacroix , before joining Lacoste in 2001 .
He brought new blood into the company , having colored classically white sporty tennis skirts , collegiate sweaters , piqued polos , and brought Lacoste back onto fashion scene .
What to expect from Lemaire ?
On his website , he describes his style as “ sophisticated casual and generous volumes . ”
For Hermès , they do n’t get Gaultier ’s sometimes difficult to implement designs .
Lemaire ’s first show will be for fall 2011 .
Expect to see his collection next March .

Julia Gillard says she is " very honoured " to become Australia 's first female prime minister , after Kevin Rudd stood down in tears as Labor leader at a caucus meeting this morning .
Ms Gillard , not Mr Rudd , will now decide when to lead her party into the next election .
Mr Rudd , who made " a very gracious speech , " stood aside to avoid a humiliating defeat .
Newcastle Herald NEXT PM : Julia Gillard challenged Kevin Rudd for the Australian leadership - and won .
Treasurer Wayne Swan was elected deputy leader unopposed , Senator Michael Forshaw announced after the caucus meeting .
Sources said Mr Rudd was reduced to tears as he addressed his colleagues and announced his decision to stand aside as leader .
Mr Rudd ignored questions from reporters as he left the caucus room .
He was accompanied by senior ministers John Faulkner and Kim Carr and Queensland backbencher Jon Sullivan .
Reuters STOOD DOWN : Prime Minister Kevin Rudd will hand over the leadership reins to Julia Gillard .
JOHN KEY
Prime Minister John Key spoke to the new Australian PM Julia Gillard at about 12.30 pm today and passed on his congratulations .
" Our relationship with Australia is a critical one and our most important with any country , and I look forward to working with Julia Gillard to advance that relationship , " he said .
Mr Key also acknowledged Mr Rudd with whom he said he had a " constructive relationship .
" He has always been a gracious host when I have visited Australia , and our discussions have always been ones I have enjoyed . "
He hoped to talk to Mr Rudd later today .
Mr Key first met Ms Gillard in 2008 when she came to New Zealand for the Australia - New Zealand Business Leadership Forum .
" I am confident that the very close relationship between the two countries will remain strong .
Mr Key said he was the first prime minister to ring Ms Gillard " and I think that 's a sign of the depth and strength and the significance of the relationship between New Zealand and Australia . "
He admitted being surprised by the speed of the change .
" I guess there had been a sigjn that the polls had been difficult for Kevin the last few months but that 's not unique in politics and he'd obviously been a highly regarded and well loved prime minister of Australia . "
Next week 's scheduled visit by the Australian Prime Minister to New Zealand has now been cancelled .
POPULARITY DIVE
Just a year ago , Mr Rudd rivalled Bob Hawke as Australia 's most popular leader .
But he now joins Mr Hawke as the only other Labor prime minister dumped by his party .
Mr Rudd had decided to fight to the death after refusing to step aside last night for Ms Gillard .
Ms Gillard , however , was believed to have to the numbers before going into this morning 's ballot , which was not held .
She also had the backing of the powerful Australian Workers Union .
A series of policy failures , poor polls and the decision to go to war with the mining industry have all contributed to Mr Rudd 's plunging fortunes among his colleagues .
The Coalition fears a change to Ms Gillard .
Although she bears responsibility for many of the government 's poor decisions , including shelving the emissions trading scheme and the school buildings program , she would be harder to beat than Mr Rudd .
The push to oust Mr Rudd was driven by the Right faction in Victoria and South Australia .
The entire national Right , including the NSW Right and its kingmaker Mark Arbib , had last night swung behind Ms Gillard , as had the Victorian Left , led by Kim Carr , who installed Mr Rudd .
The hard Left was left doing the numbers for Mr Rudd .
After a three - hour crisis meeting in his office last night with Ms Gillard and the veteran fixer John Faulkner , Mr Rudd held a media conference and said he would fight .
" I was elected by the people of Australia as the Prime Minister of Australia , " he said .
" I was elected to do a job and I intend doing that job . "
But he had acknowledged that he was abandoned by most of the factional powerbrokers .
Mr Rudd had attempted to salvage votes by promising to bring a speedy conclusion to the mining tax saga and initiate a timetable to implement an emissions trading scheme .
After being pressured to take a hard line against asylum seekers , he baulked , saying he would not engage in a race to the right .
The push to oust Mr Rudd was led by the Victorian senator David Feeney , the Victorian MP Bill Shorten , and the South Australian senator Don Farrell , all right - wing heavyweights .
Sources said they met Ms Gillard yesterday afternoon in an attempt to persuade her to stand .
She was reluctant .
But the Agriculture Minister , Tony Burke , and Senator Arbib met Ms Gillard separately to urge her to move .
Senator Arbib and Ms Gillard were instrumental in forcing the government to abandon the emissions trading scheme , which was the catalyst for the government 's slide in the polls .
The move against Mr Rudd was sparked by a report in yesterday 's Herald that Mr Rudd had used his chief of staff , Alister Jordan , to sound out the backbench over the past month on the level of support for him .
This followed a Herald / Nielsen poll which showed the government would lose if an election were held then .
But Mr Rudd 's action was regarded as a sign that he did not trust the repeated assurances by Ms Gillard that she would not stand .
" It was offensive and disloyal , " said a Gillard supporter .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Workers for Bank of America Corp , one of the nation ’s largest employers , have sued the company for allegedly failing to pay overtime and other wages .

The lawsuit filed on Friday in federal court in Kansas City , Kansas , consolidates 12 lawsuits filed on behalf of employees in California , Florida , Kansas , Texas and Washington .
It seeks nationwide class - action status on behalf of employees at Bank of America retail branches and call centers over the past three years .
George Hanson , a lawyer for the plaintiffs , said the case could eventually cover more than 180,000 workers , based on information provided by the bank .
That could lead to a recovery in the “ hundreds of millions ” of dollars , assuming a typical employee was deprived of $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 in pay , he said .
According to the 44 - page complaint , the largest U.S. bank by assets requires employees to work in excess of eight hours a day or 40 hours a week , yet fails to pay them both for overtime and for all straight time worked .
The complaint also accuses Bank of America of requiring employees to work during unpaid breaks , failing to provide meal and rest breaks , and failing to timely pay terminated employees for earned wages and accrued vacation time .
“ Bank of America enjoys millions of dollars in ill - gained profits at the expense of its hourly employees , ” violating either the federal Fair Labor Standards
Act or various state labor laws , the complaint said .
Shirley Norton , a Bank of America spokeswoman , said the Charlotte , North Carolina - based bank would defend against the lawsuit , and had comprehensive policies and training to ensure compliance with all federal and state wage and hour laws .
Bank of America as of March 31 employed 283,914 people worldwide , and operated 5,939 U.S. branches .
The federal Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation in April had directed that the 12 original cases be combined .
The lawsuit seeks class - action status , a halt to the alleged illegal conduct , compensatory and punitive damages and other remedies .
The case is In re : Bank of America Wage and Hour Employment Practices Litigation , U.S. District Court , District of Kansas , No. 10- md-2138 .
For 15 years , Kevin Costner has been overseeing the construction of oil separation machines to prepare for the possibility of another disaster of the magnitude of the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill .
Does this evoke his tagline from “ Field of Dreams ? ”
It seems that Mr. Costner , the 55 - year - old actor , environmental activist and fisherman , was ready for the current spill in the gulf .
Disturbed by the effects of the Valdez spill in Alaska , Mr. Costner bought the nascent technology from the government in 1995 and put $ 24 million of his own money into developing it for the private sector .
“ Kevin saw the Exxon Valdez spill , and as a fisherman and an environmentalist , it just stuck in his craw , the fact that we did n’t have separation technology , ” said John Houghtaling , Mr. Costner ’s lawyer and business partner as chief executive with Ocean Therapy Solutions , which developed the technology .
Mr. Costner ’s brother , Dan , is a scientist who worked on the project and was also in New Orleans this week .
On Wednesday , BP ’s chief operating officer , Doug Suttles , said that the company had approved six of Ocean Therapy ’s 32 machines for testing .
All boast centrifuge processing technology — giant vacuum - like machines that suck oil from water , separate the oil , store it in a tanker and send the water , 99.9 percent purified , back into the gulf .
“ I ’m very happy the light of day has come to this , ” Mr. Costner said at a news conference in New Orleans .
He said he was “ very sad ” about the spill , “ but this is why it ’s developed . ”
“ It ’s prepared to go out and solve problems , not talk about them , ” the actor said of the technology .
Mr. Houghtaling of Ocean Therapy Solutions said that the company had trained independent contractors and were bringing in scientists from U.C.L.A. to deploy the machines , which were waiting on a barge in Venice , La. , on Wednesday afternoon .
The technology was available for use 10 years ago , Mr. Houghtaling said .
“ These machines have been very robust , but nobody ’s been interested in them until now , ” he added .
BP officials and Ocean Therapy are working to determine where best in the gulf to test the machines , and if all goes well , the technology will be running within the week , he said .
“ We just need the green light from BP . ”
He said that the largest four machines have the capability of separating 210,000 gallons of oil from water a day , 200 gallons a minute .
This game had a lot of firsts .
It was my most visually ambitious game yet .
It was my first use of actual perspective .
And it was my first serious attempt at making art without resorting to 2d sprites – the only sprites in the game are the black structure at the beginning , the minigame icons , and one simple sprite used for the explosion graphics .
What Worked
Honestly , all of the above worked .
The game does look good – I think the explosions particularly turned out well .
I spent a good chunk of time on " small things " like screenshakes and a gradually changing background .
Things that nobody really mentions , but that help the game tremendously .
So , full marks for art .
The game design itself also worked as well as I was hoping .
The game design did n't really change from the first day to the end – I knew where I was going with it , and I went there , and everything was good .
I did n't have concrete plans for the bosses from the very beginning , but they came together in an hour or two each once I sat down to work on them .
What Didn't Work
I made some decisions early on about the monster graphics that ended up constraining my design a bit more than I 'd really intended .
Namely , I just assumed I 'd be sticking with right angles for everything , and , later , when I found myself wanting more complex layouts , I could n't do it easily .
I 'm not sure this would have been easily solvable , however .
I could have changed it moderately simply , but it would have been Difficult to do the actual graphics design without that constraint , as my character design was limited to text input .
Originally I had plans for how to produce more organic - behaving monsters – still built out of right angles , but with the individual parts given a little more freedom relative to each other .
I ended up not implementing this due to a lack of time .
I was also running into issues with render speed , which that would have made even worse .
I 'm not sure what the actual render speed bottleneck was , though I suspect it 's heavily based around my continued use of immediate mode OpenGL .
Solving this will require me to finish my Lua OpenGL layer first .
Speaking of graphics , I decided to use framebuffer objects to do the bloom effect .
It turns out that framebuffer objects are problematical , as many graphics cards do n't support them , and I actually reduced my userbase rather unfortunately with them .
The " standard solution " appears to be rendering to the screen , then copying that to textures .
Unfortunately that is difficult with my current render framework .
I 'll have to come up with a solution for this in the future , as I 'd now like to avoid FBOs .
More graphics issues : I did the complex texture effects entirely with shaders .
It turns out that shaders do n't antialias well , and I was having horrible aliasing issues .
Turning up the back render resolution fixed that issue .
An effective 64 x antialiasing looked goddamn gorgeous .
It also ran like crap on every system I could get my hands on , besides my main computer , so I turned it back to 4 x and crossed my fingers that it was an acceptable tradeoff .
I 'm not convinced it was a great tradeoff .
The only alternatives were to completely redesign rendering in terms of multiple textures or to try simulating anti-aliasing inside the shader itself – the latter did n't go well , and the former would have taken a lot of time .
I 'm not sure what else I could have done better here , but I 'll keep it in mind as a stumbling block .
I spent about six hours trying to get perspective working properly , but I kind of expected that .
I also ran into some problems writing the monster AI – I had hacks upon hacks upon hacks , and that , as well , became a significant bottleneck .
I 've since written some chunks of code to provide a more powerful and general AI layer , which should prevent that from happening in the future .
Despite all the work done on making the Linux version work well , I had one giant critical error that – as near as I can tell – broke it on all NVidia cards .
Whoops !
Guess I should n't have relied on friends and VMWare .
That 's fixed now though , and the incoming Linux error reports flatly stopped after fixing that bug .
This was kind of expected , though , new platforms are always a little flaky until you do a serious test .
The Bottom Line
I know I just spent like 3 / 4 of this post talking about fuckups , but the fact is that I think the game was pretty successful .
I got everything done I wanted to , and the game worked out as well as I 'd wanted .
I do n't have anything major to say about the game design itself .
I 'm trying a few new public - relations things , despite it feeling a little bit scummy .
I went and posted a bunch of stories on Reddit and got a huge pile of comments and readers , so I feel like that worked out well .
I was kind of hazy about whether this moved into " spammer " territory or not , but considering the generally positive feedback , I figure people are n't objecting to the content .
Oddly , I simultaneously feel like I 'm getting fewer non-Reddit comments on this game than I 'd expected , though maybe I 've been spoiled by the feedback on Robert Recurring and Nieuwe Aarde .
( So if I 'd posted RR or NA heavily on Reddit , how much feedback would I have gotten ? )
The hits I 'm getting for " mandible " are finally overcoming the hits I 'm getting for " hard disk double boiling " .
In summary : k0r worked out great .
I learned a lot from it , and I learned a lot about what I fucked up badly .
Time to move on to the next project !
Osaka is quite famous for its Kushiage cuisine , especially around Shinsekai area .

We 've got details from a tried - and - true tipster of what may well end up being the hottest phone of the year -- a tall order , indeed , given what we 've seen from HTC so far this year , and what 's coming out from Motorola .
Let 's discuss after the break .
The Samsung Galaxy S Pro is real .
We know that , of course , because we 've seen a picture of it with Sprint branding .
But what we have n't had is specs or any hands - on impressions -- until now .
First , let 's preface this by saying that we would n't be surprised to see some of what you 're about to read may well change by the time this phone launches .
From what we 're told , things are still very much in the testing phase , and so it 's not unusual for some things -- especially on the software side -- to be changed up .
But now , the juicy parts .
Samsung Galaxy S Pro hardware
Size :
It 's a tad shorter ( about a half - inch ) and more narrow ( about three - eights of an inch ) than the Sprint Evo 4G , but it 's thick .
Not surprising , given the slide - out keyboard .

Samsung / Intrinsity ARM Cortex A8 @ 1GHz .
Screen : " Gorgeous , " which is about what we hear anybody say when they 're first exposed to Super AMOLED .
Blacks are very dark , " almost look wet . "
Font edges look a tad fuzzy , like on the Nexus One .
But when viewing white text on a black background , they 're very easy to read .
The resolution appears to be 480x800 .
The screen size is noticeably smaller than the Evo 4G , but bigger than the Nexus One .
So it may well be the same 4 - inch screen that 's on the Galaxy S. Very responsive , only needed a light touch .
" Never used anything so fluid . "
Feels a little plasticy .

Memory : 512MB of RAM .
There was 8.2 gigabytes of ROM , which possibly could be re-allocated to phone storage / internal storage , much like the Verizon Droid Incredible .
But that 's speculation on our part .

Samsung Galaxy S Pro software impressions
OK , so this is where we 'd expect more movement before launch .
But here 's what we were told :
Sounds like the TouchWiz 3.0 customizations are on board .
( Which our tipster was n't crazy about but says " really cool scrolling people widget makes up for it . " )
Android 2.1 - update 1 was on board .
No word if it 'll launch with it or Froyo .
As for video , H.264 and Divx both worked fine .
Usual Sprint software was on board , and Sprint TV worked fine over 4G , 3G and Wifi ( on the Evo 4G , it does n't work on Wifi ) .
So that 's it for now .
We 're sure we 'll flesh this out some by launch time -- whenever that is -- and it 's possible we may see it announced in a week or so at the New York event .
Let 's hope so , as the Galaxy S Pro is shaping up to be another ( yes , another ) must - have phone this year .
I came across this text over at www.linuxformat.gr and it got me into a lot of thinking .
I would like to thank NikolaosX1 for sharing the original post in Greek and Danae for the translation in English that follows .
Here is what NicolaosX1 wrote :
“ If you have problems in understanding the substance of Free Software , read the following dialogue between Socrates and Antiphon ( Xenophon , Memoires A , 6 ) .
ANTIPHON : I believe that you are a fair man .
I do not consider you wise , though .
I even think that you know this yourself , since you do not receive any money for your teaching .
Your clothes , however , or your house , or any other of your possessions , which you think that may be of value , you would not give it for free or for a lower price than what it ’s worth .
It is , thus , obvious that if you consider your teaching of value , you should have been receiving some money .
You might therefore be fair , because you do not deceive anybody out of greed , but you can not be wise because you know things with no value .
SOCRATES : Antiphon , I find selling one ’s beauty or wisdom a foul deed .
Because , if one sells his beauty to whoever wants it , then we call him a prostitute , but if one meets somebody who is beautiful in body and soul and befriends him , then we call him a wise man .
This is exactly what happens with wisdom .
The ones selling it to those who want it are called Sophists * .
Whoever , though , understands that somebody is clever and teaches him something good and makes him a friend , we believe that he is a good and virtuous citizen .
The same way , then , that somebody is pleased to have a good horse or a dog ( tangible goods ) , so am I , and much more , when I have good friends and if I know something good I teach and I recommend it to others , which I think will benefit when it comes to virtue .
And I study together with my friends the treasures written in the books of the old wise men and if we find something good we say it and we consider it to be a big profit if we become friends through this .
* Socrates , greatly averse to the Sophists who were paid for the classes they gave mainly to young rich Athenians , compares them to prostitutes ( of knowledge ) . ”
After discovering this article I really wanted to write a post here expanding my thoughts on it and how they relate with Free Software .
I decided to just express some initial points of concern I have instead , leaving it open for discussion .
Here ’s what ’s troubling me :
In general I do n’t like taking words of great people out of context , nor misusing them just to make a point .
I only use this quote here , with respective differences taken into consideration and respecting the analogy , to trigger a conversation .
I already feel awkward , but I felt this was something worth sharing .
I am aware that FLOSS has other “ rules ” and “ freedoms ” to define itself and I have in mind that the quoted text is far from expressing the Free Software ideology .
However I agree with the initial writer .
For me , the idea behind Socrates ’ words in a way demonstrates the substance of Free Software , and the “ sharing knowledge ” concept is one of the reasons that drove me into this community in the first place .
How do you feel about this ?
Does it represent the essence behind FLOSS to you ?
And in what perspective ?
Please leave your comments below , always remembering to keep a contributing spirit .

In mid-May , Portland police Officer James Crooker went to Southeast Portland on a patrol call .
With a few minutes to spare , he decided to get a coffee .
So , he popped into the
on Southeast 12th Avenue near Oak Street , bought a coffee and was heading out when a customer approached him , saying she appreciates the hard job that police officers do every day in Portland .
One of the co-owners of the cafe , John Langley , has another point of view .
While the officer and customer were chatting , he walked up and asked Crooker to leave , saying he felt uncomfortable having a uniformed officer in the vegan cafe .
The incident , which was brief , speaks volumes about the tensions between Portland police and some members of the community who are more worried about
than protection .
Crooker said he was surprised to be shown the door but left immediately .
He said this marked a first during his nine - year in law enforcement , two in Portland and seven in Coeur d'Alene , Idaho .
" The places that I 've been kicked out of before have been places like the methadone clinic , " he said .
" I 've never been kicked out of a regular cafe . "
But the 36 - year - old officer , who was born and raised in Portland , said it 's all part of working this city 's streets in a uniform .
" We have a unique relationship with the community , " he said .
" You 're there to protect them but on the other hand they do n't know what that involves .
Being gracious is part of it . "
A former Marine who served in Iraq , Crooker did n't take the incident to heart .
" It was not personal , " he said .
" He was being hostile to my uniform , " he said .
Langley , who did not raise his voice during the encounter , agreed .
" It 's not about the police , " Langley said .
" It 's about what the police represent to many people who frequent the cafe .
The cafe draws vegans -- of course -- along with homeless people and animal - rights and environmental activists who Langley said have been targets of police abuse and harassment .
But the cafe also draws customers like Cornelia Seigneur , who blogged about the incident on her
Seigneur , a freelancer for The Oregonian who was enjoying lunch with her daughter on May 18 when Crooker came in , was the one who approached him .
" There have been some unfortunate situations recently , " Seigneur said .
" But overall the police are out there day in and day out protecting us . "
She said she struck up a conversation with Crooker to show her support for police , who she said saved the life of a friend after he was shot by gang members .
When Langley asked Crooker to leave , she was startled .
" It was shocking , " Seigneur said .
" Everyone deserves to have a coffee , and he was served a coffee .
It was humiliating . "
She said there were only about three other people in the cafe and that no else seemed to notice the officer .
But the incident has fired a reaction , with dozens of comments pouring into Seigneur 's website .
It 's been so overwhelming that she took the blog post down but put it back up Thursday afternoon .
The cafe , too , has received a deluge of calls , with about half supporting the cafe and the rest expressing anger .
" We 've received threats , " Langley said .
" People have threatened to attack us and break our windows . "
Still , he has no regrets .
" I never expected a police officer to come into the space , " he said .
" If it happened again , I would n't serve him . "

Despite the global credit crunch and recent crisis in Dubai its been reported that Dubai has the lowest unemployment rate due to high level of economic activity .
The UAE ’s unemployment rate fell to 4.2 % last year from double - digit .
Minister of Economy , Sultan Bin Saeed Al Mansouri , released Economic Report for 2009 by the National Statistics Bureau on this weekend .
The report showed that 53 % of the UAE population is employed while 19.9 % has no desire to work .
Employment rate among expatriate workers is 79 % while about 45 % of UAE nationals are employed .
According to report majority of unemployed are fresh graduates under age of 25 .
The economically active workforce is aged between 25 to 54 years .
Of this group , 42 % is female while the average of the male working population in this age bracket is 89 % .
According to the report among the emirates , the unemployment rate is lowest in Dubai due to the high level of economic activity .
However ,
The report showed an unexpected increase in the UAE population , touching 8.19 million in 2009 , up from 8.07 million in 2008 , a figure that is nearly double the 4.1 million reported during the 2006 census .
With a total GDP of Dh914 billion , this translates to Dh111,599 per capita GDP in 2009 — one of the highest in the world .

I think the pause button is a hard slap to the forehead , but I 'm not really sure .
Anyway , while the device could forever end childhood obesity , it 's doomed for a number of reasons not the least of which is its Microsoft origins .
First of all , game play is typically a sedentary activity .
You typically play games while already pooped out from the day 's activities .
The last thing you want to do is jump around like some ninny .
The device is never going to catch on with the general gaming community for this reason alone .
Kinect is also limited by what it can actually do .
Serious gamers get into fine control with specialty controllers that can execute elaborate and accurate action .
This will never happen with full - body control it would be too hard to make it work , and no coders will ever put in the effort much past , " it kind of works .
Ship it ! "
Then there is the big bugaboo : hardwood floors .
Unless your house has a slab floor of solid concrete , no one is going to tolerate the room and house shaking that will be produced by this " controller . "
This relegates the games to the cement floor basement playrooms that are rare in many parts of the country .
Live in an apartment ?
Prepare to be evicted .
Many homes have a second floor where the children 's bedrooms are .
You can be certain that this device , and the Xbox that uses it , will never find its way to the upstairs bedroom where the house would be shaken to its foundation .
You may as well buy the children a drum kit .
Even with padded carpeting , this product will be a nuisance to anyone not playing that will probably be most of the people in the house , since it appears the controller can only handle two people , not a mob .
And while the carpeted floor may dampen the annoying home - wide shaking , the carpet will be beaten to death and deep - rooted dust , mites , and god - knows - what else will be kicked up .
You 'll need an electrostatic precipitator or high capacity HEPA filtering system in the house if you are going to use this .
Of course , Microsoft designed this for families in an environment with no real families : the Microsoft compound in Redmond .
People who develop such things are usually single men with no real thought about how such things will go over in a real family environment .
Let me give them a hint .
Shout the following as loud as you can , " hey , you 're shaking the whole house !
Turn that damned thing off and go outside if you want to jump around !
Now ! "
A recording of that plea ought to be included with the product .
That said , I 'm sure this device will be fun to pull out at a party .
It will also be a great way to monitor calisthenics .
It does seem like an amusing way to run in place and do other limited motion exercises .
It has to be a natural for non-impact activities , too .
The bowling game might be interesting .
Tai - Chi fans might find this product ideal as well , though watching a video tape will probably offer the same benefits .
This all seems like Microsoft 's answer to the clever Wii controller , with its built - in gyroscopes and accelerometers .
But when all is said and done , game consoles were invented with game controllers in mind .
The Wiimote is a modernized game controller .
The Kinnect is a gimmick , and as gimmicks go , its popularity will be brief , unless the most compelling game in the world arrives built around it .
And I do not see that happening .
Those vuvuzela horns may be all the rage at the World Cup in South Africa , but the Yankees wo n’t let fans toot , toot , toot for the home team .
When “ bleacher creature ” Anthony Zachariadis wailed on one of the plastic horns at Tuesday night ’s game , Stadium security snatched it out of his hands .
“ You gotta give me the horn , ” the guard told him , inducing a chorus of boos from the bleachers .
“ You ca n’t blow it . ”
Zachariadis , 27 , purchased several vuvuzelas months ago for $ 6 apiece on a soccer Web site , with the intention of traveling to the World Cup .
When the trip fell through , he decided to bring the sounds of soccer to Yankee Stadium .
Though hugely popular in South Africa , the horns — which can reach an excruciating 120 decibels — are now reviled by soccer fans around the world .
Fortunately for American sports fans , the plastic instruments of irritation are still only available online or in novelty shops .
But that could change .
Even though the denizens of the bleachers are known for being loud using just their own voices , Zachariadis said he could n’t resist trying them out at the Stadium .
“ I hid them in my shorts to get into the stadium , and when I pulled out the horns , the whole place went nuts , ” he said .
“ Phillies fans would walk by and we would blow it in their ear , ” he said .
“ They had a laugh — they knew we were playing with them . ”
Zachariadis even gave one of his instruments to a fellow Bronx Bomber fan , who helped demonstrate its ear - splitting abilities .
After Mark Teixeira hit a home run in the bottom of the fifth , Zachariadis went wild on the horn , which sounds like a cross between an elephant and a donkey .
That ’s when the security guard told him there ’s no braying in baseball .
“ I blew on it only five or six times — for big plays , ” Zachariadis said .
Zachariadis finally agreed to leave the game in return for not having his horns seized .
“ I have been tossed from that place hundreds of times .
Many times I even deserved it , ” he said .
“ But this was ridiculous . ”
The Yankees did not return calls seeking comment .
The rules for fans , posted on the team ’s Web site , say you ca n’t “ blow horns and all other distracting noisemakers . ”
As bad as the Macondo oil spill is , the prospect that it will lead to tougher regulations that drive exploration out of U.S. waters is stoking fears and reminders of worse oil disasters in other countries .
" There has never been a situation where an oil spill took place and the president of Nigeria goes to that site and takes a look , and what has happened in the Gulf is much less than what we have experienced , " said Nigerian writer and activist Ben Wuloo Ikari , pointing to President Barack Obama 's multiple trips to the Gulf Coast since the disastrous blowout of the BP deep - water well .
He said spills are more frequent in Nigeria because of company and government apathy .
" You will not see their staff on the scene , mobilizing the people the way BP is doing in the Gulf , " Ikari said .
Ikari is an Ogoni , an ethnic minority from the resource - rich Niger Delta of Nigeria .
The African nation is the fifth - largest exporter of oil to the U.S. , and one of the most environmentally degraded regions on the planet .
Over the last 50 years , the amount of oil spilled in Nigeria amounts to one Exxon Valdez spill a year , according to a recent analysis of data by Amnesty International .
Though Ikari has been a U.S. resident for 10 years , the Gulf disaster evokes grim memories of home .
" It reminds me of what my people have been through and what they are still going through , " Ikari said .
" People are displaced from their way of life .
Their health is in jeopardy . "
But as debate rages over how the U.S. can prevent further catastrophic spills in U.S. waters , some industry and environmental observers warn that an onslaught of draconian regulations and financial burdens could push operators out of the Gulf and into nations less able to or less interested in protecting the environment .
Countries in west Africa , including Nigeria and Angola , are frequently mentioned as examples .
Beyond protecting its own jobs and national security , Ikari said , the world 's largest energy - consuming nation has a moral obligation to produce as much of its own oil as possible .
He cites the destruction oil production has wrought in Nigeria as one reason why .
Could be happening now
The flight of offshore drilling rigs from the Gulf of Mexico to less stable lands may already be under way .
As it investigates the Macondo blowout and resulting deadly explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig , the Obama administration wants to impose a six - month deep - water drilling moratorium .
That already has led several companies to announce plans to move drilling vessels overseas .
Norwegian oil company Statoil said recently it would invoke force majeure on two of its contracts in the Gulf because of the proposed six - month ban , leading to speculation that its drilling contractor , Maersk , would move its rigs to West Africa or Brazil .
Force majeure is a clause in contracts that allows parties to avoid liability if they can't perform their obligations because of circumstances beyond their control .
Pulling up anchor ?
Earlier this month , Houston - based drilling company Cobalt International Energy gave notice of force majeure on its contract with Diamond Offshore and said it would look into pulling up anchor .
" We are currently in conversations regarding the potential to move one or more of our rigs to international jobs , " Diamond spokesman Les Van Dyke said in an e-mail .
Regulations under discussion would raise the liability for potential oil spills to levels that none but the largest companies could meet , or require companies to sock money away in escrow , said John Felmy , chief economist with the American Petroleum Institute , a top industry trade group .
He said such financial regulations concern the industry more than new environmental or safety rules .
Industry groups chafe at the suggestion that member companies cut corners when doing business in developing countries .
Still , the idea that governments in those countries might be less attentive to environmental risks comes up frequently as a reason the U.S. government must strike a delicate balance when imposing new regulations that raise the cost of doing business .
Many drawbacks
In a recent research note , Houston - based energy investment bank Tudor , Pickering , Holt & Co. said the spiraling Macondo situation could prompt deep - water drillers to migrate to areas that are less environmentally safe , in addition to eliminating thousands of U.S. jobs , impairing Gulf state economies and increasing the nation 's dependence on foreign oil .
Even if companies extract oil safely overseas , the risk of spills rises because they must transport the crude thousands of miles by tanker , rather than through subsea pipelines to nearby coastal refineries .
Many of history 's biggest oil spills have been caused by tanker groundings or collisions .
Lamar McKay , chairman and president of BP America , suggested as much in testimony before a House subcommittee earlier this month .
" Reducing our energy production , absent a concurrent reduction in consumption , would shift additional jobs and dollars offshore and place millions of additional barrels per day into tanker ships that must traverse the world 's oceans , " he said .
But Jackie Savitz , senior scientist at Oceana , an international ocean conservation group , takes issue with what she calls the industry 's " veiled threat " of abandoning the Gulf , saying the oil produced in the region represents only a fraction of U.S. energy consumption .
" If we could alleviate the need for that additional oil through conservation , energy efficiency and clean energy , we could avoid taking these risks without pushing them off on other countries , " Savitz said .
Able to do the job better
Ben Wuloo Ikari , 41 , who now lives in St. Louis but grew up amid the din of gas flares and pipeline spills near his home city of Bori in the Niger Delta , insists the U.S. is better equipped to hold multinational companies like BP accountable .
" If you keep giving money to Nigeria because of this oil that they sell to you and you do n't have to tell them to stop gas flaring or have to tell them to do other things right , then you are a partner in that deadly business , " he said .
The Ogoni have long accused Shell Petroleum Development Co. , which is operated as a joint venture with the Nigerian government , of environmental atrocities over the years , allegations
Shell denies .
The company stopped producing oil in the region in 1993 but says its oil pipelines still cross through and are frequently vandalized .
Constant reminder
Amanda Little , an author of Power Trip : From Oil Wells to Solar Cells —
Our Ride to the Renewable Future , who describes herself as a pro-drilling environmentalist , said one reason the U.S. should continue drilling domestically is to remind itself of its crippling dependence on oil .
" We are going to keep drilling in other areas and putting other coastlines in ecological peril , " she said .
" And what is most concerning to me is that we will stop caring and thinking about the risks and stop feeling any sense of accountability for our own demands . "
As Ikari watches the Gulf spill fallout , he laments a way of life being shattered in the Gulf but also says people there have something few in his land have experienced when it comes to oil spills - hope .
" With the help of the American government and American people , that will come back , " he said .
" It wo n't be totally the same , but they will have money to start lives again , maybe in other trades .
That 's not anything close to what happened to the Ogoni people of the Niger Delta of Nigeria .
Nobody is going to pay you … in the first place . "

MOSCOW , Russia —
Just two months after the inauguration of a friendly president in neighboring Ukraine , Russia has moved swiftly to solidify its influence in the country , making Kiev ’s flirtation with the West look like a brief post - Soviet blip .
Today , Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych signed into law a deal extending Russia ’s lease of a naval base in Crimea , Ukraine ’s autonomous Black Sea region .
The contentious deal ensures a Russian naval presence on Ukrainian territory through 2042 .
In return for the long - sought - after agreement , Russia offered Ukraine a steep discount on gas imports .
Ukraine will now pay 30 percent less for its gas , bringing estimated savings of $ 40 billion over the next decade , and an estimated $ 3 billion this year alone .
The savings will be key to salvaging Ukraine ’s economy , which has been pummeled by the global financial crisis , and to filling budget gaps that have prevented it from appealing to the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) for additional aid .
( The country took a $ 16 billion IMF loan in late 2008 . )
Yanukovych , long an advocate for close relations with Russia , said during his election campaign that he would seek to balance his country ’s relations with Russia and the West .
In some areas , his quick moves to soothe ties with Russia may work in the West ’s favor .
A good relationship between Ukraine and Russia means Europe will likely no longer be subjected to the gas cut - offs that became a hallmark of the presidency of Viktor Yushchenko , Yanukovych ’s Western - leaning predecessor .
Upon Yushchenko’s election in the 2004 - 2005 “ Orange Revolution , ” Russia began raising gas prices to Ukraine , cutting subsidies and moving prices closer to those of its European clients .
As payments and deadlines for contract renegotiations neared each New Year ’s Day , the war of words grew more heated .
Last year , when Russia shut the taps to Ukraine because of failure to pay , some European countries froze for nearly two weeks .
( Europe gets most of its Russian gas from pipelines that cross Ukrainian territory . )
“ The deal should be a big relief for Europe , ” said Fyodor Lukyanov , the editor of Russia in Global Affairs .
Many Russian analysts also believe that Yanukovych ’s quick jump eastward means he wo n’t quickly be seeking a membership action plan with the European Union .
During his election campaign , Yanukovych said EU membership would remain a priority for Ukraine but that he would abandon plans to join NATO , a Yushchenko goal that sorely irked Moscow .
“ At this point , I can not imagine Ukrainian membership in NATO or the EU .
Ukraine was and still is a big disappointment for those organizations , ” said Vyacheslav Nikonov , a Kremlin - connected political analyst .
A Yanukovych decision against pursuing EU membership might just be an acknowledgment of the difficulties such a bid could face , especially as Brussels deals with the Greek debt crisis and its aftermath .
Ukraine is hardly financially healthy , with its economy having shrunk 15 percent last year .
Naftogaz Ukrainy , the state gas company , said the gas deal — which included Russia ’s waiving of penalties for late pay — saved it from bankruptcy .
It is owed some $ 500 million in unpaid bills , even though state subsidies means it sells gas to industries and households at prices well below those it paid to Gazprom in the first place .
What the deal does do is strike a blow at Russia ’s claim that it has never used its vast energy resources as a coercive weapon .
During each New Year ’s dispute , Russia went to great pains to describe the tussle as “ purely commercial , ” despite critics ’ assertions that Moscow was punishing Kiev for turning its back on its one - time patron .
The price Russia charged Ukraine eventually became punitive .
By 2010 , Ukraine was paying $ 330 per thousand cubic meters , while countries like the Czech Republic and Hungary were paying about $ 300 , even though their transport costs were higher .
Ukraine will now pay about $ 230 per thousand cubic meters , something that energy experts see as closer to the market price it should have been paying from the start .
Still , it ’s being touted by both sides as a significant discount .
“ Any price for any commodity includes a commercial , political and geostrategic cost in it , ” said Nikonov .
“ In big deals you can not distinguish this .
Everything is interrelated . ”
That ’s a different tune than the Kremlin was singing during the disputes that led to gas cut - offs in Europe — New Year ’s 2006 , 2008 and 2009 .
Then , it even summoned the promotion skills of top New York and Brussels public relations firms in order to get its message — that the dispute was a market issue — across .
Their favorite tactic was pointing out that even at the height of the Cold War , Russia never cut energy supplies to Europe .
Nonetheless , the disputes severely damaged Russia ’s reputation as a reliable energy supplier .
“ This puts politics back at the heart of the Russian - Ukrainian gas relationship , ” said a source focusing on energy at an international organization .
“ While this releases some of the pressure on Ukraine , it does n’t address some of the key Ukrainian gas vulnerabilities . ”
Inefficient pricing , reliance on Russia ’s lifting of an export duty ( which can be reinstated at any time ) , and industrial waste all continue to wreak havoc on Ukraine ’s domestic gas industry and , thus , its economy .
Some Russian analysts say the deal , in exposing Russia ’s true motivations , will add , rather than subtract , from its credibility with global partners .
“ For the first time , Russia is very transparent in terms of its intentions , ” said Lukyanov .
Speaking to his cabinet last week , Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said as much .
The agreement , he said , was “ a qualitative breakthrough in bilateral relations . ”
“ And money is not the key point here at all , ” Putin said .
“ The key thing is ultimately … the relationship of trust , the understanding of common interests and historical goals and the feeling of fellowship . ”
American Culture , Charles Taylor , Church of Scientology , Commerical Advertising , Gold 's Gym , Kenny Smith , Need Him Ministries , Redeemer Presbyterian Church , Religion Nerd , Scientology , Tim Keller
By : Kenny Smith
Gold ’s Gym and the Church of Scientology have recently featured some very interesting commercial videos on their websites , videos that have also ( to some degree ) ventured out into the broader culture .
The Gold ’s videos are shown regularly on the many television screens typically located throughout Gold ’s Gyms , over treadmills , stationary - bikes , ski-machines , free - weights , and in locker rooms and rest areas .
The Scientology commercials air occasionally on the SyFy cable television network .
Both sets of commercials are extraordinarily upbeat , offering clear paths for reinventing and revitalizing one ’s self .
At Gold ’s , we are told , we can burn off junk food , deserts , beer , and bad habits , add a few years to our life , feel stronger and lighter , gain the respect and admiration of others , look better naked , and increase our sex drive .
With Scientology , we can transcend past mistakes , realize our deepest desires , and discover our most authentic selves .
For , we are assured ,
You are not your name .
You ’re not your job .
You ’re not the clothes you wear , or the neighborhood you live in .
You ’re not your fears , your failures , or your past .
You are hope , You are imagination .
You are the power to change , to create , and to grow .
You are a spirit that will never die , and no matter how beaten down , you will rise again .
Scientology .
Know yourself .
Know life .
( http://www.scientology.org/#/videos/scientology-commercial-you)
Oddly , though , it is only Gold ’s Gym that refers to itself as a community , an institution to which one must commit oneself to receive the desired rewards .
Amidst a continual stream of carefully selected images mostly of young , attractive , well - toned women and men engaged in weight lifting , yoga , cycling , running , mountain climbing , boxing , or some other competitive sport , interspersed with inspiring scenes from nature ( e.g. , two rams colliding on a mountain top ) , high energy rock music plays in the background and lines of gold script scroll across the screen , announcing :
This is more than a gym .
This is a movement .
A movement to redefine strength , commit to our goals , to prove we can do anything .
This is more than a gym .
It ’s 44 years of strength , of success , of sweat .
This is more than a gym .
This is where you get inducted , into the strongest club in the world .
KNOW YOUR OWN STRENGTH .
Scientology , on the other hand , while presenting itself as a profound source of self - knowledge and healing , expressly avoids any reference to itself as “ a place where you get inducted , ” an institution to which one must commit oneself in order to receive the proffered existential goods .
This leads to a rather intriguing question : why does Gold ’s Gym employ precisely the sort of language that Scientology avoids ?
Why does the secular commercial gym present itself as a movement , but the religious movement present itself as a highly individualistic endeavor that requires no commitment whatsoever ?
The first part of this riddle is fairly easily solved .
It is not difficult to see why Scientology does not emphasize its institutional aspects .
These commercials hope to attract potential converts , and also improve Scientology ’s public image .
Since its emergence in the early 1950s with the highly creative religious efforts of founder L. Ron Hubbard , Scientology has been poorly received by the broader American culture .
While Americans ( if not human beings generally ) tend to react negatively to new religious movements whose myths , behaviors , and modes of social organization differ significantly from those of the dominant culture , the Church ’s policy of aggressive retaliation ( typically through lawsuits ) against those who have publicly criticized it have amplified negative public perceptions .
( Press button to continue reading )
Also , the highly individualistic nature of American culture encourages a preference for individualized , rather than institutionalized , expressions of religiosity .
This is evident in the large numbers of Americans who self - identify as “ spiritual , but not religious , ” and evangelicals who see themselves as practicing the Gospel , rather than religion .
Tim Keller , pastor of Redeemer Presbyterian Church in Manhattan , for instance , makes this distinction in an essay that can be found on any number of popular evangelical blogs : religion , he explains , is predicated upon fear , insecurity , selfish desires to “ get things from God , ” and a willingness to adhere to shallow institutional rules in order to be accepted into a community ; the Gospel , on the other hand , begins with God ’s acceptance of us as we are as sinners , followed naturally by a “ joyful gratefulness ” on our part , a sincere desire to obey , and a truly authentic relationship with Christ .
( http://cccblaine.com/site/2009/05/14/tim-keller-on-religion-vs-the-gospel/)
A similar sense of Christian identity is evident in a recent video commercial for Need Him Ministries ( http://needhim.org/), also airing on the SyFy network .
Entitled , “ Something ’s Not Right , ” this video suggests “ a way out of loneliness and fear , ” and all of the ills said to stem from “ separation from God . ”
This path to “ forgiveness , hope , and freedom … is not about church or religion , but about a relationship ( with Jesus ) , one you need , now and forever . ”
Taken together , these factors go a long way towards explaining why the Church of Scientology advertisements sidestep completely its nature as a religious institution .
The more difficult ( and interesting ) question is , why do the Gold ’s videos emphasize the sort of community - based language that Scientology avoids ?
If Americans are as individualistic as we tend to think they are , would n’t we expect savvy advertisements to sidestep such potential minefields as well ?
The work of Charles Taylor , a Canadian philosopher , shed ’s some helpful light on this question .
In The Ethics of Authenticity ( 1991 ) , Taylor points out that , whereas in previous centuries the meaning and purpose of human lives was determined by the social and religious hierarchies into which people were born , in our age , the meaning and purpose of our lives is determined by us ( rather than for us ) .
This is what Taylor calls “ the massive subjective turn of modern culture , ” one in which an inner search for authentic selves and authentic lives has come to take on tremendous significance .
One advantage of this historical shift is that people have a far greater range of options available to them .
One disadvantage is that our lives can become rather isolated , largely disconnected from those around us , and we can also begin to worry that nothing has any real , objective , meaning .
Taylor ’s theory helps us to see how the community - based language in the Gold ’s commercials might actually prove successful in our highly individualistic society .
If meaning in our culture is determined by looking within rather than without , what kinds of communities would we be willing to join ?
Typically speaking , those that required of us only what we already wanted to do .
Anything suggesting that we go beyond this point , that we work towards goals transcending the intuitions of the self , may well be perceived as misguided , or even as somehow threatening .
Citing an example of how intimately this cultural pattern plays out in our lives , Taylor writes ,
It ’s not just that people sacrifice their love relationships , and the care of their children , to pursue their careers .
Something like this has perhaps always existed .
The point is that today many people feel called to do this , feel they ought do this , feel their lives would be somehow wasted or unfulfilled if they did n’t do it .
Indeed , one suspects that much of the outrage over recent healthcare legislation requiring Americans to eventually purchase health insurance ( albeit with significant financial assistance ) , as well as staunch refusals to fill out 2010 Census information ( even by elected officials within the U.S , government http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-5095844-503544.html), finds its cultural origins in precisely these cultural dynamics : if the ultimate arbiter of meaning resides within me , how can I be justly required to purchase something I do not want to purchase , or , for that matter , to do anything I do not wish to do ?
It ’s not difficult to see why Taylor worried that our “ ethics of authenticity ” might well lead to profound levels of social fragmentation , and a culture in which we find it virtually impossible to commit to projects that transcend the narrow interests of our individual selves .
If Taylor is correct , and we do in fact live in an age in which personal authenticity lies at the heart of our cultural ethos , then Gold ’s Gym is certainly “ more than a gym . ”
It is clearly “ a movement , ” one that thrives precisely because it asks of its members only what they already wish to give , and do , and be .
This may have been a serious error since double - digit growth of M3 during the US housing bubble gave clear warnings that the boom was out of control .
The sudden slowdown in M3 in early to mid-2008 - just as the Fed talked of raising rates - gave a second warning that the economy was about to go into a nosedive .
The United States earned a 3 - 1 victory over Australia in their final warm - up before the World Cup .
In a match replete with little defending , poor finishing by both sides , and David Beckham observing from the stands , the United States Men 's National Team used a first - half brace from Edson Buddle to defeat Australia 3 - 1 in both sides ' last warm - up before the 2010 World Cup .
Tim Cahill scored for the losing team that dominated possession and saw striker Joshua Blake Kennedy miss numerous opportunities .
Robbie Findley flubbed two chances at the empty net , while second - half substitute Herculez Gomez demonstrated his remarkable ability to tally in short order , converting Landon Donovan 's cross in second - half injury time .
It was a successful afternoon for the Americans , although questions about the health of Oguchi Onyewu remain unanswered .
Edson Buddle opened the scoring with an opportunistic tally in the fourth minute .
Vincenzo Grella was caught in possession just outside his 18 - yard box after pressure by Robbie Findley , then the Los Angeles Galaxy striker .
As his partner streaked toward the net , Buddle looked to pass , but instead took a touch to his right and blasted the Jabulani past Mark Schwarzer .
The tally provided Bob Bradley with more evidence that his untested attacking duo can make a difference on the international level .
It was a terrible give - away by the Socceroos , but Findley and Buddle looked calm and confident and the latter man finished well .
Findley somehow managed to miss an empty net in the 15th minute .
He did wonderfully to beat the offside trap and found himself released into space .
The MLS Cup - winning forward sidestepped an onrushing Schwarzer , only to shoot wide of the net 's gaping maw .
A miss like that could be the difference between advancing into the second round and going home early .
Tim Cahill showed why just minutes later .
Australia earned a corner kick as Clarence Goodson made a mess of a clearance , and Tim Howard 's teammate at Everton beat Clint Dempsey ( who looked to let up ) to the back post , then toe - poked the ball past the American goalkeeper .
Buddle doubled off a brilliant cross from Steve Cherundolo in the 31st minute .
Hannover 96's captain used a step - over to gain space on the right flank , and then served to the far post where the goal - scorer stood unmarked .
Unlike his partner , Buddle did n't miss .
It was a good build up for the Stars and Stripes , but the goal also came as a result of soft defending .
Dempsey and Craig Moore earned yellow cards in the 37th .
The American was lucky not to be sent of for retaliation after the defender 's perhaps dangerous tackle .
Bradley 's side , the recipient of soft red cards during the Confederations Cup , desperately needs to avoid those types of mental lapses if it expects to emerge from group play .
After the break , Marcus Hahnemann replaced Howard while Cahill came off in favor of Carl Valeri .
Kennedy needed to score moments after kickoff but could n't turn his hips square to the goal and watched his shot fly harmlessly wide .
The Americans nearly doubled their lead in the 52nd minute .
Donovan released Buddle who played the role of distributor after drawing Schwarzer out .
His chipped cross found Findley who demonstrated his scoring ineptitude by hitting the crossbar with a sliding effort .
The rebound fell to Michael Bradley but the Aussie keeper was equal to his effort , parrying the blast skyward .
Dempsey finally put the ball in the back of the net but the play was called offside .
Jonathan Bornstein removed captain Carlos Bocanegra in the 55th minute , while Dario Vidosic replaced Jason Culina and Onyewu took Clarence Goodson 's place six minutes later .
The A.C. Milan 's defender 's awkward first touch resulted in a corner for the opposition , and he looked uncomfortable during his half - hour stint .
Nikita Rukavytsya joined the match in the 72nd minute , ending Richard Garcia 's night .
Australia dominated possession throughout the middle part of the second stanza , but had nothing to show for their efforts .
Hahnemann appeared lost on a number of crosses although he made a series of impressive saves .
The performance hurts the English Premier League goalie as the American No. 2 position is presumably up for grabs before the World Cup kicks off .
Brad Guzan may be considered steadier .
Grella earned himself a yellow card in the 76th minute for a reckless challenge on Dempsey .
It was quite a hard tackle for a match played with little defensive intensity and perhaps it was the result of the Texan 's earlier antics .
Buddle walked off the pitch after a successful night in the 79th minute with DaMarcus Beasley earning his 92nd cap , while Herculez Gomez replaced Dempsey three minutes later .
The Mexican league 's leading scorer found himself on a 2 - on - 0 break with Findley after another wonderful throughball from Donovan , but scuffed his pass , immediately pointing to the pitch as if to blame its poor quality .
The Americans iced the match in injury time as Donovan once again showed his brilliant vision .
The squad 's all - time leading scorer feigned a shot , instead hitting a cross on the ground .
Gomez atoned for his earlier mistake , finishing from the six - yard box .
After the goal , Ricardo Clark left the pitch holding his upper hamstring and the whistle blew shortly thereafter﻿ .

Adding there were ways to deal with oil tanker accidents but not “ catastrophic ” blowouts in deep - water drilling , she said that there was a need “ to start now to get better prepared to deal with something of this magnitude in the future . ”
When it butts up against pandering on the 2nd Amendment , of course .
New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg 's appeal to what he called " common sense " at a congressional hearing Wednesday morning failed to sway two Republican senators who said that giving the government the ability to block the purchase of guns by suspected terrorists would undermine the Second Amendment 's right to bear arms .
" Should n't FBI agents have the authority to block sales of guns and explosives to those on the terror watchlists -- and deemed too dangerous to fly ?
I actually believe that they should , " Bloomberg told senators .
Federal law currently only allows the government to block guns sales for a very limited number of reasons , and being on that list is not one of them ....
But GOP Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lindsay Graham of South Carolina would n't go along .
Admitting that " at first blush " the bill " seems to be an obvious step that we should take , " Collins said that many people on the FBI 's watchlist do n't belong there .
" None of us wants a terrorist to be able to purchase a gun , but neither should we want to infringe upon a Constitutional right of law - abiding Americans , " she said .
Graham described the bill as an instrument of those who would ban guns altogether .
" We 're talking about a constitutional right here , " he said , explaining that he could not support a bill that would force " innocent Americans " to " pay the cost of going to court to get their gun rights back . "
Graham was n't nearly as concerned about rights when he launched into a disquisition on the treatment of American citizens accused of terrorism .
" I am all into national security , " he said .
" I want them to stop reading these guys Miranda rights . "
( CNN ) -- Fatima Mohamed , a 45 - year - old Somali immigrant living in America , was faced with a question most parents will never worry about :
Should my daughter be circumcised ?
The United States has outlawed female genital cutting , but cultural and religious pressures to circumcise girls linger among some African and Muslim immigrant families .
Mohamed says the decision was an easy one for her to make after going through the painful experience herself in Africa as a child .
She strongly opposes the idea of cutting her 11 - year - old daughter , an American - born Somali with long curly hair , who plays soccer and likes watching " American Idol . "
But not every family in her African community in Massachusetts feels that way .
Nor can they they swiftly make the decision to reject circumcising their daughters , because it 's a cultural ritual integral a woman 's identity , she says .
" They say they do n't want to hear it , " Mohamed says .
" Some think I 'm disrespecting my own culture .
Some will say , ' You act like an American now .
You forgot about who you are . ' "
Female genital cutting is often a coming - of - age ritual practiced in various parts of Africa , Asia and the Middle East , but the procedure is n't just invoking concerns in the developing world .
Religious and cultural beliefs fueling female circumcision often follow immigrants and refugees who move to America .
Rarely have cases of female genital cutting been documented in the U.S. , but much more likely , cutting has moved underground in the U.S. and overseas , advocacy groups and doctors say .
In the U.S. , an estimated 228,000 women have been cut -- or are at risk of being cut -- because they come from an ethnic community that practices female genital cutting , according an analysis of 2000 Census data conducted by the African Women 's Health Center at Brigham and Women 's Hospital .
The Census reports there are roughly 150 million women living in the United States .
The World Health Organization estimates up to 140 million women and children worldwide have been affected by female genital cutting .
The WHO defines female genital cutting as a process that alters or injures female genital organs for nonmedical purposes .
There are several types of female circumcision .
The most severe types require the inner or outer labia to be sewn together , a procedure performed in parts of Somalia and Egypt .
Other forms include excising the entire clitoris or part of the clitoris .
Genital cutting dates back at least 5,000 years , says Marianne Sarkis , a professor of international development at Clark University in Worcester , Massachusetts .
Some women desire the procedure because they believe they are dirty or unmarriageable if they are not cut , she said .
There are cultures that begin cutting women as early as infancy , while some wait until adolescence .
Communities divided
Not all families in communities where female genital cutting is commonplace will want to participate .
In Mohamed 's immigrant community in Massachusetts , families are divided , she says .
Some refuse to allow the procedure , as she does .
Others say they want it , and many remain silent .
Occurrences of the practice have been documented in the U.S.
In March , a Georgia mother was charged with female genital mutilation after the father noticed an infant 's genitals " appeared to be have been circumcised , " according to the Troup County Sheriff 's Office .
Officers would n't comment further on the family .
Several advocacy workers say the more common scenario involves sending girls back to their home country to have the ritual performed .
Over the past few years , Taina Bien - Aimé , president of the women 's advocacy group Equality Now , has heard several anecdotal stories of girls being sent back to have the procedure .
With summer vacation approaching , one 34 - year - old mother from Senegal , living in New York City , says she knows several African families in limbo about genital cutting .
One of her female friends abandoned her husband earlier this year when he asked for their 6 - year - old daughter to be cut in Africa this summer .
The friend , who speaks little English and is jobless , fled to a shelter with her daughter .
" A lot of them , it does n't matter if they [ the daughters ] were born here , they want the procedure done , " said the mother , who declined to be named out of fear of being ostracized by her community .
She was also cut in Africa as a child .
National surveys determining U.S. immigrant attitudes toward female genital cutting are nonexistent , because cutting affects few American families , advocacy groups say .
Neither have studies been completed to track whether parents are sending their girls to their country of origin to be circumcised .
Conducting such studies , doctors and advocacy groups say , would be near impossible since most families remain hushed about the taboo topic .
Legislators , doctors get involved
In response to suspicions of genital cutting being planned in the U.S. , Rep. Joseph Crowley , D - New York , and Rep. Mary Bono Mack , R- California , proposed an amendment to close a loophole in the 1996 federal law banning female genital mutilation .
The legislation , introduced in April , would criminalize parents who force their daughters to have the procedure abroad .
This spring , the American Academy of Pediatrics released a contentious policy statement suggesting that some physicians who work with immigrant communities that want the procedure should have the ability to prick or nick a girl 's clitoral skin in order to " satisfy cultural requirements . "
The academy says the pricking procedure is harmless , like an ear piercing .
The pricking method is illegal in United States , but it could be effective in certain African communities in reducing harm , said Douglas S. Diekema , a Washington physician and former chair of the bioethics committee at the academy .
" We are very disappointed , " said Asmaa Donahue , senior program officer at the Sauti Yetu Center for African Women in New York .
" By offering to a person to do it , it undermines the education and advocacy work being done to stop it . "
Despite the mixed feelings about the pricking procedure , both advocates and the American Academy of Pediatrics agree that the pressure for American girls in some immigrant communities to undergo genital cutting is a reality .
" It 's naive to think they do n't have some equivalent of a Jewish mohel , " or person who performs a circumcision , said Diekema , the academy 's former bioethics chairman .
" Not all circumcisions are done in the medical setting , either . "
Reaching out to the immigrant community
Soraya Mire , a Somali film director and activist , works with the African immigrant population in the U.S. and knows that the pressures exist .
Her 1994 documentary " Fire Eyes " chronicles her experiences with female circumcision when she was 13 .
From her Los Angeles , California , home , Mire has counseled hundreds of genital cutting survivors and immigrant parents by letters and phone calls , including a few who have contemplated sending their daughters abroad to be cut .
She sleeps with her cell phone tucked under her pillow , so she can answer at all hours .
" You do n't have a right to do this to your children , " Mire tells the immigrant community .
" You are continuing the abuse . "
Mire has received death threats from the Somali community .
Some threats stem from her role in helping law enforcement officials in Atlanta , Georgia , prosecute the first case of female circumcision in the U.S.
In 2006 , Khalid Adem was convicted of aggravated battery and cruelty to children for cutting the genitals of his 2 - year - old Ethiopian daughter .
He is incarcerated and tentatively eligible for parole in 2012 .
Back in Massachusetts , Fatima Mohamed 's recollection of the genital cutting at her grandmother 's rural Kenya home is clear :
Her grandmother 's wise voice telling her the procedure was for her own good .
Sitting in a chair as the strange women pulled her legs apart .
The pain of the incisions .
She was only 9 years old .
" I just thought it was something that had to be done , " said Mohamed , who added that she was lucky because many Somali women undergo more severe circumcisions in which their labia are sewn together .
" They go through hell , " she said .
Mohamed , too , is reaching out to Somali women in her Massachusetts community .
The first step to eliminating the genital cutting , she knows , is discussing the topic .
She spearheaded an organization last year called the East African Community Outreach , where part of her job is educating women about the dangers of genital cutting .
Her 11 - year - old daughter is too young to comprehend genital cutting , Mohamed says .
Instead , they discuss her daughter 's dreams to become a pediatrician .
Perhaps in a few years , Mohamed will tell her the truth .
" I would never do it to my daughter , " she said .
" I do n't want it .
This has nothing to do with religion or culture .
I believe nobody should control my child . "

Yunnan hit by severe drought :
With fish already like this , what can people do ?
In Luliang County of Qujiang City of Yunnan province , a fish buried in mud has its mouth wide open trying desperately to breath .
Unfortunately , it is already dead , though it is frozen in swimming posture .
Everywhere within the cracks of the dried - up lake bed are little fish that have met misfortune .
Leaving water - rich Nanchang , this journalist who is originally from Qujing City of Yunnan Province yesterday headed to the Dege Haizi Reservoir in Luliang County , the location of the drought .
He stood transfixed by what he saw .
This reservoir , once a 1.60 - million cubic meter water body , is now utterly dried up , with palm - width cracks spreading all over its parched lake bed , some running as deep as 50 cm .
A villager surnamed Zhang sighed , “ Over the past 40 years , this lake has never dried up . ”
When the lake dried up , villagers came and took away the large fish .
The smaller ones , took a desperately dove into the mud , eventually dying slowly as the lake ’s water vanished .
Seeing it is heartbreaking .
Luliang county , the No.1 plain and largest irrigation district in Yunnan , is always claimed as the granary / bread - basket of Yunnnan .
Nanpan River , flowing through Luliang , is the upper reach of Zhujiang River .
Up till yesterday , the area had had 126 consecutive days without precipitation / rainfall .
99 % of the county ’s sown area is affected by this severe drought , totaling 529,9000 mu [ 1 mu = 0.0667 hectares ] .
That day , the sky was covered with clouds , but according to the area ’s weather forecast , rainfall over the next few days is not clear , and the severe drought may continue .

The state ’s Board of Registered Nursing has discovered that some 3,500 of its nurses have been punished for misconduct by other states — hundreds even had their licenses revoked — while maintaining clean licenses in California .
As many as 2,000 of these nurses now will face discipline in California , officials estimate .
That ’s more registered nurses than the state has sanctioned in the last four years combined .
The board ’s discovery was prompted by a Times / ProPublica investigation last year that found hundreds of instances in which California nurses had been sanctioned elsewhere for sexual abuse , neglect , rampant drug use and criminality but could work freely in California .
The “ massive ” onslaught of new disciplinary cases is going to be “ a very significant challenge , ” said Paul Riches , a deputy director for the state Department of Consumer Affairs , which oversees the agencies that license and police health professionals .
Advertisement
After last year ’s report in The Times , California ran its list of 376,000 active and inactive nurses against a database maintained by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing , to which nearly all states voluntarily report their disciplinary actions .
Among the matches were nurses who had been disciplined by multiple states , sometimes for the same incident .
California officials said they could n’t disclose the names of any nurses who turned up in the search until a formal disciplinary charge is filed in this state .
While those cases are pending , the nurses remain free to practice in California .
Nurses are not required to inform the board when and where they are working , but officials said they would file emergency petitions to suspend nurses from practicing if they believed there was a public safety threat .
A review of disciplinary records by reporters easily found cases involving current California - licensed nurses , some reflecting serious misconduct .
Among them :
Advertisement
? Marci Nablo , who surrendered her Florida nursing license in 2007 after admitting that she stole the painkiller Fentanyl from patients ’ pain pumps , replaced it with saline and injected the drug under her tongue .
She also was accused of paying a hospital janitor for urine and hiding it in her bra so she could pass a drug test .
After she stole drugs in Pennsylvania , her license in that state was suspended in 2008 .
? Karen Vivian , whose license was suspended by Nebraska in 2008 after she made nine medication errors , including putting ear drops into a patient ’s eye .
A mental health exam found that she had bipolar disorder that “ made her vulnerable in the work environment , ” board records said .
A year later , she also surrendered her Minnesota license .
? Gregory Ashmore , whose Tennessee license was revoked in 2002 after he engaged in sexual intercourse with a patient at the mental health facility where he worked .
Ashmore , who lives in the Northern California town of Fairfield , declined to comment on his case .
But when asked whether he should have been disciplined by California , he said it was up to the nursing board to decide .

Vivian lives in Nebraska and is not working as a nurse .
But she said she ’d thought about moving to California , where her license remains clean .
She said California should know about every case involving one of its nurses , even though she considers hers less serious than drug - using nurses or those with criminal records .
“ Why do n’t they check the national databank ? ” she asked .
“ They can get the information the same way you did ....
If I ’m a patient , I would want to know . ”
Nablo could not be reached for comment .

California ’s nursing board has historically done little to check whether its nurses were running into trouble anywhere .
Until late 2008 , the state did not require nurses , when renewing their licenses , to reveal whether they ’d been disciplined elsewhere .
The board checked their records against the national council ’s database of disciplinary actions only when they initially applied for a California license .
Board President Ann Boynton said the board now plans to pay the national council to run checks of California nurses on a quarterly basis .
The risks of not checking can be serious .
The Times / ProPublica investigation detailed cases in which nurses sanctioned in another state moved to California and were later accused of misconduct .
Nurse Beverley Cathey , for instance , came to California after being put on probation in North Carolina in November 2006 for failing to account for drugs she ’d signed out , falsifying records and providing negligent care .
Four Los Angeles - area hospitals filed six complaints against her in August and September of 2007 , according to records from a temporary staffing firm that hired Cathey .
The California board did not file a public accusation against her license until August 2009 , nearly two years after North Carolina indefinitely suspended her .

The nursing board has struggled to address a host of problems identified in last year ’s news report .
The priority has been to reduce the time it takes to discipline errant caregivers — from the more than three years reported in the Times / ProPublica investigation to less than 18 months .
Until recently , nurses had been able to keep working — and getting in trouble — as complaints languished .
After the stories in The Times , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger replaced the majority of the nursing board ’s members and ordered broad changes in oversight of all health professionals .
His budget request for more than 30 staffers to cut the board ’s discipline backlog is pending in the Legislature .
Board staff had said they needed nearly double that .
Advertisement
“ It ’s going to be a lot on our staff , ” said board President Boynton , referring to 2,000 new cases .
Officials say the cases are going to be handled separately from the hundreds already being investigated or adjudicated .
The attorney general ’s office is creating teams of attorneys in Northern and Southern California to handle the additional caseload .
These new cases should be easier to process because the alleged misconduct has been investigated and adjudicated elsewhere .
But the state still needs to collect records from across the country and ensure that the investigations meet California standards , officials said .
The costs can be absorbed within the nursing board ’s existing budget , which is funded by licensing fees , officials said .
The attorneys will focus first on the 1,743 nurses whose licenses are active in California .
The licenses of more than 430 in this group have been revoked , suspended or surrendered in other states .
Advertisement
The state plans to flag the licenses of the remaining 1,720 nurses whose status is inactive , in case they attempt to renew them .
Other states routinely do more to learn if their nurses are getting in trouble elsewhere .
Thirty - seven states and the District of Columbia provide the names of all of their nurses — whether they ’ve been disciplined or not — to the national council ’s database so that if any nursing board takes action against a nurse , the other participating states can be quickly alerted .
But because California and 12 other states do n’t participate , it ’s difficult for regulators elsewhere to know if they should alert those states .
Nonparticipating states license more than 40 % of the nation ’s 3.5 million registered nurses .
California also has a financial incentive not to submit its names .
The state makes money by charging nurses a fee to verify their licenses , test scores and training when authorities in other states call for information .
Advertisement
For example , a nurse licensed in California who wants credentials to practice in Arizona must pay California $ 60 to confirm her background .
Those sorts of checks netted California nearly $ 1 million in fiscal 2009 .

The Rolling Stone piece by Michael Hastings has some excellent color about McChrystal ’s interactions with the troops and the rocket - fuel of those controversial quotes .
Otherwise , it ’s pretty lackluster and very anti-war .
This is hilarious over - writing about McChrystal : “ His slate - blue eyes have the unsettling ability to drill down when they lock on you .
If you ’ve f—- ed up or disappointed him , they can destroy your soul without the need for him to raise his voice . ”
Destroy your soul ?
It takes a special brand of shamelessness to accuse someone of “ over - writing ” after having just seconds before described a series of significant quotes as “ rocket - fuel . ”
This is doubly true when the shameless writer in question is perhaps best known for the following passage , which may qualify as the most worthless bit of commentary from the very 2008 election news cycle that so disgusted Hastings :
Palin too projects through the screen like crazy .
I ’m sure I ’m not the only male in America who , when Palin dropped her first wink , sat up a little straighter on the couch and said , “ Hey , I think she just winked at me . ”
And her smile .
By the end , when she clearly knew she was doing well , it was so sparkling it was almost mesmerizing .
It sent little starbursts through the screen and ricocheting around the living rooms of America .
This is a quality that ca n’t be learned ; it ’s either something you have or you do n’t , and man , she ’s got it . ”
Incidentally , this telling bit of zeta - male - ish output was interspersed with several years of objections from Lowry and his associates to the effect that Obama ’s fans were merely “ starstruck ” by a telegenic empty suit .
More telling is Lowry ’s dismissal of an extraordinarily important article as “ anti-war . ”
I look forward to the point at which National Review , which remains an exceedingly Catholic entity , realizes that the Pope is also “ anti- war ” in this and most other contexts and thereby concludes that it would be shameful to continue to cast aspersions on others for holding views they tolerate in their beloved representative of God on Earth .
I also look forward to being made Pope myself .
I am a tremendous optimist for someone who has grown up amid the twilight of American competence .
But now I am engaging in a bit of over - writing myself , for which I apologize to Mr. Lowry , fond admirer of little starbursts .
Now I shall retract my apology in the face of the following statement , delivered after Lowry had finally deigned to read the silly magazine that scooped his own :
I ’ve now read the piece which — as you might expect — is very defeatist .
One might expect that any article which puts forth the plain facts of what is happening in a war that National Review and even a great many liberal pundits declared to have ended in victory some seven years ago might appear defeatist to the very people who have since been proven not just wrong , but ludicrously and repeatedly wrong , time and time again , on this very subject .
It sounds defeatist because it describes a situation that has evolved into a slow and almost inevitable defeat by the initial standards of the very people who demanded it .
Speaking of “ defeatism ” — so clearly the exclusive province of radical liberals who wish to see the U.S. fail in its failed expeditions — let us , for no particular reason , take a look back at something National Review founder William Buckley wrote a few years ago :
One ca n’t doubt that the American objective in Iraq has failed .
Clearly this long - haired Buckley fellow is a defeatist and ought to be ignored .
Perhaps he submitted the essay in question to Rolling Stone before running it in his own magazine ?
At any rate , this pronouncement that no one can doubt our failure in Iraq is rather strange , coming at a time when several of Buckley ’s own writers remained amusingly hopeful that real victory was still attainable — as many of them still do today — but then the late fellow can be forgiven for not having at that point been in the habit of reading his own magazine .
I myself am a subscriber and find myself constantly distracted by the ads , many of which are written to look like articles and which routinely conjure up dubious global financial entities in order to convince the publication ’s readers to buy coins in exchange for some unspecified number of payments in order that they might also receive a free safe .
Advertisers know their audience , naturally .
But let me attempt to refute two more of Lowry ’s commonplace objections without this time stopping to insult thousands of other people in the process :
For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
Dick Cheney has n’t made much time for television appearances lately .
But in the weeks since the Deepwater Horizon unleashed a torrent of oil on the Gulf of Mexico , his name has been creeping back into the press .
“ The truth is that right now we have precisely the regulatory system that the Bush - Cheney administration wanted : full of loopholes , full of cronies and lobbyists filling the very agencies that are supposed to be overseeing the industry , ” liberal commentator Arianna Huffington said on ABC’s This Week last Sunday .
Cheney ’s daughter , Liz , was on hand to defend her father .
“ Arianna , I do n’t know what planet you live on , ” she shot back .
“ What you are saying has no relationship to the truth , no relationship to the facts . ”
The reality is a lot more complicated than that .
Many of the policy and regulatory failures that laid the groundwork for the BP catastrophe can be traced back to the Bush - Cheney era .
But so far , this question has received relatively little attention — mostly because the task force that developed the former administration ’s energy policy operated in extreme secrecy .
Did the task force ’s decisions play a role in the BP spill ?
And could the Gulf disaster finally provoke new scrutiny of the task force ’s clandestine workings ?
The energy task force was created days after onetime oilman George W. Bush took office in 2001 , and was headed by Cheney , a former CEO at Halliburton , one of the world ’s largest providers of oilfield products and services .
For months , the task force solicited input on US energy policy .
On May 16 , 2001 , the group issued its final report , which was submitted to Congress in June .
But the participants and details of the discussions were kept tightly under wraps .
The open - government group Judicial Watch tried to pry details of the task force ’s deliberations from the administration in June , arguing that the sessions qualified as public information under the Federal Advisory Committee Act and the open - meetings law .
The US General Accounting Office ( GAO ) , the investigative arm of Congress , also sought information on which industry executives and lobbyists had attended the gatherings .
But in the first of many clashes over presidential secrecy , the White House rejected those requests , arguing that it was entitled to conduct the meetings behind closed doors thanks to executive privilege .
Judicial Watch and the Sierra Club sued , but the Supreme Court ultimately sided with the administration .
Though some information has trickled out in the years since , the vast majority of the task force ’s deliberations remain hidden from the public eye .
Here ’s what we know about the task force and offshore drilling .
The Natural Resources Defense Council , an environmental group , was able to obtain 13,500 pages of heavily redacted documents that gave a glimpse into the role industry leaders played in shaping the administration ’s policies ( NRDC also got a list of the documents ( PDF ) that the administration refused to turn over ) .
In July 2007 , the Washington Post got a list of the roughly 300 groups and individuals who met with task force staffers and , in some cases , Cheney himself .
BP officials were among those who “ gave detailed energy policy recommendations ” to the administration , though when that fact came to light , the company refused to comment on those meetings .
We still do n’t know what specific policy areas BP execs weighed in on .
Perhaps it ’s little surprise that BP recently hired Cheney ’s former press secretary , a public defender of the secret task force , to help the company with crisis communication after the spill .
But we do have a few more details about other oil industry players in the talks .
Chevron ’s CEO contributed a detailed list ( PDF ) of ways in which the government could “ eliminate federal barriers to increased energy supplies ” — many of which were incorporated in the task force ’s final report .
This included recommendations to ease federal permitting rules for energy development and a request that the administration support opening up new areas of the eastern Gulf of Mexico for offshore oil and gas development .
Doing so , wrote Chevron CEO David O’Reilly , would “ demonstrate a commitment to reject unjustified opposition to new energy leasing and development . ”
The American Petroleum Institute offered its own long list of suggestions for energy policy .
A March 20 , 2001 , email from API to an official at the Energy Department included a draft executive order calling for all federal agencies to issue a detailed statement on any regulatory action that “ adversely affects energy supply , distribution or use . ”
It was nearly identical to the order Bush issued just two months later .
Many of the recommendations from the task force report were adopted in the 2005 Energy Policy Act .
That legislation provided $ 6 billion in subsidies for oil and gas development .
Royalty payments for oil and gas development were waived in several regions of the US .
Some companies were allowed to pay royalties with oil , rather than money — a less transparent system that was more vulnerable to abuse .
The bill also provided $ 1.5 billion in direct payments to companies to incentivize drilling in deepwater wells , and curtailed the power of states to oversee oil and gas exploration off their coasts under the Coastal Zone Management Act .
In addition , the bill weakened environmental protections for offshore drilling , making it easier to exclude a broad range of exploration and drilling activities from analysis under the National Environmental Policy Act .
This has been cited as the reason that the Deepwater Horizon site was not subjected to a thorough environmental analysis .
The task force ’s final report also presented a rosy picture of the offshore drilling industry .
Newer oil and gas drilling methods , it said , “ practically eliminate spills from offshore platforms ” and “ enhance worker safety , lower risk of blowouts , and provide better protection of groundwater resources . ”
The report advocated lifting the moratorium on portions of the outer continental shelf , noting that “ concerns over the potential impacts of oil spills have been a major factor behind imposition of the OCS moratoria . ”
Bush lifted the executive moratorium in 2008 , and the Democratic - controlled Congress allowed its own moratorium to expire .
But there ’s a lot we still do n’t know .
The task force recommendations included scaling back regulations and oversight of offshore drilling while expanding incentive programs and access to resources , many of which would come to pass in future legislation .
But how much the task force may have guided decisions at federal agencies — in particular the notoriously lax Minerals Management Service ( MMS ) — is unclear .
The administration ’s directives across the agencies actively discouraged any regulations or oversight that might hinder development of resources .
Among the many questions is what role the task force may have played in a 2003 decision by the MMS not to require offshore rigs to install an acoustic shut - off switch , a remote - controlled backup system that seals off an underwater well even if the rig above is destroyed .
Countries like Norway and Brazil require this precaution , and MMS considered doing the same .
But oil companies complained that the $ 500,000 devices were too expensive and , they argued , ineffective .
Ultimately , MMS made the switches optional .
The Deepwater Horizon was not outfitted with such a device , which could have prevented the spill .
Other concerns include a failure to implement new cementing policies or act on known concerns about key components on drilling rigs .
The Department of Justice has launched criminal and civil investigations into the disaster , while a presidential commission is looking into both the spill and offshore drilling policy in general .
That commission currently lacks subpoena power , though there ’s an effort underway in Congress to grant the commission that power .
Numerous congressional committees have also launched probes of the spill .
A congressional aide working for one of those committees indicated that there has been some discussion of revisiting the task force in those investigations , though no concrete steps to do so have been taken .
Open government advocates say this might be the appropriate time to push for more information about his task force .
Mandy Smithberger , an investigator at the Project on Government Oversight , says that it ’s “ definitely a ripe time ” to find out more about what went on in the meetings .
“ I do n’t think you can understand how we got to where we are without looking back , ” she says .
“ When you have a disaster of this magnitude , it raises the question , if in this whole secretive process , what was discussed , how much did the Bush administration ignore , how much did they allow the oil and gas industry to basically do what they wanted , ” says AnneWeismann , chief counsel at Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington .
“ Secrecy is so pernicious that it can continue to damage even when the administration is not in power . ”

Virgin Media has said it is " crunch time " for broadband as it gears up to offer speeds of up to 400 M bps ( megabits per second ) .
Virgin Media 's director of broadband Jon James said 100 M bps would be available by the end of the year .
And the company has 400 M bps - ready modems and routers in the pipeline .
Virgin Media hopes to extend its network to reach out to another million customers , using overhead cables .
400 Mbps data transfer is fast enough to download an album in around a second , or a high - definition movie in around two minutes .
" We have a big fat dial to give more capacity to customers and there will be a steady series of upgrades , " said Mr James .
He said that consumers are beginning to want more out of their connections .
" The crunch point is coming .
There is a step - change in what people are trying to do with their broadband connection . "
In terms of the usage that will drive faster speeds , Virgin Media envisaged a future where cloud computing , currently the preserve of businesses , comes to the living room .
" It would take people 's IT problems away .
Homework , photos , films would all live in the cloud and people would n't have to worry about the capabilities of their machine , " said Kevin Baughan , director of technical strategy at Virgin Media .
Coupled with 3D multi-player gaming and home working , it should create demand for faster services , he said .
And consumer teleconferencing could also feature as a killer app .
" It has been oversold for so long but now we are actually doing it , " said Mr James .
Telegraph poles
The UK government is keen to see the private sector increase its broadband footprint in rural areas .
As part of its attempt to fulfil that brief , Virgin Media is looking at rolling out broadband via existing overhead cables .
It is experimenting in the Berkshire village of Woolhampton , where it has built its own poles to provide residents with speeds of 50 Mbps .
It estimates it can reach a further one million customers using existing overhead cables .
Laying down the gauntlet to rival BT , Mr James said the telco 's technology had hit a " cul - de-sac " .
" No - one can match us on speed .
BT Infinity is a cul - de-sac .
Its 25 M bps average is kind of the limit , " he said .
Upstream speeds
But BT denied that the need for speed was due to accelerate any time soon .
" DSL speeds are increasing all the time so it is silly to suggest that there is a crunch point coming , " said a spokesman .
" There are no services today which require 50 or 100 M bps but there may be in the future which is why BT is investing £ 2.5 billion in faster broadband , " he added .
Virgin Media has been criticised for offering slow upstream speeds , crucial for those who want to create and upload content on to the web .
" Upstream speeds are going to become increasingly important and that 's where BT 's fibre network has the real advantage over others , " said the BT spokesman .
Virgin Media revealed it does plan to notch up its upstream speeds later this year .
" Currently upstream speeds are far down the list of priorities when we do customer research .
They can't see the applications for it , " said Mr James .
Palin accuses environmentalists of endangering the Earth because they wo n't allow drilling in ANWR :
Extreme deep water drilling is not the preferred choice to meet our country ’s energy needs , but your protests and lawsuits and lies about onshore and shallow water drilling have locked up safer areas .
It ’s catching up with you .
The tragic , unprecedented deep water Gulf oil spill proves it .
...
There ’s nothing clean and green about your misguided , nonsensical radicalism , and Americans are on to you as we question your true motives .
Chait picked apart this argument when Krauthammer made it last week .
He gives Palin the same treatment .

Abstract
This paper explores SB 1070 , the 2010 Arizona law creating several new immigration - related crimes in the Arizona code and imposing a set of duties on Arizona law enforcement agencies and officers , some enforceable by private suit .
We lay out the main features of the statute , show how they fit in to current Arizona and federal law , and are in many respects novel .
We also explore some of the interpretive and constitutional issues presented by particular sections of the law .
We emphasize that our views are necessarily preliminary .
To understand this bill requires the expertise of one half of a law school faculty , since issues arise about both structural and substantive constitutional law , immigration law , criminal law , criminal procedure , state and local government law , and other fields .
Further , SB 1070 includes many provisions whose interpretation is open to a range of interpretations .
Accordingly , we invite comments and rejoinders to this analysis .
On Thursday , Al Jazeera English broadcast an interview with Jamal Elshayyal , one of the channel ’s journalists who was on board the Mavi Marmara on Monday when it was intercepted by Israeli commandos enforcing a naval blockade on Gaza .
In his account of the start of the raid , which left nine activists dead and has sparked calls for an independent investigation , Mr. Elshayyal insisted that the Israelis had fired live ammunition at the ship from the air before commandos landed on the boat and said that he had seen someone shot and killed by a bullet that hit the top of his head .
He said , in part :
As soon as this attack started , I was on the top deck and within just a few minutes there were live shots being fired from above the ship , from above , from where the helicopters were . [… ]
The first shots that were fired were either some sort of sound grenades , there was some tear gas that was fired as well as rubber - coated bullets .
They were fired initially and the live bullets came roughly about five minutes after that .
Asked if the shots fired at the ship by the Israeli forces had seemed to come from ships nearby or the helicopters above , Mr. Elshayyal said :
It was evident there was definitely fire from the air , because one of the people who was killed was clearly shot from above — he was shot , the bullet targeted him at the top of his head .
There was also fire coming from the sea as well .
Most of the fire initially from the sea was tear gas canisters , sound grenades , but then it became live fire .
After I finished filing that last report and I was going down below deck one of the passengers who was on the side of the deck holding a water hose — trying to hose off , if you will , the advancing Israeli navy — was shot in his arm by soldiers in the boats below . [ … ]
There is no doubt from what I saw that live ammunition was fired before any Israeli soldier was on deck .
What I saw , the sequence of events that took place , there was a pool camera , so reporters took it in turns to file , so after I had done my first file , I turned around to see what was going on and there were several shots fired .
In fact , one of the helicopters at the front of the ship , you could almost see the soldiers pointing their guns down through some sort of hole or compartment at the bottom side of the helicopter and firing almost indiscriminately without even looking where they were firing .
And those bullets were definitely live bullets .
Mr. Elshayyal ’s account , of course , is only one part of the puzzle , and it will not be accepted easily by people who see his network as biased against Israel .
That said , now that the accounts of activists and journalists who were detained by Israel after the raid are starting to be heard , it is clear that their stories and that of the Israeli military do not match in many ways .
On Thursday , Today ’s Zaman , an English - language newspaper in Turkey , reported that the president of the Turkish aid group that helped to organize the flotilla said that a photographer working for the group “ was shot in the forehead by a soldier one meter away from him . ”
Bulent Yildirimhe , the president of the aid organization Insani Yardim Vakfi ( known in English as the I.H.H. ) , told the newspaper on Thursday after he returned from Israel : “ Our Cevdet [ Kiliclar ] , he is a press member .
He has become a martyr .
All he was doing was taking pictures .
They smashed his skull into pieces . ”
The newspaper added :
Kevin Ovenden of Britain , an activist on the ship that arrived in İstanbul on Thursday , also said a man who had pointed a camera at the soldiers was shot directly through the forehead with live ammunition , with the exit wound blowing away back of his skull .
In another report , the newspaper said that Israeli officials had confiscated images taken by one of its photographers in the flotilla :
A photojournalist from Today ’s Zaman Kursat Bayhan who was on board an international aid convoy for Gaza said he tried to hide a flash disk which included the photos from the moments of Israeli attack on the convoy under his tongue to prevent Israeli authorities from seizing it but his effort failed during a medical examination .
The report added , “ Bayhan said the journalists in the ship including him tried to protect the video footage and photos they took , ” after the ships were seized by Israeli commandos , but “ all the materials of the press members , including their passports and identity cards , were taken away . ”
The way these accounts diverge from that of Israel ’s military would seem to make an independent investigation into the events crucial .
That is particularly true since , as The Lede noted on Wednesday , Israel is apparently in possession of much more video evidence than it has yet released .
In a post making the case that Israel should not conduct that inquiry , Noam Sheizaf , an Israeli journalist and blogger , pointed out that journalists in the flotilla seem to have left Israeli custody without any of the video they shot during the raid that might bolster their accounts .
After years of being the little guy who used Washington to fend off Goliaths like Microsoft , Apple CEO Steve Jobs is about to learn what life is like when the shoe ’s on the other foot .
According to a person familiar with the matter , the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission are locked in negotiations over which of the watchdogs will begin an antitrust inquiry into Apple ’s new policy of requiring software developers who devise applications for devices such as the iPhone and iPad to use only Apple ’s programming tools .
Regulators , this person said , are days away from making a decision about which agency will launch the inquiry .
It will focus on whether the policy , which took effect last month , kills competition by forcing programmers to choose between developing apps that can run only on Apple gizmos or come up with apps that are platform neutral , and can be used on a variety of operating systems , such as those from rivals Google , Microsoft and Research In Motion .
An inquiry does n’t necessarily mean action will be taken against Apple , which argues the rule is in place to ensure the quality of the apps it sells to customers .
Typically , regulators initiate inquiries to determine whether a full - fledged investigation ought to be launched .
If the inquiry escalates to an investigation , the agency handling the matter would issue Apple a subpoena seeking information about the policy .
Officials at both the Justice Department and FTC declined comment .
Apple did not return calls seeking comment .
The threat of Apple being the subject of an investigation would be a remarkable turnabout for a company that has long seen itself as being outside the establishment , and one that has egged on antitrust officials to blunt the momentum of larger rivals .
However , thanks to the popularity of the iPod and iPhone , Apple is having a tough time continuing to play the role of David fighting against Goliath .
Indeed , its market cap of $ 237.6 billion exceeds that of the world ’s largest retailer , Wal - Mart , whose market cap is $ 201.7 billion .
Apple put its might on full display last week when Jobs wrote a scathing explanation for why Adobe ’s Flash programming language was unfit to be used on Apple products .
The day his missive was released , Adobe shares fell 2 percent .
In forcing computer programmers to choose developing an Apple - exclusive app over one that can be used on Apple and rival devices simultaneously , critics say Apple is hampering competition since the expense involved in creating an app will lead developers with limited budgets to focus on one format , not two .
Generally , app developers are paid from a cut of the revenue generated when consumers buy the app .
Shaun Meredith , a former Apple employee who runs software development company InfoBridge , said that as a result of Apple ’s rule change , some of his customers are choosing to finance apps that are compatible with all of Apple ’s competitors instead of those that work only with the iPhone or iPad .
Indeed , though Apple has the most applications , it is a distant second in terms of operating system market share .
According to comScore , RIM , which makes the BlackBerry , has a 42 percent share , while Apple ’s take is 25 percent .
Microsoft has 15 percent and Google ’s Android software has 9 percent .

Architecture
is a tricky thing to convey in museums , because it ’s usually resigned to photos ,
blueprints , and weird little models .
Which can be about as
interesting as watching paint dry .
So London ’s Victoria & Albert asked architects to throw up
structures in the museum itself .
The result : 1:1 – Architects Build Small Spaces
displays seven real , live mini- buildings that , as the press materials
tell us , “ push the boundaries and possibilities of creative practice . ”
The theme is refuges .
That ’s obvious enough in Sou Fujimoto Architects ’s acrylic cube ( top ) , an abstraction of a tree that looks like a giant princess - cut diamond , and one of Terunobu Fujimori ‘s whimsical teahouses ( an old example below , and then video of the new project being built ) .
Helen
& Hard Architects axed ash trees from a forest
in their native Norway to make this exuberant pavilion , which
references both Norse folklore and British garden folly from the 18th
century ( back in those quaint , pre-InterWeb times when putting odd crap in your backyard counted as high entertainment ) .
Not
everything ’s a refuge in the strict sense of the word , this being
architecture about “ pushing boundaries and possibilities . ”
Consider the contribution from Studio Mumbai Architects .
It ’s the cast of a sliver of a hovel
that ’s tucked into a narrow corridor behind the firm ’s offices and
peopled by a family of eight .
Sounds more like a domestic war zone than a
sanctuary , but according to the project description , unauthorized dwellings
of this sort “ offer intelligent design solutions ” in a place , where
scarce land and skyrocketing real estate prices conspire against the
city ’s poorest residents .
“ As well as shelter , they provide spaces
for refuge , contemplation and worship , ” we ’re told .

Team America is Rural Studio , the Auburn U architecture
program that lets schlubby college students cobble together buildings in
the backwoods of Alabama .

look like a refuge in , well , the backwoods of Alabama .
Image caption Ronay booked into hotels and restaurants using an assumed name
Restaurant critic Egon Ronay has died at the age of 94 after a short illness .
Ronay , who was born in Hungary in 1915 , wrote his first guidebook in 1956 after managing several restaurants and contributing to the Daily Telegraph .
He continued to publish the books for three decades , helping to usher in the era of restaurant reviews .
Paying tribute , Michelin - starred celebrity chef Raymond Blanc said Ronay was a visionary who had pushed up " the standard of British cuisine " .
Ronay died on Saturday morning at his Berkshire home with his wife and two daughters by his side , said close friend and broadcaster Nick Ross .
" He was , in the most literal sense , incredible , right up until the last few weeks of his life - he was sharp as a button , " said Ross , who had known the writer for 15 to 20 years .
" We went for a tasting with him four months ago and he had this remarkable ability to taste flavours in anything .
" Right up until his death , even young chefs regarded him as the monarch . "
Blanc said winning Ronay 's Restaurant of the Year award in 1978 , for Le Manoir aux Quat ' Saisons in Oxfordshire , " changed his life " .
He said : " [ Ronay ] was meticulous , he was a visionary and he knew what gastronomy should be .
" There 's no doubt that he had a huge , huge influence and he helped British chefs to believe in themselves . "
Ronay was the son of a prominent restaurateur in Budapest whose businesses were destroyed during and after World War II .
Penniless
Ronay escaped from communist Hungary in 1946 and arrived in London as a penniless refugee .
He went on to manage several restaurants before opening his own establishment in 1952 , the Marquee in Knightsbridge , serving classic French dishes that were almost unheard of in post - war Britain .
Television chef Fanny Craddock raved about the place and persuaded Ronay to write a food column for the Daily Telegraph .
Image caption
His often scathing criticism is credited with helping improve UK catering
He sold his restaurant in 1955 to concentrate on his writing , and Egon Ronay 's Guide to Hotels and Restaurants arrived the following year .
The guidebook was inspired by France 's Michelin restaurant guides .
" Everybody looked at his guides , " celebrity chef Phil Vickery told BBC News .
" He really did make everyone stand up and say , ' Oh my goodness , are we selling good food or not ? ' "
Vickery added : " He was a very successful restaurateur in his own right .
" He knew his stuff .
I think very few people these days understand cooking fully , or understand the process .
" Coming from that background , he knew exactly what to say and what to do . "
Threat of exposure
Ronay produced the books , with the help of a team of inspectors , for 30 years - never accepting a free meal .
" I think the guides certainly have had the effect , particularly in mass catering , of telling people that they could no longer get away with murder - because I would expose them , " Ronay once said .
" My aim was to improve catering standards and having seen the way the Michelin guides worked I felt a guide was the best way .
" I never considered it a business and only made money out of the guides when I sold them . "
He sold the guidebooks to the AA in 1985 , but regained the rights to the books in court in the late 90s after arguing that the company 's actions were in danger of tarnishing his name .
Restaurant critic Michael Winner said Ronay was " humble " but the " greatest food critic ever " .
" He surpassed all the supercilious , arrogant , position - seeking food critics we have at the moment .
He had a great heart , great dignity and great warmth .
" He was a true expert and I admired him beyond belief .
He was superior to us all .
" I was very sad to hear of his death . "
Katherine Mansfield , the Victorian short - story writer , suffered a number of afflictions in her short life : tuberculosis ; weariness of her homeland , New Zealand ; and quite possibly men , though she harbored quite a few of them over the years , and even married two .
But it was women she seemed most interested in : they are often her strongest characters , as well as her closest friends , mentors and most cherished lovers .
Women seemed to have provided Mansfield the most calm in 34 years of disease , depression , wanderlust and romantic tumult .
Katherine Mansfield
As these things tend to go , Mansfield amassed a large amount of very good writing while “ living fast , ” as the British novelist Ali Smith put it in the Telegraph a few years ago , in marking the release of Penguin Classics Collected Stories of Katherine Mansfield .
Even her childhood was interesting enough to inspire the work of her contemporary D.H. Lawrence , who is said to have modeled parts of The Rainbow , as well as Women in Love ’s Gudrun , after her .
As an adult , Mansfield plunged her own life into fiction as much as she invented characters to make her fiction run , which proved difficult for her , Lawrence and nearly everyone else who came in contact with her .
( As for the work itself , Carson McCullers allegedly returned to Mansfield ’s books so frequently that they fell apart . )
She was , according to Smith and the confused but adoring scholars that try to label her , “ merrily dexterous when it came to identity ” –– a grab bag of characters .
Trying to pigeonhole Mansfield becomes a jumble of words like the one Smith arrives at : “ colonial bisexual angel - devil plagiarist original . ”
Kathleen Jones ’ forthcoming biography of Mansfield , The Storyteller , may reveal the most about this colorful writer , simply by drawing out the nature of many of her relationships .
Those unfamiliar with fiction about New Zealand will enjoy the new territory , and Mansfield is arguably the country ’s most celebrated author .
“ Where the hell am I ? ” is the sensation many readers will have , but the gloriously alien quality of Mansfield ’s stories has as much to do with setting as with her ability to blend clipped , straightforward narration with flashes of surprising description .
The character at the center of “ The Woman at the Store ” could be a woman from rural Tennessee as easily as rural New Zealand .
The story , like so many of Mansfield ’s , trots along , intermittently kicking you in the face with little images and interactions .
To suggest drunkenness , the narrator says , “ The woman ’s hair was tumbled –– two red spots burned in her cheeks –– her eyes shone . ”
This is a quality Faulkner shares : his narrators also have singular , touching ways of looking at the world ( and he ’s Mansfield ’s contemporary , just seven years her junior ) , and both authors are brilliant at capturing the way people speak .
Without revealing too much about “ The Woman at the Store , ” the final sentence is a haunting double - whammy , two ends in one .
The characters leave the setting and Mansfield leaves us , with signature concision : “ A bend in the road , and the whole place disappeared . ”
This happens frequently over the course of her hundred or so stories : we ’re forced to move on .
Virginia Woolf , a friend , wrote that Mansfield “ stank like a civet cat that has taken to street walking , ” but she felt quite differently about her work , as biographer Jones writes , admitting that Mansfield was the only writer she was jealous of .
She tried to temper that feeling , too : “ My jealousy , ” Woolf told her sister , “ … is only a film on the surface beneath which is nothing but pure generosity . ”
Indeed , Woolf and her husband published Mansfield ’s breakthrough story , “ Prelude . ”
But the generosity also took the form of a mutually beneficial creative friendship .
Though both had romantic relationships with women , their kinship seems to have been professional in nature , and it proved longer lasting than many of the other friendships Mansfield would have .
( Jones recounts that D.H. Lawrence and his wife Frieda bitterly parted ways with Mansfield after sharing a house with her and her husband .
Lawrence later wrote to Mansfield to tell her , “ You are a loathsome reptile ; I hope you will die . ” )
Mansfield ’s life and work were inextricable , she said , but perhaps only to her , since sometimes the writing was respected long after the person who wrote it had been cast off .
( Frieda Lawrence allowed that Mansfield , while horrid , “ knew more of the truth than anyone else . ” )
But Mansfield , plagued by health problems and sexual urges that she sometimes flaunted and sometimes suppressed , had her reasons for being difficult .
She was largely unwilling to accept the bounds of monogamy and marriage , often impulsively entering into relationships only to break them off days or weeks later .
But in the case of her second husband , John Middleton Murray , who would n’t be unwilling ?
For he felt his career as a writer was more important than hers , and often expected her to fund it ( she came from money , while he did not ) .
As far as setting and situation goes , the life and work are closely tied .
Like the writer , the stories move between New Zealand and Europe .
Mansfield , disillusioned with New Zealand , first moved to Europe as a teenager , finishing her secondary education in London .
She actually began work on her short - story career back in New Zealand , where she returned for a brief period as an older teenager .
But Mansfield fled to London again two years later , and would spend the rest of her life in Europe .
As Joyce has suggested , a place is best written about once you ’ve left it , and New Zealand and its environs remained a focus of her work , a way to come to grips with a heritage –– analyze it , critique it , memorialize it –– without having to perpetuate it .
One clear embrace of her upbringing is the series of stories that begins with “ Prelude ” and continues with “ At the Bay , ” “ The Garden Party ” and “ The Doll ’s House . ”
There is the bubbly social antics and class issues of the slightly elder Forster in these stories , which concern a family called the Burnells , as well as a writer ’s energetic reexamination and remaking of her past .
Though Mansfield was never able to completely unravel the issues that preoccupied her in life –– her body would n’t let her –– writing brought sense to her chaotic days .
She also found solace in Ida Baker , a woman whom she called her “ wife , ” and who nursed Mansfield until the very end .
Mansfield wanted it all , though –– wife and husband – –which bewildered Baker .
Mansfield died in the midst of a romantic visit from Murray , who ’d been living elsewhere .
True to her spirit , she and Murray kept up a “ fictional ” relationship in letters , Jones writes , that often proved too awkward –– too real –– in the flesh .
Having left the world so soon , Mansfield haunted her loved ones –– and their loved ones –– long after she was gone .
Murray felt that she would live on forever –– perhaps in the form of another person , since within months of her death he married an aspiring writer named Violet le Maistre who looked strikingly similar to Mansfield .
Le Maistre , too , contracted tuberculosis , but after she and Murray had the children he and Mansfield had dreamed of having but were unable to ( instead , they had two imaginary children ) .
“ I ’m so glad ! ” Le Maistre told Murray after learning she had TB .
“ I wanted you to love me as much as you loved Katherine –– and how could you , without this ? ”
Vignette
This document has been superseded by http://www.photo.net/wtr/vignette.html.
I keep this old one around because it was a fun piece of writing .
The key issue is " how closely does your Web tool suite model the business that you want to be in ? " .
In the two years since I wrote this article , Vignette has built some higher - level software than the mere Web / db connectivity layer described below .
I 've actually been doing this myself for a broad class of Web service operators with the ArsDigita Community System ( free , open - source , and driven forward by 40 developers at arsdigita.com ) .
Note that my book chapter describing the system does not even mention the Web / db connectivity issues discussed below .
They really are n't relevant in the grand scheme of things .
Looking at Vignette also gave me a good idea for a problem set for my students at MIT : http://www.photo.net/teaching/psets/ps3/ps3.adp.
Why am I reviewing a product that is at least two years behind the state of the art ?
Because Vignette has somehow managed to attract sufficient funding and PR that people occasionally ask me for my opinion .
So here 's an edited version of a report that I wrote for a client in August 1997 after a meeting with Vignette 's sales and tech people .
What it does not do
I could laboriously evaluate Vignette against the criteria that I laid down for Web / DB integration tools in Chapter 12 of Database Backed Web Sites .
However , I think I 'll restrict myself to a few key points instead .
Caching
The wizard programmer : figures out a very fast mechanism for a dynamically generated Web page to get to the RDBMS .
( AOLserver )
The smart programmer : tries to build a very fast mechanism for a dynamically generated Web page to get to the RDBMS but fails and ends up with a needlessly pokey one instead .
( Netscape LiveWire ; Oracle WebServer )
The stupid programmer : can't figure out this RDBMS thang and resorts to stuffing the results of queries into the Unix file system .
The idiot programmer : can't figure out this RDBMS stuff so stuffs the results of queries in the Unix file system .
Then goes and patents the idea .
( Vignette . )
Yes , what Vignette does is , the first time someone requests a page , the code written by the publisher 's programmer is executed .
It may query an RDBMS .
When the page has been built , it gets delivered to a user and then stored in the Unix file system .
Should another user request the same page within a specified time period , the HTML is delivered from the Unix file system rather than by running the Tcl code and querying the RDBMS again .
Fifteen minutes of thinking about this architecture makes one realize that it is totally the right thing for Sun Microsystems .
Data comes from the disk subsystem .
It goes into Oracle 's shared memory cache .
Then it goes into Vignette which writes it back to a different part of the disk subsystem .
Then it comes back out of the disk subsystem and into Vignette before going out the Netscape Enterprise Server to the client .
You need a computer with about twice as much RAM and disk / RAM bandwidth than if you just did the obvious thing and served db - driven pages on the fly .
Let it be noted that caching outside the RDBMS is not always a bad idea .
If one is using a low - grade RDBMS or depending on data from foreign servers ( see The Bill Gates Personal Wealth Clock ) , then caching in the server program 's virtual memory can be an excellent idea .
I spent ten minutes writing a general - purpose Tcl memoization function that I use for caching portions of pages .
For modern Web services , this kind of caching is n't usually make - or - break .
The whole point of Web service design is that you personalize pages .
Server - side caching of a big page that you built for Jane Doe wo n't be of any use when you 're serving Joe Foobar .
So even if the Vignette caching scheme were better - implemented , it would n't be of any use for most parts of a modern Web site .
No Data Model
This was actually the most useful part of the meeting .
I studied the success of Vignette 's marketing literature and began to think about what it would be like if one actually built a product like the one they imply they have .
Check out the system I designed and have ( mostly ) built .
No Session Variables
No Expertise in Document Management
One of these " real document management " companies ( Basis ; http://www.idi.oclc.org/)
did n't feel like dealing with Oracle , et. al. , so they wrote their own full - blown RDBMS from scratch .
No Product

After reading the complete documentation i just could not understand what exactly Vignette StoryServer is .
I 'm a ASP professional .
How can it will be useful to me ?
and you are saying that TCL programming ... what it is ... And this Vegnette Server is compatiblle with ASP ( Active server pages ) ... please send me the mail with all details ...

The review of Story Server is quite outdated ...
The product now offers extensive content managment , personalization and cache management .
Yes , cache management is important ... if you perform a database operation for every page generation then you still need to get that information from the database , process it , format it in HTML , then deliver it to the client .
With Vignette 's patented cache management , the generated HTML is cached , and hence delivered without the processing overhead .
This is part of what the industry calls scalability .

This is a rather simplistic and biased view of Vignette .
From programming in tcl off and on for the past 5 years , it is simple and felxible enough to provide a custom Content Management App. in a relatively short period of time .
Further customization of this software would create a " Microsoft - like " product , totally inflexible and full of bugs .

Unlike his D8 predecessor Steve Jobs , who spoke eloquently , frankly , and insightfully during his interview , Facebook ‘s Mark Zuckerberg seemed to have trouble answering questions concisely , and his on - stage sweating has made for a few pun headlines ( “ Great Perspirations , ” remarked Forbes ) .
Zuckerberg is embroiled in a scandal , yes , but so is Jobs –the problem is that while Jobs spoke of the stolen iPhone drama with force and conviction , Zuckerberg seemed to stumble his way through questions about privacy .
All Things D’s liveblog captures the rambling , buzzwordy nature of the interview pretty well .
In response to the question “ Why are you making me take steps to protect my information , ” he responded with a long soliloquy on “ serendipitous connections . ”
When asked why certain public features force users to opt - out , rather than choosing to opt- in , he responded that Facebook tries to find a balance , that making everything opt - in would “ create more friction . ”
Repeatedly , it seems , Zuckerberg either ignored or talked his way around a question .
When asked what instant personalization really means , he “ fumbles ” ( in the words of All Things D ) and speaks abstractly about “ the people - centric Web . ”
Several references are made to his excessive sweating –I do n’t want to draw any particular conclusions , but his perspiration was even mentioned on stage when moderator Walt Mossberg asked if he ’d like to remove his sweatshirt .
All Things D says he ’s “ literally dissolving in a lake of his own sweat . ”
But he did deliver an answer , or at least a response , to those college - era instant messages that have cropped up in relation to his early years as a hacker :
When I was in college I did a lot of stupid things and I do n’t want to
make an excuse for that .
Some of the things that people accuse me of are
true , some of them are n’t .
There are pranks , IMs .
I started building
this when I was around 19 years old , and along the way , a lot of stuff
changed .
We went from building a service in a dorm room to running a
service that 500 million people use .
I ’d love to hear what you all think about that point .
There are different perspectives on his teenage shenanigans .
Some think that those IMs represent a disregard for privacy that can be traced to the present day .
Others remember that we all said and did things at that age that we regret , that we would n’t do today , and that do n’t necessarily reflect the beliefs or inclinations of our adult selves .
But it ’s clear that Zuckerberg is a novice interviewee , possibly shaken by the recent scandal his company ’s undergone .
I ’m not sure why he did n’t just plan out his answers beforehand –none of them are curveballs , and he could have had somebody write him out some nice , clean answers .
At least next time he ’ll know to wear a short - sleeve shirt .
This is a funny one .
You'd think the President of Nintendo America , Reggie Fils - Aime , would know the date of release for his revolutionary new 3DS , but telling Jimmy Fallon on Friday that it'd launch " next year " was incorrect , apparently .

His mistake has n't been cleared up officially by a Nintendo spokesperson , but according to our brother - site Kotaku 's Japanese Nintendo sources , he was " mistaken " in saying it 'd launch next year .
Must 've been too pre-occupied playing Donkey Kong Returns on the Wii , as shown in the video here .

A pre-Christmas launch certainly makes the most sense , if Nintendo really wants to capitalize on the 3D craze this year .
We know , thanks to their initial press release on the console , that it 's going to launch before the new financial year begins in April next year .
Speaking from experience , if people have any pocket - money left over after January — enough to buy a pricey 3DS — Nintendo will be very lucky indeed .

I have Included Every Chapter Leading up to the final chapter , which is chapter 7 , please enjoy .
I have enjoyed writing this series , now it has come to an end , Prison Rape Forever !!!
Part 1
I sat gripping the bars as they pounded my ass like a roadside construction crew digging a ditch .
The first one to have a go around with me was a sweaty and rather large cross dresser by the name of Kirby , his man boobs rubbed the back of my neck like two deflated whoopie cushions and his throaty grunting filled my ears like the sounds of hungry pigs fighting eachother for a mid-day feeding .
The man that kept the towel gripped in my mouth was a skinny black man with a dick like the trunk of a circus elephant .
In fact the irony came in the form of him making me call it by a pet name , Petey , Petey the Penis is what he made me call it .
Goddamn i hated Petey , I hated Petey every time he touched my mouth , I hated Petey every time he spit in my eye , and i hated Petey everytime he burrowed a nice comfortable home inside my ass .
Petey will most likely be the next visitor in my ass , and that is one house guest i am not looking forward to , but that is just part of biting down on the towel in the c-wing of San Quentin .
Part 2
It 's been a month since i first entered these walls , these walls of pain and butt pillaging sorrow .
I remember my first night here , i thought i had accomplished something because i made it through twelve hours with out having my ass violated , oh how little i knew .
They do n't get you on your first day , or your second , hell sometimes they give you a week before they actually tie you to a bed and pile drive your ass .
But make no mistake about it , they are watching and waiting .
My first time was with the skinny little black dish washer known as Buckshot and his elephant sized cock Petey the penis .
Oh Goddamn how i hate petey .
For some reason i never saw it coming , i did n't see the hints that Buckshot had marked my ass for entry , but now that i look back the signs are clear .
When he walked by me in the mess hall and told me to lube up it did n't register , when he slapped my ass in the shower and told me to keep em loose and ready it did n't register , when he sent me flowers in the rec yard with a note saying he was looking forward to tonight , it did n't register , but it should have .
Those are the signs of prison love and imminent rape .
He bribed one of the guards , i know he did , because after lights out my cell popped open and in walked Buckshot with Petey in hand .
He clocked me twice across the head before laying my limp body across the mattress ... gosh ... you gotta love that prison foreplay .
It 's fickle and trite but oh so tender .
He forced a white towel in my mouth before stripping my pants off and scuba diving in my ass .
Petey was fast and brutal , i tried to break free , but every time Buckshot would clock me another one .
Now it 's a routine to me , biting down on the towel in the C Block of San Quentin ....
Part 3
I was taking my shower , letting the water cleanse my violated body as much as possible .
My ass was still sore from the plundering done previously by Buckshot and his horse sized cock nick named Petey .
I always keep an eye out when i am taking my shower , you never know when one of those tattooed up gay bastards is going to sneak up behind you and attempt to play hide the weasle in your ass , that is a game that usually ends with me sucking my thumb in the fetal position while my body is degraded by strange fluids , never fun .
So as i am rubbing myself down with the soap it slips from my grasp , the goddamn soap slips from my grasp .
So i have to ask myself , what 's this soap worth , if i bend down to pick it up i open my ass for an all out assault .
I look over my shoulder and decide it 's safe .
Just as i bend down i feel a loud stinging on my left ass cheek as one of the prisoners smacks me with his towel .
I shoot upwards nailing my balls on the water handle and doubling backwards in pain .
As i am laying on the floor a prisoner seizes my hands and locks them above my head .
I am struggling but to no avail .
His friend , a man as tall as he is wide , stands over me .
His fat fleshy stretch mark ridden stomach soaked with perspiration .
His balls , wrinkled and wet and strangely resembling Clint Eastwoods face dangle above my head .
He begins to lower himself , setting his balls on my lips .
I struggle doing my best to keep my mouth closed as those wrinkled hairy orbs of homosexual desire try to fight their way in my mouth .
A fist slams into my nuts forcing my mouth open in pain and the fat mans hairy nut sack finds it 's way in my mouth .
Having nuts in your mouth is a strange feeling , it 's like sucking on an old persons face , except you have a cock across your nose at the same time .
As these nuts swim around inside my mouth i get a strange feeling that this wo n't be the last time i suck balls in San Quentin ...
Part 4
My time on C - Block has resulted in the utter destruction of my ass and any thing that possibly resembles my manhood .
I am a bitch , a punk , a walking hole for other convicts to stick their dicks in .
This is my stake in life , my claim , my fate , to be a prison cum bucket , woo hoo , oh how exciting ....
So my cell opens , it 's morning , time to get ready for breakfast .
I ease myself from my bed , a place where i have been raped anally and had my mouth defiled multiple times , as i stand i feel the familiar pain in my ass .
I have begun walking stiff because of the constant pain from the numerous ass poundings i have recieved courtesy of Buckshot and many other prisoners .
Before i can really wake up two large black men that i do not recognize step into my cell , they have rape in their eyes and they are looking to release it on to me , or in to me is probably closer to the truth .
" What do you guys want with me ? " I ask , with an idea of their intentions already running around inside of my head .
" We do n't want you , we just want your ass . "
I have been raped before , i know the drill .
But i have never been the meat in two black mens sandwich , and i'll be goddamned if i was about to start .
The thought of being dp'd by two very large black schlongs did not appeal to me at all .
" Let 's go than , bring it on , i eat fuckers like you for breakfast ! "
I said as i weakly raised my fists to fight .
They smiled , coy grins showing an inner joy for the fight they were about to take on .
" Well , i hope you like sausage ! "
One of them responded .
They jumped on me , they beat me black and blue before stripping me down and raping me .
I do like sausage though , just not the cream filled kind ...
Part 5
I had gone a month without being sodomized or tea bagged .
My ass was starting to go back to normal and i was just getting the taste of Buckshots balls out of my mouth , when the warden called me to his office .
Warden :
Hey boy , i heard to been taking it from behind pretty good lately , word is you 're the best piece of ass we have had on hand in some time .
Me : Well i do appreciate the comment sir , but i can't say i'm too fond of the attention .
Warden : Ah nonsense son , i believe i am going have myself a go around wit ya .
Milo , Otis , hold him over the desk .
And before i could react his boys were on me , my pants were down , and i was once again biting down on a towel in the C - block of San Quentin .
The warden spanked me a few times and grunted while telling me i smelled pretty .
I was almost relieved to be raped by the warden rather than Buckshot and his foot long penis named Petey .
The warden was more tender and loving and he even cuddled with me and told a few jokes after he was done plowing my ass .
All in all i was kind of numb towards the whole thing , yes i was raped again , but it was n't by Buckshot or one of the other prison brothers with their freakishly large peckers , so that was a nice change .
I have to say , looking at it , that was the best sex i had so far on the C - Block , and at least there were n't any balls in my mouth .
Part 6 : The Saga Continues
The rapes have not stopped , but their frequency has lessened to a degree .
I am able to walk upright about twice a week , a change from the wide legged shuffling i am used to doing , accompanied by a chorus of cat calls and ass slaps from the different inmates who have owned my inner sanctum .
Two weeks ago , and against my will , i was entered into the C - Block beauty pagent .
I begged and pleaded , " I 'm not a pretty lady , I 'm not a pretty lady " i screamed as they pushed me on stage .
The warden , standing offstage with a rifle in hand , forced me to pout and wiggle my " apple pie money maker " as Bootylicous played in the background .
At the end of the night , when i heard i'd won , i broke down into tears .
My prize , a night with the Mcreggor Brothers , the envy of every hardcore latent homosexual on C - Block , but i am not a hardcore latent homosexual .
I am a victim of homosexual lust , nothing more .
They saw my ruby red starfruit ass and ran through it like a pack of buffalo through an indian reservation .
My night with the Mcreggors was a mix of love and anger .
While it was n't as painful as my previous poundings , it was the most humiliating .
They made me get on my knees and beg for their balls like puppy treats , all while holding a shiv to the back of my neck ; talk about a demanding lover , sheesh .
Have n't they ever heard of foreplay , i mean helllo !
They called me a dirty boy and made me sit in the corner and suck my thumb while they sprayed me with their " super soakers " ... you figure that one out .
Afterwards , they gave me a treat , I got to " pluck cherries " from their " salad bowls " ... and in case you 're wondering there were no actual cherries involved , and these salad bowls were made of ass .
Yes , i cried , i cried alot .
And the next day i stayed curled up on my cot , my mascara was smeared , and my beauty pagent dress was stained and smelling of sweat and rape .
And the ironic thing is , when i was asked what the one thing was that i wanted out of the beauty pagent , i said i did n't want to be raped ... yeah , fat fucking chance !
Chapter 7 : The Final Chapter
It was the night of my release , my final night in this place of pent up homo erotic frustration .
The final night i had to sleep on my back with one eye open .
Had i really made it through ?
Was the ass raping over .
Christ , i hoped so , hopefully i could leave , get my ass surgically repaired , and maybe move on with my life , and find a thread of diginity and manhood somewhere along the line .
Hell , maybe i could finally experience sex with a female again , i have grown oh so weary of feeling calloused fingers in my mouth , and hairy chests along the expanse of my back , not to mention the thick intruder that was usually in my ass during these two simoultaneous events .
Oh goddamn , if it was only that simple ....
My cell door swung open , in the metal frame of my 8 by 10 apartment stood the warden , with his two cronies , Milo , and Otis.
Great , time for another raping .
They pulled me from the cell , I did n't struggly , the warden made sure to slap my battered ass as his two cronies drug me past him , coy bastard .
They took me down stairs and tied me to a pole in the center of the cell block , a line of prisoners slowly formed behind me .
They all had their standard issue shirts on ... but none of them wore pants ... or underwear for that matter .
I began to cry , not out of fear , i was n't afraid , i have been raped , i have been raped by the best of them .
This was a situation my ass had been trained for , i knew the drill , and it could handle what was about to happen .
I cried because i had n't bathed and my hair was dishevled , i mean , i was Ms C - Block for christ sake , i had a reputation to live up to .
But now , here i was , tied to a pole , twisted at an awkard angle , oh how humiliating .
Buckshot came up beside me and lubed my ass up with a bottle of oil .
I thanked him , he told i was the best lover he ever had , and that i always treated him and that ungodly schlong Petey with just the right amount of tender loving care .
Hell , truth was , i'd grown attached to Petey , everytime i was with him he was either buried up my ass or working his way inside my mouth , and even though he was a brutal , blunt , and rather unpredictable bastard , i'll be goddamned if i did n't love him for it .
So in the end , i was raped by every prisoner on the C - Block , some of them had my ass more than once .
Hell , even the warden got himself a little piece of the action .
But all of that taught me something .
It taught me that you can find love anywhere , whether it be at the tip of a cock or the bottom of my ass , the love is there .
You just have got to know how to interpret it .
That backhand across the mouth that you may think is nothing more than a brutal expression of pent up homosexual rage may be his way of saying " I love you " .
Ya know , part of me is going to miss biting down on the towel in the C - Block of San Quentin .
The End
Nuking the Gulf spill
Navy submarine vet and Columbia University nuclear policy scholar Christopher Brownfield has an odd post over at the Daily Beast on a potential solution for the Gulf oil spill .
He begins :
On Day 1 of the BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico , my gut instinct was to nuke the well shut .
Really ?
That was his gut instinct ?
Nuclear weapons ?
Brownfield goes on to say that Obama probably wo n’t use this strategy because it would be " problematic " for his global anti-nuclear agenda .
I ’m no nonproliferation expert , but I can think of a few other reasons why setting off a nuclear weapon 50 miles off the coast of the United States might be " problematic . "
In any case , Brownfield feels the well could be effectively shut using just conventional explosives , if the military were to get involved .
This was also intriguing :
On Thursday , my gut instinct for nuking shut the well was confirmed when CNN reported that the Soviet military had used nuclear explosives on four separate occasions , beginning in 1966 , to seal off runaway oil and gas wells under water .
Weird .
Frequent FP contributor Julia Ioffe has more on this practice :
Komsomoloskaya Pravda , the best - selling Russian daily , reports that in Soviet times such leaks were plugged with controlled nuclear blasts underground .
The idea is simple , KP writes : “ the underground explosion moves the rock , presses on it , and , in essence , squeezes the well ’s channel . ”
Yes !
It ’s so simple , in fact , that the Soviet Union , a major oil exporter , used this method five times to deal with petrocalamities .
The first happened in Uzbekistan , on September 30 , 1966 with a blast 1.5 times the strength of the Hiroshima bomb and at a depth of 1.5 kilometers .
KP also notes that subterranean nuclear blasts were used as much as 169 times in the Soviet Union to accomplish fairly mundane tasks like creating underground storage spaces for gas or building canals .
[ My emphasis . ]
" How would the Soviets have handled this , " is not necessarily the first question I ask when faced with environmental catastrophe , but things are getting pretty desperate out there .

“ New cars smell the same in India as they do in the US , ” was the first thought that came to my mind as I took my seat in my nephew ’s new Hyundai sedan in which he had come to pick me up from the Chandigarh airport .
It was the first of August and I had just arrived in India for a short visit .
My home - town was my first stop .
New cars in India may have the same leathery - plasticky smell as new cars everywhere , but they look like nothing else in the world .
The car that I was riding in , like the tens of thousands that roll out of auto - showrooms everyday all over India , was bedecked in red ribbons and had a garland of fresh marigolds strung around the number - plates .
The top of the front window had two swastikas and an “ Om ” painted on it in red color .
The driving - wheel had the “ auspicious ” red string tied to it .
The Ganesh idol on the dashboard had the residue of burnt incense in front of it .
My nephew told me that he was coming straight from the temple where he had taken his car for a “ vahan puja , ” a brand new Hindu ritual invented to bless the new vehicles that are clogging the Indian roads these days .
This being his first car - and the object of his loving devotion , at least for now – my nephew told me that he wanted to do something really , really , special for it .
That is why , he told me , he took it to the temple where he had to shell out some serious cash for the ceremony , instead of getting a free puja which his dealership had offered as a part of the incentive package .
“ What ” ?
My ears pricked up .
I must have sounded incredulous : “ Car dealers offer free pujas ?
Do they have pundits on their staff now ?
Car dealerships have become new temples or what ? ”
My nephew looked at me as if to ask where I had been all these years ?!
This is nothing new , he said .
Knowing how popular vahan pujas are , more innovative car - dealers throw in free pujas for their customers .
They hire full - time pujaris , who along with their helpers , do all the required rituals : break a coconut for auspiciousness , make you drive over limes to ward off evil spirits , while they recite Sanskrit mantras whose meaning even they do n’t know .
They give you prasad to take home with you .
They even take a picture of the ceremony on your digital camera that you can email your friends and relatives all around the world .
A puja in a car - dealership feels just like a puja in a temple , really .
But he still prefers a real temple and that is why he decided to forgo the freebie – my nephew told me this , all in one breathless monologue .
Car - dealerships with in - house pujaris !
What a fancy idea , I thought , and how typical of Hinduism to cash in on this new opportunity to adapt and thrive in these times of globalization .
The pujaris are happy as they can make more money sitting in the air - conditioned comfort of car - dealerships than in your average neighborhood mandir , I am sure .
Car - buyers are happy , for they can cross out “ puja ” from their to - do list without any extra money and time .
Happiness and contentment all around !!
I bet even the coconut sellers are laughing all the way to the bank .
( Regular coconut deliveries to auto showrooms ?!
Only in India . )
What is not to like about this Brahman - bania business model ?
Is n’t this simply a creative re-enactment of the eternal partnership between god and mammon ?
Why , then , do I feel a wave of dismay sweep over my heart ?
Why do I feel sad at the idea of so many educated young people like my dear sweet nephew – who I love dearly , and who is so touchingly proud of his first new car – believing that puja adds anything of value to their new vahans ?
I felt that something is amiss in the way this generation of “ modern ” Indians is encountering the products of modern science and technology with an utterly medieval or even pre-medieval worldview .
While they seek out and revel in every gadget and every creature - comfort created by a purely materialistic and rational understanding of nature , they seem to experience the world as if it is literally crawling with gods who have power of life and death over our lives .
God is as much a part of their taken - for - granted reality as stones , trees – and , indeed , their precious vahans – are .
A prayer to the gods is the ultimate insurance policy against any accidents and mishaps .
Of course , my nephew is worldly - wise enough to buy a real insurance policy .
But why does he think he needs the puja over and above the certificate of insurance lying in the glove compartments of his brand new car ?
I wondered if he wonders who or what is this protective power he is bowing to , as he breaks those coconuts and burns the incense ?
Has too much praying blunted his capacity to wonder and to ask questions ?
If he can bow to an invisible power purely on faith without asking any questions , will this young man ask too many questions from other authority figures he will be asked to bow his head to in the rest of his life ?

“ There you go again ! ” , an old friend remarked when I shared this bit about free vahan pujas with him when we met in one of the many canteens that dot the Punjab University campus in Chandigarh .
He is quite godless himself , but thinks that intellectuals must respect people ’s religiosity and not presume to be more “ enlightened ” than them .
That way , he fears , lies avant - guardism of the Bolshevik kind .
He went on : “ Do n’t you and people like you in America – all claiming to be so modern and secular – have your own superstitions ?
Tell me honestly : have you never worn your “ lucky ” dress for a job interview ?
Have n’t you ever avoided , say , going over a crack in the pavement ?
So why do you get so upset over harmless little quirks of Indians ?
Let them do their pujas , if it brings them comfort in this harsh and cruel society that we are creating .
A puja is not harming anyone , is it ?
Besides , do n’t you realize that you are replicating the prejudices of English sahibs ’ toward the natives ?
Are you not behaving like those Christian missionaries who labeled us as superstitious idolaters ?
If you want to reach ordinary people , you have to respect their faith and not look down upon them – like you often do . ”
Ouch !
I have lost count of how many times I have heard such “ friendly ” advice to take my hat off , so to say , when speaking of religion .
But no matter how many times I hear it , this idea of “ respecting ” other people ’s faith will never sit well with me .
I happen to believe that indulging people ’s irrational beliefs – like a parent puts up with a child ’s follies – does not add up to “ respect . ”
In my rulebook , the best way to respect people you care about is to treat them as worthy conversation partners who can be persuaded by reason ( or who may persuade you with better arguments and evidence ) .
The way I see it , engaging people in an honest and open dialogue about the matters of ultimate concern is to pay them the highest grade of respect that there is .
Besides , I have never been able to understand why my otherwise progressive friends bend over backwards to make exceptions for “ the people ’s ” faith .
My progressive friends actually take the lead when it comes to demanding good reasons and evidence when politicians , government bureaucrats , corporate CEOs or the “ West ” try to sell us some phony idea or products .
But their critical faculties seem to desert them when it comes to challenging the religious faith of “ the people , ” even if that faith ends up causing so much unnecessary suffering all around .
When it comes to popular Indian religiosity – be it Hindu , Sikh , Muslim , Chrisitan or whatever – secular and progressive Indian intellectuals tend to behave more like caretakers rather than critics , even though they themselves are quite devoid of any serious religious conviction .
My secularist friends , for example , are on the forefront of the struggle against Hindu extremists – and I respect them greatly for that .
But I am also puzzled at their hand - off approach toward Hinduism itself .
I have lost count of how many times I have heard them proclaim with all seriousness that “ Hinduism has nothing to do with Hindu nationalism . ”
Why is that ?
How do they justify their position ?
Hinduism , they say , is a matter of “ faith ” ( and therefore good ) while Hindu nationalism is a “ political ideology ” ( and therefore bad ) .
But I am afraid this raises more questions than it answers .
Is it really the case that religious faith and ideology have nothing to do with each other ?
When has faith not served as ideology ?
Is n’t the story of Ramayana simultaneously faith and an ideology of a patriarchal and a caste society ?
Do my good secularist friends really believe that faith is like a pair of chappals that people leave outside the door marked “ politics ” ?
Religious beliefs , or faith , have always supplied the commonsense understanding of the world which ideologies mobilize .
A consistent secularist has no choice but to challenge both the commonsense worldview derived from faith , and the political ideologies that resonate with this commonsense .
I have yet another bone to pick with those insist that we must “ respect ” people ’s religious beliefs .
Why should we respect beliefs that defy all possible evidence , which thumb their nose at all the accumulated knowledge about how nature works and which have played such a reactionary role throughout India ’s history ?
Just because some beliefs come wrapped up in piety and tradition does not make them worthy of respect .
All these thoughts were racing in my head as I sat there under a tree .
But I bit my tongue and did not say anything : I was enjoying my visit to the campus where I was once a student , and did not want a debate just then .
Thankfully , the chai - wallah ( a young lad who should have been in school ) came just then .
We got busy with our chai and bread - pakoras .
One good new : the junk food of my student days still tastes as good as I remembered it .
Some traditions definitely do need to be preserved !
***
I was still mulling over my friend ’s words next morning when the local newspaper ( I read The Tribune when I am in Chandigarh ) arrived .
The headlines announced : “ 146 die in Naina Devi Stampede “ .
Naina Devi is a popular temple , about 100 km up north of Chandigarh in the foothills of the Himalayas .
The temple is supposed to mark the “ exact ” spot where goddess ’s eyes ( or “ naina ” ) fell when her body , reconstituted by her husband god Shiva after she had committed sati was blown into smithereens by the god Vishnu – a double dose of mayhem , you may say .
( What is so holy about this act of violence , escapes me entirely ) .
Incidentally , there are at least two other so - called shakti-peeths , one in Pakistan , which claim the eyes of the goddess .
There are at least 50 other such temples all over south Asian which lay claim to bits of the goddess ’s decimated body .
I wonder : how do they know that the right big toe , or the upper eye - tooth of the goddess fell exactly at the spot where the temple stands , I wondered .
No one knows .
Besides , it is not appropriate to ask such questions for these beliefs are based upon faith and therefore beyond reason .
But wait : the same faith - based claims get trotted out as empirical facts backed by pseudoscience when government - run tourism departments want to promote these sites , or when Hindu nationalists want to lay claim on Ramsethu or the Babri mosque .
The faithful want it – and have it – both ways in the good old secular democratic republic that is India . )
But I am rambling .
Let me go back to the great stampede of August 2008 .
Here is the clipping I saved from The Tribune , Aug . 4 :
More than 146 persons , most of them women and children , were killed in a stampede in the Naina Devi shrine in Himachal Pradesh .
More than 200 persons were injured , some of them critically .
Since it was the Shravan Ashtami mela on the second day of the Navratras and a Sunday , the crowd of devotees , an estimated 20,000 to 25,000 persons , thronged the popular hilltop shrine .
The shrine has little space for such a huge congregation that waited in a serpentine queue to pay obeisance to the deity .
So many lives snuffed out so tragically …
My mind flashed back to what my friend had said yesterday : “ harmless little quirks ” is how he had described popular Hindu prayers to gods and goddesses .
Well , it did not turn out to be all that harmless for these poor souls , I thought .
I understand , of course , that stampedes can happen anywhere and at any event – from rock - concerts in the US to political rallies in India – without adequate attention to crowd - management .
Yet , there was something so sad about so many people dying precisely when they had come all the way to ask for divine blessings for happier and longer lives .
A footnote : Even as I sit here , back in my home in Connecticut , USA , writing about the Great Temple Stampede of August 2008 , the National Public Radio brings me the news of the Great Temple Stampede of September 2008 .
On September 29 , nearly 200 pilgrims gathered at Chamunda Mata temple in the state of Rajasthan lost their lives in a stampede .
One more goddess , one more temple , one more stampede .
So it goes …

Within a week of Naina Devi tragedy , there was another case of utterly unnecessary and perfectly avoidable death and mayhem , this time in the streets and the highways of the state of Jammu and Kashmir .
Starting on August 11 , and lasting for at least a week , there were daily reports of tens of thousand people from all parts of Kashmir marching toward Muzzafarabad , the capital of Pakistan - occupied part of Kashmir , demanding “ azadi ” or independence , from India .
The protestors were trying to defy the economic blockade engineered against Kashmir by Hindu - right affiliated groups based in Jammu .
Scores died in indiscriminate police firing and many hundreds were seriously wounded .
This fresh round of political unrest in Kashmir was sparked by religious enthusiasm for an ice stalagmite resembling Shiva ’s lingam in the famed Amarnath shrine .
Incredibly daft though it may appear considering Kashmir ’s status as the “ world ’s most dangerous place , ” Hindu pilgrimage to Amarnath temple has been actively promoted by a bunch of state functionaries committed to advancing Hindu interests in this Muslim majority state .
The current row was sparked by an attempted land - grab of some 400 acres of forest land by Amarnath temple ’s management board which , by statute , is headed by the governor of the state ( but only if s/ he is a Hindu ) .
After the Muslims protested , the land - transfer order was revoked .
The revocation of land - transfer , in turn , provoked counter - protests among Hindus who demanded that the land be “ restored ” to the shrine .
Hindu groups , most of them aligned with Hindu nationalist parties , blockaded the trade routes linking Kashmir to the rest of India , provoking the call for “ azadi ” among Kashmiris who began their march to Pakistan - controlled Kashmir .
It was this throng of Kashmiri protestors who had come under fire from the security forces , leading to so many deaths and injuries .
It appears that wherever you find political strife in India these days , you are bound to find religion lurking in the shadows .
Religious enthusiasm is to Indian politics what a virus is to pneumonia .
These twin tragedies in the hills got me musing .
I began to see the connections between the relatively harmless ( not counting the harm it does to the faculty of critical thought ) middle - class rite of vahan puja , the tragic fate of pilgrims to Naina Devi and Chamunda Mata temples , and the politically disastrous outcome of government - encouraged Hindu pilgrimage in the state of Jammu and Kashmir .
I began to see , more clearly than ever before , how the same worldview and beliefs of ordinary Hindus that makes them have pujas for their cars and undertake arduous and often life - threatening pilgrimages , also makes them sympathize with – and indeed actively demand – the open , state - sponsored Hinduization of India that has been going on in recent years .
This led me to see the folly of my secularist friends ’ argument that popular Hinduism has “ nothing ” to do with Hindu nationalism .
Or to put it differently , Hinduism has no organic – that is , cognitive , aesthetic and moral – connections with Hindu nationalism , and that “ bad ” Hindu nationalism has “ hijacked , ” “ distorted ” or “ Semitized ” the “ good , ” “ tolerant ” and “ harmless ” Hinduism of the masses .
I began to see more clearly than ever before that we cannot fight the faith - based politics of Hindu nationalists and the faith - based initiatives of the Indian state , unless we question and combat the very foundations of faith - based beliefs and rituals of popular Hinduism itself .
We can not go on “ respecting ” people ’s faith , but then turn around and start questioning them when they actually act upon that faith .
What is happening in Kashmir over the land - transfer issue is a perfect illustration of what I mean when I say that secularists cannot continue to “ respect ” faith while , at the same time , fight against faith - based politics .
Let us suppose that out of “ respect ” we do not question the popular Hindu myth – which is endlessly repeated not just by priests but by the agencies of the supposedly “ secular ” state as well – that the naturally formed ice stalagmite in the Amarnath cave is “ really ” Shiva ’s lingam ( or phallus ) and that God Shiva actually revealed the secrets of the universe at this spot to his wife , goddess Parvati .
If we grant all that , then on what grounds do we turn around and start criticizing the mass mobilizations of Hindus that are taking place not just in Jammu but all over the country demanding that land be given to Amarnath temple so that more and more Hindu pilgrims can witness the “ miracle ” of the ice - lingam ?
Sure , we can criticize political parties and the temple management for their attempted land - grab for a temple in such an ecologically and politically sensitive area .
But if we grant that people ’s faith – even it if confuses a natural phenomenon with a divine lingam – is to be “ respected , ” then why should we not respect their right to demand more land to build better facilities so that they can exercise their freedom of religion ?
I am convinced that as long as we do n’t challenge the worldview , the background assumptions , the explicit and tacit beliefs that animate popular Hindu rituals and practices , we will be fighting against the menace of Hindutva with one hand tied behind our backs .
For then , we will only allow ourselves to challenge the material and political interests of Hindu nationalist parties .
But we will be no position to challenge and change the mentalities , or the habits - of - the - heart , of the millions of ordinary people that incline them to support Hindutva politics , enthusiastically ( by joining the many rath - yatras , pujas and other religio- political spectacles organized by the Hindu Right ) , or passively ( through the ballot box only ) .
Unless we question the basis of faith critically , rationally and scientifically , we will not succeed in stemming the popular support for faith - based politics .
There can be no viable secular politics in India without a secularization of consciousness and conscience of Indian people .

In the middle of all this rather dismal news , I found the time to take care of the main purpose that had brought me to India : I handed over the completed manuscript of one of my forthcoming books , God and Globalization in India to S. Anand of Navayana who has agreed to bring out the Indian edition of this book .
It gives me no pleasure to report that what I saw in India this summer fully confirmed the thesis of my forthcoming book .
My nephew ’s freshly prayed - over car confirmed one part of my thesis which states that the new middle classes are turning out to be more religious than the middle classes of the previous ( aka “ the Nehruvian ” ) generation .
I argue in this book that contrary to the expectations of the classical secularization theory , economic and political modernization is leading not to greater secularization but to invention of new rituals , gentrification of gods / goddesses , and to a perverse kind of scientism in which Hindu metaphysics which teaches pan-psychism ( i.e. , consciousness is a fundamental quality of even the smallest unit of matter ) and vitalism ( i.e. there is a special “ life - force , ” or “ prana ” that accounts of life ) is being sold as if it is supported by modern science .
The emerging middle classes , I argue , are “ modern ” only insofar as they have become more or less savvy consumers of global brand - names .
These material accouterments exist amidst the mental furniture which harkens back to a world full of disembodied atman or shakti , which either roams free or gets “ embodied ” in idols .
The tragic events in Naina Devi and Amarnath in the month of August confirmed the other part of my thesis which argues that a “ state - temple - corporate complex ” ( my term ) is emerging to fill the space left behind by the neoliberal state which is retreating from its public sector obligations , especially in education .
In the name of promoting economic development , this STC is openly promoting “ temple tourism ” ; in the name of promoting “ Indian culture , ” it is promoting Hindu symbols , rituals and practices ; and in the promoting “ values education , ” it is promoting pseudo - sciences like astrology , Ayurveda - yoga and vastu .
Globalization is turning out to be great for the gods in India .
Take this case of pilgrimage to Naina Devi which ended in such tragedy .
It would be wrong to see the rush of pilgrims as an index of the “ natural ” religiosity of Indian people , for this religiosity has been actively fostered by the supposedly “ secular ” Indian state .
Just last year , the state of Himachal Pradesh where Naina Devi is located , received a grand sum of 71 million rupees from the central government for promotion of tourism .
An unspecified but a large enough chunk of it was assigned to “ promote temple tourism in a big way , ” to quote the relevant minister of the state .
Tax - payers ’ money was used to promote the state as the “ land of Gods , ” complete with the Puranic legends of Naina Devi as one of the Shakti - peeth temples – an idea that completely defies all reason .
Such promotion of superstitions makes a complete mockery of the state ’s constitutional obligation to promote “ scientific temper ” among the citizens .
Not only that , state bureaucrats on the government payroll acted as advertising and booking agents for would - be pilgrims .
The supposedly secular government put more of its resources in promoting a Hindu yatra than in actually preparing for the rush of pilgrims .
Why are we so surprised that there was such a deadly stampede at the temple ?
What happened in Amarnath is even more appalling .
For years , the state governor , S.K. Sinha , actively and routinely participated in Hindu yagnas and darshans bringing the prestige and the power of his office to the Vaishno Devi and Amarnath temples .
In his capacity as the ex-officio head of the management trusts for these two most well - known temples / pilgrimage spots , the governor acted more as a Hindu activist than as the head of the state which is supposed to have no religion .
Tax - payers ’ money was used not just to provide facilities for the pilgrims but to actively promote pilgrimage by organizing cultural festivals including dance , drama , food and handicrafts .
Why are we so surprised at the communal rift that has opened up afresh in such a geo-politically sensitive state as Jammu and Kashmir ?
All that I saw and read in the one month that I was in India this summer confirmed my thesis that globalization and market economy are proving to be a god - send for the many gods in India .

Well , after about a month in India , I came back to the United States where I have lived for many years .
I happened to attend a music concert in the Hindu Temple in Middletown , Connecticut .
There , among other notices , the list of “ religious services ” caught my attention .
Among priestly services for wedding and funerals , I found the following :
“ Vahan Pooja : $ 31 . ”
Well , why not ?
When Indians move from one god-crazed country to another , that is what they do .
So it goes …

Miracle escape as plane crashes into CAR and explodes in flames
Advertisement
This was the astonishing scene on an airfield after a two - seater plane crashed into a car , sparking a fireball .
Miraculously , the occupants of the Volvo X60 escaped without a scratch – although the pilot of the AT3 plane suffered serious injuries .
By another stroke of luck , there was a volunteer fire crew already on site , and the blaze was quickly put out .
The driver and passenger of the car , who were leaving the North Weald Airfield , in Essex , managed to help the pilot out of the wreckage , following the crash at 2.25 pm yesterday afternoon .
A single engine AT3 aircraft struck this Volvo X60 at North Weald Airfield in Essex , yesterday afternoon .
The occupants of the car escaped without a scratch and helped pull the plane pilot to safety seconds before a fierce fire
A fire service spokesman said : ' An onlooker who saw the incident told us that the plane appeared to come into land but immediately took off again , banking over the top of a hanger before coming back to try a second landing and clipping the back of a brand new Volvo with two people inside who were driving out of the airfield . '
Steve Brecknell , North Weald Airfield fire officer , added : ' The fire crew were on the closed part of the airfield for a drag race , they are just there in case anything happens .
' Then there was the crash on the other side of the air field and they rushed to put the fire out .
' An aircraft got in some sort of difficulty and as he tried to put it down and get onto the taxiway it hit this Volvo .
' The car was driving along , leaving the airfield - it was pure fluke that the plane hit it .
' The two guys inside the car looked in their rear view mirror and saw it coming towards them .
' They jumped out and helped the pilot and seconds later the plane caught light .
It could have been much worse if he had n't been dragged out .
' I do n't know what caused the crash - by the sound of it , it is one of those freak things . '
The pilot was treated at the scene by an ambulance crew before being rushed to hospital .
A volunteer fire crew were on site at the time of the accident and were able to put out the blaze
The man , who is thought to be 40 - years - old and from Hertfordshire , suffered facial , back injuries and a suspected leg injury in the crash .
A spokeswoman for the East of England Ambulance Service said the pilot was conscious and in a stable condition when taken by ambulance to Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow , Essex .
Speaking on a flying forum , a fellow pilot described the scene at the airfield after he landed another plane a few moments before the crash .
He said : ' The main runway was closed as it was being used for drag racing , but the cross runway was open .
' I landed on runway 13 a few minutes before the incident and heard but did not see the crash , whilst I was putting the cover on my plane .
There was a mild crosswind .
' An ambulance was at the scene when I left the airfield . '
He added : ' The aircraft was completely wrecked , with everything forward of the cockpit consumed by impact and / or fire , and the car was badly impacted dented and burned out .
‘ The fire was quite fierce for a few minutes , and produced a plume of black smoke .
I am sorry to read that the pilot was injured .
The people in the car were said at the time to be OK ( it was a modern car with side impact protection ) , but I have no confirmation of that .
' I have no idea what happened just before the crash .
Some people at the scene mentioned a control problem , but that might have been speculation .
' Three cheers also for whoever was first on the scene to assist the pilot and the people in the car from the wreckage . '
Station Officer Len Cleary said : ' The pilot was lucky .
It appears that the two people in the car brought him clear of the fire after the collision .
' It is not clear at this stage whether the incident was caused by mechanical failure or human error .
' The volunteer fire team acted swiftly to cover the scene with a blanket of foam so when we arrived the fire was under control .

THE Crocodile Dundee star Paul Hogan allegedly committed tax fraud by deliberately misleading both Australian and American tax authorities about his residency status .
According to confidential documents released yesterday , the actor , 70 , was allegedly in effect '' stateless ' ' , telling the US authorities he was paying tax in Australia while simultaneously telling the Tax Office he was paying tax in the US .
The details of Hogan 's allegedly fraudulent tax arrangements were released yesterday after he lost a High Court battle to keep secret 108 pages of confidential advice from the accountancy firm Ernst & Young and his former accountant Tony Stewart .
In unanimously dismissing Hogan 's appeal , the High Court also granted access to the Australian Crime Commission 's outline of its case against the actor .
Earlier today we noted how Grover Norquist is continuing to come under attack from Religious Right leaders for having signed on to serve on the board of GOProud , the conservative gay organization .
While Norquist has yet to fight back , GOProud is not being so cautious , blasting the Family Research Council as a bunch of phony conservatives and calling them ( and Mike Huckabee ) “ dinosaurs headed to political extinction “ :
Today , GOProud , the only national organization of gay conservatives and their allies , responded to attacks from the anti-gay Family Research Council .
“ Over the last week , the Family Research Council has shown its true colors – attacking GOProud for working with the National Rifle Association and Gun Owners of America to protect 2nd Amendment rights , attacking GOProud for supporting cutting taxes on American families , and for supporting the free market healthcare reform proposal offered by Senators Richard Burr ( R - NC ) and Tom Coburn , M.D. ( R - OK ) , ” said Jimmy LaSalvia , Executive Director .
“ These attacks make it clear the Family Research Council does n’t care one iota about the conservative agenda . ”
GOProud is n’t the only organization that has come under fire from Tony Perkins and company .
In March , Perkins attacked tea party organizations , Freedom Works , and the Contract from America .
Perkins ’ attacks followed former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee ’s criticism of the Conservative Political Action Conference , an event GOProud sponsored .
“ We wear attacks from Tony Perkins and the Family Research Council as badges of honor , ” said Christopher Barron , Chairman of GOProud ’s Board .
“ The rise of the new right and the tea party movement in this country is a total reputation of their ‘ big government conservatism . ”
“ Tony Perkins and his cronies at the Family Research Council are n’t for limited government , ” continued Barron .
“ They support policies , like the federalization of marriage and family laws , which would represent one of the greatest usurpation of state ’s rights in the history of this country . ”
“ Tony Perkins referred to GOProud ’s opposition to the death tax and Obamacare as ‘ radical ’ and has singled out our organization ’s support for urban economic empowerment zones first championed by conservative icon Jack Kemp , ” said LaSalvia .
“ Maybe Tony Perkins could explain to conservatives everywhere exactly what is so radical about supporting these conservative policies ? ”
“ Big government conservatives like Tony Perkins and Mike Huckabee are dinosaurs , headed to political extinction .
The truth is that the conservative movement has moved on , and has done so without them , ” concluded LaSalvia .

Experimenting on Native American Indians
( Natural News )
When a person signs up to participate in medical research , he or she is given a form to sign that is supposed to state the goal of the study as well as all the known possible risks of the drug or procedure being tested .
But a new report by researchers from the University of Pennsylvania Law School and Columbia University concludes informed consent forms are often too long and complicated -- full of legalese and technical gobbledygook -- for many people to understand .
For anyone who takes a look at the sometimes shameful history of human experimentation in this country , even the slightest concern research subjects are not fully informed is worrisome .
One of the most heartbreaking cases of study participants denied informed consent involved the infamous Tuskegee Syphilis Study .
Between 1932 and 1972 , the U.S. Public Health Service conducted experiments on 399 poor African - American men suffering from syphilis .
The men were never told what disease they had or its seriousness .
Instead , they were told they were being treated for " bad blood " by doctors who had no intention of curing them of syphilis at all .
In fact , the goal was to collect data from the men's bodies after they died from the excruciating effects of untreated syphilis .
In 1966 , Henry K Beecher , M.D. , published a scholarly article , " Ethics and Clinical Research , " that documented 22 unethical research trials published in U.S. medical journals since World War II .
The paper revealed horrendously dangerous experiments conducted on unsuspecting research subjects .
For example , malignant cells from cancer patients were injected into elderly and debilitated inmates of the Jewish Chronic Disease Hospital -- people who were incapable of giving informed consent
No one is suggesting that the horrors of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study or the unethical research described by Dr. Beecher are still taking place in the 21st century .
However , there are reasons to be concerned that many people participating in medical studies as research subjects are not always given comprehensible or accurate information .
A case in point : in a high - profile legal case last April , a Native American tribe won a substantial settlement from Arizona State University because blood samples provided by Havasupai tribe members were used for purposes never revealed in the consent forms they signed .
A researcher told the Indians , who live in the Grand Canyon , their blood samples would be used to find out why the tribe had high rates of diabetes .
The blood was actually used to study rates of schizophrenia and for racial migration research .
For the new review of informed consent forms , which was just published in the journal , the authors examined the accuracy and length of research consent forms used for 215 studies by one department in a major academic center over the past 25 years .
Their conclusion ?
There is both good news and bad news .
The actual information in consent forms has become far more accurate over time .
However , the consent forms have become increasingly lengthier and more complicated -- growing from an average of a paragraph or two to more than four and a half pages .
The study authors cited data showing that these longer , wordier consent forms " are unlikely to be read , perhaps in part because of the time involved . "
And that raises the obvious question : if informed consent forms are not being read and understood before they are signed , what is the true state of genuinely informed consent among today 's medical research subjects ?
Fieldwork in Afghanistan is not like most geology fieldwork .
“ When I landed , the first thing I had to do was to put on a bulletproof vest , ” says Tom Mack .
He was part of a U.S. Geological Survey team that evaluated water resources in the Kabul Basin , in the north - central part of eastern Afghanistan , a couple of years ago .
“ It was strange to wear the vest , but eventually you get used to it . ”
There was a lot to get used to , he says .
No matter where Mack went , he had to get special permission to be there .
His team also always had to travel with a special security team in a reinforced vehicle mainly limited to the city of Kabul .
Working in collaboration with the Afghanistan Geological Survey and Ministry of Energy and Water , USGS began to study the Kabul Basin in 2004 .
Kabul , the capital of the country , sits at an elevation of 1,791 meters at the confluences of the Kabul River , Logar River and Paghman Stream .
Roughly 3 million people live in the sprawling city .
“ Our goal was to develop a better understanding of how much water is available , how much is being used and what the quality is , ” Mack says .
Despite the inflow from the three rivers , Kabul relies principally on groundwater for drinking and irrigation .
With already limited water supplies , the basin ’s residents have suffered as a result of a decade - long drought , when the Kabul River has stopped flowing during parts of the year .
Also lurking on the horizon is global warming , which has shrunk many of the glaciers that provide water for these aquifers .
Further exacerbating the problem is long - running warfare in Afghanistan .
First , the Soviets invaded in 1979 , then civil war ensued , with the Taliban taking over in 1996 , and then the United States moved in after 9/11 .
Military operations have ruined irrigation systems and dams , increased thefts of parts necessary for irrigation , reduced the number of people with in - country expertise and restricted access to experts studying water resources .
Since 1980 , all 18 of the country ’s meteorological and hydrological stations have been destroyed .
In addition , tens of thousands of refugees have fled from unsafe , drought - wracked areas to the water - starved Kabul Basin .
All of these factors conspire to heighten not only concerns for future water availability but also for security in one of the harshest environments on Earth .
But USGS and the U.S. military and coalition forces are working to more efficiently use the region ’s water .
Geology and Water
Geologically , Afghanistan consists of numerous crustal blocks that began to be sutured together between 100 million and 5 million years ago .
Millions of years of continental collisions have created complex and varied geology , as well as topography .
More than half the country is greater than 2,000 meters above sea level , with rugged mountains and high deserts with little vegetation accounting for much of the land , making the terrain difficult to impossible to pass through , says
John “ Jack ” Shroder , co-founder of the Afghanistan Studies Center at the University of Nebraska at Omaha , who has been working in Afghanistan on and off for 40 years .
The highest summits are in the Hindu Kush , part of the Himalayas , which rise to nearly 7,500 meters .
Because of the ongoing continental collisions , Afghanistan is riddled with faults that produce strong earthquakes .
Thanks to the topography and geology , the country also faces flooding events , severe soil degradation and desertification , and frequent severe droughts , which only intensify the use of its limited natural freshwater supplies .
Snowfields and glaciers cover much of the higher mountain ranges , especially in the Hindu Kush , and provide 80 percent of the country ’s water resources .
Three great river systems run throughout the country : the Amu Darya River in the north , the Helmand River in the southwest and the Kabul River in the east .
The water in these rivers comes primarily from runoff from snow and glacial melt in the high mountains .
After dropping from the peaks , rivers flow into valleys and desert plains that surround the centrally located mountains .
Some rivers continue into surrounding countries , such as Iran , Pakistan and Tajikistan , creating a potentially volatile water situation , Shroder notes .
Afghanistan also has a sizable supply of groundwater in many of the desert basins , including the Kabul Basin .
Groundwater sits beneath the surface at depths ranging from about 1.5 to 68 meters .
The groundwater is exploitable , even at those depths , and the Afghans have been using these resources for millennia .
For more than 3,000 years , Afghans have relied on an ancient system of hand dug , horizontal tunnels known as karez , for important sources of water .
After digging down into the alluvial fans at the base of the mountains , the Afghans then dug out the horizontal tunnels that carry groundwater gently downslope from the alluvial fans to basins hundreds to thousands of meters away , where the water emerges laterally outward .
Length and depth of the tunnels depend upon the amount of seasonal rainfall , with wetter areas generally having shorter , shallower “ mother wells . ”
In a 2002 study , Asad Sarwar Qureshi , acting director of the International Water Management Institute ’s Pakistan office , found 6,741 karez systems in Afghanistan .
These tunnel systems discharged at a rate of between 10 and 200 liters per second and irrigated 163,000 hectares , primarily in the south and southwest parts of Afghanistan .
“ Karez irrigation is environmentally benign because only the waters at the top of the water table are tapped , whereas borehole wells with pumps use much larger amounts of water and can over - exploit the resource , ” Shroder says .
Furthermore , he adds , in such an arid country , a subterranean system like the karez can significantly reduce water loss through evaporation .
However , although they have lasted millennia , by 2008 some 60 to 70 percent of the karez systems were “ not in use , out of order , dried - up or with only low discharge due to drought conditions in recent years , low precipitation and consequently low groundwater discharge , ” a report in the journal Water International noted last September .
And now most of the country ’s irrigation is done through open - water canals , which are much less water - efficient .
Problems of Late
Afghanistan has been in a deep drought since 1997 , and the inefficient use of water for irrigation is exacerbating the problem .
This includes evapotranspiration , leakage and overwatering of crops .
Since 1980 , the total acreage under irrigation has dropped in half with a subsequent national food deficit of 30 percent , according to Qureshi ’s 2002 paper .
One of the few benefits of drought has been a reduction in opium poppy production .
Suppressed during the reign of the Taliban , poppy cultivation exploded again after the U.S. military moved in in 2001 , with Afghanistan becoming the world ’s largest producer of opium .
After the U.S. and coalition forces arrived in Afghanistan , the Taliban did an about - face and began to support opium production , finding that it was not only a source of money but also a useful recruitment tool .
Whenever outside forces destroy a field of poppies , the Taliban “ offers ” to protect the crop in the future in return for control in the area — thereby gaining a new recruit or at least a supporter .
But this tactic may not withstand the lingering drought :
An annual United Nations assessment of Afghan poppy cultivation reports a 19 percent drop in total poppy acreage in 2008 from the peak in 2007 , and predicts further reduction in 2009 .
Of course , this drought also ruins other crops , including fruit and nuts , and with only 12 percent of the land even remotely arable , that does not portend an auspicious future .
Warming will not help matters either .
At the fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union last December in San Francisco , Calif. , Shroder described a study of 30 randomly chosen glaciers in the Great Pamir , in the country ’s northeast corner .
Working with the Global Land Ice Measurements from Space program ( which involves 60 institutions worldwide , from government agencies to universities ) , he found that 28 of the glaciers retreated from 1976 to 2003 , with the largest retreat rate of 36 meters per year .
What Shroder and others have not determined , however , is exactly how much water is coming out of the streams .
The country is too dangerous to put people on the ground checking discharge , he says , so researchers rely on less - detailed technology such as satellite data and aerial photography .
Aerial photography shows that tributary glaciers have separated from main glaciers , high - altitude lakes have formed , and proglacial lakes ( formed by a retreating glacier ) have increased in size and frequency .
Even without the hard data , Shroder says , climate change means reduced water availability for irrigation .
In particular , less glacial ice , smaller snowpacks and more precipitation falling as rain than snow results in two problems :
Spring melt comes earlier and less water is available in summer to supply late season crops .
Dams and diversions further reduce the water available for drinking or irrigation — and this is becoming a more pressing issue .
“ The water treaties with surrounding governments have not been renewed since the 1930s , ” Shroder says .
“ They need to be renegotiated because if the Afghans want dams — and they do for irrigation and power generation — the countries around them will freak out . ”
Tensions are already high .
In May 2008 , Shroder says , an unidentified group of Iranians crossed into southwestern Afghanistan and bulldozed a diversion of the Helmand River to their benefit .
Nobody responded because no American troops were present , and the Afghans did n’t want a fight that could escalate , Shroder says .
The story did not appear in the news .
Any increased exploitation and consumptive use of these precious water resources inside Afghanistan could “ be a destabilizing influence ” due to the age of the cross - border water treaties , Shroder says .
Such issues need to be renegotiated before serious development can be undertaken in Afghanistan .
That necessitates a strong and sovereign functioning national government .
The Added Problem of Guests
Of course , Afghans are n’t the only ones relying on the country ’s water supply right now .
When the United States invaded Afghanistan following 9/11 , the military moved in and set up camp throughout the country .
“ The military needs water , ” Shroder notes , so at their bases and camps , “ the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers pops a well down and pumps out water , which is clean and good . ”
The problem arises when the military pumps water indiscriminately — “ without too much thought ” about possible adverse effects on a nearby karez , which might be supplying water to local villages , he says .
In a few short weeks , such a well can suck a karez dry .
“ And if you screw up the karez , you make more enemies . ”
Although U.S. forces may not have considered potential impacts on water supplies during the early days of the war , by 2005 that was no longer the case , says Major Christopher Gellasch , a U.S. Army Environmental Science Officer who was deployed in Afghanistan from April 2005 to April 2006 as the commander of the 71st Medical Detachment ( Preventive Medicine ) .
A geologist by training , Gellasch ’s duties included water sampling missions and water well evaluations for U.S. and coalition forces .
“ The military knows it ’s going to be in Afghanistan for a while , so we understand that we have to take care of water resources , ” Gellasch says .
But the military faces difficult challenges .
The rugged terrain makes water acquisition challenging , and there is little to no infrastructure , such as water treatment plants and treated water distribution systems .
Furthermore , each military base supports between 100 and 10,000 people .
That means a lot of water is needed — somewhere between 50 and 120 liters per day per soldier , depending on the level of infrastructure , he says .
Because of concerns about contamination and availability , U.S. and coalition forces use well water primarily for nondrinking purposes , such as personal hygiene and laundry , Gellasch says .
For drinking water , the military relies on bottled water .
To supply the rest of the water necessary for the bases , however , the military is trying to get a better sense of the overall water situation .
Not surprisingly , Gellasch says , the U.S. and coalition forces generally lack a detailed understanding of local geologic conditions at U.S. forward operating bases ( FOBs ) , which are smaller bases ( 100 to 1,000 troops ) used to support tactical operations without setting up full support systems .
When Gellasch and others in preventive medicine tried to bring in military well - drilling crews , they discovered that none were available to be deployed in Afghanistan .
Furthermore , unfortunately , many of the local drillers , even those who have been working in the region for years , have a more limited understanding of the water situation than might be hoped — meaning they may know where to drill but not how that water source connects to other sources in the region — and there are few details on where old , existing wells may be located , virtually no records of any water testing of any recent ( or old ) wells , and no well log data .
So even though the military is working with locals , they may not seal well heads or properly case and screen wells .
As a result , FOBs often end up with poorly built wells , which has regularly led to coliform bacteria contamination from nearby sanitation sources , at least according to the many tests Gellasch and his colleagues have run .
This is easily treated by chlorination , he adds .
The groundwater itself tends to be of high quality , Gellasch says .
One advantage of working in a country with little industry is a lack of industrial contaminants seeping into groundwater , he says .
The local geology has left the groundwater with what appear to be minor amounts of boron , arsenic and sodium , but most concentrations are not high enough to cause adverse health effects .
Furthermore , such contaminants are easily treated with water treatment programs , such as using reverse osmosis .
In the eight years that U.S. and coalition forces have been in Afghanistan , many issues have begun to change , Gellasch says .
In particular , more advance planning is taking place .
Specialists are now able to go in and conduct site assessments to determine what environmental needs should be addressed .
These include water and sanitation issues , as well as checking for potential disease vectors such as mosquitoes and sand fleas .
The Good News
Drought or no drought , “ water is absolutely critical to peace in Afghanistan , ” Shroder says .
“ Thirsty , starving people are very dangerous people , and we have n’t always been smart in Afghanistan . ”
There is good news , though , he says .
“ The huge groundwater resources have not been properly exploited . ”
Asad Sarwar Qureshi estimated in 2002 that annual per capita water availability in Afghanistan is 2,500 cubic meters , as compared to 1,400 cubic meters for Iran and 1,200 cubic meters for Pakistan .
At present , Afghans use only around 1,700 cubic meters per person each year .
So there is enough water for the residents .
Additionally , what is there is of generally high quality .
However , much more information is needed , Shroder says .
Tom Mack and his USGS co-workers plan to publish the results of their study of the Kabul Basin ’s water supplies sometime this year .
The amount of water varies widely across the basin , as does recharge , so that some areas have plenty of water and others have little .
For example , they found that recharge was very low at a refugee camp north of Kabul .
“ We hope that our data can lead to better management decisions , ” Mack says .
He adds that one problem throughout the valley was fecal contamination of water , due to poorly built wells and bad sanitation .
Mack and his colleague Ingrid Verstraeten , who works in the International Water Resources Branch of USGS , say USGS is determined to help Afghan scientists and resource managers be more self - sufficient and manage their own resources sustainably .
“ We want to empower our Afghan colleagues to make sound , informed science - based decisions on sustainable use of their water resources , ” Verstraeten says .
USGS employees have shown the Afghans how to use updated computers and software and how to collect water data .
“ I feel we have moved forward quite significantly in the last few years , ” Verstraeten says .
Signs point to additional funding from the United States , Verstraeten says .
Furthermore , U.S. President Barack Obama said during a recent speech at the State Department that he was emphasizing “ soft policies , ” such as science , to help drive decision - making regarding Afghanistan .
“ If we — the U.S. and international community — curtail terrorism , we will have an increased opportunity to aid our Afghan colleagues in a very positive manner and lead them to a prosperous future , ” Mack says .
“ Afghanistan is blessed with lots of natural resources , including water .
If we can build capacity for the sustainable and wise use of these natural resources , we will move Afghanistan toward a prosperous future . ”
And a prosperous future for Afghanistan bodes well for a secure future .

WASHINGTON , June 22 ( Reuters ) - A U.S. judge on Tuesday ruled against the Obama administration ’s six - month moratorium on deepwater drilling in the wake of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , a blow to the White House which had hoped the ban would provide time to ensure other wells are operating safely .
A lawsuit was filed by Louisiana - based Hornbeck Offshore Services LLC HOS.N and was joined by more than a dozen companies involved in offshore drilling operations to reverse the drilling ban imposed by the U.S. Department of Interior .
A federal judge in Louisiana granted the drillers ’ request for a preliminary restraining order that would prevent the ban from taking effect .

TWO Victorian men required surgery to remove slug pellets from their backsides after playfully shooting each other with an air rifle to see whether it would hurt .
The 34 - year - old mates were enjoying a Sunday afternoon beer drinking session when they decided to shoot one another with an air rifle to see whether it would penetrate their skin or cause pain , Victoria Police said .
The men , from the Grampians region in Victoria 's west , took it in turns to shoot each other in the backside and the leg about 5.30 pm ( AEST ) on Sunday .
They thought they were fine but were admitted to hospital two days later requiring surgery to remove slug pellets from their rear ends and legs , police said .
The men will be interviewed by police at a later date when their medical condition improves , police said .
One man will have his firearm licence withdrawn and his firearms confiscated after the incident .
Today ’s world is a complicated environment to maneuver through .
With all that we have to do on a daily basis – just to take care of day - to - day things – it is very difficult to imagine how one would deal with a legal issue .
The bottom line question really comes down to when one would need to hire a lawyer .
Sure , we can all deal with simple matters , like parking tickets , but what do you do if more serious legal matters need to be dealt with ?
Just when do you seek professional legal counsel instead of trying to tackle a complicated legal issue on your own ?
To answer these questions for you , we have put together a basic primer on why you might need to hire a lawyer for legal assistance .
The legal world can be quite confusing to those of us who do n’t deal with it on a regular basis , so please read up on the most common circumstances that call for the professional counsel / guidance of a lawyer .
Criminal Charges and Hiring a Lawyer
None of us ever want to face a situation where legal charges are being pressed against us .
It goes without saying , of course , that most people do n’t consider themselves criminals per se .
However , if a criminal charge is brought against you – be it for driving while intoxicated or domestic violence – it is very important to have a top notch lawyer on your side .
Failure to have a good criminal defense lawyer could mean that you wind up having to pay big fines , on probation , or worst case scenario , actually behind bars doing time in jail .
If you have been charged with any type of criminal activity , be it a misdemeanor or a felony charge , you must seek a professional lawyer ’s assistance immediately !
Legal Defense from Civil Suits
It is not always the long arm of the law that can cause you legal headaches .
We live in a very litigious society , one where people have become a little bit “ sue - happy ” so to say .
As such , more and more people find themselves on the receiving end of civil law suits each and every day .
You do n’t have to be a big , million dollar corporation to get sued these days .
People get sued for a variety of reasons , ranging from simple car accidents to cases of professional negligence .
And since a civil suit can result in huge settlement payments that you must make , it is essential to have a lawyer on your team to help provide you with the defense that you deserve .
You ca n’t count on just your word or even your insurance coverage to provide you with a good defense when a civil suit is leveled against you .
Instead , make the smart decision and set up a meeting with a lawyer in your area to talk about the civil case you are involved with .
Getting Your Legal House in Order
So far we ’ve talked about lawyers coming to the rescue and helping you out during some pretty trying scenarios .
But there are times when you should hire a lawyer that do n’t necessarily involve you actually having to go to court .
You may be interested in setting up a will or some other type of legal documents .
It can be very difficult to file legal documents properly , without the assistance of a crack legal professional .
Lawyers are trained on what needs to be done to file your legal documents properly , so you will have the peace of mind that comes with knowing your legal paperwork is processed properly .
You do n’t want to make any mistakes when filing legal documents , so be sure to get guidance from a lawyer prior to filing any type of paperwork that is legally binding .
Do n’t Provide Your Own Legal Counsel
The worst thing you can do when legal proceedings are in your future is to try to be your own legal counsel .
Unless you happen to be a well - trained legal professional , you could end up making some mistakes that may cost you a lot of money , or lead to potentially big trouble .
Lawyers practice their craft each and every day .
They go through a lot of schooling to learn the complexities and letter of the law .
Be sure that you always at least meet with a lawyer first , before you make any decisions that might have ramifications on your freedom , your money or your future well - being .
Tax Attorney
Another good reason to have a lawyer is to reduce your tax payment .
A good tax attorney can advise you on your tax matters and help you save on the tax .
We hope this primer helps you to realize why you might need to hire a lawyer .
Life is difficult enough as it is , you do n’t need complications from criminal or civil charges making things more complicated for you or your family .
Always seek professional legal guidance if you have even the slightest doubt about something that pertains to complicated legal matters .
Why Pay More ?
Every month , we publish our Best Gaming CPUs For The Money column .
This is where we share our picks for the processors that we feel provide the best gaming value for your hard - earned dollar .
Our recommendations are based on a lot of testing , and that testing has shown that games respond best to high clock speeds .
However , our benchmarks also show that the number of processor cores is a secondary consideration .
There is a large performance jump from single - to dual - core CPUs , but most games only show a slight performance increase when a third core is added .
In fact , it is rare to find a game that will take advantage of more than three processor cores and demonstrate a notable performance increase .
Since its release , the Athlon II X3 440 has had a strong impact on our recommended gaming CPU list .
When you combine its high 3 GHz clock speed , trio of processor cores , and sub -$ 90 price tag , you end up with a real force in the gaming arena .
On top of that , the third processing core allows the Athlon II X3 to be an especially great processor compared to dual - core models because that extra core can smooth out desktop performance when multitasking .
When it comes to gaming , though , the CPU can only do so much ; the graphics subsystem is key .
We 've received some feedback on the forums suggesting that our recommendation of any processor more expensive than the Athlon II X3 440 is frivolous .
The argument is that , while game performance may increase with a costlier CPU , the money is wasted because the Athlon II X3 440 is supplying all the performance that games require to achieve smooth frame rates , and that upgrading the graphics cards is the only way to remove a meaningful game performance bottleneck .
We decided to run a series of tests to really explore whether or not there 's any point in investing in a CPU more powerful than the Athlon II X3 440 for gaming duty .
First , we need to examine how we measure game performance and get a better understanding of how meaningful the numbers are .
On May 28 , a press conference was held in the South Visitors ’ Center on Temple Square to unveil a new public exhibit : a cut - away scale model showing the interior architecture and layout of the Salt Lake Temple .
The LDS Newsroom and Deseret News posted detailed stories with additional images ; in this post I just want to toss out a few ideas for discussion .
First , why did n’t someone think of this thirty years ago ?
That reaction , of course , just highlights how informative and helpful the exhibit is .
All good ideas have a we - should - have - thought - of - this - before quality .
For visitors , the exhibit dispels the natural misconception that the interior of the temple is similar to the interior of most Christian cathedrals : a large , open , dimly lit chamber furnished with wooden pews and marble statues .
The exhibit shows how different is the interior of an LDS temple .
Even Mormons who often frequent the Salt Lake Temple will find the exhibit interesting , as it shows areas and rooms not generally seen , such as the large assembly room on the upper floor .
On the other hand , I ’m not sure this would have been an acceptable Visitors ’
Center exhibit thirty years ago .
While I doubt this exhibit is in direct response to the Big Love depiction of the interior of an LDS temple , it certainly reflects a more open and public discussion of LDS doctrine and practice than was the norm a couple of generations ago .
Two General Authorities spoke at the press conference , Elder Hinckley , the executive director of the Missionary Department , and Elder Walker , the executive director of the Church ’s Temple Department .
That ’s a subtle reminder that every LDS - operated historical site is staffed and operated by missionaries .
As door - to - door tracting and street contacting become less welcome and less productive , alternative approaches ( member referrals , interactive online discussion , historical sites ) become more valuable as missionary outreach tools .
Update ( 6/14 ) : Discover 's Phil Plait published a post disagreeing with Soneira 's assertions , and we 've published Soneira 's full statement .
The iPhone 4's screen may be the best mobile display yet , but its resolution does not exceed the human retina , as Steve Jobs claims .
The math just does n't add up , said Raymond Soneira , president of DisplayMate Technologies , who explained that the iPhone 4's purported " retina display " was a misleading marketing term .
" It is reasonably close to being a perfect display , but Steve pushed it a little too far , " Soneira said .
During his keynote speech , Jobs said the iPhone 4's display had a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch .
He claimed that this resolution exceeds the limit of the human retina , which Jobs said was 300 pixels per inch for a display about a foot away .
" It turns out there 's a magic number right around 300 pixels per inch , that when you hold something around to 10 to 12 inches away from your eyes , is the limit of the human retina to differentiate the pixels , " Jobs said .
Soneira , who possesses a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from Princeton and has been studying displays for 20 years , said it was inaccurate to measure the resolution of the eye in terms of pixels , because the eye actually has an angular resolution of 50 cycles per degree .
Therefore , if we were to compare the resolution limit of the eye with pixels on a screen , we must convert angular resolution to linear resolution .
After conversions are made , a more accurate " retina display " would have a pixel resolution of 477 pixels per inch at 12 inches , Soneira calculated .
He noted , however , that he was confident Apple will have the best phone display on the market .
Like the iPad 's LCD display , the iPhone 4's screen features In - Plane Switching technology , in which crystal molecules are oriented so their motion is parallel to the panel rather than perpendicular .
For viewers , the result is a very wide viewing angle — up to 180 degrees — with brilliant color .
Soneira added that we might not realistically need anything better than 326 ppi .
For comparison , glossy magazines are typically printed at 300 dots per inch .
Soneira said he wanted to highlight that " retina display " is a symptom of a larger problem of market puffery in the display industry .
Basically , many manufacturers exaggerate claims about their display specifications — everything from resolution to viewing angle , and from brightness to contrast — and they have to do it because everyone is doing it .
" The marketing puffery is now in control , " Soneira said .
" Everything that 's being said now is just this superamplified imaginary nonsense , and the only way to get people 's attention now is making more outlandish statements . "
For example , Soneira discarded Sharp 's Quattron TVs that claimed to display four primary colors ( as opposed to the traditional three ) as utter nonsense .
He explained in an earlier Maximum PC guest article that all television and movie content is produced and color balanced in the traditional RGB color arrangement .
Sharp Quattron 's fourth primary color is yellow , and there is nothing for it to do because yellow is already reproduced with mixtures of the red and green primaries , he said .
" [ Market puffery ] hurts companies that make good products , like Apple , because they can't really put the specs out because everybody is lying , " Soneira said .
" If you and I have the world 's greatest display , and we launched it and put down the real scientific numbers , we'd go bankrupt because our numbers would look like the worst display being made . "

The year is 1971 in a small village called Darvaza ( or Derweze ) about 260 km north of the capital Ashgabat , Turkmenistan .
Back then it was part of the Soviet Union and the area was ( and still is ) quite resource - rich .
One day , amidst the drilling and vodka , geologists accidentally punched into a massive underground natural gas cavern .
This led to the ground collapsing , the entire drilling rig falling in , and a subsequent crater 300 + feet wide ( 90 + meters ) and 65 + feet deep ( 20 + meters ) .
And what was the solution to curbing the raging emissions of natural gas ?
BURN IT .
And so it has for the last 38 years .

A little background on the country of Turkmenistan :
– After 69 years as part of the Soviet Union ( including 67 years as a union republic ) , Turkmenistan declared its independence on 27 October 1991
– With a population just over 5 million , over 80 % of the country is covered by the Karakum Desert
– Half of the country ’s irrigated land is planted with cotton , making it the world ’s tenth - largest producer .
It also possesses the world ’s fifth - largest reserves of natural gas and substantial oil resources
– In 2004 , the unemployment rate was estimated to be 60 % , their GDP per capita is rougly $ 5,710 , and is among the twenty countries in the world with the highest perceived level of corruption

" The egg is arguably what makes a breakfast sandwich a breakfast sandwich .
And sadly , we 've been conditioned to expect the pre-made egg - loaf - spongy - patty - blob - thing . "
Even people who swear they wo n't touch fast - food seem to make exceptions for breakfast sandwiches .
Something about the combination of egg , melted cheese , salty meat , and toasted bread is so satisfying , not to mention a lifesaver on those especially rough mornings .
You go from zero to feeling - more - like - a - real - person in just a few bites .
Sure , it 's not that hard to make one at home , and even tastier with just - fried eggs ( try not to think about the pre-cooked egg loaf on most fast - food sandwiches too hard ) but sometimes you just need to grab one on the go .
For a whole week , we gathered around the big table at Serious Eats headquarters ( Ed has been known to call it the stadium ) at 10 a.m. every morning to nibble on breakfast sandwiches ( note : no breakfast burritos , but we made an exception for one wrap ) from various fast - fooderies to think really hard about each component :
Bread : Toasted ?
Fresh - tasting ?
Good on its own , or just a tool to hold the sandwich together ?
Chewy ?
Too much chew ?
This raises the question of bagels — are they an appropriate breakfast sandwich bread ?
We all agreed the answer is often no because there 's too much bready mass , which throws off the whole bun - to - insides ratio .

Because that 's a bit of a dealbreaker .

The Winner : White Castle
White Castle , we apologize for having no faith in you at first .
To be honest , we even questioned walking the extra ten blocks to you .
But while staring off into space waiting for our order , we heard a crack — the magical crack that only a real egg could make .
Could it be ?
A real egg ?
Yes .
Finding a fast - foodery that will actually do this for you is rare .
" There 's not enough room .. not enough time . "
But White Caste did n't give us any hogwash excuses .
The fried egg ( you can see the yellow and white parts ! with the real browning around the edges ! it 's so real ! ) goes onto one of the slider buns , with your choice of meat .
The sausage is well - salted , but not in a whoa , settle down , kind of way .
The bacon had the right crispity - pliant balance .
Our only complaint ?
The buns .
They could have been toasted and buttered , but then again , we gobbled it down too fast to care .
Honorable Mention : Wawa's Ham & Cheese Ciabatta Melt
Unfortunately we do n't all live near a Wawa .
But somehow this convenience store chain ( in New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Delaware , Maryland and Virginia ) has a way of putting a spell on people .
The iced tea !
The made - fresh hoagies !
And , if you have n't already , you should add breakfast sandwiches to the list .
Our favorite was the Ham & Cheese Ciabatta Melt ( $ 4.29 ) .
Stuffed with scrambled eggs , deli ham , and Swiss cheese , this thing is massive .
The roll was lightly toasted and by far the best bread of all the Wawa breakfast sandwiches we tried .
It 's a big roll , which could be problematic , but they overstuff it to balance out the ratio of bread - to - innards .
There 's no skimping on the ham either — it had as much meat as the regular hoagies .
And the eggs taste so eggy .
" They 're first frozen then go into a rethermalizer , " a Wawa employee informed us .
Retherma - whatawhat ?
We looked into it , then stopped and just accepted the creamy , fluffy , eggy - tasting goodness .

You can tell much about a person by how they wait tables .
The worse the place , the more you can tell .
Do they take pride in their work in spite of their surroundings ?
Transcending the sullen and dull with a mote of warm light ?
Or , as my TSA associates did , let it be known , in every single movement , how much they loathe their working lives , and you for spending your moments with them ?
St. Christoper , in my rendering , does not look kindly upon their souls .
Yet , tonight , at the Sam Adam ’s bar , by gate 62 , at Newark Airport , was a bright eyed , brown haired , wonder of service , with a killer smile , who transformed my dull hours waiting for a long flight into the extraordinary .
I watched her dance between tables , charming and serving , making the stress and sadness that accumulates in these hopeless places melt away .
There is a rare kind of wonder in watching joy and proficiency combine .
Much too young to call me hon ’ ( as in honey ) , she did it anyway , which had it ’s own unintentional charm .
There should be a shrine in your honor in every airport bar .
A beacon of hope for the huddled masses stuck for far too long in the interstitial purgatory of airports , place so bereft of life that they are driven to drink in such unfortunate confines .
I deem you Nina , the innocent unknowing savior of my pre-red - eye flight evening , as the new patron saint of the weary traveler .
May all who endure the red-eye , the flight delay , and all mindless time in soulless places , learn the wonders of your charms .
Vote For 2010 Candidates Who Support Marijuana Reform In California
On the eve of the California Primary Election , the great people at Drug Policy Forum of California released an election guide .
Considering the fact that this is a history setting election , in regards to marijuana policy in California , this is EXTREMELY valuable .
I would like to personally thank Drug Policy Forum of California for granting us permission to post their guide on TWB .
With no further interruption , here is the guide posted below :
Although the major candidates for state office have predictably declared themselves in opposition to this year ’s legalization initiative , certain candidates have distinguished themselves as being more supportive than others on marijuana and drug reform issues .
GOVERNOR — Neither party offers a significant choice .
Republican front - runner Meg Whitman has declared , “ I am absolutely , 100 % not in favor of legalizing marijuana for any reason . ”
Whitman donated big bucks to help defeat Prop 5 , the “ Non-Violent Offenders Rehabilitation Act ” in 2008 .
Whitman is the former CEO of Ebay , whose subsidiary PayPal has a policy of blackballing medical cannabis businesses .
Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner ’s website declares that he “ will fight all efforts to legalize marijuana and will be a strong advocate against its recreational use . ”
Poizner ’s actual views may be more nuanced ; when teaching at Mount Pleasant High School , he invited NORML to debate marijuana legalization before his civics class .
However , Poizner ’s campaign has taken a rightward drift to cater to hard - core Republican conservatives ,
Democrat Jerry Brown faces token opposition .
Brown signed California ’s path - breaking decriminalization law back in 1975 , but did little to advance drug reform subsequently .
As Attorney General , Brown deserves credit for having issued reasonable guidelines for medical marijuana enforcement .
On the other hand , he actively campaigned to kill the Three - Strikes Reform initiative and the Non-Violent Offenders Rehabilitation Act ( Prop 5 ) .
“ I ’m not going to jump on the legalization bandwagon , ” said Brown , “ We ’re going to get a vote of the people soon on that , but I ’m not going to support it . ”
Among Brown ’s lesser - known competitors , MoveOn.org founder Peter Schurman endorses the TaxCannabis2010 initiative .
ATTORNEY GENERAL —
This is the most crucial race , since the tenant becomes the state ’s chief law enforcement officer and oversees the Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement .
California has been fortunate to have two consecutive A.G.s supportive of Proposition 215 , but past gains will be endangered if this election goes the wrong way .
This could well happen if the leading Republican contender , LA D.A. Steve Cooley , wins office .
Although Cooley is being lauded by the press for his moderate views on certain issues , such as Three Strikes enforcement , his views on marijuana are hardly moderate .
Cooley spearheaded the effort to close down Los Angeles ’ dispensaries , wrongly insisting that sales of medical marijuana are illegal under state law .
Such views could make him an extremely dangerous A.G. Cooley is also a vocal opponent of the TC2010 initiative .
Cooley ’s primary opponents offer no better , coming from the strident law - and - order wing of the party : State Senator Tom Harman had a perfect 0 % voting record on marijuana and drug reform issues in the legislature , while Chapman Law School professor John Eastman denounces marijuana as “ addictive ” and legalization as “ dangerous . ”
It will be up to the Democrats to offer an A.G. candidate with sympathetic views on marijuana and drug enforcement .
Only one candidate , Emeryville attorney Mike Schmier , has come out in support of the TaxCannabis2010 initiative ; an outsider , Schmier is not regarded as a serious contender .
The leading candidate , S.F. District Attorney Kamala Harris , boasts a strong record of support for civil liberties .
As DA , Harris has been supportive and accessible to medical marijuana advocates , though she is shy about going further .
“ While I support the legal use of medical marijuana , and personally know people who have benefited from its use , I do not support the legalization of marijuana beyond that , ” Harris told the Bay Area Reporter .
Political pros worry that Harris is the Democrat most vulnerable to defeat in the general election due to her supposed weakness on crime , opposition to the death penalty , and an embarrassing police drug lab scandal .
Facebook attorney Chris Kelly , who poured $ 8 millions of his own money into the campaign , is thought to have the best shot at overtaking Harris .
Kelly has progressive views on most issues , though he is coy about legalization .
“ I think that we have to make sure we have a regulatory regime in place around medical marijuana and compassionate use of marijuana before we consider any further steps toward decriminalization or legalization , ” he told the Bay Area Reporter .
Assembly Majority Leader Alberto Torrico of Fremont compiled a decent voting record in the state legislature .
While reported to be sympathetic on marijuana , his views are mixed .
In an op - ed in the San Jose Mercury .
Torrico deplored the lack of oversight of pot doctors and called for “ tough regulations ” of the medical cannabis industry , which he wrote up in a draft bill .
That bill , which was later introduced by Assemblywoman Buchanan as AB 2650 , would have made the siting of dispensaries practically impossible and overridden successful regulatory ordinances in San Francisco , Oakland and elsewhere .
Asssemblyman Pedro Nava of Santa Barbara , a former prosecutor of drug cases , has been more adversarial to marijuana .
Nava jumped into an ugly local battle over dispensaries in Santa Barbara by siding with local groups seeking to ban them .
Assemblyman Ted Lieu of Torrance is a cautious middle - of - the - roader with little record .
He boasts of his endorsement by the California Police Chief ’s Association , bitter opponents of drug reform legislation in Sacramento .
Former LA City Attorney Rocky Delgadillo ran a losing race against Jerry Brown last time around .
Though less obnoxious than his successor as city attorney , Carmen Trutanich , Delgadillo did nothing during his tenure to recommend himself on drug issues .
Lieutenant Governor :
Democrats : SF Mayor Gavin Newsom , famous and infamous for his support of gay marriage , has voiced progressive views on drug policy , though his actions have been more cautious .
Newsom has called the war on drugs a failure and voiced proud support of the city ’s medical cannabis dispensaries .
Having struggled with his own personal drug demon of alcoholism ( he denies the rumors of cocaine ) , Newsom says he welcomes the debate on legalization , but believes a federal solution is required .
LA City Council Member Janice
Hahn says she never used marijuana , but spoke out in support of medical cannabis patients and dispensaries in Los Angeles .
Hahn opposed the City Attorney ’s proposed ban on sales , proposing instead that the city tax medical marijuana .
“ In this current economic crisis , we need to get creative about how we raise funds , ” she said .
Republicans : Incumbent appointee Abel Maldanado of Santa Maria is regarded to be a “ moderate , ” while his major challenger , State Senator Sam Aanestad of Grass Valley , is running to his right .
In the legislature , both followed their party ’s rigid anti-drug line by voting against medical marijuana and drug reform bills , although both backed the hemp cultivation bill , co-sponsored by fellow Republican Chuck Devore .
US Senate :
Incumbent Democrat Barbara
Boxer has done nothing to recommend herself to marijuana supporters in her 18 years in the Senate , backing tough drug sentencing laws and opposing Prop 215 , though she has supported needle exchange .
Boxer has belatedly endorsed medical marijuana , but done nothing to advance it in the Senate .
She faces token opposition from political blogger Mickey Kaus , who has been silent on drug issues .
The Republican primary offers an alternative with sympathetic views on drug reform : former Rep. Tom Campbell , a fiscal conservative with liberal views on social issues .
Campbell compiled an excellent voting record in the legislature and Congress , opposing drug sentencing enhancements and mandatory minimums , endorsing Prop. 36 , and backing needle exchange and medical marijuana .
Campbell was derided by political pundits for suggesting heroin maintenance in his losing campaign against Sen. Feinstein in 2000 .
Campaigning in the Republican primary , he has declined to support the legalization initiative .
Still he says “ I have long favored allowing medical marijuana use .
I have been critical of the use of federal resources to close down medical marijuana dispensaries “ legal in California . ”
If Campbell wins , Boxer may have to fight for votes from the medical marijuana community .
Former H - P exec Carly Fiorina has been campaigning to the right of Campell on social issues .
She opposes decriminalization as well as legalization of marijuana , and states that dispensaries must be “ consistently regulated to ensure they are complying with California ’s medical marijuana law . ”
Assemblyman Chuck Devore of Irvine , the tea party candidate , deserves credit for sponsoring a hemp cultivation bill with Mark Leno .
Nonetheless , on important criminal justice issues , including decriminalization and ending discrimination against medical marijuana patients , he has consistently sided with fellow Republican prohibitionists .
Taking issue with Gov. Schwarzenegger ’s call for a debate on legalization , Devore commented , “ I think this shows the governor ’s growing desperation over the budget . ”
STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION ( 1st Dist ) : Democratic incumbent Betty
Yee deserves special credit for having endorsed Tom Ammiano ’s marijuana legalization bill .
Yee has repeatedly argued that legal marijuana , medical or otherwise , offers a promising source of tax revenue for the state .
LOCAL RACES
ALAMEDA COUNTY Board of Supervisors :
The retirement of two incumbents offers an opportunity to tip the balance of power on this board , which has been resistant to new dispensaries .
Local advocates are supporting Nadia Lockyer in District 2 and Wilma Chan in District 3 , both of whom have been favorable to medical marijuana .
Hayward City Councilman Kevin Dowling , who is running against Lockyer , was instrumental in blocking the restoration of dispensaries to Hayward .
FREMONT ( District 20 ) Assemblymember – Garrett
Yee opposes legalizing marijuana ; opponent Bob Wieckowski supports marijuana legalization .

LOS ANGELES COUNTY : Superior Court Judge — Local MMJ activists are endorsing Tom Griego for judge ; as a prosecutor in the City Attorney ’s office , Griego has favored leniency in marijuana cases
ASSEMBLY DISTRICT 53 ( TORRANCE – VENICE ) —
Running in a field of seven Democrats to fill Ted Lieu ’s open seat , Venice neighborhood councilmember Nick Karno says he favors marijuana legalization , but wants it implemented carefully so that gangs do n’t get control .
Three others have said they support both medical marijuana and taxing and regulating marijuana : Mitch Ward , Edgar Saenz , and Peter Thottam .
MENDOCINO CO .
DISTRICT ATTORNEY : Incumbent DA Meredith Lintott has pressed marijuana prosecutions in a way that her predecessor did not , resulting in prolonged , costly court battles for defendants and the county .
Local medical marijuana advocates are backing attorney David Eyster , who has promised to take a harder look before pressing charges in marijuana cases .
Deputy DA Matt Finnegan , who handled forfeiture cases for Lintott , is regarded to have similar views on marijuana as his boss .
NORTH EAST - CENTRAL STATE — 2nd Assembly District ( Siskiyou - Shasta - Tehama — Glenn — Colusa — Yolo — Sutter ) .
No other Democrat having filed in time to appear on the ballot , Ray Henneman is running a write - in campaign for the opportunity to run against incumbent Republican Jim Nielsen in November .
In a statement in the Record - Searchlight , Hennemann advocated legalizing marijuana at the federal level .
ORANGE COUNTY Sheriff : Candidate Bill
Hunt deserves credit for his statement on marijuana : “ As it stands now , medical marijuana is legal in this state by a vote of the people .
It is not the job of the sheriff to try to circumvent the will of the people by collaborating with the federal government .
If marijuana is legalized I will treat it just like any other legal activity such as the use of alcohol . ”
In contrast , Anaheim PD Chief Craig Hunter has been vocal in supporting the drug war and opposing legalization .
RIVERSIDE COUNTY
DA : Candidate Judge Zellerbach has been reaching out to proponents of medical marijuana in his race against incumbent DA Rod Pacheco , who has been actively hostile to patients ’ collectives and coops .
Also see Medical Cannabis Experts Voter Guide to Riverside County .
SAN LUIS OBISPO County – Sheriff Pat Hedges , who involed the feds in prosecuting Morro Bay dispensary operator Charles Lynch , is leaving office and six candidates are vying for his seat : a retired police chief , a police captain , a retired California Highway Patrol officer , a former police sergeant who was a county supervisor , and two current sheriff ’s deputies .
Four of them made statements about supporting medical marijuana , but not its abuse , to the New Times .
Local activists seem to favor former Pismo Beach Police Chief Joe Cortez or SLO Police Captain Ian Parkinson .
SAN FRANCISCO 8th Congressional District —
Two Republicans are vying for the thankless task of opposing Rep. Nancy Pelosi this November : John Dennis is a libertarian on marijuana and drug war issues ; Dana Walsh represents the more conservative traditionalists .
Democratic Central Committee : Marijuana activist Michael Goldstein is seeking re-election to the party ’s influential central committee .
SISKIYOU COUNTY
Sheriff :
Three out of the four candidates for this open position seem likely to continue Siskiyou ’s tradition of good - ole - boy LEO contempt for medical marijuana .
The fourth , Mt. Shasta Police Chief Parish Cross , deserves consideration for ( reluctantly ) allowing three dispensaries in his town .
SONOMA COUNTY – Local activists , while not exactly unhappy with incumbent DA Stephan Passalaqua , feel challenger Jill Ravitch is listening and more likely to be positively involved in the issue .
Judicial candidate Jamie Thistlethwaite has support of local activists .
In the District 2 State Senate race ( for Pat Wiggins ’ seat ) , which includes Solano and Sonoma ( parts ) , Napa , Lake , Mendocino and Humboldt , progressive Tom Lynch is “ totally in favor of legalization . ”
From the Dutch design firm Studio Wieki Somers come household objects made out of human ashes .
Yes , human ashes .
As in John Steegman ( b. 1939 , d. 1985 ) , who is now a vacuum cleaner :
Somers
thinks there ’s too much conspicuous consumption in the world , so by
turning grandpa into a vacuum cleaner or a rocking chair or whatever ,
she hopes we become more attached to our stuff .
No one would throw out
a family member ’s ashes .
Why toss a dusty old toaster ?
The
scary thing : Technology ’s actually making this possible .
Somers created
the objects on a 3 - D printer .
( Where she got the ashes , we have no
idea , but we ’re , um , dying to know . )
Clearly , the project ’s
meant to freak people out and Somers does n’t really think we should heat
Pop -Tarts with dead bodies .
( At least we hope not . )
In any case , her
point is a good one .
“ A dilemma that questions us most , is the way
technology ( or humanity ) has made it possible to extend our lives
almost endlessly , ” she says .
“ But what is an eternal life good for if
we use it only to continue being excessive consumers who strive for
more and more products , regardless of the consequences ? ” Great question .
Just do n’t bring us back as a toilet plunger .

First of all , I am completely confused and am wondering if this is some kind of horrible mistake .
I had put on my profile that I am studying Polish and German , so the gifts are absolutely perfect .
However , wedged at the bottom was a black fabric thing , inside of which was a MacBook Air .
It wo n't power up and there is no adaptor in the box .
I do n't have access to a MacBoook Air adaptor .
There was also nothing included for me to identify and thank my match personally on Reddit .
I 'm concerned that this is an error of some kind , so if my match could make himself / herself known so that I can give thanks personally , that would be great .
And perhaps see about returning the laptop if actually was in there by mistake - did some helpful child decide to assist with some extra packing ?
During Israel 's takeover of a Turkish ship in the Gaza - bound aid flotilla this week , some passengers tried to take captive three commandos who lost consciousness as a result of the activists ' blows , according to early findings of a navy investigation .
The three were dragged into one of the passenger halls below deck and were held there for several minutes .
After dozens of other commandos began searching the ship , the Mavi Marmara , the three soldiers regained consciousness and managed to join their comrades .
Conversations with senior navy officers in the chain of command during the operation present a different view of the events on Monday .
In Israel , the raid has been perceived as a failure , while abroad it has been derided as piracy or worse .
The navy rejects the claims that it was poorly prepared .
Officials have been commending the commandos ' performance in a situation in which they were confronted by dozens of activists who attacked them as they rappelled from helicopters .
" They were terrorists - hired killers who came to murder soldiers , not to assist the residents of the Gaza Strip , " said a navy officer .
The operation on the Mavi Marmara began at about 4:30 A.M. on Monday .
Because of the presence of hard - core activists including members of the IHH , the Turkish group organizing the aid convoy , most attention went to that ship .
Navy chief Eliezer Merom and the head of the naval commandos , Lt. Col.
A. , were on vessels next to the ship .
Lt. Col. A. climbed on the Mavi Marmara during the takeover .
As seen on a video documenting the takeover , the first four commandos to rappel onto the deck were attacked by activists with bars , axes and knives .
The fourth commando , K. , saw his team leader on the deck , with a Turkish activist holding the pistol he had grabbed from him and pointing it to his head .
K. jumped from the rope and managed to shoot the activist holding the gun .
This happened 20 seconds after the first soldier landed on the deck .
The commanders of the first unit were hit by the mob as they landed .
One of the soldiers managed to fix another rope , after there were problems with the original one , for 10 more soldiers to land .
The commandos cared for the wounded and took over part of the upper deck of the ship .
At this stage , six minutes into the operation , another force landed from a second helicopter , led by a major .
At that point they realized that three commandos were missing and they began looking for them .
A short while later the naval commando chief landed along with dozens more soldiers , some of whom climbed from boats .
Others landed from a third helicopter .
The search involved limited shooting , in the bridge and on the lower deck , until the three men were recovered .
The head of the naval commandos gave orders by radio to use live fire , two minutes after the incident had begun .
Shots had been fired earlier , but Lt. Col .
A. later explained that in his orders he wanted to make sure that the troops realized that " the mood of the incident had changed . "
The soldiers reported that the activists had fired on them during the confrontation and that at least two commandos suffered gunshot wounds .
After the incident , 9 mm bullet casings were found - a kind not used by the naval commandos .
The Israel Defense Forces says that during the operation a number of pistols and an M - 4 rifle were taken from soldiers , but they believe that the Turkish activists had other weapons .
The captain of the ship told the naval commando chief that the guns were thrown overboard before the ship was completely taken over .
The wounded activists were airlifted to Israel for treatment , some seriously hurt whose lives were saved by the evacuation .
The IDF did not question the activists extensively because of the decision to release them .
In conversations after the takeover , activists said they were surprised by the use of helicopters , even though the navy had used this method before .
However , nothing else appears to have surprised them because international law requires sufficient warnings before ships are boarded .
Post - operation assessments have the number of hard - core activists involved in the fighting at between 60 and 100 .
It appears that they were well trained and experienced , especially in view of the arsenal found and code books used to pass on orders from group leaders .
Among the rioters , in addition to Turks , were Yemenis , Afghans and one person from Eritrea .
All were apparently experienced in hand - to - hand fighting .
Some of them did not retreat when shots were fired .
The operation involved a month of training , with dummy takeovers of a ship at sea with 50 soldiers performing the role of activists .
The navy admits that it trained mostly for " a Bil 'in type of opposition , but there was no feeling that this was going to be a walk in the park . "
He was referring to a village at the separation fence where demonstrations take place .
The navy says it needs to look into whether the psychological preparations of the force were sufficient , and whether it had emphasized an easier scenario that did not take place .
The navy says it went over " incidents and responses " in preparation ; these included opening fire at charging activists with melee weapons .
In case of a threat to their lives , the commandos were ordered to shoot to kill even as they were on their way onto the deck .
" The main gap between preparations and intelligence was that we did not know we would face dozens of rioters , " a senior officer involved in the operation said .
" This was not a disturbance that went awry .
It was a planned ambush . "
Another officer added that " I still wake up at 3 A.M. and wonder how the hell we did not know more . "
Another officer said said that " we became a little spoiled , as a society , expecting perfect performances . "
According to a senior officer , " Under the circumstances , and I do not like the result , I think we did the best we could .
We took care of five ships without injuries .
On the sixth ship , we faced a harsh attack and killed nine saboteurs .
" No real peace activist was injured .
No soldier was killed , even though it came pretty close .
In the end the ships are docked at Ashdod .
It was very complicated and the result is near perfect . "

All Species Go Extinct or , S**t Happens
It is a law of nature .
Why would you think it any different for the only extant species of humans ?
We are headed for extinction , like it or not .
What is particularly ironic about our case is that we are the prime instrumental force pushing us to extinction .
In the geological past external events , like comet collisions , were instrumental in causing mass extinction events .
Cyanobacteria evolved from pre-existing anaerobic bacteria , generating oxygen ( by photosynthesis ) and thus killed off a huge number of then existing life forms ( all bacteria ) .
So there is precedence for life itself causing mass extinctions .
But this is probably the first time that one species has triggered events that would lead to its own demise .
The environment of the Earth is forever changing .
And that is the principal cause of species extinction .
A species evolves to ' fit ' a particular environment or niche .
When that environment changes more than the adaptive capacity of the species then the species is no longer fit and extinction ensues .
It is a very old story .
More species have gone extinct over geological time than exist now .
It is the rule , not the exception .
Of course the extinction of a species must be accompanied by the generation of new species that are better able to fill the niches created by the new environments .
Sometimes this leads to explosive speciation ( see : Cambrian explosion for an example ) .
The main contributor to the change of the environment in the near future is us .
As Walt Kelly noted in his famous Pogo cartoon , " We have met the enemy and he is us " .
Energy Decline , Climate Change , Environment Degradation ; The List is Long
We have built an entire human - based ecosystem based on abundant , high - EROI energy in the form of fossil fuels .
We are now dependent on our energy cocoon for existence .
That is our econiche !
And , unfortunately , it is based on energy flows from a finite resource that is now reaching its apex .
From here on out it looks like declining net energy flows are the order of the day .
That means we humans are going to have less so - called wealth in the future .
Not more .
On top of that , in the process of pursuing increasing net energy in the past , when it was feasible , we burned uncounted tons of carbon , producing incredible amounts of CO 2 , a greenhouse gas , that is now coming back to haunt us .
We are changing the very climate of the planet .
And the change is n't looking to be very good for our species , and many others .
On top of that , in the process of chasing the goal of increasing our per-individual ownership of stuff in a throw - away society , we have belched out uncounted tons of garbage and pollutants .
Our clever ( but not sapient ) command over chemistry has produced some toxins of which the effects on us and nature we are only beginning to understand .
And the early evidence is n't particularly encouraging .
Overpopulation is probably our biggest ' sin ' .
Most of our activities , if done in small portions , would not have so grossly overwhelmed the Earth 's capacity to deal .
But there are so many of us , each clamoring for a piece of the action , that we have now succeeded in overcoming the planet 's ability to detoxify what we produce .
Congratulations humanity .
You win .
Earth loses .
But guess what ?
So do you .
We will be the first species on the planet to be the instrument of our own extinction .
Shall I Grieve For Thee ?
This idea is undoubtedly repugnant to the majority of people , possibly the vast majority of readers of this blog !
Very probably many have considered that Homo sapiens would ' one day ' go extinct ; in the very far distant future .
But most of you probably have n't really , seriously , considered that the time of extinction was at hand , even possibly within your own lifetime .
But then , we do n't really think much about our own personal demise , do we ?
Imagine that you have just gotten a check - up with your doctor .
You were experiencing some symptoms that were puzzling and your doctor ordered up some tests .
Now you 're in his office and he has the results .
He says to you : " I 'm sorry to have to tell you but you have an inoperable cancer in your brain and you have only two months to live " .
How would you feel ?
In all likelihood you would react with something like Kübler - Ross 's five stages of grief .
You would first go through a process of denial .
This could n't possibly be ' your ' fate .
As your doctor assures you that the test results are conclusive , you get angry .
How could this happen to you ?
It is n't fair .
Etc .
Now picture the collective reaction to species extinction .
How could this happen to us ?
The Earth doctors have been testing the situation for our planet and our species .
And though it will be hard for most to accept , the results look pretty grim .
We have sealed our own fate .
We are going to die and in the not - too - distant future .
Since I have written extensively in these postings about the nature of the situation I will not go into details here .
It is my considered opinion ( and take that as it may be ) that Homo sapiens has , so to speak , shot its wad .
We gave it our best shot and came up wanting .
But here is the thing .
It was just part of the scheme of nature .
It was n't some cosmic comedy .
We lived as we had evolved to live .
We are what we are and that is all there is to it .
No apologies needed .
We did our best to live as we understood living .
That this has led to our own demise , as a species , should not be lamented .
We should not beat ourselves up for being too unwise to live in a way that would have ensured our eternal continuance .
Such a thing is n't even possible .
The real issue is once we get through the grieving process , can we make appropriate provisions for our successors ?
Oh yes .
There will be successors .
Evolution is n't finished with humanity even if this particular species is finished .
We will have successors .
Just as we make provisions for our children after our own deaths , we must make provisions for our succeeding species .
For such there will be .
What Comes Next ?
Some of you may have read my review of William Catton 's book , Bottleneck ( HERE or on The Oil Drum or The Energy Bulletin ) .
In case you did n't , a population bottleneck occurs when there is a major die - off of a species leaving just enough individuals to provide a breeding population .
This is postulated to have occurred for humans ( see this ) .
A population bottleneck is of evolutionary significance because it tends to reduce the variability in the genome of the remaining population .
On the other hand , the events that led to the causes may have radically changed the environment such that only members of the species with the traits that made them survivors would produce offspring under strong pressures for further selection .
Past human evolution has been correlated with significant climate changes associated with the ice ages , the cooling and the thawing .
It is entirely reasonable to assume that any human survivors from the catastrophic events that we are causing will also undergo evolutionary pressures and produce one or more new species better adapted to that future world .
I , like Catton , have become convinced that sometime within the next hundred years humankind will experience a bottleneck event of its own making .
The event could take many decades as in a global collapse of civilization and slow die - off of the population dependent on high energy support from fossil fuels .
It could come quickly if the increasing pressures from economic decline push someone to sending nukes skyward .
I can imagine any number of scenarios that may seal our fate .
I am quite convinced there is no technology that could be brought to bear within a workable time frame that would mitigate this event .
I am as absolutely convinced as I think possible to be that we will fail to muster the political will and smarts to employ such a technology even if it could be shown to exist and work .
The reason I am so pessimistic is because of the tipping points involved in all of dynamical processes at work .
There are ecological tipping points that once passed ensure that massive species die - offs will occur through population collapses .
There are climate changing tipping points that work through positive feedback loops such as the warming tundra and Arctic Ocean releasing previously frozen methane thus amplifying the greenhouse effect .
There are population density tipping points in which the stresses of close - packed living increase the violence and aggressive tendencies in people .
There are many sociological tipping points such as Joseph Tainter 's civilization collapse due to declining marginal benefit from increasing complexity .
The list goes on .
Any and all of these are being reached by human actions and population numbers .
One or more could break and cause the others to break as well .
We have just pushed the limits of growth to the point of breaking down everything .
Once society starts down the slope of collapse , no matter how rapidly or slowly it transpires , the end result is pretty much the same .
At some point in the future we will have just a few surviving pockets of humans , probably quite isolated from one another , living in extremely primitive conditions , probably just getting by .
Then depending on what the climate does in the way of further changes some of these may fail to adapt and survive too .
But those that do , in their isolated conditions , will begin the long slow process of allopatric speciation — the development of species characteristics in separated and reproductively isolated populations .
What the world gets from that might not strike us as more advanced than our current incarnation .
Indeed , in a more brutal world , it could be more like the Morlocks rather than the Eloi in H. G. Wells ' , The Time Machine .
That is the pessimist in me .
The optimist in me sees another , though not - at - all certain , possibility .
Operating on the premise that humans had been evolving higher levels of sapience ( see my various writings on this from this index page ) before we abrogated our mental development to cleverness in technology ( esp. agriculture ) , we might still have an opportunity to nudge future evolution toward beings with much higher levels of that which is the basis of wisdom than we now possess on average .
Hence my visions of a future society in which more sapient humans could live and thrive in tune with nature .
It would be a Utopia made possible only because the human brain was evolving in the direction of greater sapience ( vs. greater cleverness , which we may possess too much of now ! )
Remember the part above where I mentioned how when we learn or understand that we are dying we usually finish the grief by doing something to foster our loved ones , particularly our children , after we are gone ?
Think of future humans as our special children .
Would n't we want to make preparations that would help ease their futures , leave them our true wealth in our wills ?
If there is to be a brighter future for an even more advanced human species in some distant day , we should take steps now to help that happen .
We actually do know what to do in that regard .
There are no guarantees , of course .
Climate change may go completely out of control and the Earth ends up looking like Venus .
Or a meteor could strike the planet killing everything .
But those kinds of disasters ( Black Swans ) notwithstanding , we should hope for the best and do what we can now .
We wo n't be around to see the results .
This is the one thing I would do on faith alone .
Image caption Some experts believe high winds could cause helpful dispersal
The fight continues to stem the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , but could the arrival of the annual hurricane season make things worse ?
The prediction this year for the Atlantic is for an " active to extremely active " hurricane season , which officially began on 1 June .
According to the US's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , there is a 70 % chance of eight to 14 hurricanes , of which between three and seven could be major hurricanes with winds of more than 111mph ( 179 km / h ) .
I 'm of the belief that hurricanes are Mother Nature 's dispersant Prof Ed Overton , Environmental scientist
Apart from the possibility of damage and loss of life unrelated to the oil spill , there is a very obvious downside to hurricanes passing near the source of the oil spill .
A hurricane would clearly disrupt the efforts to stop the leak , although BP has a plan to install a device in order to quickly disconnect and reconnect the link down to the spill site in high winds .
On shore , tasks like the laying of boom and rescue of wildlife would become more problematic .
But what would happen to the oil that is already out there floating in the sea ?
High winds and heavy seas would mix the oil and water and help the process of biodegradation , NOAA believes .
Bacteria effect
Prof Ed Overton , an environmental studies expert at Louisiana State University ( LSU ) , agrees with this view .
Image caption Operations at the site of the leaking well would be disrupted by a hurricane
" Concentrated oil in a very small area is very bad .
But if you spread it out … nature can handle that .
Bacteria can degrade the oil .
I'm of the belief that hurricanes are Mother Nature 's dispersant . "
But there is another downside .
A hurricane has the potential to take oil to places it would not otherwise reach .
It all depends on the path of the storm .
" A hurricane passing to the west of the oil slick could drive oil to the coast , " the NOAA says .
" A hurricane passing to the east of the slick could drive the oil away from the coast . "
This is because hurricanes rotate anti-clockwise .
Slow - moving water
To date , the weather conditions have been relatively placid out in the Gulf of Mexico .
" So far the water has been very slowly moving , almost stagnant , " says Prof Chuanmin Hu , an optical oceanographer from the University of South Florida .
HURRICANE PROS AND CONS PRO : Storm could disperse oil
PRO : Hurricane east of slick area could in theory send oil further out to sea
CON : Hurricane could cause loss of life and damage to property
CON : New oil spills could be caused
CON : Storm surge could take oil far inland
CON : Operations at spill site and on shore disrupted
But hurricanes cause storm surges .
Such a surge of water has the potential not only to affect the behaviour of oil far out in the Gulf , but also to cause grim consequences when it reaches the shore .
" It is potentially not a pretty picture , " says Prof Nan Walker , an oceanographer at the School of the Coast and Environment at LSU .
" A real concern is that because Louisiana is so low - lying , even a category one storm can raise the water level eight or 10 feet .
" There is potential for oil to go fairly far inland , penetrating the marshes even deeper .
It makes the problem potentially a lot worse . "
The sand berms , or barriers , that have been planned in Louisiana may not stop even a relatively small storm surge .
High waves
" You have to have a very high berm to stop a 10ft storm surge , " says Prof Walker .
" Another issue is that the waves are enormous during a hurricane . "
She recalls that Hurricane Ivan , a category four storm , created waves of 80ft ( 23.4 m ) out at sea .
Hurricanes are the spin ball Prof Nan Walker , Oceanographer
If there is any oil suspended underwater , such high waves would bring it to the surface - but it is likely then to be diluted , she says .
NOAA addresses this point , suggesting that the oil underneath the surface , anywhere away from the leak site , is only being measured in parts per million and will be further dispersed by a hurricane .
One thing NOAA 's experts seem clear about is that the oil leak will not have a significant effect on the formation of the hurricanes themselves .
The track of hurricanes is very hard to predict .
A pressure system called the Bermuda High can alter their path , notes Prof Walker .
If this high pressure area is in the north , the hurricanes can be dragged up the east coast of the US .
If the high pressure area expands to the south or the south - west , storms can be pulled to the west , hitting Mexico and the northern Gulf coast .
As well as their path , their forward motion , intensity and wind speed are all very difficult to predict , NOAA notes .
And previous experience of the interaction of oil spills and hurricanes has usually been based on slicks resulting from damage caused by the winds themselves .
No -one can be sure what is going to happen .
" Hurricanes are the spin ball , " says Prof Walker .
It sounds strange that a drug addiction could be successfully combated using another recreational drug , but it appears that certain psychedelic drugs can have a positive influence when combined with psychotherapy .
Although much of this research has been conducted before the 1970s and has typically focused on the use of LSD , recently psychiatrists from the St. Petersburg State Pavlov Medical University have tested the use of the drug ketamine .
Ketamine is typically used as a general anesthetic , but sub- anesthetic doses of it can produce psychedelic experiences .
The study was conducted by Evgeny M. Krupitsky , Andrei M. Burakov , Igor V. Dunaevsky , Tatyana N. Romanova , Tatyana Y. Slavina , and Alexander Y. Grinenko .
It was published in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs in 2007 .
Previous research conducted by Krupitsky found that ketamine - assisted psychotherapy could be an effective treatment for heroin addiction .
This study was conducted to examine whether the addition of a psychedelic experience to psychotherapy provided a one time boost to the treatment or if continuing to administer ketamine during psychotherapy would increase the effect of the treatment .
Krupitsky and his colleagues provided an initial ketamine - assisted psychotherapy session to 59 heroin dependent inpatients from the Leningrad Regional Center of Addictions .
“ Before the first ketamine session , participants received five hours of psychotherapy focused on the participants ’ addictions to prepare them for the ketamine session , and they recieved five hours of psychotherapy after the first ketamine session to help them to interpret their experience , ” as they explain .
The ketamine - assisted psychotherapy session itself lasted for about one and a half to two hours .
After their initial ketamine session , roughly half of the participants received two additional sessions of ketamine - assisted therapy , while the other half received two sessions of psychotherapy without the use of ketamine .
After a one year follow up , Krupitsky and his colleagues found that 50 % of those who received multiple sessions of ketamine - assisted therapy remained abstinent compared to 22.2 % of those who received only a single session .
Traditional forms of heroin treatment , such as the use of naltrexone , typically have abstinence rates of about 20 % .
But how would using a psychedelic substance such as ketamine aid psychotherapy ?
“ People have reported experiencing violent or rapid travel through tunnels or corridors , derealization , extreme depersonalization associated with intense fear or euphoria , and feeling connected to God or a higher power .
The transformative experiences often began with extreme fear , including fear of the world ending or apocalypse , and often ended in an experience of rebirth associated with oceanic , or positively experienced , ego loss and boundlessness , ” Krupitsky and his colleagues describe .
“ The ketamine experience is similar to some near - death experiences , and it may produce a positive shift in the participant ’s understanding of the meaning of life , life purposes , and spiritual development through mechanisms similar to those seen with near - death experiences . ”

In the first - ever study combing the entire human genome for genetic determinants of male sexual orientation , a University of Illinois at Chicago researcher has identified several areas that appear to influence whether a man is heterosexual or gay .
The study , which is currently available online , will be published in the March issue of the biomedical journal Human Genetics .
UIC 's Brian Mustanski , working with colleagues at the National Institutes of Health , found stretches of DNA that appeared to be linked to sexual orientation on three different chromosomes in the nucleus of cells of the human male .
" There is no one ' gay ' gene , " said Mustanski , a psychologist in the UIC department of psychiatry and lead author of the study .
" Sexual orientation is a complex trait , so it 's not surprising that we found several DNA regions involved in its expression . "
" Our best guess is that multiple genes , potentially interacting with environmental influences , explain differences in sexual orientation . "
The genomes of 456 men from 146 families with two or more gay brothers were analyzed .

While earlier studies had focused solely on the X chromosome , one of the two sex chromosomes , the present study examined all 22 pairs of non-sex chromosomes in addition to the X chromosome .
The other sex chromosome , called Y , was not explored because it is not believed to contain many genes .
Identical stretches of DNA on three chromosomes -- chromosomes 7 , 8 and 10 -- were found to be shared in about 60 percent of the gay brothers in the study , compared to about 50 percent expected by chance .
The region on chromosome 10 correlated with sexual orientation only if it was inherited from the mother .
" Our study helps to establish that genes play an important role in determining whether a man is gay or heterosexual , " said Mustanski .
" The next steps will be to see if these findings can be confirmed and to identify the particular genes within these newly discovered chromosomal sequences that are linked to sexual orientation . "

Pastor Lindsey Williams
, who has been an ordained Baptist minister for 28 years , went to Alaska in 1971 as a missionary .
The Transalaska oil pipeline began its construction phase in 1974 , and because of Mr. Williams ' love for his country and concern for the spiritual welfare of the " pipeliners , " ; he volunteered to serve as Chaplain on the pipeline , with the subsequent full support of the Alyeska Pipeline Company .
Because of the executive status accorded to him as Chaplain , he was given access to information documented in his eye opening book , The Energy Non-Crisis .
After numerous public speaking engagements in the western states , certain government officials and concerned individuals urged Mr. Williams to put into print what he saw and heard , stating that they felt this information was vital to national security .
Mr. Williams firmly believes that whoever controls energy controls the economy .
Thus , The Energy Non-Crisis .
Until the Senate passes the Defense Department ’s budget bill with DADT ’s compromised repeal attached , the House is n’t going to move on ENDA , says Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
Well is n’t this a familiar situation .
While ENDA is a “ personal priority ” for Pelosi , she ’s also focused on doing “ one thing at a time , ” she tells the Washington Blade .
Which for now means getting the DADT repeal through the Senate and on the president ’s desk .
And until then , there ’s not going to be a vote in the House on ENDA .
I can already hear the on-lookers screaming , “ WHY NOT PELOSI ?!
JUST DO IT ! ”
Except the reality of this situation — the House , voluntarily or not , being stalled by the Senate ’s lack of movement — is n’t new .
The House has managed to at least introduce ENDA in the past , which Rep. Barney Frank did again this year .
It even passed the bill , albeit sans gender identity protections , once before , only to see the Senate stall and let the effort peter out .
So let ’s be clear that the House waiting for the Senate to move on LGBT legislation is n’t a new phenomenon , and it ’ll likely repeat itself again in the future .
What Pelosi ’s statement represents now , however , is what we were fearing with DADT :
That by the time either the House or Senate gets around to it , Democrats could lose a whole slew of seats to Republicans , killing the chances of passing such legislation after November , putting it in the “ now or never ” category .
SSL handshake latency and HTTPS optimizations .
At work today , I started investigating the latency differences for similar requests between HTTP and HTTPS .
Historically , I was running with the assumption that higher latency on HTTPS ( SSL ) traffic was to be expected since SSL handshakes are more CPU intensive .
I did n’t really think about the network consequences of SSL until today .
It ’s all in the handshake .
TCP handshake is a 3 - packet event .
The client sends 2 packets , the server sends 1 .
Best case , you ’re looking at one round - trip for establishing your connection .
We can show this empirically by comparing ping and tcp connect times :
% fping -q -c 5 www.csh.rit.edu www.csh.rit.edu : xmt/rcv/%loss = 5/5/0 % , min/avg/max = 112/115/123
Average is 115 ms for ping round - trip .
How about TCP ?
Let ’s ask curl how long tcp connect takes :
% seq 5 | xargs - I@ -n1 curl - so / dev/null -w " %{time_connect}
" http://www.csh.rit.edu 0.117 0.116 0.117 0.116 0.116
There ’s your best case .
This is because when you ( the client ) receive the 2nd packet in the handshake ( SYN+ACK ) , you reply with ACK and consider the connection open .
Exactly 1 round - trip is required before you can send your http request .
What about when using SSL ?
Let ’s ask curl again :
% curl - kso / dev/null -w " tcp:%{time_connect} , ssldone:%{time_appconnect}
" https://www.csh.rit.edu tcp:0.117 , ssldone:0.408 #
How about to google ?
% curl - kso / dev/null -w " tcp:%{time_connect} , ssldone:%{time_appconnect}
" https://www.google.com tcp:0.021 , ssldone:0.068
3.5 x jump in latency just for adding SSL to the mix , and this is before we sent the http request .
The reason for this is easily shown with tcpdump .
For this test , I ’ll use tcpdump to sniff https traffic and then use openssl s_client to simply connect to the http server over ssl and do nothing else .
Start tcpdump first , then run openssl s_client .
terminal1 % sudo tcpdump - ttttt - i any ' port 443 and host www.csh.rit.edu' ... terminal2 % openssl s_client - connect www.csh.rit.edu:443 ...

#
At this point , openssl s_client is sitting waiting for you to type something # into stdin .
Summarizing the above tcpdump data for this ssl handshake :
12 packets for SSL , vs 3 for TCP alone
TCP handshake took 114ms
Total SSL handshake time was 436ms
Number of network round - trips was 3 .
SSL portion took 322ms ( network and crypto )
The server tested above has a 2048 bit ssl cert .
Running ‘ openssl speed rsa ’ on the webserver shows it can do a signature in 22ms :
sign verify sign / s verify / s rsa 2048 bits 0.022382s 0.000542s 44.7 1845.4
Anyway .
The point is , no matter how fast your SSL accelerators ( hardware loadbalancer , etc ) , if your SSL end points are n’t near the user , then your first connect will be slow .
As shown above , 22ms for the crypto piece of SSL handshake , which means 300ms of the SSL portion above was likely network latency and some other overhead .
Once SSL is established , though , it switches to a block cipher ( 3DES , etc ) which is much faster and the resource ( network , cpu ) overhead is pretty tiny by comparison .
Summarizing from above : Using SSL incurs a 3.5 x latency overhead for each handshake , but afterwards it ’s generally fast like plain TCP .
If you accept this conclusion , let ’s examine how this can affect website performance .
Got firebug ?
Open any website .
Seriously .
Watch the network activity .
How many HTTP requests are made ?
Can you tell how many of those that go to the same domain use http pipelining ( or keepalive ) ?
How many initiate new requests each time ?
You can track this with tcpdump by looking for ‘ syn ’ packets if you want ( tcpdump ' tcp[ tcpflags ] == tcp-syn ' ) .
What about the street wisdom for high - performance web servers ?
HAProxy ’s site says :
“ If a site needs keep - alive , there is a real problem .
Highly loaded sites often disable keep - alive to support the maximum number of simultaneous clients .
The real downside of not having keep - alive is a slightly increased latency to fetch objects .
Browsers double the number of concurrent connections on non-keepalive sites to compensate for this . ”
Disabling keep - alive on SSL connections means every single http request is going to take 3 round - trips before even asking for data .
If your server is 100 ms away , and you have 10 resources to serve on a single page , that ’s 3 seconds of network latency before you include SSL crypto or resource transfer time .
With keep alive , you could eat that handshake cost only once instead of 10 times .
Many browsers will open multiple simultaneous connections to any given webserver if it needs to fetch multiple resources .
Idea is that parallelism gets you more tasty http resources in a shorter time .
If the browser opens two connections in parallel , you ’ll still incur many sequential SSL handshakes that slow your resource fetching down .
More SSL handshakes in parallel means higher CPU burden , too , and ultimately memory ( per open connection ) scales more cheaply than does CPU time - think : above , one active connection cost 22ms of time ( most of which is spent in CPU ) and costs much more than that connection holds in memory resources and scales better ( easier to grow memory than cpu ) .
For some data , Google and Facebook both permit keep - alive :
% URL=https://s-static.ak.facebook.com/rsrc.php/zPET4/hash/9e65hu86.js % curl -w " tcp : %{time_connect} ssl:%{time_appconnect}
" - sk -o /dev/null $ URL -o / dev/null $ URL tcp : 0.038 ssl:0.088 tcp : 0.000 ssl:0.000 % URL=https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js % curl -w " tcp : %{time_connect} ssl:%{time_appconnect}
" - sk -o /dev/null $ URL -o / dev/null $ URL tcp : 0.054 ssl:0.132 tcp : 0.000 ssl:0.000
The 2nd line of output reports zero time spent in tcp and ssl handshaking .
Further , if you tell curl to output response headers ( curl - D -) you ’ll see “ Connection : keep - alive ” .
This is data showing that at least some of big folks with massive qps are using keep alive .
Remember that new handshakes are high cpu usage , but existing SSL connections generally are n’t as they are using a cheaper block cipher after the handshake .
Disabling keep alive ensures that every request will incur an SSL handshake which can quickly overload a moderately - used server without SSL acceleration hardware if you have a large ssl key ( 2048 or 4096 b it key ) .
Even if you have SSL offloading to special hardware , you ’re still incuring the higher network latency that ca n’t be compensated by faster hardware .
Frankly , in most cases it ’s more cost effective to buy a weaker SSL certificate ( 1024 bit ) than it is to buy SSL hardware - See Google ’s Velocity 2010 talk on SSL
By the way , on modern hardware you can do a decent number of SSL handshakes per second with 1024 bit keys , but 2048 bit and 4096 bit keys are much harder :
# ' openssl speed rsa ' done on an Intel X5550 ( 2.66g
Hz ) rsa 1024 bits 0.000496s 0.000027s 2016.3 36713.2 rsa 2048 bits 0.003095s 0.000093s 323.1 10799.2 rsa 4096 bits 0.021688s 0.000345s 46.1 2901.5
Fixing SSL latency is not totally trivial .
The CPU intensive part can be handled by special hardware if you can afford it , but the only way sure way to solve network round - trip latency is to be closer to your user and / or to work on minimizing the total number of round - trips .
You can be further from your users if you do n’t force things like keep - alive to be off , which can save you money in the long run by letting you have better choices of datacenter locations .
Previously ( here ) I sketched out a design that went some way to being a coverage tool for Clojure code .
The result was a macro that when used to define a function , resulted in an instrumented function that tallied every time the code was called .
This time I am going to sketch the beginnings of a design that does n’t use a macro .
To start with here is a slight re-write of the structure I used last time to record the coverage :
( def coverage - records ( ref nil ) ) ( defn add - record [ fn - name record ] ( dosync ( alter coverage - records assoc ( str fn-name ) record ) ) ) ( defn get - record [ fn - name ] ( get @coverage - records ( str fn-name ) ) ) ( defn covering [ form fn-name ] ( dosync ( alter ( get - record fn- name ) assoc form 0 ) ) ) ( defn - inc - map [ map key ] ( if ( contains ? map key ) ( assoc ( dissoc map key ) key ( inc ( get map key ) ) ) map ) ) ( defn inc-coverage [ form fn-name ] ( dosync ( alter ( get - record fn- name ) inc - map form ) ) )
This code uses a single map to store a coverage record , another map , for each function that is being measured .
Functions are provided for adding records and incrementing the coverage .
I am using the same set of functions to wrap and instrument the s-expressions that define the function , with a few minor modifications .
I am indexing the s-expressions with a number so as to distinguish between any identical s-expressions within the function .
This set of functions is still incomplete since there are lots of Clojure code that will get wrapped incorrectly , I will be rectifying this sometime in the near future .
( declare wrap - seq ) ( defn wrap [ form idx fn-name ] ( cond ( seq ? form ) ( let [ key ( str idx " : " form ) ] ( covering key fn-name ) ( list ' do `( inc - coverage ~key ~( str fn-name ) ) ( wrap - seq form idx fn-name ) ) ) : else form ) ) ( defn - indexed [ coll ] ( map vector ( iterate inc 0 ) coll ) ) ( defn wrap - seq [ coll count fn-name ] ( for [ [ idx elt ] ( indexed coll ) ] ( wrap elt (+ count idx ) fn-name ) ) )
The previous article used a macro to generate Clojure code that was instrumented , this time I will load the source code for the function , wrap it and then evaluate it .
This is done by the get - source function in clojure.contrib.repl-utils combined with a call to format and load - string , My code that interprets the source code is fragile and needs more work , it wo n’t handle functions with multiple bodies for example , but it demonstrates the principle .
I am using a structure to hold the instrumented function and the coverage record for this function .
( defstruct wrapper : wrapped - fn : coverage - record ) ( defn wrap - fn [ f cv-rec ] ( let [s ( read - string ( get - source f ) ) fn-name ( first ( drop 1 s ) ) args ( first ( drop 2 s ) ) body ( last s ) ] ( add - record fn- name cv-rec ) ( load - string ( format " ( fn %s %s ) " args ( wrap body 0 fn-name ) ) ) ) ) ( defn wrap - function [ f ] ( let [ coverage - record ( ref nil ) ] ( struct wrapper ( wrap - fn f coverage - record ) coverage - record ) ) )
So now we can try the code out at the REPL :
user= > ( def x ( wrap - function ' test1 ) ) # 'user / x user= > x {:wrapped - fn # , : coverage - record # }
Here I have wrapped the function test1 and we can see the coverage structure returned , consisting of the wrapped function and the coverage record , keyed by the single s-expression with a count of 0 .
If I now use the wrapped function like this and examine the coverage structure the count should increment to 1 .
user= > ( ( : wrapped - fn x ) 1 2 ) - 1 user= > x {:wrapped - fn # , : coverage - record # }
So we now have a partially functional coverage tool and no macros have needed to be written .
To complete this tool I just need to tidy up the wrapping and source code reading functions and provide some sort of binding macro so that we can call the fn with
( test1 1 2 )
instead of
(( : wrapped - fn x ) 1 2 )
.
Hopefully , in my next blog entry I will have completed it !
Spain began the match utilizing the 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formation that had been so successful in ousting France in their recent Paris friendly , with David Silva joining the Barcelona trio of Andres Iniesta , Xavi , and David Villa in the offensive positions .
However , it was the Saudi’s who started the match stronger , and should have taken the lead as early as the eighth minute .
Hazazi left Carles Puyol for dead before cutting the ball neatly across goal .
Gerard Pique was flat - footed , and Al Numare got there first , rounding Iker Casillas in one fluent motion , but could only slam his shot into the side netting .
Spain did not learn from that near - miss , though , and The Green Falcons surprisingly , though deservedly , took the lead after 15 minutes .
A corner from the right met the head of , who powered home past Casillas .
The Real Madrid shot stopper had came out expected to punch clear , but was left floundering as Hawsawi showed more desire .
La Roja were lackadaisical and insipid for much of the first half , appearing as though the long domestic season had taken its toll , butshowed his alertness to draw the World Cup favorites level on the half - hour mark .
A beautiful , teasing cross from Iniesta cleared the heads of every Saudi defender , and ' El Guaje ' was left unmarked to head into the top corner past the helpless Ali .
Indeed , Barcelona ’s new addition should perhaps have added to his tally as the match meandered towards half time .
Once again Iniesta was the architect , proving the former Valencia man with a slide - rule pass , but the striker ’s radar was slightly off on this occasion , dragging his shot wide of the post .
After the interval , though , Vicente del Bosque ’s side did not have to wait long to take the lead for the first time in the match .
Iniesta had squandered a decent opportunity , butmade no mistake on 57 minutes , pouncing on a loose ball at the edge of the area to skilfully place his shot into the corner of the net .
With the lead in place , Del Bosque then rang the changes , with the likes of Pedro and Jesus Navas given a run out , but incredibly the Saudi ’s were not beaten yet , and drew the match level again with 17 minutes remaining .
Al Sahlawi attempted a snapshot from the edge of the area , but his shot deflected off the back of team - mate ofand completely wrong - footed Casillas .
It was a bizarre goal , but one that the Saudis thoroughly enjoyed .
La Roja desperately attempted find a winner , with Joan Capdevila and Navas both coming close , but it looked as though their urgency would be in vain .
However , in injury time , Saudi Arabia were left devastated when Athletic Bilbao forwardrose highest to head a Xabi Alonso corner into the net , with ' keeper Ali flailing .
Spain had clinched a win in the dying moments of play , but it was by no means a vintage performance from the European Champions .

An Ipswich man who killed a gay hairdresser and claimed the victim touched him has been jailed for 18 years .
Rodney Greenland , 47 , of Manchester Road , Ipswich , stabbed 36 - year - old Simon Amers to death last July .
He claimed he “ flipped ” when Mr Amers made sexual advances to him .
The pair had met in a pub on the night of July 27th and returned to Mr Amers ’ flat in Wigeon Close for a drink .
The victim ’s naked body was found by his friends in a pool of blood at his flat several days later .
He had been stabbed seven times .
Greenland admitted manslaughter but denied murder .
He told police that the victim , who was gay , began stroking his leg .
He said that Mr Amers then followed him into another room and tapped his shoulder .
Greenland said he picked up a knife and slashed Mr Amers , who fell down the stairs .
While being interviewed by detectives , he said he had been abused at boarding school as a child and “ flipped ” .
Ipswich crown court heard that Greenland had repeatedly confessed to the murder in the days after the killing but was not believed because no body had been discovered .
He told friends , family members , police and a doctor he had killed a man .
Police drove him around the area where Mr Amers lived in an effort to jog his memory but when he could not remember where he had been , they assumed he was drunk and nothing had happened .
According to the East Anglia Daily Times , Godfried Duah , a prosecuting lawyer for the Crown Prosecution Service , said : “ Greenland needlessly took Simon ’s life .
“ One minute they were sharing a drink and the next he was subjected to a frenzied attack by a cold - blooded killer . ”

A two - inch layer of submerged oil is coating portions of the Gulf seafloor off the Bon Secour National Wildlife Refuge : a week after a smothering layer of floating crude washed ashore there .
This scenario is being played out all along the Gulf shoreline .
Collecting in pockets and troughs in waist - deep water , the underwater oil is looser and stickier than the tarballs that cover the beach .
The consistency is more like a thick liquid , albeit one made up of thousands of small globs .
Unlike tarballs , which can often be picked up out of the water without staining the fingers , the submerged oil stains everything that it touches .
If you passed your hand through the material it would emerge covered in oily smears .
There are a number of patches of submerged oil 40 to 100 feet off the beach , apparently collecting along rip currents and sandbars .
The carcasses of sand fleas , speckled crabs , ghost crabs , and leopard crabs are spread throughout the oil , a thick layer of the material caking the bodies of the larger crabs - their claws looking as if they been turned into clubs made of oil .
***
Huge schools of bait fish are hugging the shore , attracting large numbers of birds .
King mackerel , Spanish mackerel , mullet , ladyfish , speckled trout , and other fish are congregating in massive numbers amid the sharks .
The Dauphin Island Sea Lab measured large areas of low oxygen water just off the beach at Fort Morgan last week , beginning in water around 20 feet deep .
Monty Graham , a University of South Alabama scientist , theorized that the population of oil - consuming microbes had swelled .
Sea life begins to die if oxygen levels drop below 2 parts per million .
" We saw some very low oxygen levels , some below 1 , " said Graham , of testing he conducted aboard a Dauphin Island Sea Lab research vessel .
He said that the layer of low - oxygen water closest to shore off Fort Morgan began at the bottom and rose up 30 feet .
Graham said he believed that the low oxygen levels were responsible for reports of strange behavior among fish : " The low oxygen explains things we 've been hearing , like reports of flounder swimming on the surface . "
The low - oxygen levels offshore may also explain the dense aggregations of fish seen in the surf zone .
The turbulent area near shore is naturally high in oxygen due to the influence of the breaking waves .
There are numerous reports that suggest that oil is moving beneath the surface in Alabama waters .
State officials conducting shrimp trawls in the Mississippi Sound two weeks ago found oil on their nets when they pulled them .
More recently , BP contractors working around Dauphin Island reported oil coming up on their anchors .
Gulf Coast Residents Hit Hard
It 's not just the sealife .
Gulf coast residents are being hit hard as well .
David Kotok of Cumberland Advisors estimates that one million jobs will be lost permanently in the Gulf coast oil services and supporting industries .
The House Judiciary Committee has found :
As of ... Tuesday , June 15th , BP had paid less than 12 percent ( $ 71 million dollars out of an estimated $ 600 million ) of outstanding claims submitted by individuals and businesses .
Two weeks after the disaster , BP had not paid a single dollar to the individuals or businesses harmed by the explosion and the oil spill .
As of May 18th ( four weeks post - disaster ) , BP had only paid $ 11,673,616 .
In apparent response to congressional oversight and the efforts of the federal government , BP began increasing their payments to affected individuals and businesses in the past few weeks .
Although the oil spill disaster occurred on April 20th , BP has only begun to compensate individuals for their full loss of income in the past two weeks .
We understand individuals continue to experience delays in the receipt of full income awards .
BP has not paid a single bodily injury claim .
As of Friday , June 18th , there were 717 claims submitted for bodily injury , including claims for respiratory issues , headaches , and skin irritation .
BP has not paid a single claim for the diminishment in value of homes in the affected areas of the Gulf South , out of a total 175 claims submitted .
Out of the 267 claims submitted , BP has paid only $ 169,371 in loss of income claims for affected restaurants .
However , the lack of data from BP on the damage amounts requested by the affected restaurants or the number of claims paid makes it impossible for the Committee to determine if restaurants and other Gulf Coast businesses are being properly compensated .
" I remain concerned that BP is stiffing too many victims and short - changing others , " [ Committee Chairman John ]
Conyers said .
Reuters notes that BP is paying only a fraction of what the fishermen think they 're entitled to .
USA Today notes :
State officials in Louisiana and Florida say the payouts , so far , have been small and often too slow and that BP has n't given them the data they need to adequately monitor the process .
WDSU reports :
Some people claim the payout process is unorganized , and other said there is no system in place to account for how many days the fishermen have worked and no clear time frame for when they 'll see the money they 've earned .
The L.A. Times notes that :
BP 's request for tax records poses a problem for some residents of fishing communities in southeastern Louisiana — the nonconformists who have n't kept records or reported their cash income .
Time Magazine makes a similar point :
Fishing can bring in a lot of money in a very short period of time during the right season , but fishermen might be hard - pressed to provide evidence — bank statements , pay stubs — that can back that up .
The same goes for many other businesses : if receipts are dwindling at a restaurant , or guests are cancelling at a resort , how is it possible to prove that the spill alone is responsible ?
" We 're stuck in the middle , " says Chris Camardelle , whose seafood restaurant in Grand Isle has been badly hurt by the oil spill .
" So it 's a tricky situation . "
Indeed , there are reports that businesses who sell to fishermen are faring even worse than the fishermen themselves .
The above - linked USA Today article provides an example of the difficulties faced by non-fishermen :
[ Ray Chagnard , owner of Chag 's Fishing and Marine Supply store ] says he sent documents in twice that were lost , including three years of personal and business tax returns , monthly sales figures and profit - and - loss statements .
" I 'm at five weeks , and I have n't got a dime , " Chagnard says , despite claims on BP 's website that " reasonable effort " will made to provide interim payments to claimants within 48 hours .
***
Chagnard says that puts him in a tough spot , because his fishing - supply distributors are expecting payment for inventory that Chagnard can't sell , because the spill has squashed the fishing industry .
" I can't imagine going through this again next month , " Chagnard says .
Given that the oil spill is killing not only fish and crabs - but the American dream for millions of Gulf Coast fishermen , shrimpers , tourist industry workers and others - the image in the photograph above is very powerful indeed .
Taking Pianos to the Streets
On June 21 , Make Music New York hits the streets , a day - long extravaganza of free music events in public spaces in all five boroughs of the city .
Among the offerings this year are a New Orleans - style Second Line parade in Manhattan , interactive music in the Meatpacking District , and Take Your Musician to School Day outside public schools .
I was particularly intrigued by “ Play Me , I ’m Yours , ” a public art installation of 60 pianos conceived by artist Luke Jerram , set outside for anyone to play .
Roughly analogous to the CowParade exhibition in 2000 or Christo ’s Gates in Central Park in 2005 , the pianos will be decorated and set up in places like the Grand Concourse , Brooklyn Bridge Park , Bryant Park , Jackson Heights Post Office , and the Staten Island Ferry Terminal .
But unlike cow statues or giant swaths of saffron fabric , the pianos are there to be played .
They go up on June 21 and remain in place until July 5 , when they will be donated to area schools and hospitals .
“ Play Me , I ’m Yours ” was organized by the New York - based charitable organization Sing for Hope .
Last week I spoke to Emily Walsh , Sing for Hope ’s director of operations , about the logistics behind getting 60 pianos in place — and keeping them there safely .
( Interview excerpts below . )
In the weeks leading up to June 21 , the pianos have been in storage at a SoHo warehouse ( photos below ) .
How did “ Play Me , I ’m Yours ” first come about ?
Emily Walsh :
We initially hoped to do “ Play Me , I ’m Yours ” this August .
When we met with the City of New York in January , they thought it would be a great project , but said why do n’t you do it in June , to coincide with Make Music New York , instead of August ?
That definitely threw us into high gear !
Sing for Hope had one employee last fall — we ’ve grown to five in the past couple of months .
What about logistics ?
The city has been assisting us with the permitting process .
About half the pianos are going into parks , and so we ’ve been accepted as a special art project for the Parks Department .
We ’ve been meeting with all the parks managers , doing site visits , taking photos , talking to them about how each piano will be secured .
The pianos themselves will be wired with metal cablings to two 90 - pound cinderblocks , which will sit behind them .
For those pianos in locations where they can be affixed to a permanent object , we ’re going that route , but for the majority of them they had to be self - standing , so we ’ve come up with the whole cinder block idea .
Each of the pianos is going to have a piano buddy who is responsible for general maintenance of the piano .
They open the piano at 9 a.m. every day , and they close it at 10 p.m. ; they also check the weather forecast , and if it ’s supposed to be pouring rain all day , instead of opening the piano , they ’ll go and cover it with a plastic tarp , which is attached to the back , rolled up in a little bundle that can be unraveled .
“ Play Me , I ’m Yours ” has been done in London before .
Did any of the lessons about logistics come from that installation ?
Emily Walsh :
The piano buddies and the tarp are from designs that the London people set up .
The cinder block thing was our own creation , because we had much stronger regulations regarding how we ’re fixing these pianos .
These are regulations from the City of New York ?
Emily Walsh : Yes .
There ’s a bureau of the city that controls any fixed object — like lampposts or fences .
And they ’re very particular about what they will allow — virtually nothing — to be affixed to it .
So we had to come up with a system where each piano that can be fairly stable and secure by itself .
How about budget ?
Emily Walsh :
The project here in New York — 60 pianos — is double the size of the London installation .
Our budget is exponentially greater .
We had huge insurance requirements .
We ’ve had piano movers , and the states are all unionized , and our budget for this project is $ 220,000 .
In London , they worked off of a $ 30,000 budget ( £ 20,000 ) .
Where do the pianos come from ?
Emily Walsh :
We have been assisted by a number of people who ’ve been donating their time to make this happen .
The most important of these is Fred Patella , who does concert piano services .
He ’s the one who has sourced all these pianos , and they ’ve been coming from warehouses from New Jersey to Long Island , New York .
We ’ve had some individual donations of pianos , but probably about 90 percent of the pianos have come in bulk from warehouses .
These are pianos that have sat there for years ; no - one has used them , no - one has been able to sell them , and their average value is about $ 100 to $ 200 .
Fred has amassed them all in a warehouse based in Tribeca which has been donated to us , about 7,000 square feet of ground floor of the AT&T building .
They ’re there right now .
Fred has been working 10 hours a day in the space , refurbishing the pianos , making sure all the keys work , that all of the parts are in there , and also coordinating with the piano movers who we ’ve hired to bring the pianos in and who will also be putting all the pianos out on the street .
Is this like the Macy ’s Thanksgiving Day parade , where the pianos must be readied for the public by the exact same time on June 21 ?
Emily Walsh :
The city ’s original idea was to install them all overnight on June 20 , which just was n’t feasible .
We are going to do three days of installation , starting on Friday the 18th .
The pianos will all be locked .
The keyboards have padlocks on them , and they ’ll be locked until Monday .
What will the pianos look like ?
Emily Walsh :
We do have a couple of fairly well - known artists painting five of the pianos , but of the most part the pianos are just going to be painted by kids from our program , by Sing for Hope friends and staff — definitely not works of art , but hopefully pleasant to look at .
The two artists who are working on pianos , which we ’re also planning on auctioning after the project , are Sophie Matisse — she ’s actually the great - granddaughter of Henri Matisse , who is painting all four of the pianos that are going to Lincoln Center .
And another artist , the Italian painter Ruggero Vanni , has created this amazing sculpture that fits around the piano , which is going to Chelsea Market .
That ’s the only indoor location .
The pianos will be lacquered so they will be completely waterproof .
The four pianos that are going to Lincoln Center are going to be at the four corners of the plaza ; there are two at the entrance , and then one in Damrosch Park , and one in Hearst Plaza , by the Henry Moore sculpture .
After “ Play Me , I ’m Yours , ” where do the pianos go ?
Emily Walsh :
All the pianos are being donated to schools and hospitals in the New York City area .
Sing for Hope ’s programming during the year — we work with about 2,000 public school children , 1,500 hospital patients , and we are taking the pianos to the schools that we work with , the hospitals we serve .
Are there any sort of scheduled music events involving the pianos ?
Emily Walsh : On June 21 , we ’ve given our pianos over to Make Music New York .
Events will be scheduled all day .
Other than that , we really are only scheduling three other days with the pianos , with maybe a few pop -up events as we find out about artists ’ availability .
We ’re doing one event the evening of June 22 in the meatpacking district , one event the evening of June 26 — we have n’t decided on a location for that , but probably Central Park or Fort Greene Park or the Gantry State Park Plaza .
And the closing concerts for the event will be on July 5 at the Lincoln Center pianos , from 4 to 6 p.m .
Other than that , we ’ve pretty much leaving it open to anybody to use their creativity , rather than trying to schedule too much ourselves .
What exactly is Sing for Hope , anyway ?
Is there an easy way to explain what Sing For Hope ’s phrases about its nonprofit mission — “ arts accessibility ” and “ artist activism in action ” — mean ?
Emily Walsh :
We were founded in 2005 by two professional opera singers , Camille Zamora and Monica Yunus .
They are both working professionals in the opera world .
They established Sing for Hope as a resource for volunteerism of professional artists .
So really it was a volunteer - run , volunteer - driven organization .
What we ’ve found as sort of our easy catchphrase , is that we ’re an Artist Peace Corps .
We like to get cross the idea of artist volunteerism , which I think has been helped by this whole idea of Barack Obama ’s call to action for volunteers .
We have a number of different programs , but with each one it ’s easy to just say we ’re a roster of artists who volunteer .

NEW ORLEANS –
The best hope for stopping the flow of oil from the blown - out well at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico has been compared to hitting a target the size of a dinner plate with a drill more than two miles into the earth , and is anything but a sure bet on the first attempt .
Bid after bid has failed to stanch what has already become the nation ’s worst - ever spill , and BP PLC is readying another attempt as early as Wednesday , this one a cut - and - cap process to put a lid on the leaking wellhead so oil can be siphoned to the surface .
Additional Photos
A supply vessel passes through oil floating near the site of the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Louisiana on Monday .
BP and scientists say the trial - and - error process of using relief wells to stop the flow of oil from the leaking well will eventually work , but could take weeks .
The Associated Press
But the best - case scenario of sealing the leak is two relief wells being drilled diagonally into the gushing well – tricky business that wo n’t be ready until August .
“ The probability of them hitting it on the very first shot is virtually nil , ” said David Rensink , incoming president of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists , who spent most of his 39 years in the oil industry in offshore exploration .
“ If they get it on the first three or four shots , they ’d be very lucky . ”
For the bid to succeed , the bore hole must precisely intersect the damaged well .
If it misses , BP will have to back up its drill , plug the hole it just created , and try again .
TRIAL -AND -ERROR PROCESS
The trial - and - error process could take weeks , but it will eventually work , scientists and BP said .
Then engineers will then pump mud and cement through pipes to ultimately seal the well .
As the drilling reaches deeper into the earth , the process is slowed by building pressure and the increasing distance that well casings must travel before they can be set in place .
Still , the three months it could take to finish the relief wells — the first of which started May 2 — is quicker than a typical deep well , which can take four months or longer , said Tad Patzek , who chairsf the Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering Department at the University of Texas - Austin .
BP already has a good picture of the different layers of sand and rock its drill bits will meet because of the work it did on the blown - out well .
On the slim chance the relief well does n’t work , scientists were n’t sure exactly how much — or how long — the oil would flow .
The gusher would continue until the well bore hole collapsed or pressure in the reservoir dropped to a point where oil was no longer pushed to the surface , Patzek said .
“ I do n’t admit the possibility of it not working , ” he said .
A third well could be drilled if the first two fail .
HOW MUCH OIL ?
“ We do n’t know how much oil is down there , and hopefully we ’ll never know when the relief wells work , ” BP spokesman John Curry said .
The company was starting to collect and analyze data on how much oil might be in the reservoir when the rig exploded April 20 , he said .
BP ’s uncertainty statement is reasonable , given they only had drilled one well , according to Doug Rader , an ocean scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund .
Two relief wells stopped the world ’s worst peacetime spill , from a Mexican rig called Ixtoc 1 that dumped 140 million gallons off the Yucatan Peninsula .
That plug took nearly 10 months beginning in the summer of 1979 .
Drilling technology has vastly improved since then , however .
So far , the Gulf oil spill has leaked between 19.7 million and 43 million gallons , according to government estimates .
In the meantime , BP is turning to another risky procedure federal officials acknowledge will likely , at least temporarily , cause 20 percent more oil — at least 100,000 gallons a day — to add to the gusher .
Using robot submarines , BP plans to cut away the riser pipe this week and place a cap - like containment valve over the blowout preventer .
The company hopes it will capture the majority of the oil , sending it to the surface .
“ If you ’ve got to cut that riser , that ’s risky .
You could take a bad situation and make it worse , ” said Ed Overton , a Louisiana State University professor of environmental sciences .
The latest attempt to capture the well comes after BP failed to plug the leak Saturday with its top kill , which shot mud and pieces of rubber into the well but could n’t beat back the pressure of the oil .
NO WORSE LOCATION
The location of the spill could n’t be worse :
• To the south lies an essential spawning ground for imperiled Atlantic bluefin tuna and sperm whales .
• To the east and west lie coral reefs and the coastal fisheries of Florida , Alabama , Mississippi and Texas .
• And to the north , Louisiana ’s coastal marshes .
More than 125 miles of Louisiana coastline already have been hit with oil .
“ It ’s just killing us by degrees , ” said Tulane University ecologist Tom Sherry .

Tonight is a special night because WWE will have it ’s first ever Fatal 4 Way branded PPV .
Both major titles will be defended in a fatal four way match , meaning the champion only has a 25 % chance of walking away with his title , and he does n’t need to be pinned to lose it .
It ’s a dire situation for a champion , and the odds are not in his favor .
Who walks away a loser and who gets their hand raised ?
Here ’s what I have to say about that :
Intercontinental Title Match
Kofi Kingston ( Champion ) vs. Drew McIntyre
SHOULD : Kofi WILL : Kofi
After all the drama that has gone on over the past few months between McIntyre and Smackdown General Manager , Teddy Long , it would be a shame to reward McIntyre with the IC Title .
Kofi and fellow McIntyre rival , Matt Hardy , have both come to the aid of Teddy Long , and this past week , McIntyre got the best of both of them .
If that ’s any indication , I ’m going to pick Kofi to retain his IC Title .
US Title Match
The Miz ( Champion ) vs. R - Truth
SHOULD : Miz WILL : Miz
Miz originally lost the US Title to now RAW General Manager , Bret Hart .
Once Bret got the job , he vacated the title , and Truth wound up beating Miz for the belt .
Just last week on RAW , Miz stole a victory in a Fatal 4 Way preview match by pulling John Morrison off Truth and getting the pin fall to become the US Champion once again .
It would n’t make sense to take the belt off of Miz so soon after the victory , plus I think the Miz is a better heel when he has a title than when he does n’t .
He can gloat more , and people can hate him more .
Miz retains tonight .
Diva ’s Title Match – Fatal 4 Way
Eve Torres ( Champion ) vs. Gail Kim vs. Maryse vs. Alicia Fox
SHOULD : Maryse WILL : Alicia
This is a total toss up for me .
Frankly I do n’t care who wins this match .
When it comes to talent and being over as a heel , Maryse is the best choice to have the title .
All four divas have what WWE looks for in a Diva ’s Champion ( a good look and a pulse ..? ) , but only one can be champion .
I would n’t put it past WWE to have Eve survive , but out of this group of divas , I just have a feeling like it ’s Alicia ’s time to hold the belt for a bit .
I do n’t think the other divas will mind .
Women share clothes and accessories all the time right ..?
World Heavyweight Title Match – Fatal 4 Way
Jack Swagger ( Champion ) vs. Rey Mysterio vs. CM
Punk vs. Big Show
SHOULD : CM Punk WILL : Mysterio
I would n’t put it past WWE to not have Mysterio qualify for the match originally , and then have him win the World Title .
WWE does stupid shit all the time .
I personally would love to see Punk with the title again because the “ I ’m better than you ” routine works better when he has gold .
Swagger ’s basically been Houdini over the course of the last few months , disappearing from the ring magically holding the gold , but I do n’t think tonight will be a repeat performance of that .
The one key factor in this match up will be whether or not Kane gets involved .
He ’s been on the war path since The Undertaker was attacked and put in a “ vegetative state . ”
WWE Title Match – Fatal 4 Way
John Cena ( Champion ) vs. Randy Orton vs. Edge vs. Sheamus
SHOULD : Anyone but Cena WILL : Cena
Orton is coming into this match up with an injured arm .
Edge has been fascinated with hurting Orton .
Sheamus seems like he ’s the only one with his eye on the prize here .
Cena does n’t really care who he has to beat because he ’s going to go out there and do his thing to impress the WWE Universe .
Cena having the belt all the time does nothing for me , and for a lot of people , but he is WWE ’s shining star , and I think at the end of the night , Superman will still be at the top of the heap with the WWE Title .
Fatal 4
Way starts here on the west coast at 5 pm , and it starts on the east coast at 8 pm then .
I ’ll be back tomorrow with results and my review on what went down .
Till then …
I need to import an entire Wordpress blog to a new Drupal install .
I want the posts , pages , authors , taxonomy , comments , and the users who made comments .
The last one being the hang up , we did n't want to lose any users from the community during this migration .
In the end I used Wordpress Import module , the User Import module , a little manual parsing and some simple SQL and now have 300 new users linked to their original comments .
But I took the long road to this solution , read on and I will relate my journey .
The Wordpress Import module works great .
But , even though the exported WXR file contains email and other data for each comment the Wordpress Import module does not allow you to import and map these Wordpress users who made comments , only the authors of Wordpress posts .
So here I took a detour trying for a complete solution .
I decided to use Table Wizard module and Migrate module .
Again two great modules that work great together .
To start you need the Wordpress data prepped in database tables .
But as I prepped the data , I did n't find a good tool to parse / export the WordPress eXtended RSS ( WXR ) file .
So as I was starting to parse the WXR file on the command line , by hand and w/ PHP I realized this was NOT the simplest solution .
The simplest solution would be to use the great Wordpress Import module then create new users accounts and map these new users to their previous comments .
Then with the addition of the User Import module all I needed to do was prep the user data before hand and map those users to comments with SQL .
Following are quick notes on my final process .
Get Wordpress data prepped
• Export WXR file from Wordpress.com :
- login at wordpress.com
- My DashBoard >>
My Blogs >>
Tools >>
Export
- Select author
- Download Export File
- for use with the Wordpress Import module
Prep the comment user data from Wordpress WXR file :
• Grep from command line for comment user email address , plus extras :
- We did n't bother with anything but the email in the end because of the messy " names " and multiple names per email address that can be entered on the wordpress blog .
You can get names as well as linked URLs per user if you wanted .
> grep '< wp:comment_author>\|<wp:comment_author_email>\|<wp:comment_author_url >'
WORDPRESS-WXR-FILE.xml
• Search and clean up any commas ' , ' in author names via a text editor
- Only if you want more than email addresses
• Grep for lines with @ so as to have only email addresses , and sort by unique
> grep '@ ' GREPED - WORDPRESS-WXR-FILE.txt | sort -u
- if you wanted more than email address do n't grep for @
• Search and replace via a text editor for tags so you have CSV of each record
- yes the tags right there in front of you :)
• Count your lines for kicks
> grep '@ ' GREPED - WORDPRESS-WXR-FILE.txt | sort -u | wc -l
• I used a Spreadsheet to quickly create a second column of user names from the user portion of the email address .
- Giving me an export of a " name , email " CSV file for use with the User Import module .

• Disable all 4 modules :
Map users to the comments :
I got here by reviewing database after making new user comments and new anonymous comments .
• Link new users to their proper comments w/ SQL :
> UPDATE comments , users SET comments.uid = users.uid , comments.name = users.name WHERE comments.mail = users.mail
• Clean other comments of Anonymous names
> UPDATE comments SET comments.name = " " WHERE comments.uid = 0
• Clean email and Homepage from all comments
> UPDATE comments SET comments.mail = " " , comments .homepage = " " WHERE 1
===============================
Notes :
• I used the 6.x - 2.1 version
• 6.x - 2.1 is not dependent upon Menu
• Wordpress module does not allow you to import and map the Wordpress Users who made comments , only the Authors of Wordpress posts .
• Had to turn - up / add " upload_max_filesize = 4 M " to my php.ini for larger uploads
• Possible problem w/ php 5.3.x ?

New firefox support model and coming changes in stable updates
Hello Ubuntu Developers ,
The desktop team has been working since the Karmic UDS on the following blueprint : https://blueprints.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/desktop-lucid-new-firefox-support-model
The upshot of the blueprint is that there will be some changes to users ' desktops if they are currently Hardy , Jaunty or Karmic users .
In Lucid , we put in a lot of effort to ensure these updates will be easier in the future ( Firefox now uses bundled libraries rather than system libraries , we have reduced the number of applications in the archive using xulrunner , and dropped a lot of extensions too ) .
The update for Lucid is quite trivial , but the update in Hardy , Jaunty and Karmic is not quite as simple .
When we roll out the new version , we also need to update the following : * All the Firefox extensions that we ship in the archive * Language packs
In addition to this , we are going to be porting some applications which are currently using xulrunner 1.9 to either the latest version of xulrunner ( 1.9.2.4 ) or Webkit .
However , this can happen after the Firefox rollout , as the 2 xulrunner versions can be installed in parallel .
We have a list of the affected applications [ 2 ] .
We wo n't be porting all of the applications on that list , but will be focusing on the applications which are exposed to insecure content ( at the bottom of the page ) .
Why : Firefox 3.0 ( and xulrunner 1.9 ) are now unsupported by Mozilla .
Rather than backporting security fixes to these now , we are moving to a support model where we will be introducing major new upstream versions in stable releases .
The reason for this is the support periods from Mozilla are gradually becoming shorter , and it will be more and more difficult for us to maintain our current support model in the future ( see [ 1 ] for information ) .
When : Next week , Mozilla will release Firefox 3.6.4 as a minor update to the 3.6 series .
This will be rolled out to Lucid , Hardy , Jaunty and Karmic ( along with xulrunner 1.9.2.4 ) .
Call for Testing : Packages will be hosted in the Ubuntu Mozilla Security team PPA [ 2 ] .
As this is being rolled out as a security update ( rather than a SRU ) , there is no bug report tracking this .
The rollout is being covered ( and will be announced ) by USN - 930 - 1 .
Clearly , there are significant risks associated with the update .
In addition to ensuring that Firefox and all the extensions still function correctly after the update , we also need to ensure : 1 . All the Firefox plugins ( eg , Flash ) still work 2 .
The actual upgrade to the latest version goes smoothly 3 .
We do n't break Hardy -> Lucid and Jaunty -> Karmic upgrades
4 . The upgrade works with the *- updates pocket disabled Applications that are ported to the latest version of xulrunner ( or to Webkit ) will also need testing .
However , we will also need to test every application on the list in [ 3 ] ( even the ones which are n't being updated ) , with the latest version of xulrunner installed on the system .
The reason for this is that most applications dynamically load one of the GRE's on the system , and some of these applications will load 1.9.2.4 if it is present .
I already know of 1 API change in 1.9.2.4 which had been causing me problems with applications I 've been porting , so it 's possible that the same issue will affect applications we are n't porting if they load the newest GRE .
You can help testing the upgrade by following the instruction on https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2010-June/030811.html

The signal on West 117th Street at Interstate 90 turns red , and roadway movement stops .
Curb - lane drivers turning right onto the westbound highway look ahead and see a clear path .
It looks safe to go .
Too bad it 's illegal .
" No Turn on Red " signage stymies I - 90 - bound motorists at the always busy spot just south of shopping plazas on Cleveland 's West Side .
The do n't - do - it notice " seemingly functions only to bottle up traffic , " according to Road Rant lookout Jim Spilsbury of Lakewood , one of several readers to complain about the order .
The curb lane functions only to pour southbound West 117th vehicles onto I -90 .
No other traffic rolls into the entry path .
There is a crosswalk to consider , but there 's also a clear line of sight -- better than most traditional intersections -- to spot pedestrians .
Simply put , no reason stands out to force a no - right - on - red rule .
So why have it ?
Heads up : Signage informs motorists that they can't drive down Landon Road in Shaker Heights during certain hours .
Unfortunately , the nitty - gritty details arrive a tad late for those turning off Shaker Boulevard .
Westbound traffic on Shaker learns the specifics of the restriction after committing toward Landon and Green Road , reports Road Rant scout Sheldon Gisser .
The posted notices on Landon stand roughly 200 feet from where boulevard drivers start veering right .
" I doubt I am the only one who is unable to read the small print , " the Pepper Pike man e-mailed .
That forces a last - second decision for drivers aimed at Landon between the prohibited hours of 7 and 9:30 a.m. and 3 and 6:30 p.m. Monday through Friday : Either go rogue and disobey or turn right onto Green Road and map a new route .
It 's an annoying setup , Gisser said .
It 's also fixable with the installation of a sign along Shaker Boulevard before the intersection at Landon .
So how about it , Shaker Heights ?
Night frights : Joe Harmon knows people can vanish in the dark .
Two streetlights fronting his round - the - clock storage facility in North Royalton stopped glowing a few years back .
The outage turned the cul - de-sac on York Theta Drive into a gloomy location . . . and that 's not exactly good for business .
Harmon e-mailed that he's " tired of losing potential customers and the peace of mind of my existing customers " to the inky conditions .
So Road Rant put the spot in the spotlight .
A call to FirstEnergy brought a review of the situation .
( Crews responded previously but never managed to resolve the problem . )
The illumination gang determined that an underground circuit needs to be replaced , making the job a bit more complex .
Design work is under way and officials expect a fix within a week or two .
In other words , the future looks bright .
Scaling back : Macedonia decluttered .
Workers removed three of the 11 street - name signs identifying Aurora Road ( Ohio 82 ) , North Bedford Road and Valley View Road where they intersect just east of Interstate 271 in northern Summit County .
It 's an improvement . . . though fewer nameplates would be even better .
Road Rant noted a complaint about the excess signage in the spring .
Safety step : A pair of busy East Side streets now offer walking instructions .
Cleveland crews relighted the pedestrian signals at the tricky intersection where Woodland Avenue and Kinsman Road meet East 55th Street .
Road Rant noted the out - of - order devices in a previous column .
The wobbly bits that shook the world :
The joyous support created by one model 's picture ( flabby tummy and all )
At first glance it 's just the kind of playful picture your boyfriend might snap of you , caught unawares on a lazy Sunday morning .
The subject looks glowing , happy , natural , totally at ease with her body and herself .
But something is awry .
Something that causes you to do a double - take .
Especially given that this photo has just appeared in a glossy magazine .
By now , I bet you 've spotted it .
What I am referring to is the small roll of fat around the middle of this 20 - year - old model .
It might be a tiny imperfection , but when it was published in the American edition of Glamour magazine , it appeared amid hundreds of pages of adverts and fashion shots in which the models have no blemishes , no frown lines , no wrinkles and certainly no body fat .
Defying convention : Lizzie Miller 's tummy has featured as a story on America 's morning TV programme Today , one of the most - watched shows in the country
So what impact did this little mound of flesh have ?
Were women disgusted that such an offensive thing should be displayed in public ?
Well , even though it was only 3in square and hidden away on page 194 , this extraordinary image of a woman with wobbly bits that have not been airbrushed away has sparked a whirlwind of reaction - almost all of it positive .
Hundreds of readers flooded the magazine 's website the moment after the image first appeared , roaring their approval and appreciation with comments like : ' I love this picture .
I was starting to despair of ever seeing real women in magazines and it made me reassess how I look at myself .
I have a similar tummy which I hate - but look at her , she 's beautiful . '
Groundbreaking : Lizzie - who is 5ft 11in and 121/2st - is considered too big to model even plus - size lines
Such was the excitement that Lizzie Miller 's tummy featured as a story on America 's morning TV programme Today , one of the most - watched shows in the country .
Now Glamour is planning a follow - up feature in November 's issue which will include more shots of Miller .
Many of the women who spoke out in support of the image were horrified that professional Lizzie - who is 5ft 11in and 121/2st - is considered too big to model even plus - size lines .
Brave stand : Jamie Lee Curtis showed the nation even Hollywood celebrities have lumps and bumps
Having been rejected as too big , she said the reaction to her picture proves ' that the world is hungry to see pictures of normal women ' .
She 's so right .
What also gives this image such sledgehammer power is that it's not her breasts or her upper arms or her thighs that draw the eye immediately , but the stomach - the area of every woman 's body that inspires more agonies of self - loathing than any other .
You might be a mother who , however hard you try , simply cannot shift what has cruelly been dubbed the ' mummy tummy ' .
Or you might be a young woman who likes a glass of wine and is paying the price with a bulging midriff that just never responds to sit-ups .
Of course , when we dress up to go out we can always rely on one variety or another of Bridget Jones 's big hold - em - in pants .
But when we are naked in front of the mirror , there is no disguising a sagging tummy .
That 's why it 's so groundbreaking to see a beautiful woman who is a model , even if a curvy one , willing to reveal that she , too , has the same imperfections as the rest of us .
In its way , this picture has as much power to shock as the photograph of actress Jamie Lee Curtis , who seven years ago stripped to her underwear at 43 - without the aid of an airbrush - to prove that even a woman who was once Hollywood 's pin-up girl had matured to have as many lumps and bumps as the rest of us .
When I was editing SHE magazine in the early Nineties , we decided to produce a special ' Big is Beautiful ' issue .
We ran a competition to award a modelling contract to a size 14 - plus model , and featured women naked who were far larger than Lizzie Miller .
We also ran a picture of the famously fat Dawn French on the cover , showing off her considerable decolletage in a knockout vermilion Vivienne Westwood dress .
That issue of the magazine flew off the shelves to become a complete sell - out , the fastest and highest - selling issue in the six years I was editor .
I made a vow from then on to feature women of all shapes and sizes , and not just in specially flagged - up features .
I thought that perhaps in the dozen years since I stopped editing glossy magazines things would have changed .
I hoped that , along with reality television and an appetite for real - life stories of every hue , real - life women with real - life bodies might begin to appear in other glossy magazines and across the media .
Airbrushed : Keira Knightley 's breasts have suddenly acquired a bigger cup size in the new Chanel ad , and everyone is talking about her breasts as if they own them
AT A GLANCE ... 8 per cent of women have a classic hourglass figure
34in is the typical British woman 's waist .
In the Fifties , it was 27.5in
20 per cent of women are pear - shaped
But what seems to have happened is quite the reverse .
Just look at Sophie Dahl , who arrived like a blazing comet on the fashion scene as a gloriously sensual size 14 , but who then began to shrink before our very eyes until she was wafer thin , presumably because she was constantly surrounded by images of female perfection .
And if models and celebrities are not actually perfect , they sure as hell will be by the time their images appear on the newsstands .
As Lizzie Miller herself has said : ' Pretty much every picture in a magazine or ad is airbrushed . . .
I do n't think the public understands how much smoke and mirrors are involved in making women look like that .'
On this last point , I think Lizzie is wrong .
Almost everyone these days is aware that photographs are re-touched .
Kate Winslet went public about her thighs when they were airbrushed almost to the point of disappearing altogether when she appeared on the cover of GQ .
Keira Knightley 's breasts have suddenly acquired a bigger cup size in the new Chanel ad , and everyone is talking about her breasts as if they own them .
But even if we are aware of what goes on in the world of showbiz and fashion , that does n't mean we should be blase about it , or pretend it has nothing to do with us .
Being bombarded with perfect images everywhere just makes us despair all the more about our imperfect bodies .
Real women :
The only genuine media breakthrough in recent years as far as the portrayal of real women is concerned has been the Dove Campaign
If all those celebrities , with their personal trainers , personal nutritionists , personal stylists , hairdressers and make - up artists , world - class photographers and expert lighting , can't be seen in pictures without being airbrushed , what might the rest of us need before being deemed acceptable to be seen in public ?
A full body transplant , perhaps .
The only genuine media breakthrough in recent years as far as the portrayal of real women is concerned has been the Dove Campaign For Real Beauty , featuring women of all ages , shapes and sizes .
Not only did women respond well to it , Unilever was canny enough to make the campaign ongoing .
Never mind that it's all part of its brand - boosting campaign to sell more products , The Dove Self - Esteem Fund , which provides teachers with educational tools to include body awareness seminars within schools , is at least a stab at raising the issues involved .
Even Alexandra Shulman , the editor of British Vogue , entered the fray recently when she criticised prominent fashion designers for encouraging Size Zero models by sending out tiny clothes for fashion shoots .
In an open letter , she wrote : ' We have now reached the point where many of the sample sizes do n't comfortably fit the established star models . '
She also pointed to the trend for ' jutting bones and no breasts or hips ' and how such body shapes are a result of the ' minuscule ' pieces of clothing supplied to the magazine for photo shoots .
Vogue is regularly re-touching photos to make the models look larger , she told the designers .
But how much larger , I wonder .
From a Size Zero to a size 2 or 4 perhaps ?
Almost even up to Kate Moss 's ' gigantic ' proportions ?
The trouble is , when you 're talking about Vogue , it 's all relative is n't it ?
In high - end magazines like that , you will rarely see anything so provocative as this new picture of Lizzie Miller .
Susie Orbach , author of Fat Is A Feminist Issue and , more recently , Bodies , says she sees far more people in her psychotherapy practice than she used to who are unhappy about their bodies - presumably because of the intense pressures they feel from the media to be perfect .
' Bodies are becoming part of our personal mission to tame , extend and perfect , ' she writes .
That 's why she 's not surprised that eating disorders , self - harm and a general feeling of being cheated out of the body we want are all on the increase .
' Body shame , ' Orbach says , has gone global , and she cites the example of South Korea , where 50 per cent of young women are having surgery to give them ' Western ' eyelids .
Chinese girls , in the meantime , are having rods inserted in their legs to make them taller , and Tehran in Iran has 3,000 surgeons specialising in nose jobs .
' The body has become a casing for fantasy , ' says Orbach , ' rather than a place from which to live . '
It 's taken me 56 years to become reasonably comfortable with the body nature gave me .
To my self - critical eye my breasts have always been too small , my bottom too big , my knees too fat .
Who knew ?
Islands in the South Pacific , including Nauru , Tonga and Micronesia , top the list of countries with the greatest percentage of overweight adults - a portly 90 per cent
Illnesses have taken me to a level of skinniness which horrified me , but as soon as the weight has come back on I 've begun to feel discontent again with what I 've got , pinching disconsolately at myself , castigating myself for not watching the levels of cholesterol in my diet or going to the gym .
In the past six months I 've put on about 12lb and my washboard stomach is now a small mound - rather like Lizzie Miller 's , in fact .
I know why I 've put on weight - it's because I 'm happier and more relaxed than I 've been for a long while .
Nevertheless , I told my boyfriend I needed to lose a few pounds .
He told me I could do with just a few pounds more and that it was good to see me looking like a woman rather than a boy .
At this stage in my life , I hope I have the wisdom to know that he 's right and that I will never , and should never , look like the models I see in fashion magazines .
But it 's so hard not to feel inferior , undesirable , in comparison .
It 's ironic when you think about it that mostly it 's not men who make us paranoid about our bodies - they often do n't even notice imperfections that we agonise over for years .
It 's the magazines for sure that chip away at self - esteem .
Perhaps one small picture of lovely Lizzie Miller and her little pot belly - just like the women currently prancing in all their variety around the London stage in Calendar Girls - is n't going to make much of a difference to this chronic and complex condition of female body dissatisfaction .
But it 's a step in the right direction .
Unless we start addressing the issues , unless we wise up to the fact that our body fantasies can never be fulfilled , we 'll continue to be pointlessly unhappy for a long time to come .
A University of Southampton archaeologist and Oxford Archaeology have found evidence that Neanderthals were living in Britain at the start of the last ice age , 40,000 years earlier than previously thought .
Commissioned by Oxford Archaeology , the University of Southampton 's Dr Francis Wenban - Smith discovered two ancient flint hand tools at the M25 / A2 road junction at Dartford in Kent , during an excavation funded by the Highways Agency .
The flints are waste flakes from the manufacture of unknown tools , which would almost certainly have mostly been used for cutting up dead animals .
Tests on sediment burying the flints show they date from around 100,000 years ago , proving Neanderthals were living in Britain at this time .
The country was previously assumed to have been uninhabited during this period .
" I could n't believe my eyes when I received the test results .
We know that Neanderthals inhabited Northern France at this time , but this new evidence suggests that as soon as sea levels dropped , and a ' land bridge ' appeared across the English Channel , they made the journey by foot to Kent , " says Francis .
Early pre-Neanderthals inhabited Britain before the last ice age , but were forced south by a previous glaciation about 200,000 year ago .
When the climate warmed up again between 130,000 and 110,000 years ago , they could n't get back because , similar to today , the Channel sea - level was raised , blocking their path .
This discovery shows they returned to our shores much earlier than 60,000 years ago , as previous evidence suggested .
" The fieldwork uncovered a significant amount of activity at the Dartford site in the Bronze Age and Roman periods , but it is deeper trenches excavated through much older sediments which have yielded the most interesting results -- shedding light on a long period when there was assumed to have been an absence of early man from Britain , " comments Oxford Archaeology Project Manager David Score .
One theory is that Neanderthals may have been attracted back to Kent by the flint - rich chalk downs visible from France .
These supported herds of mammoth , rhino , horse and deer -- an important source of food in sub-arctic conditions .
" These are people who had no real shelter -- no houses , not even caves , so we can only speculate that by the time they returned , they had developed physiologically to cope with the cold , as well as developing behavioural strategies such as planning winter stores and making good use of fire , " says Dr Francis Wenban - Smith .
The last glacial period ( or ice age ) occurred between around 110,000 to 10,000 years ago , but this was interspersed with fluctuations when the climate temporarily warmed .
It is unclear whether Neanderthal colonisation across North Western Europe and Britain was related to these minor fluctuations ..
Dr Wenban - Smith believes more evidence is needed to date their occupations more accurately , to show how many were living in Kent at this time , how far they roamed into Britain and how long they stayed for .
The Channel is also a critical area for further research , with the buried landscape between Boulogne and Newhaven -- provisionally christened " Boulognia " -- possibly containing the crucial evidence .
The excavation was carried out prior to construction work on the scheme by the Costain Group PLC .
The archaeological investigations were designed by Jacobs Engineering U.K. Ltd , in consultation with Kent County Council .
Other results from the project include the discovery of a woolly rhino tooth in the floodplain gravels of the River Darent , dated at around 40,000 years old .
The Event is an emotional , high - octane conspiracy thriller that follows Sean Walker ( Jason Ritter , " The Class " ) , an everyman who investigates the mysterious disappearance of his would - be fiancée Leila ( Sarah Roemer , " Disturbia " ) , and unwittingly begins to expose the biggest cover - up in U.S. history ...
Sean 's quest will send ripples through the lives of an eclectic band of strangers , including newly elected U.S. President Elias Martinez ( Golden Globe nominee Blair Underwood , " In Treatment " ) ; Sophia Maguire ( Emmy Award nominee Laura Innes , " ER " ) , who is the leader of a mysterious group of detainees ; and Leila 's shadowy father ( Scott Patterson , " Gilmore Girls " ) .
Their futures are on a collision course in a global conspiracy that could ultimately change the fate of mankind .
Ian Anthony Dale ( " Daybreak " ) , Clifton Collins , Jr. ( " Star Trek " ) , Taylor Cole ( " The Violent Kind " ) , Lisa Vidal ( " The Division " ) , Bill Smitrovich ( " The Practice " ) , and Emmy winner Željko Ivanek ( " Damages " ) also star in the ensemble drama .
The Event is a production of Universal Media Studios and Steve Stark Productions .
Evan Katz ( " 24 " ) serves as executive producer / showrunner ; Steve Stark ( " Medium , " " Facing Kate " ) serves as executive producer ; Jeffrey Reiner ( NBC's " Friday Night Lights , " " Trauma " ) is director / executive producer ; and Nick Wauters ( " The 4400 , " " Eureka " ) is creator / co- executive producer .
I was quite happy with print - manager progress as you can read on my last post , in about 3 weeks of work it looked like almost everything was done , so I started to create the Add Printer Assistant , and my first problem was : “ I really need threads now ” .
My idea was to add threads support on KDE SC 4.6 , till there we would have UI freezes but not so much …
The problem was that the cups method to get new printers hangs for 30 seconds , so it ’s not a short freeze anymore .
The pain of threads …
My graduation project was an application called doKa that downloaded using threads , well it was a really nice project and working with threads there gave me lot ’s of ground to start putting threads in printer - manager , but this time I had a really hard work : P .
The problem is that when the authentication dialog comes up we need to do some event loop locking , as the thread needs to wait for the end of the dialog and the UI must only return when the user type it ’s password .
It worked when just one thing was done at time , but as the printers list has to be updated we got into a dead lock , all the calls to cups started a QEventLoop so we could call exit on it when the cups request was finished , but the first call to cups would only exit after the second call exited which never happens , even if we explicit called loop -> exit ( ) .
Thiago Maciera helped a lot with some stuff I was doing wrong but after that the problem got intermittent 😛
I was almost giving up …
I had lots of ideas and lots of ways of how not to do it !
But finally I had the async idea that solved every thing , now each request returns a request object that emits finished when it ’s done so no more locking with QEventLoops and no more dead locks 😀
Right , so now is just the Add Printers UI right ?
Well yes , but no , Riddell invited me to go to UDS to talk about KPackage Kit / aptcc and printer - manager stuff and being there one of the developers of the gnome printer applet showed to me what I ’d need to do in the Add Printer UI which is not so simple stuff .
There is lots of magic ( logic ) to find a good match to the printer driver , samba searches , queue searches … how to handle when a printer is plugged in .
This was very important , since I was doing a simple http://localhost:631
replacement and then I saw that doing these things would be very important …
So yes , no printer - manager in KDE SC 4.5 .
But hey !
Do n’t be sad , today I and some oxygen friends made some UI improvements , and it ’s looking really nice , pinheiro is also working on some more icons ( fax , MFP … ) so here you can see some progress , hopefully soon I ’ll have the Add Printer doing some stuff , and maybe you distro can backport that 😀
You have made known to me the path of life ; you will fill me with joy in your presence , with eternal pleasures at your right hand .

Bankruptcies are still plaguing this country and show deeper strain in the fabric of the economy .
Average Americans are still very much dealing with the challenges of a deep and profound recession .
Filing for bankruptcy is usually the end of the financial line for many Americans .
Yet in the last month of data for March of 2010 we saw the highest number of bankruptcy filings in the entire fiscal year .
Instead of the rate dropping it has actually increased .
Keep in mind that these filings are coming at a time when bankruptcy laws have become tougher and stricter on most Americans .
Yet there is only so much you can squeeze out of someone who has entered the last stage of their financial options .
This is why even programs that focus on mortgage adjustments do n’t help because they do n’t drill deep enough into the core of what is happening in our economy .
Without a job or adequate income , most will simply default whether it is in bankruptcy or through foreclosure .
The spike in 2005 below was bankruptcy cases rushing through the system before tougher legislation was enacted :
Source : U.S. Courts
The number of filings still remains elevated and is a reflection of the structural problems in the economy .
We need to remember that when people file , the vast majority are at a point where they are no longer able to service their debts with their current cash flows .
In other words , they are insolvent .
It is interesting that the large banks reached this point in 2008 yet were able to muster unlimited access to taxpayer money through the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve .
Clearly individual Americans do n’t have this luxury and must deal with the trappings of a system that is pushing many over the edge .
Many have brought this on but others have paid medical bills with credit cards .
Either way , there are major losses ahead .
Quarterly data may not show the exact changes or turns in the economy .
But if we break down the last fiscal year for bankruptcy filings we see that we end on an extremely high number of filings :
By far the last point was the highest on record .
It is likely that this reflects the courts rushing to close the year with later cases but whatever the reason may be , this spike is not a good sign for the financial health of average Americans .
The problems of bankruptcy are not limited to one part of the region .
Although it would seem that Nevada and the South have larger per capita case filings :
It is clear that bankruptcy hits every part of this country .
If we look at the latest data for May , we find the following :
May 2010 filings ( personal filings ) : 136,142 May 2009 filings ( personal filings ) : 124,838
This is a solid 9 percent increase over the last year .
Keep in mind this latest jump occurred under the notion that the economy is recovering .
It also reflects the unwillingness of banks to work with average Americans even though that is specifically what the bailouts were based on .
What is occurring unfortunately with banks is the hoarding of bailout funds to speculate on Wall Street while letting American families be crushed by their insurmountable debt .
The breathing room they have gotten from the taxpayers is not being given back .
It is a troubling case of do as I say , not as I do .
The bottom line with spikes in bankruptcy filings is that the real economy is still mired in deep systemic problems .
If we have people anxiously waiting for their food assistance debit cards to refill at midnight simply so they can go to Wal - Mart to buy food , this tells us the economy is anything but solid .
Bankruptcy is never the first option and is a long process .
To show you that this can hit everyone even those that appear to be rich a New Jersey “ housewife ” shows that spending too much can lead many into a precarious financial position :
( NY Post ) Spendaholic ‘ housewife of NJ ’ owes a big - hair - raising $ 11M Behind the bankruptcy filing What the Giudices make a year : $ 79,000 ( plus $ 120,000 in “ assistance ” from family members )
What they owe : $ 10,853,648.04 Credit Cards
$ 104,000
including $ 20,000 to Bloomingdale ’s , Neiman Marcus , Nordstrom $ 1,280 monthly payment for Cadillac Escalade Mortgages
$ 2.6 M
for eight mortgages on three homes ( two have been handed back to lenders ) $ 5.8 M
Joe ’s business investments $ 85,600 Home repairs $ 12,000 Fertility treatments $ 2,300 Phone bill
Now run those numbers .
$ 79,000 annual income and $ 11 million of debt !
Now I ’m sure many other families are nowhere close to this but there are many families out in more high cost of living regions that took on say $ 1 million in debt with a $ 40,000 income .
This was easily done during the credit bubble days .
I ’m sure the courts are seeing many of these cases as well .
In the end , the fact that bankruptcy filings are this high shows that the economy is n’t exactly on the mend .

Toronto - Two Toronto Police Services officers have just approached the Alternative Media Centre , asking to speak with its members at 1:22 pm .
They were immediately asked for a warrant .
The officers said that there was no warrant and that they were investigating a complaint .
When approached and asked why they were coming to the media centre , Constable S. Chen ( #499 ) said that they were investigating a complaint from neighbours that people had been milling about the outside of the building all week .
Constable Chen was accompanied by Constable N. McIsaac ( #10576 ) .
The centre has been operating 24 hours a day , 7 days a week since Monday the 21st .
According to Chen , " people called about this place " .
Police said that they could not put their complaint to rest because the media centre was not speaking to them and they did not know who the owner was .
" We do n't know if there 's a break and enter or if people are squatting . "
When police were asked why they did not use the City of Toronto's ' assessment roles ' which have the names and contact info of every property owner in the City , police said they did not know about it .
When asked how that could be since a number of TPS officers can go to City Hall to use the information , the Constable replied " I do n't know about that , it 's not my division . "
The visit comes while several Alternative Media Centre ( AMC ) journalists are in jail or the hospital .
Two were peacefully protesting at Queen 's Park on Saturday before being arrested and detained .
Another , with accreditation from the Guardian , was arrested while covering the a demonstration at Novatel hotel .
A strike by the hotel workers union , Unite HERE , was joined by hundreds targeting the hotel and the French delegation staying there .
Reports indicate that 150 people were arrested .
A fourth AMC journalist was arrested , ironically , while protesting the detainment of others at the Eastern Av. detention centre .
They were pulled into a van and taken away .
A fifth and sixth AMC journalist were arrested for witnessing and covering a police detainment of ten Montreal activists who were being asking for ID .
One of the journalists was beaten very badly , and taken to the hospital for x-rays .
Other journalists were also sporting bruises and injuries from police sustained yesterday at demonstrations .
The Two Constables at the Alternative Media Centre were later joined by a third Constable , M. Morris .
The centre 's landlord came to out to confirm that the Centre , filled with equipment and journalists for a week , was not the victim of a break and enter or group of squatters .

Julia Gillard has been sworn in as Australia 's first female prime minister after a surprise leadership vote in the ruling Labor Party ousted Kevin Rudd .
Mr Rudd chose not to take part in the ballot knowing he would suffer an embarrassing defeat to his deputy .
Ms Gillard said she believed " a good government was losing its way " and vowed to revive Labor ahead of a general election expected in October .
The party has suffered a sharp drop in support in opinion polls this year .
A turn - around on a carbon trading scheme and a wrangle over a controversial mining tax led to a sharp slide in approval ratings for Mr Rudd 's government .
So long as she can wipe the slate clean of Rudd 's mess , she should make a great leader David , BBC News website user , Melbourne Your views Profile : Julia Gillard
Ms Gillard , who was deputy prime minister before the surprise Wednesday night challenge to Mr Rudd , stood unopposed at a vote of the Labor Party 's 112 members of parliament at a meeting on Thursday morning .
Treasurer Wayne Swan was elected the new deputy leader , also unopposed .
Ms Gillard was born in Barry in south Wales , moving to Australia with her family at the age of four .
Emotional
Emerging victorious from the party vote at Parliament House in Canberra , Ms Gillard told reporters : " I came to the view that a good government was losing its way .
They 've changed the salesman but they have n't changed the product Tony Abbott , Liberal Party leader Australia 's pioneering Welsh PM
" I believe too I have a responsibility to make sure at the next election that Labor is there at its strongest . "
On the issue of a planned " super tax " on mining , which had dogged Mr Rudd , she said she wanted a consensus .
" We need to do more than consult , we need to negotiate ... we need to end this uncertainty , " she said .
" Today , I am throwing open the government 's door to the mining industry and in return I ask the mining industry to open its mind . "
On Mr Rudd , she said : " He was the leader who saw us through the global financial crisis .
Analysis
The tumble of events has been extraordinarily fast , for at the start of this year the polls suggested Kevin Rudd remained Australia 's most popular PM in 30 years - since the days of Bob Hawke .
But the pivotal moment came when he decided to shelve the centrepiece of his environmental strategy , an emissions trading scheme .
Many thought it was an act of political cowardice - gutless was the oft - heard word .
Since becoming leader of the Labor party in 2006 , he had always been much more popular with the Australian people than with his colleagues in the Labor party .
But after picking a fight with the resources sector over his plans for a super tax on their super profits , the polls slumped again .
The party powerbrokers and factional leaders decided the government would fare better at the forthcoming federal election with Julia Gillard at its head .

" He came within a breath of brokering an international agreement on climate change . "
Mr Rudd , 52 , repeatedly choked back tears as he and his family appeared before the media in Canberra .
" I have given it my absolute all and in that spirit I am proud of the achievements we have delivered to make this country fairer , " he said .
Mr Rudd said he would devote himself to helping Labor get re-elected , adding that they were " a good team led by a good prime minister " .
" I 'm proud of the fact that we kept Australia out of the global financial crisis , " he said .
" I 'm proud of the fact that had we not done so , we would had had half a million Australians out there out of work . "
Opposition Liberal Party leader Tony Abbott dismissed the change of leadership , saying Ms Gillard was committed to the " same dud policies " of her predecessor .
" They 've changed the salesman but they have n't changed the product , " he told reporters .
Fall from grace
Mr Rudd had called a late - night news conference on Wednesday to announce the ballot after Ms Gillard said she would challenge him for the party leadership .
Mr Rudd , who led Labor to a landslide election victory against the Liberal government in 2007 , blamed " a number of factional leaders " within the party for plotting against him .
Mr Rudd had initially insisted he would stand in the leadership ballot , but the BBC's Nick Bryant in Australia said that by Thursday morning Mr Rudd could not even muster enough support to contend the ballot .
Mr Rudd started this year as the most popular Australian prime minister in three decades and was widely expected to win the federal election expected in October with ease .
But his popularity plummeted following a number of policy setbacks , our correspondent adds .
He shelved the centrepiece of his environmental strategy , an Emissions Trading Scheme ( ETS ) , which led to accusations of political cowardice .
Mr Rudd then entered into an advertising war with the country 's powerful mining sector over his plans for a super tax on their " super profits " .
Newish Portland Mayor Sam Adams wants to build more “ 20 - minute neighborhoods ” in his fair city .
From a Fast Company interview :
We ’re also working to make every section of Portland a complete 20 - minute neighborhood to strengthen our local economy .
Two - thirds of all trips in Portland and in most American cities are not about getting to and from work .
So if I can offer quality , affordable goods and services , eliminate food deserts , have neighborhoods with schools and parks and amenities –if I can create these 20 - minute complete neighborhoods all over Portland–it strengthens our local economy .
We drive 20 % less than cities of comparable size , and because we do n’t manufacture cars , produce oil , or have car insurance companies , every dollar that we do n’t spend elsewhere , will stay in Portland ’s economy .
There ’s about $ 850 million that stays in Portlanders ’s pockets because we drive less .
With a 20 - minute neighborhood , also reduce congestion and meet our climate action plan goals .
The point is to encourage neighborhoods where basic amenities are within comfortable walking ( or biking ) distance .
Sort of a catchier term for “ mixed - use development . ”
Makes sense for all sorts of reasons , as Adams says .
Side note : After President Obama failed to speak the phrase “ climate change ” in his Oval Office address , there ’s been a conversation about whether leaders can effectively address a problem they ’re afraid to name ( presumably because polls say the public does n’t care about it ) .
Rather than yet another attempt to rebrand climate change / global warming / global weirding , etc , etc. , may I suggest that it might be more fruitful to add phrases like “ 20 - minute neighborhood ” that flesh out what a response to climate - change looks like ?
Concepts such as that and location efficiency help illustrate a sustainable vision , they ’re not politically charged ( for now ) , and they appeal to notions of health , community , and quality of life along with the environmental benefits .
" It was agreed to liberalize the system by which civilian goods enter Gaza [ and ] expand the inflow of materials for civilian projects that are under international supervision . "
AFTER pondering the matter for two days , the Israeli cabinet has announced it will ease some of the restrictions of Israel 's land blockade of Gaza .
After the meeting , the government released a statement saying :
But it is far from clear what this " liberalisation " will entail , or how fast it will happen .
The statement also says that Israel would continue to implement the " existing security procedures to prevent the inflow of weapons and war materials " and that it will decide in the coming days how it will implement this decision .
Some items banned from Gaza , mainly construction materials , are forbidden on the basis that they are " dual-use " — they might be used to build houses but they might also be for building bombs , says Israel .
The statement has been greeted with caution .
Catherine Ashton , the EU 's foreign policy chief , responded by saying that the EU supports Israel 's intention to ease the blockade but pointed out that " this is an in - principle statement ... obviously the detail is what matters " .
Unsurprisingly , Hamas has been swift to criticise the proposal , dismissing it as propaganda .
The cabinet 's decision reflects Israel 's concern that its botched and bloody operation to stop a protest flotilla bound for Gaza last month has not just tarnished its reputation , but also undermined the legitimacy of its policy of besieging the Hamas - controlled Gaza Strip .
Barack Obama has said " the situation in Gaza is unsustainable " .
As America and Britain found with their sanctions against Iraq in the days of Saddam Hussein , an economic blockade tends to lose support over time and ends up isolating the sanctioner .
Tony Blair , the former British prime minister , presaged the change in Israeli policy by saying he was hopeful that the restrictions would change in emphasis .
He suggested that instead of permitting only a restricted list of goods to enter Gaza , a new system would allow in all items except for a limited number placed on a " blacklist " .
It is unclear whether the cabinet decision goes this far .
But Mr Netanyahu will be hoping that he has yielded enough on the humanitarian front to maintain enough restrictions to choke the flow of weapons to Gaza .
Arms , as well as civilian goods , flow into Gaza through the network of underground tunnels connecting the territory to Egypt .
Israeli officials argue that the blockade prevents longer - range rockets , able to threaten Tel Aviv , from reaching Gaza .
From Israel 's perspective , the key is to maintain the naval blockade .
And that is what will be challenged repeatedly as more protest ships are prepared — including several sponsored by Iran that will call at various Arab ports .
Things could get uglier still off the beaches of Gaza .
A 2 cm long fish apparently found it 's way into the penis of a 14 - year - old boy from India in a bizarre medical case .
The patient was admitted to hospital with complaints of pain , dribbling urine and acute urinary retention spanning a 24 - hour period .
According to the boy , the fish slipped into his penis while he was cleaning his aquarium at home .
Professor Vezhaventhan and Professor Jeyaraman , who treated the boy and later wrote a paper on the case , explained : " While he was cleaning the fish tank in his house , he was holding a fish in his hand and went to the toilet for passing urine .
When he was passing urine , the fish slipped from his hand and entered his urethra and then he developed all these symptoms . "
After detecting the fish in the boy 's bladder , Vezhaventhan and Jeyaraman used a technique known as cystourethroscopy to insert a special set of forceps down the patient 's penis .
Unfortunately , the fish was just too slippery to grip , so they resorted to using a rigid ureteroscope with a tool attached that is normally used for removing bladder stones .
The fish the urologists removed , which Practical Fishkeeping believes to be a small member of the Betta genus , measured 2 cm long and 1.5 cm wide .
He was later admitted into counseling to help him overcome any trauma .

“ We need to enhance community support for younger children in troubled families — to fight crime early .
I used to have some very good buddies who did n’t receive too much attention from their families , and were naturally comforted by the influence of other ‘ bad ’ kids .
I say ‘ comforted ’ because unlike the rest of the world around them , they actually talked and listened to each other .
I think the best way to ease crime in the city would be to pay more attention to these kids .
They are not bad people , and all they really wanted is a group of people that could understand them .
Every single kid likes people who listen to them .
It ’s one thing to get tough on crime , with longer jail terms or curbing gun violence , but we need to increase the amount of community support services in the city .
Sure , spending resources to curb gun violence is helpful , but that is just an immediate patch .
I truly believe that any criminal in this city could have been on a better track .
Instead of immediate solutions to reduce crime , please consider a greater focus on the long term . ”

“ I believe that to make life better in Greater Toronto , we must engage our youth in extracurricular activities , such as sports or leadership .
One idea , with respect to engagement of Toronto ’s youth , may be community sport centres , particularly in areas where parents cannot afford to give their kids these extracurricular opportunities .
There is strong evidence that participation in sports also leads to an increase in learning development and therefore , an increase in school grades .
After reading about the closing of schools in the Toronto District School Board , I would want to see these schools turn into community sport centres — areas where youth can go to exercise and promote active living .
If you are not as involved in sports , then leadership may be an alternative .
In the education system , there has always been some type of student involvement , whether it is through student councils , student senates or student trustees .
What is strange is why there is not this same youth involvement in our city council ?
How can a council , which admits to representing all the people of Toronto , not have a representative from our age group ? ”

“ I ’ve gone to school with students from all over the world , incredible people who want to make a positive change .
Unfortunately , our school system sometimes denies students the opportunity to be the incredible leaders that they are .
A perfect example of this is the community service requirement in high schools where students must complete an obligatory 40 hours .
Community service provides an unparalleled opportunity for the youth of Toronto to discover their passions and give back to their communities .
Students who are passionate about sports have a myriad of events to choose from , whether it be volunteering with a local team or at a city - wide marathon .
And that ’s just one example ; no matter what students are interested in , our city is so diverse that there is an outlet for them to grow themselves and to give back to their communities through volunteering .
In many high schools , the community service requirement is viewed as an obligation , not an opportunity .
Students are not provided with enough opportunity to explore their passions through community service and therefore many students end up forcing themselves to complete the requirement .
They count down every hour volunteering in a place they do not particularly enjoy and when they ’re done , they ’re never coming back .
By providing students with more information regarding opportunities to complete community service , students will select things that they are passionate about and will come back again and again . ”

“ The stereotypical view of the average teen is a careless and ignorant rebel .
However , what many people are unaware of is that most teens are sincere and care deeply about issues that matter .
It ’s just a matter of helping them take initiative to stand up and make a difference in their community .
Thus , if I could suggest one thing to make life better in the GTA , it would be to create more programs within schools involving community initiatives targeted towards teenagers .
As part of my school ’s Empower Student Partnership team – between York Region police and students — I have witnessed the amazing contribution of some of the leaders in our school .
We have done food drives , hockey games to support Sick Kids hospital , fundraisers for cancer research and much more .
As we began to go in depth into issues , more students and younger students decided they would take a part in what the Grade 12 seniors have done in a standing up to bullying campaign .
It is our generation that will eventually replace those before us .
Thus , it ’s vital that we have the tools to identify issues , propose solutions and have courage to make a difference .
With programs that encourage leadership , more students will be motivated to create positive social change in their community and eventually , the outside world . ”

“ I would make the school system more accessible to different learners .
There are a lot of students who are interested in the trades or electronics , but there are not a lot of opportunities .
I think there ’s only one trade school in York Region .
Because of this , we do see a lot of students just checking out .
We could have students in schools .
I think there is an interest among students to learn a trade , but there are n’t the facilities .
There are people who are more inclined to enter the work force from high school .
I do n’t think our school system adequately prepares them to do that . ”
The Department of Defense has identified 1,093 American service members who have died as a part of the Afghan war and related operations .
It confirmed the deaths of the following Americans recently :
BRUMMUND , Gavin R. , 22 , Lance Cpl. , Marines ; Arnold , Calif. ; Second Marine Division .
FIKE , Robert J. , 38 , Sgt. First Class , Army ; Conneautville , Pa. ; First Battalion , 110th Infantry Regiment .

Only 28 per cent of Torontonians received the H1N1 vaccine , far below the 75 per cent targeted by the province .
A report to be presented to the city ’s Board of Health next Tuesday states that the estimated vaccination rate of Toronto residents was 28.2 per cent .
And it confirms what many have long suspected — that the vaccine arrived too late .
The report , essentially a post - mortem on how the pandemic was managed , outlines lessons learned that can inform pandemic and emergency planning in the future .
While the city ’s response was a success in many ways , “ things can always be done better , ” said Dr. Barbara Yaffe , the report ’s lead author and director of communicable disease control for Toronto Public Health .
The public health unit was stymied by changing directives from the provincial health ministry , the report states .
For example , the initial plan stated that only public health units administer the vaccine .
That was later expanded to include physicians and hospitals .
The report calls on the ministry to review options for efficient vaccine delivery and to clarify criteria for decision - making during an influenza pandemic .
It notes that the roles and responsibilities were unclear for the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion and the province ’s 14 local health integration networks , which coordinate local health care services and funding .
Asked about the 28 per cent vaccination rate , Yaffe said : “ Obviously I would have liked to have seen it higher , but I think that given all the challenges that we faced , it was n’t bad . ”
The health ministry has said an estimated 38 per cent of Ontarians were vaccinated .
Yaffe said she could n’t explain the discrepancy .
Noting the numbers were only “ estimates , ” she said only about 70 per cent of family physicians who administered the vaccine submitted regular reports on vaccine uptake .
Yaffe said she was disappointed by the low vaccination rate among health care workers .
Only 39 per cent of employees in long - term care settings got the shot , 58 per cent in acute care settings such as hospitals , and 59 per cent in complex continuing care facilities , which provide a higher level of care .
Last year , the health board urged the province to make flu shots mandatory for health care workers if coverage rates do n’t increase .
The report found that most of the serious illness from the virus occurred before significant immunity from the vaccination was achieved .
“ In retrospect , the vaccine came too late , ” Yaffe said .
The peak of the infection in the second wave occurred at the end of October , just as vaccine was made available to priority populations .
It took up to two weeks for the vaccine to become effective after administered .
Another challenge facing the public health unit was the “ lack of robust surveillance systems ” that would identify how many people were ill in “ real time , ” the report said .
H1N1 quick facts
• More than 750,000 doses of the H1N1 vaccine were administered in Toronto .
• 28.2 per cent of Torontonians got the H1N1 vaccine .
In a normal flu year , 35 per cent of residents get vaccinated .
• Fewer than 50 per cent of physicians surveyed by Toronto Public Health felt the vaccine - ordering process went well .
Frequently cited concerns included vaccine delays , excess red tape , wastage due to large shipments of the vaccine .
• There were 30 deaths associated with the H1N1 virus in Toronto and 428 in Canada .

BP screwed up and now they have to pay .
Nobody doubts they should and everyone knows they will .
Only extremely wealthy companies can afford deep sea drilling , making talk of BP seeking bankruptcy to avoid its obligations ludicrous .
Industrial accidents happen in industrial societies and unless we want to go back to living in trees we should expect others .
We can only learn not to make the same mistakes twice .
There will be much sturm and drang over exactly how many billions BP must ultimately fork over to finance the cleanup and compensate those that were economically harmed , or claimed they were .
Thousands of tort lawyers will make careers chasing this booty and , truth be told , a plague of tort lawyers is how the market disciplines companies that cut corners and spew their externalities on others .
BP will not be able to hide behind a 20 year old law limiting an oil spiller 's secondary liability to $ 75 M .
Let this be a lesson to any industry that thinks it can buy lasting protection from Congress , a fickle partner eager to sell out yesterday 's donors for tomorrow's .
Watch for ex post facto laws targeting BP along with further industry restrictions , taxes , and moratoriums that punish the innocent along with the guilty .
Much commentary will be spilled as Obama responds to yet another crisis by trashing the rule of law .
Announcing on national TV that BP is going to pay into a politically controlled escrow fund before even meeting with the company is a dictatorial fiat that has no foundation in due process .
But the shakedown worked ; Hugo Chavez must be green with envy .
White House political operatives believe the ends justify the means , and why pass up a chance to buttress their boss 's sagging popularity by beating up on BP ?
Besides , think what Washington can do with an extra $ 20 billion in walking around money .
Look for oyster preservation facilities to pop up in West Virginia .
Sadly , nothing can be done to bring back the lives of the eleven workers killed when the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded .
Loss of life is one consequence of accidents that money can't fix .
As an exercise in social responsibility , imagine that an industry inadvertently killed - one million people .
Imagine that they did this every year for twenty five years , making them second only to Mao Zedong as the top mass murderer in history .
Should such a group be held accountable ?
Should the errors leading to those deaths be corrected ?
Apparently not if the killer is environmentalism .
Flash back to Rachel Carson , author of " Silent Spring " and earth mother of the environmental movement .
Carson galvanized the consciousness of an increasingly wealthy society growing tired of swimming in its own waste .
A clean environment is a valuable luxury good , and credit should be given to those who put their shoulders to the wheel to clean up our air , rivers , and harbors .
We live longer , healthier , more pleasant lives thanks to the shift in our value system that forced polluters to clean up after themselves .
Yet giving a blank check to environmentalists has its costs , in this case one to three million preventable deaths a year .
That is the unintended consequence of demonizing DDT , the safest and most cost effective means to kill mosquitoes that carry malaria .
Indiscriminate field spraying of DDT was a questionable practice worthy of restriction .
Harmless to humans ( you can eat it ) some scientists believe DDT accumulates in certain birds making their egg shells thin .
With or without compelling evidence , most of us are willing to pay a few pennies more for Cornflakes in order to live in a world that has eagles and falcons .
Indoor spraying of DDT , on the other hand , has no discernable environmental impact .
For a few pennies a year every hut in African can be made malaria - mosquito free .
$ 5 insecticide - impregnated bed nets can't come close in effectiveness and affordability .
No alternative insecticide is as cheap or as safe .
That 's why the inventor of DDT won the Nobel Prize and why malaria was eradicated from North America .
These facts are widely known yet nothing has been done to ease restrictions on DDT production for indoor use .
Devout environmentalists prefer to sacrifice millions of lives rather than admit they were wrong .
The economic devastation wreaked on the quarter billion people chronically debilitated by malaria is untold .
Misinformation is rife - compare the Wikipedia and Junk Science entries on DDT .
The World Health Organization ( WHO ) finally came around to promoting DDT as an antimalarial but was bullied into recanting .
Do n't hold your breath waiting for Congress to hold hearings .
The dead and dying are mostly Africans who neither vote in US elections nor have the money to make campaign contributions .
If Republicans were at fault the press would blame this shameful callousness on racism .
Instead the cries of African governments for relief fall on deaf ears .
Someday this horrible oil spill will be behind us , paid for by the folks who caused it .
Yet the malaria tragedy continues with no one held responsible .
Apparently errant oil companies make for better villains than errant environmentalists .
Factors to Consider When Setting Up an Emergency Fund
You know that an essential part of your financial health is having an emergency fund of some sort .
Creating an emergency savings plan to help you through difficult times is important .
Your emergency fund can help you make housing payments , buy food and pay for utilities .
If you want true financial freedom , you have to have an emergency fund .
Before you set up your emergency fund , though , consider the following :
Stop Worrying So Much About Growth
First of all , it is important to understand the purpose of an emergency fund .
Your emergency savings are designated for use in a true emergency .
While it would be nice to be earning higher returns on that money , the purpose of an emergency fund is not to provide you with income , nor is it meant to help you build a nest egg .
Once you build an emergency fund to the point where it meets your goal of covering three , six , nine , 12 , or 18 months worth of expenses , you just let it sit .
It ’s a safety net .
Safety
Your emergency fund should be in a safe place .
The whole point is that you have a reserve that can be called upon .
Sticking your emergency savings in stocks — and watching the losses pile up when you might need that money — does n’t really fulfill the purpose .
Safe places for an emergency fund include savings accounts and CDs that are in FDIC - insured accounts .
You can also consider Ginnie Mae funds that are backed by the U.S. government .
The problem with Ginnie Mae funds for an emergency , though , is that if your emergency happens when the fund is down , you might have to take a loss .
Plus , you will have to pay fees on any sort of fund that you use for emergency savings .
Safety means that you will get a smaller return .
However , you can shop around within those safe options for higher yields .
Accessibility
You have to make sure that your emergency fund is accessible .
You want to be able get the money when you need it .
This means checking the withdrawal rules for any savings account you put money into , since many have limits on the number of withdrawals you can take each month ( usually three or six withdrawals per month ) .
CDs can be helpful , and they usually offer higher returns that savings accounts , but accessibility can be a problem .
You might want to set up a ladder for a portion of your emergency savings so that money becomes available , penalty - free , at predictable and usable intervals .
One nice thing about Ginnie Mae funds for emergencies is that some funds offer check writing and other withdrawal privileges so that your money is accessible .
Another consideration with accessibility is how you get to your money .
The nice thing about a savings account is that you can usually use an ATM card to get the money if you need it , or effect a quick and painless transfer to your checking account .
Other types of emergency funds might require a few more hoops to jump through , limiting how quickly you can get the money you need .
You can , of course , spread your emergency savings around so that you keep some of it in a high accessible savings account , able to hold you over until you can access a CD or some other less immediately accessible source .
Peace of Mind
In the end , your emergency fund is all about peace of mind .
You want to feel confident that you can take of things should some sort of financial hardship come up .
In order to have the peace of mind , you need to make sure that your emergency savings are in some kind of guaranteed account , and that you will be able to access it , with little to no penalty , when you need it .
Clock Opera did an amazing remix of Marina & the Diamonds ’ single I Am Not A Robot the other week , and honestly it was the first time I had heard their name .
In the back of my mind I knew it would n’t be the last though .
Clock Opera is a London based four piece with a very bright future ahead of them .
Guy Connelly ( the frontman ) , used to be a part of two different bands called bands called The Corrections and The Fall Out Trust , but now creates the self - coined “ chop pop ” â€ “ literally chopping up sounds to create songs out of the remains .
Clock Opera is a fantastic name , but where does it come from you ask ?
It was chosen as Guy Connelly is heavily into “ pocket symphonies with a mechanical , repetitious feel ” and singing over the top in a high - pitched voice .
Anyway , A Piece of String is Clock Opera ’s latest single and I think it ’s absolutely fantastic .
Connelly ’s haunting vocals float over piercing synths and expertly selected ( naturally chopped up of course ) guitar and mandolin samples .
A Piece of String is available to buy on June 7th through French imprint Maman .
Do it .

Avec une intervention dans le rachat du Monde , ses amis aux manettes de nombre de médias , voilà qu’Hees fout à la porte Guillon ( Le Monde ) : L’humour ne doit pas être confisqué par de petits tyrans .
Ce même
Hees a nommé l’ami de la femme du Président , un certain Philippe Val , que celui- ci agit en petit chef de bande et qu’il se voit très mal perçu par la rédaction comme le révèle une motion votée contre lui ( Le Monde ) :
France Inter connaît de sérieuses turbulences depuis l’arrivée de Philippe Val .
Reconnaissez - vous avoir commis des erreurs ?
C’est vrai qu’il y a eu parfois des maladresses .
Qui n’en commet pas ?
Mais , dans un an , Val n’agira pas de la même façon .
Il a atterri dans une grosse structure et mon erreur a été de le laisser y aller seul .
Depuis , quelques semaines , il travaille avec Laurence Bloch comme adjointe qui connaît parfaitement la maison .
Il ne s’agit pas d’un recadrage de Val , mais d’un renforcement .
Cela n’a pas empêché la rédaction de voter la semaine dernière une motion contre Philippe Val à propos de la grille de rentrée ...
Oui mais cette inquiétude ne correspond pas à la réalité .
Il n’y a pas de grands chambardements à France Inter .
La mécanique d’une grille est très compliquée .
Il faut bouger car il y a des émissions qui ne marchent pas bien .
Val , qui a un projet éditorial et culturel , essaie de trouver des solutions de remplacement pour les journalistes ou animateurs dont les émissions seront supprimées .
On ne laisse jamais les gens au bord de la route .
Je connais beaucoup de journalistes à l’extérieur qui aimeraient vivre le malaise de France Inter .
France Inter a été considéré par ce même Val , ami de la femme du Président , ce même val qui hait Internet qui le lui rend bien , ce Val qui n’aime pas ce que les autres font comme ce qu’il a fait lui à Charlie Hebdo , comme ayant pour propriétaire Nicolas Sarkozy .
Evidemment ce n’est ni factuellement vrai , ni moralement vrai .
France
Inter n’est pas ( enfin n’était pas ) une radio d’Etat comme à Cuba ou en Corée du Nord , mais une radio publique qui appartient à son public , qui appartient à ceux qui payent la redevance et non à ceux qui sont élus qui ne sont que dépositaires temporaires d’un pouvoir de gestion mais en aucun cas propriétaire de la France ni des Français .
Hees nommé par le « propriétaire » vient de faire ce pour quoi il a été nommé : mettre de l’ordre dans la radio publique et préparer la future campagne électorale comme l’ont voit que cette campagne est à plein régime avec des actions de communication tous azimuts : faux rapprochement avec Bayrou ( malgré tous les démentis de ce derniers la presse insiste ) , suppression potentielle de la garden party , possible modification de la loi sur les retraites , il reçoit même Thierry Henri - tout un symbole celui qui a triché et qui n’est ni entraineur , ni sélectionneur , ni dirigeant , ni président de la FFFB , ni capitaine , ni même buteur de l’Equipe de France - …
Voici donc son argumentation :
La saison de France Inter a été ponctuée par les polémiques autour des chroniques de Stéphane Guillon et dernièrement de Didier Porte .
Les auditeurs d’Inter les retrouveront - ils dans la nouvelle matinale de septembre ?
Non , car je ne m’appelle pas Raymond Domenech .
J’ai eu de nombreuses discussions avec Stéphane Guillon à propos de ses chroniques .
Si l’humour se résume à l’insulte , je ne peux le tolérer pour les autres mais également pour moi .
Quel patron d’une grande entreprise accepterait de se faire insulter par un de ses salariés sans le sanctionner .
J’ai un certain sens de l’honneur et je ne peux accepter que l’on me crache dessus en direct .
L’humour ne doit pas être confisqué par de petits tyrans .
Je prends cette décision non pas sur une quelconque pression politique mais en m’appuyant sur des valeurs minimales d’éducation et de service public .
Je considère que cette tranche d’humour est un échec .
Elle a montré une grande misère intellectuelle dont je ne m’accommode pas .
Il n’y aura pas de changement d’horaire ni de remplaçants .
Ce qui ne fait pas rire à 7 h 55 ne me fera pas plus rire à 3heures du matin .
Je sais qu’en prenant cette décision , il y a un risque .
Mais j’assume !
Cette déclaration est assez honteuse en soi .
D’abord il faut revenir sur un passage qui mériterait un détour par la justice pour diffamation .
Le monsieur
Hees devrait regarder un dictionnaire et apprendre quelques bases d’histoire .
Traiter un humoriste de tyran , fût - il petit , est plus que déplacé , c’est insultant , calomniateur et grave .
Un tyran possède un pouvoir acquis le plus souvent par la force pour , comme le dit le mot même , tyranniser .
Comment un humoriste salarié peut - il tyranniser qui que ce soit ?
Qui sont les victimes effectives de ce tyran ?
Combien de victimes a -t - il précipitées au cachot , fait disparaître dans une fosse commune , torturées ?
Combien de familles a -t - il décimées ?
Ensuite parler d’échec quand Stéphane Guillon réunit régulièrement deux millions d’auditeurs est une contre vérité qui n’honore pas son auteur .
Parler de misère intellectuelle est une insulte sans fondement .
On peut ne pas apprécier l’humour de Guillon , le trouver outré , déplacé , inadapté , sous la ceinture , mais parler de misère intellectuelle c’est se regarder dans un miroir .
Guillon est tout sauf un miséreux de la cervelle .
Ses sorties sont réfléchies , argumentées , en rapport avec l’actualité et avec un fond culturel indéniable .
Cet argument est le reflet parfait de l’adage : qui veut noyer son chien l’accuse de la rage .
Dans cet affaire il agit en nervi du pouvoir .
Par ailleurs il accepterait que Guillon insulte ( ce qui n’est pourtant pas la vérité absolue ) des victimes expiatoires , mais pas lui .
Or il est un fait permanent c’est que Guillon ne s’attaque qu’au travers des personnalités en vue et attaque là où cela fait mal .
Il défend donc a contrario la veuve et l’orphelin .
Hees défend le pouvoir et son arrogance , ses turpitudes et ses copinages malsains dont il en est un des principaux bénéficiaires .
Et Didier Porte qui sodomise Nicolas Sarkozy , pourquoi ne suit - il pas Guillon dans la charrette qui mène à l’échafaud ?
Un autre adage : deux poids , deux mesures .
Et cela rend totalement invalide l’argument d’Hees .
Terminons par cet affreux : j’assume !
Ce n’est en rien du courage car il est nommé par le propriétaire et n’a de compte à rendre qu’à lui et du moment qu’il lui obéit - ce qu’il vient de faire - il est sûr de garder son poste .
Ce n’est pas du courage mais de l’arrogance , celle du toutou qui imite son dresseur .
La purge serait - elle en marche ?
Dernière intervention de grande qualité de Stéphane Guillon à France Inter :

Kevin Rudd is the victim of a clinically planned and terrifyingly efficient political assassination .
The idea had long burned in the minds of some but the final operation was so tightly controlled that its denouement utterly shocked most members of the Labor Party .
Just before the first shot rang out at 7:00 pm on ABC News and ABC Online one of the party 's elder statesmen , Defence Minister John Faulkner , was in the middle of a pre-recorded interview for The 7:30 Report .
KERRY O'BRIEN : As we 've been sitting here recording this interview , I 'm told that ABC News is about to go to air , from Canberra , with a story that there are leadership rumblings , as they put it , in Canberra right now as we speak , that factional leaders are in discussion and counting numbers , as I understand it , with regard to a possible leadership challenge .
Are you aware of any potential moves on the leadership of Kevin Rudd tonight , not the moves tonight , but the moves ?
JOHN FAULKNER : Well , Kerry , I do n't know what 's on ABC News .
All I know is I 've been sitting here talking to you and so it might be on the ABC News , well it 's also news to me .
It was news to everyone .
In the minutes after 7:00 pm , in the offices and restaurants and cafes around the Parliamentary Triangle , the mobile phones of Labor MPs and senators lit up .
In the early stages ministers and MPs rolled out the usual denials , because they honestly believed it was another beat - up .
The Member for Reid , Laurie Ferguson , said , " I do n't know who they are , the ABC knows more than Caucus . "
The prime minister was at a function in Parliament House celebrating the 20th year in Parliament for Senator Nick Sherry .
Just after 7:00 pm many people who were there report that everyone 's mobile rang .
The prime minister left .
A few tiny flaws in the execution of the assassination plot exposed the final hours of the operation to the arc - lights of the media .
Because of the ABC stories , shortly after 7:00 pm the halls around the prime minister 's office were swarming with journalists and cameras and Julia Gillard 's every public movement was being recorded .
There is a novel in this but what follows is one small shard of the plot .
For weeks there had been speculation that the prime minister might be replaced with his deputy .
But as long as Julia Gillard remained loyal then without a challenger there could be no challenge .
So there was no genuine threat to Mr Rudd in any real sense until Wednesday .
That morning two right - wing powerbrokers , Mark Arbib from NSW and David Feeney from Victoria , went to see Ms Gillard .
They were sent away to count .
They returned at noon to say they could deliver a majority of the right in every state .
Ms Gillard was in the game and the challenge was on .
But they fretted that the entire plot could come unstuck if word leaked that it was on .
So they intended to make their final moves late to stay under the electronic media radar .
But there are few perfect operations .
There are always fingerprints .
Exactly 12 months ago the tip that Godwin Grech might be something more than just a hapless Treasury official came from a scrap dropped during a casual conversation at Aussies Cafe on the ground floor of Parliament House .
The scent of the Gillard challenge came during a chance afternoon encounter with a Labor powerbroker at the same table .
In the midst of an otherwise harmless chat he dropped his voice , scanned the tables for familiar faces and said with an unusual urgency : " Could we win with Julia ? " .
Pressed to explain , the conversation ended abruptly : " I gotta go thanks for the coffee . "
Something was up .
Calls to the likely suspects went unanswered until one picked up at 5.30 pm .
" What 's happening ? " I said .
" What do you know ? " he replied .
" I know something 's going on .
What do you know ? "
" Wait until after 8:00 pm and I 'll give you an exclusive . "
" But the news goes to air at seven . "
" Wait , " he said and hung up .
It was an infuriating conversation because it confirmed a serious push against the prime minister by serious players .
But there was every chance it could evaporate because everything depended on how Ms Gillard had responded to their advances .
Comparing notes , it emerged that the ABC 's chief political correspondent Mark Simkin was also on to the story .
By 6.50 pm we had enough to broadcast that there were moves afoot but that it was n't clear at all whether they were being supported by Ms Gillard .
We made it clear in the stories that we were uncertain of her position and deliberately erred on the side of caution .
But it was still an enormous risk .
If she had rebuffed the advances then the conspirators would melt back into the shadows and the next day everyone would , again , furiously deny there was anything going on .
And , unlike some other operations , there are serious consequences for being seriously wrong in the ABC .
We knew that the first sign that we were wide of the mark would come by way of an outraged phone call from the prime minister 's office to the ABC 's bureau chief , Greg Jennett .
That call never came .
Greg and the ABC 's tireless chief of staff Simon Johnson began furiously organising resources and dispatching them to the halls and restaurant districts .
In ABC Radio Louise Yaxley was powering through calls and stories and marshalling her team .
ABC TV's Hayden Cooper was trawling the corridors down near the prime minister 's office and Lateline 's Dana Robertson was tracking down backbenchers .
In Radio Current Affairs Sabra Lane and Samantha Hawley were working the phones and chief political correspondent Lyndal Curtis returned to work from her sick bed .
The new producer for ABC News 24 , Michelle Ainsworth , left her children with her husband and returned to work and ABC News Breakfast 's Melissa Clarke ( who gets to work at 4.30 am ) was on the phone asking if she should come in .
The rest really is history .
I write all this for two reasons .
First , it is a great yarn .
Second because the ABC does n't plaster " exclusive " on every lame rumour and , frankly , does a really poor job banging its own drum .
And I know that in the wash up of this , the story will have 1,000 fathers , as some of the self - basting outlets drown themselves in their own acclaim .
That 's fine too but I write because I 'm bored by reading bile covered tripe in the same outlets claiming the ABC does n't break stories .
The ABC radio news breaks stories almost every hour .
AM is the jewel in the crown of a radio current affairs operation that is unique in this country .
The ABC Online site is second to none .
ABC Local Radio gives a voice to every community on this continent .
And ABC TV News and Current Affairs is the most trusted brand in television broadcasting .
I 'm proud of my colleagues and the job they do in the large and small parts of the ABC .
And , in the end , the proof of the pudding is in the quality of the ingredients .
As one minister told Mark Simkin : " I did n't know about it .
But the fact that the ABC was running it meant it had credibility " .

Hi Samson ,
I 've contacted our Internet Marketing team and they said that this coupon code was n't setup correctly but has since been fixed .
It should be valid for any MSP430 tool .
Please give it another try .
If it still does n't work then try again in a day or two ( sometimes these web fixes need time to propagate ) .
Hope that helps .
Thanks and Regards ,

The Government is pumping an extra $ 5.9 million in to Customs to try and fight illicit drug smugglers .
The pre-Budget 2010 announcement came as Prime Minister John Key released the first of a new six - monthly series of reports on the progress of a methamphetamine action plan .
The report reveals little change in the push to control supply and cut off demand .
The availability of methamphetamine " may have become slightly easier " in the middle of 2009 compared to the year before , it says .
Police said prices had fluctuated over the past six months and there were distinctions between districts .
An availability score of one indicated it was " very easy " to get P and a score of four would be " very difficult " .
The score in 2008 was 1.7 and it was still 1.7 last year .
The mean price paid for a point of methamphetamine was slightly higher - up from $ 96 to $ 100 .
The mean price per gram was up from $ 698 to $ 738 .
There was no significant change in the purity of methamphetamine .
Mr Key , however , said he " would n't have thought " that it was any easier to get methamphetamine .
" In reality , by next year over - the - counter sales of pseudoephedrine will almost certainly be banned and new technology will mean the illegal importation of that material - particularly from China - will hopefully be reduced , " Mr Key said .
While there was room for improvement , the Government 's plan for action on P was " dealing to the gangs , the P cooks and dealers who spread their misery throughout New Zealand " .
Since legislation passed in December , police had identified $ 36 m worth of assets they believed had been obtained through criminal activity - $ 11 m of which had been successfully frozen .
The waiting times for residential treatment of P - addicts had " fallen dramatically " and more people were phoning in addiction help - lines .
The report showed clan lab busts in the first two months of this year were not as high as the number in the last quarter of last year .
In 2008 , there were 409 convictions for dealing methamphetamine and 505 for manufacturing it .
Last year , dealing convictions were up to 1396 and manufacturing convictions up to 518 .
Customs Minister Maurice Williamson said $ 5.9 m of capital funding had been made available to Customs in the coming Budget .
It would provide new , more advanced tools to detect the activities of drug criminals .
This is a list of incidents at recent World Cup tournaments that were ugly , unfortunate , unlucky or unwarranted .
Put simply , these are the stories of the World Cup that leave a bad taste in your mouth .
I have only considered the last three tournaments ( France ’ 98 , Japan & South Korea ’02 and Germany ’ 06 ) which were played under the modern - day format of 32 teams in 8 groups .
The reason for this is two - fold ; primarily , I wanted the average reader under 30 to be able to remember and relate to the incidents listed here .
Secondly , were it not for the excluded tournaments , the list would simply be too big .
The World Cup has a rich and colorful history that dates back to the 1930 ’s , and I felt that an attempt to condense this historical mass into one single list would detract from its depth and cultural significance .
10 WAGs Descend on Deutschland
We ’ll kick off this list with a sad , and pathetic , subculture that rears its ugly head whenever England play a major international tournament .
At World Cup 2006 , the WAGs – wives and girlfriends – of the England players had a grand old time .
The England manager , Sven Goran Eriksson , had allowed the WAGs to travel to the tournament and spend time with the players in between training and matches .
These WAGs are extremely wealthy as some of their partners were earning upwards of one hundred thousand pounds a week .
The WAGs turned England ’s World Cup experience into an absolute circus .
We were constantly bombarded by the tabloids with images of Victoria Beckham and co , dripping with jewelry and designer clothes , dragging their entourage of paparazzi all over quaint little German towns , like Baden Baden .
It was distracting for the players , distasteful for the fans and detracted from the football showpiece that is the World Cup .
9 Disastrous French Defense
This is probably only an unsavory event for the France fans out there .
For the rest of us , it certainly qualifies as unexpected .
Leading up to World Cup 2002 , the French team were on top of the world .
They were the current World Cup champions having won in France in ’ 98 , and the current European Champions , having won at Euro 2000 .
In David Trezeguet and Thierry Henry they had two of the top strikers in the world , who were scoring goals for their clubs like it was going out of fashion .
France had an eminently winnable group that included Uruguay , Denmark and World Cup debutants Senegal .
Heavily installed as pre-tournament favorites , the only blemish on the French preparation was an injury to Zinedine ‘ Zizou ’ Zidane , that saw him unable to play in their first two matches .
Senegal shocked France with a 1 - 0 win in the first match – one of the biggest upsets in World Cup history .
France were then held to a goalless draw by Uruguay in game two .
Zidane , the heartbeat of the French side , was rushed back from injury to play in the third match against Denmark , but was not fully fit and was ultimately unable to prevent a 0 - 2 loss .
France were eliminated in the group stages , losing all three matches and not even scoring a single goal – thus completing the worst defense of the World Cup in history .
A memorable incident was when Trezeguet , after a number of near - misses by the French team , hit the crossbar with a shot in the third match .
He put his hands on his hips , shook his head and stared at the heavens incredulously , rueing their incredibly bad luck .
Later , when questioned on France ’s terrible performance , Thierry Henry blamed is on the injury to Zidane , remarking “ it was because we did n’t have Zizou ” .
8 Jung - Hwan Hung Out to Dry
One of the most incredible fairy - tales of the World Cup is South Korea ’s unexpected charge to the semi-finals at World Cup 2002 .
Along the way , they claimed some high - profile scalps , the first of which was Italy in the knock - out round of 16 .
The match was highly controversial in terms of refereeing decisions – the Italians were probably entitled to feel somewhat hard - done - by .
Whatever , this is the nature of football .
South Korean , Ahn Jung - Hwan , scored the extra - time goal that sealed the fate of the Italians .
At the time , Jung - Hwan ’s club team was Italian side Perugia .
After scoring the golden goal to knock Italy out of the World Cup , Jung - Hwan was sacked by Perugia .
The owner , Luciano Gaucci said , “ That gentleman will never set foot in Perugia again .
He was a phenomenon only when he played against Italy .
I am a nationalist and I regard such behavior not only as an affront to Italian pride but also an offense to a country which two years ago opened its doors to him .
I have no intention of paying a salary to someone who has ruined Italian soccer . ”
7 David Beckham
At World Cup 98 England were pitted against arch - nemesis Argentina in the knock - out round of 16 .
Early in the second half , David Beckham was felled by Argentinian Diego Simeone in a certain yellow - card offense .
However , as Beckham was lying on the floor , he kicked out at Simeone in retaliation , triggering an instant ( and warranted ) dismissal .
England would have to play out the rest of the match with only ten men and , after a gallant effort , would eventually go out on penalties .
The unpleasantness of this incident was the treatment of Beckham in the weeks and months hence .
The English press needed a scapegoat and were baying for his blood .
A long period ensued where Beckham was mercilessly pilloried in the papers across the nation .
He spent the remainder of the close season in the United States for fears of his personal safety .
There were attacks on his home , vitriolic hate mail and even burning effigies .
Football can bring joy and happiness to all corners of the globe , but it is sad that it can also generate this level of hatred and revulsion .
6 Ronaldo – What a Winker
World Cup 2006 saw England play Portugal in the quarter finals – something of a grudge match , as Portugal had beaten England on penalties at the last European Championships in 2004 .
England talisman Wayne Rooney has something of a fiery temperament , and this was especially obvious in his more tender years .
Being a die - hard England fan , I was getting more and more nervous as the game progressed , and Rooney became visibly more frustrated by the minute .
He was starved of service from the English midfield , who just did n’t seem to be able to string passes together .
He was also getting close physical attention from the Portuguese defenders , and was leading the line by himself – deployed as the only striker in a 4 - 5 - 1 formation .
Rooney was starting to boil , and every England fan knew it was only a matter of time before he lost his cool , which he duly did in the 62nd minute by stamping on Portugese defender Ricardo Carvallho .
But it ’s not Rooney ’s foul that makes this list – which was stupid and borne of frustration , rather than dangerous and borne of malice – it is the actions of his Manchester United team - mate .
Cristiano Ronaldo , playing in the Portuguese midfield , sprinted some 40 yards to remonstrate vigorously with the referee following Rooney ’s foul .
Surrounded by three or four shouting Portuguese players , the referee duly red-carded Rooney and sent him off .
Directly after the incident , Ronaldo winked towards his bench , sending the UK media into an uproar .
The wink suggested “ mission accomplished ” – that the Portuguese had been planning on goading the notoriously hot - tempered Rooney , with close attention and underhand off - the - ball contact in a bid to get him sent off .
To do this to a close club team - mate made it particularly unpalatable on Ronaldo ’s part .
5 Card Counting with Graham Poll
At World Cup 2002 , the last Group F match between Australia and Croatia was refereed by Englishman Graham Poll .
He had a wealth of experience in the English Premier League , and took control of many of the high - profile matches .
As testament to his ability , Poll was selected as England ’s representative at two World Cup tournaments , and one European Championship .
Poll had successfully refereed two matches at World Cup 2002 , and the marks that he received from the assessors indicated that he was in with a very good shout to take charge of the final , a fact he laments in his autobiography .
It all went pear - shaped for Graham in the Australia - Croatia group match , when he inadvertently issued three yellow cards to the same player before sending him off .
When Poll issued a second yellow card to Croatian Josip Simunic , he inadvertently noted down the name of the Australian number three Craig Moore – failing to send Simunic off .
Simunic continued to play for some time , before committing another transgression and being issued a third yellow card ( which Poll thought was his second ) and finally being sent off .
This is probably the highest - profile , and most blatant , refereeing blunder in World Cup history , and it ’s a dreadful shame that it had to happen to such an experienced , and otherwise excellent , referee in his final showing at an international tournament .
4 Ronaldo ’s Mystery Affliction
At France ’98 Ronaldo was the world ’s most recognizable footballer .
Prior to the World Cup , he had signed a monumental sponsorship deal with sports giant Nike , and became the first globally mass - marketed footballer on the planet ( yes , even pre-dating the meteoric rise of brand Beckham ) .
Maybe its the cynic in me but I seemed to notice that at France ’ 98 , every time he went down after a foul , the close - up camera shot that followed ( being beamed all over the world ) always had his hands strategically clutching his leg directly beneath the Nike symbol on his shin -pads .
Whatever , the events before the final in Paris would go down in World Cup folklore .
On the morning of the day of the final , rumors began circulating in the press that Ronaldo was violently sick the night before and would be unable to play .
As the speculation worked up to fever pitch , almost every manner of illness was reported , and even wild conspiracy theories were dreamed up , involving french secret service agents dressed as bellhops slipping something into his food ( Brazil were to play France in the final ) .
Sure enough , when the Brazilian team released their team sheet less than two hours before the final , Ronaldo was excluded .
Predictably , this sent the media into a frenzy which only relented some thirty minutes before the final , when the team sheet was changed and Ronaldo was included .
Brazil would lose the final 3 - 0 , and Ronaldo was a shadow of the player that had scored four goals in the tournament , thus far .
He looked jaded , tired and his play was just …well , just not Ronaldo .
After all the furore died down , the accepted explanation is that he suffered a convulsive fit , resulting in his exclusion from the line - up .
Ronaldo says that his late inclusion was at his own request .
A prevalent alternative explanation ( or conspiracy theory , as the case may be ) is that his late inclusion was at the behest of Nike who – unable to bear the scenario of their most significant footballing investment not playing in the World Cup final – applied intense pressure to force his inclusion .
Given how much money is in football , this is certainly not beyond the realms of possibility .
3 Rivaldo ’s Theatrics
At World Cup 2002 in the group match between Brazil and Turkey , Rivaldo indulged in some Oscar - worthy play - acting .
In the closing stages of the match the ball went out of play and Brazil were awarded a corner .
Rivaldo stepped up to take it and motioned for the ball .
Instead of amicably rolling it over to him , Turkish defender Hakan Unsal spitefully booted it directly at him .
The ball clearly struck Rivaldo on the thigh but in a bid to mislead the referee , he sank to the ground clutching his face , moaning and writhing in pain .
Unsal was sent off with a second yellow card .
Without condoning Unsal ’s childish petulance , Rivaldo ’s behavior is exactly what we do n’t need defacing the beautiful game .
Diving , simulation , play - acting – whatever you want to call it – is just plain cheating , and is absolutely disgraceful .
Rivaldo was fined by FIFA for his antics , but I personally feel that incidents such as this should be much more harshly punished .
A three match suspension would make any player think twice about cheating .
2 Keane Abandons Ireland
Talismanic Ireland captain , Roy Keane , was a footballing ‘ hard man ’ – an aggressive , passionately - driven midfielder with an explosive temper .
He could have one hell of a row and would never back down .
Upon arrival at the Irish base camp for World Cup 2002 , Keane was extremely unimpressed with the facilities and team management .
Following a massive argument with manager Mick McCarthy , Keane withdrew from the squad and went home .
Ireland went on , without their captain , to do exceptionally well at the World Cup .
How much further could they have gone if Keane had stayed ?
Well , that was the speculation that was always going to hang over them , such is the respect afforded Keane as a footballer .
Keane ’s actions polarised opinions in his native country , and across the globe .
His supporters say that he was absolutely right to stand up for his principles , and point out a deep - seeded amateurism in the Irish Football Association .
His detractors say he unforgivably turned his back on his country .
Personally , I agree with Piers Morgan of ‘ The Daily Mail ’ who contends Keane is a “ humorless , nasty , violent , foul - mouthed , selfish , disloyal thug who resides on a Citizen Kane - style pedestal of egotistical , lonely , unjustified self - adoration . ”
1 Zidane ’s Moment of Madness
Zinedine Zidane was , arguably , the finest footballer of his generation , and will go down in history as one of the greatest to have ever played the game .
The French team were struggling to qualify for Germany ’06 when coach Raymond Domenech urged Zidane to come out of international retirement to help the team .
With their captain reinstated , France went to the World Cup and performed brilliantly .
To cap off his extraordinary career with another World Cup winners medal would have been a fairy - tale ending for Zidane .
However , he would end up tainting his reputation after a moment of sheer madness in the dying minutes of extra time in the final against Italy .
Zidane was sent off for a violent headbutt to the chest of Italian defender Marco Materazzi .
Though the incident occurred off the ball , it was squarely captured on camera and replayed all over the world for weeks and months to come .
There followed much speculation in the press as to what Materazzi must have said to prompt the assault .
After months of silence from both parties , Zidane ( and later , Materazzi ) came out and clarified the situation .
Frustrated at being marked so closely by Materazzi , Zidane made the sarcastic remark : “ If you want my shirt so badly , I ’ll give it to you after the match ” .
Materazzi replied “ I ’d prefer your sister ” and the rest is history .
+ Escobar
This incident did not occur at any of the three most recent World Cups – it occurred after World Cup 1994 in the USA .
However , I felt it had to be included because it is probably the most despicable and audacious act of cruelty that the game of football is unfortunate enough to be linked to .
Andres Escobar was playing for Colombia against the United States in their second group match , when he inadvertently deflected the ball into his own net , scoring an own goal .
The USA would win the match 2 - 1 , resulting in Colombia being eliminated from the tournament .
Less than a fortnight later , Escobar was shot outside a Medellin night club and died of his injuries .
The killer shouted “ Goal ! ” for each of the twelve shots fired .
On my first visit to Pyongyang in 1979 , handlers and interviewees repeatedly spoke of the North Koreans ’ constant need to be on guard against “ impure elements . ”
The unfamiliar term , puzzling at first , turned out to mean the country 's enemies .
The implication was that the North Koreans themselves were pure .
Indeed , as B.R. Myers argues in his provocative and important new book , a childish fantasy of purity is at the core of the ideology that the North Korean regime has used so effectively to control its people .
It is a doctrine that , according to Myers , owes relatively little to Marxism - Leninism , or to Confucianism .
It is , rather , “ an implacably xenophobic , race - based worldview derived largely from fascist Japanese myth . ”
Like Japan ’s Hirohito , the late North Korean President Kim Il Sung was popularly portrayed as the parent of an unsophisticated “ child race whose virtues he embodied . ”
Each of the two rulers “ was associated with white clothing , white horses , the snow - capped peak of the race ’s sacred mountain , and other symbols of racial purity . ”
Each was “ joined with his subjects as one entity , ‘ one mind united from top to bottom . ’ ” Each was “ the Sun of the Nation , … the Great Marshal … whom citizens must ‘ venerate ’ … and be ready to die for . ”
Coming from a base in Japan for that first Pyongyang visit in 1979 , I likewise found this comparison inescapable .
In Kim 's parading subjects ' shouts of " Mansei " — the Korean equivalent of the Japanese " Banzai ! " , wishing long life for the ruler — one could discern evidence that colonial rule had provided a powerful model for the cult of Kim 's personality .
So Myers ’s point is well taken — even if , in making that point more thoroughly and convincingly than anyone has previously done , he risks excessively downplaying the Stalinist , Maoist , and traditional East Asian contributions to the North Korean ideological fever .
The analogy to Imperial Japan is not merely academic .
It has crucial implications for our ongoing debate about whether to engage or contain North Korea — and for the perennial question of war and peace , which is once again salient thanks to a recent series of threats by North Korea to “ mercilessly destroy ” its foes , perhaps with nuclear weapons .
All bluff ?
Maybe .
But recall that the pure childlike Japanese , when they felt themselves cornered , threw rationality to the winds and attacked the far mightier Americans at Pearl Harbor .
Japan ’s rule over Korea from 1910 to 1945 was the Koreans ’ first experience with modern governance .
And the Japanese imperial worldview managed to attract the allegiance of many members of the Korean educated class .
Myers says that by the 1930s nearly all of them bought into the system — to the extent that many spoke Japanese , even at home when the authorities were not listening , and cheered in movie houses when newsreels showed Japanese military victories .
The following instructions for infantry facing attacking tanks were published by the U.S. War Department as a poster in Newsmap , Vol. II , No. 6 , May 1943 .
Although the bazooka was available in most infantry units for antitank defense , individual soldiers were still trained to deal with tank attacks without dedicated antitank weapons .
1 BUTTON HIM UP
Tank crews have limited vision even with the ports open .
Accurate rifle fire will force them to close up .
2 THEN BLIND HIM
Continued fire directed at the periscope and slits prevents the crew from shooting back at you accurately .
3 DUCK !
DON ’T RUN
Above the ground where you are visible you make an easy target .
Hide in your foxhole until the tank passes .
4 THEN
Let him have it with a well - placed Molotov cocktail splashing burning gasoline over his ventilator or any other vulnerable spot .

Sneaking out of bed to grab a midnight snack might translate into more missing teeth later in life , according to a new study .
The research marks the first to show that nocturnal eating can predict tooth loss among both men and women over time , even when controlling for factors such as age , education , smoking , diabetes , body mass , binge eating and carbohydrate consumption .
The study focused specifically on adults over the age of 30 .
" We hypothesize that consuming foods in the middle of the night , not brushing [ or ] flossing one 's teeth after nocturnal ingestions , and reduced salivary flow during the night increase the risk of tooth loss in this sample , " said researcher Jennifer Lundgren , a psychologist at the University of Missouri - Kansas City .
The researchers looked at 2,436 people who took part in a large Danish study and answered the question " Do you get up to eat at night " during a survey conducted from 1987 to 1988 .
The number of missing teeth came out during a second survey period of the same group from 1993 to 1994 .
Night eaters had almost four more missing teeth than non-night eaters when the second time period rolled around , Lundgren pointed out .
Waking up to eat at night more than twice a week represents one of the criteria of night - eating syndrome , a relatively rare disorder that affects just 1.5 percent of the U.S. population .
But a past study estimated that between 9 percent and 12 percent of U.S. adolescents and adults consume food after 11 p.m. , even if they do n't display the full - blown disorder .
People who eat at night and then do n't brush their teeth could be especially at risk because of less saliva flow at night to help clean the teeth , researchers noted .
Their study found a strong correlation rather than direct causation , because they did not measure salivary flow or oral hygiene in this particular study .
" It is unclear whether better oral hygiene alone can reduce risk of poor oral health , although it is probably a good start , " Lundgren told LiveScience .
" Persons who frequently engage in night eating ( and who may be diagnosed with night - eating syndrome ) can seek treatment . "
The study also found other even stronger risk factors for tooth loss , such as having just a high - school education as opposed to the highest level of education , smoking , diabetes and age .
Future studies might focus on night eating among younger people and include more detailed questions about nocturnal eating habits , researchers said .
They also cautioned that the results do n’t apply to people with full - blown night - eating syndrome or binge - eating disorder , because their study did not assess people for those syndromes .
The results are detailed in the latest issue of the journal Eating Behaviors .
TOKYO - " The Cove , " an Oscar - winning film about a dolphin - hunting village in Japan , will be shown in the country from next month , despite pressure from nationalist groups that caused several theaters to cancel screenings .
The domestic distributor , Unplugged , said Monday that six theaters around the country will start showing the movie July 3 , with 16 more to show it later .
Initial screenings of the film at three other theaters were canceled early this month after protests by nationalist groups , who say the film is anti-Japanese , distorts the truth , and has deep connections with a militant anti-whaling organization .
The issue erupted into a broad debate on freedom of speech after those theaters pulled out to avoid disruptive protests on their doorsteps .
National newspapers widely condemned the cancellations in editorials , and prominent film makers , journalists and lawyers publicly urged theaters not to back down .
" We 've increasingly been hearing from ordinary customers , who protest and say it is better that we work to show the film so that people can form opinions after they 've seen it , " said Takeshi Kato , president of Unplugged .
Japanese nationalist groups , known for blasting slogans from truck convoys and handheld loudspeakers , often use the threat of protests as leverage .
Several such protests were held in front of Unplugged 's offices in Tokyo , and twice outside Kato 's home , he said .
Similar protests two years ago against " Yasukuni , " a movie about a controversial war shrine , at first led to theater cancellations , but later made it one of Japan 's most successful documentaries .
" The Cove , " which won the Oscar for best documentary , stars Ric O'Barry , a former trainer for the " Flipper " TV show that is now a dolphin activist .
It documents how a group of filmmakers use hidden cameras to capture bloody footage of a dolphin slaughter in a small fishing village .
In Taiji , the town where the hunt occurs , the local government and fishing cooperative defend dolphin hunting as a local custom with a long history .
The mostly bottlenose dolphins killed in the hunt are not endangered , and hunts are also carried out in other parts of Japan - although very few Japanese have ever eaten dolphin meat .
Taiji fishermen have objected to being shown in the film without their permission .
Nationalists have said the film has connections to Sea Shepherd , an anti-whaling group that has been labeled a terrorist organization by Tokyo for its militant actions against Japanese whalers .
The movie includes a sympathetic interview with Sea Shepherd founder Paul Watson .
In the version of " The Cove " intended for release in Japan , the faces of most Japanese are blurred out , unlike the U.S. version .
Disclaimers have been added , including one that says that data presented in the movie were gathered by and are the responsibility of the film 's creators .
The movie cites information about mercury levels in dolphins and falsely labeled dolphin meat that has been challenged by government officials .
O'Barry , who is in Tokyo to promote the movie , denied the film is against Japan .
" My greatest hope has always been that the Japanese people will see the film and decide for themselves , " he said in a statement .
Call of Duty : Modern Warfare was a ground breaking game when it was released back in 2007 , and if you remember playing the game you might recall catching glimpses of several Helicopters during several instances .
Well , 3 years later , some dude who shares the same fetish for Helicopters as the developers at Infinity Ward , has not only counted every single instance on his blog ( Call of helicopters ) , but also detail every single Helicopter featured in the game .
Now we know that there a total 147 Helicopters in the game from UH - 60 Black Hawks to Mil Mi-24 “ Hinds . ”

Could this be the final blow to the theory that the moon is bone dry ?
Not only does the moon 's surface hold a " significant amount " of water — as two NASA crashes confirmed in October — but , a new study says , the moon 's interior may hold at least a hundred times more water than previously estimated .
" If we could take all the water which is locked up in the moon 's interior , it would make a one - meter - deep [ one - yard - deep ] ocean covering its entire surface , " said lead study author Francis McCubbin , a geologist with the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington D.C .
McCubbin's team reanalyzed old moon - rock samples gathered by Apollo missions and a lunar meteorite found in a desert in Africa .
( Related : " Apollo 11 Hoax Photos : Moon - Landing Myths — Busted . " )
The findings indicated that inside the moon " the amount of water is at least 64 parts per billion , which is two orders of magnitude more than previously thought , " McCubbin said .
" And maybe even more is there . "
Moon Water Found Hidden in Crystals
Using electron microscopes , McCubbin and his team looked at thin moon rock slices and collected tiny crystal grains of the mineral apatite .
Lunar apatite is thought to have formed billions of years ago , when the moon 's interior was filled with hot magma .
The team peered into the apatite crystals using a technique called secondary ion mass spectrometry — training a beam of ions on the rocks and then studying the ions that the beam dislodges from the material .
In the process , the researchers stumbled onto something big : the telltale chemical signature of water , in the form of hydroxyl ions .
" Until this study water had never been reported within minerals from the moon , " McCubbin said .
Apatite naturally soaks up water as water - bearing magma cools , locking it up in the form of hydroxyl ions — pairs of bonded hydrogen and oxygen atoms .
As such , apatite " really is a natural mineral to look for , because if there was any water in lunar rocks it would end up in that apatite , " he said .

Amount of Moon Water Stuns Scientists
The moon may not be soaking wet — it 's still considered drier than the driest desert on Earth .
( VIDEO : Crash Course on the Moon . )
But the quantity of water detected by the new study has stunned the scientific community , according to planetary geologist Linda Elkins - Tanton , who is n't connected to the study .
" It 's definitely surprising in that they are finding a lot more water in these minerals than would have been predicted , " said Elkins - Tanton , an assistant professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) .
" This now shows that primordial water was present when the moon itself formed , " she said .
Moon - Water Discovery a Total Game - Changer ?
While much has been made of the possibility of using moon water for hydrogen fuel for spacecraft or to sustain moon colonies , even the splashy new estimates are probably too low to make extraction economically viable , Elkins - Tanton said .
The real impact of the new moon - water discovery is in what it might say about the formation and evolution of both the moon and Earth , she said .
The leading theory on the moon 's origin says the satellite formed when a Mars - size object collided with Earth 4.5 billion years ago , sending a spray of material out into Earth orbit — material that eventually coalesced , forming the moon .
( Read " Was Moon Born From Planet 's Crash into Earth ? " )
All major , current moon - origin computer simulations suggest that the physics are such that the moon likely formed exclusively from the pulverized remains of the impactor — not from bits of Earth .
The big problem with this model , though , is that many isotopic elements found on the moon match elements found on Earth and no other body in the solar system measured so far — suggesting a kinship between Earth and the moon .
So if the moon is made from the impactor , then why would the impactor happen to have the same materials as Earth ?
" An extremely unlikely coincidence , " she said .
" This is why the discovery of water in the interior of the moon is really a critical piece of the puzzle to try and figure out how the Earth and the moon are really linked . "
By carefully measuring the water in these lunar minerals and matching up their isotopic ratios with those found on Earth , Elkins - Tanton believes it may lead us closer to solving the mystery of where both the Earth and the moon got their water .
" This , " she said , " could be a total game - changer . "
A while back , I read Alice Schroeder 's biography of Warren Buffett , The Snowball .
Afterward , I was pleased to run across a video clip of her discussing Buffett and the book .
There was one thing she said , though , that surprised me .
She noted that Buffett never advocated dollar - cost averaging , something she thought of as a good thing for investors to do , because you should never buy the market without taking price into account .
I 've long been of two minds when it comes to dollar - cost averaging into individual stocks .
I 've supposed that it was a sound strategy in general , if you 're regularly investing a set amount .
But if you 're just buying more shares of a stock as it falls , that can be dangerous -- like trying to catch a falling knife .
Many times , when stocks fall , it 's for a good reason .
But Schroeder was addressing the overall market , alluding to a strategy such as dollar - cost averaging into a broad - market index fund .
I remember Buffett endorsing index funds on various occasions .
In his 1996 letter to shareholders , for example , he said , " Most investors , both institutional and individual , will find that the best way to own common stocks is through an index fund that charges minimal fees . "
In 1993 , he said what we at the Fool have long been saying : " By periodically investing in an index fund ... the know - nothing investor can actually outperform most investment professionals . "
Schroeder is right -- it can be silly to add money to the market when its value is way overblown .
But many investors do n't know when that is .
If they just keep adding through good times and bad , they 'll accumulate shares at a wide range of prices , and over time , their value will grow .
They wo n't just be buying near the top , as many investors end up doing during bull markets .

At a recent protest in San Francisco , Zionists hurled insults at peace activists and also issued threats such as this :
You ’re all being identified , every last one of you …we will find out where you live .
We ’re going to make your lives difficult .. we will disrupt your families …
It would appear that there are Zionists in Austin , Texas , who share the same sentiment and have decided to enlist the services of the FBI in order to pursue their political agenda .
What other plausible explanation can there be as to why the FBI came to question the mother of five shown in this video ?
She is a part - time registered nurse and part - time peace activist whose only form of “ suspicious ” behavior is that she has participated in protests calling for justice in Palestine .

First , the bad news :
Throughout history a succession of serious philosophers have reminded us that life is a dead - end journey in which everything good is fleeting .
A trajectory of entropy ensures that the elation we experience in life is really an illusion , and that time will ultimately cure us of this fantasy .
It ’s pessimistic and sad but technically irrefutable .
We are all going to die — sooner than most of us would like to admit — and someday , without fail , everything we have created will perish without a trace .
Existential psychology reveals that many of us use the concept of freedom as a distraction from the dread of oblivion .
This preoccupation is so wrapped up with our sense of identity that parsing the two can be difficult .
The good news is that if we can simply come to grips with the bad news without blaming others for our existential anxiety , then facing this poignant certainty can add direction and greater meaning to our lives .
Think of it this way :
Near the center of human concern is a black hole of negativity , and the inevitability of nonexistence is at its core .
Only through awareness , existential honesty , and good will can we keep this insatiable force from draining away our humanity .
As we age , the black hole ’s gravity pulls us ever nearer , while the most fearful among us tend to react by trying to change the subject or lashing out at others .
Physicists tell us that the most omnipresent material in the universe is something we can’t even see : dark matter .
We do n’t even know what it does , although there ’s a possibility that it holds everything together .
In society , we also have something that functions as a universal backdrop .
Society ’s dark matter is an emotional background of angst and aspiration .
It ’s both ill will and good will .
We ca n’t see it , but we all know it ’s there ; it ’s everywhere .
Anxiety and aspiration are like matter and antimatter .
The anxiety emits cultural bias , a strain of attitude , that forms a milieu of invisible but projected contempt and prejudice which is felt as stigma by those targeted .
The aspiration is the force of creativity found in science and the arts and spurred on by kindness , civility , and appeals for justice and equality .
Societal dark matter ranges from the noble aspirations of the humanities to malignancies of genocidal hatred — it can bring us together or tear us apart .
Considering what research in psychology has revealed about human behavior , we should be willing to allow for the possibility that society ’s dark - matter angst is , to some extent , misspent anxiety — a rejoinder against life ’s brevity .
Better to align with the aspirational forces , in hopeful efforts not only to make the best of the time we have , but also to be grateful for having had the opportunity .
The certitude of impending death has a psychologically distressing effect on us , both consciously and subconsciously .
Unfortunately , the angst that naturally follows can lead to war .
Too many lives are cut short because we lack understanding about freedom ’s association with our sense of identity .
What is your definition of freedom ?
If a person is free to go anywhere , for any reason , at any time , but ca n’t earn enough money to rise above abject poverty , is that person really free ?
In underdeveloped countries , are people who live in trash heaps free ?
After all , as is often said in America , anyone has the right to sleep under a bridge , the rich included , although the rich seldom take advantage of the opportunity .
If people ca n’t quit their low - paying jobs for fear of losing their health insurance , are they free ?
What about individuals who are so inhibited by what others might think of them they never do anything they really want to do , but instead restrict their life choices to only those acts that they believe will gain them social approval ?
Are such people really free ?
How about the groups with which we identify — have you ever considered how they might influence our idea of freedom ?
There is a mountain of research to support the notion that our respective cultures serve as psychological safe havens , sheltering us from existential angst and anxiety .
As soon as we come to realize that our parents are not omnipotent and cannot save us from the inevitability of nonexistence , we begin to invest our psychological good will in our culture and especially the groups we associate with .
Geography shapes our views by shaping our language , evidence the differences in geographical dialect .
We seem to know intuitively that the groups we associate with will serve both as distractions and shelters from the distress that is sure to come from facing life ’s chaotic complexities .
The inevitability of oblivion ca n’t be changed , so the mistaken but seemingly most comforting thing to do about it is to change the subject .
Counterintuitive as it seems , however , confronting death has been shown to greatly enhance one ’s appreciation for life .
Nevertheless , even if we know this , we invest so much of ourselves in our culture that it becomes a big part of our identity .
We are temporary , whereas our culture can go on for centuries .
Consequently , we can become so wrapped up in our factional uniqueness that when our group identity is threatened , we take the threat personally .
For us to die as individuals is one thing , but it ’s quite another for our kind to cease to exist .
This existential sensibility is often expressed as threats to one ’s freedom , but more often than not , it ’s not about freedom at all — it ’s about otherness masquerading as an obstacle to freedom .
It ’s almost as if the very fact of another ’s existence keeps one from being free to be oneself .
Think , for example , of all of the instances of homophobic individuals we ’ve heard complaining about having homosexuality “ in their face , ” so to speak .
The experience is frightening to them because overt otherness is related to change ; psychologically , otherness turns out to be death ’s cousin .
Moreover , the presence of what seem to be extreme cultural differences presupposes the possibility that one ’s beliefs , customs , and most cherished ideals could be wrong .
For most of us , this possibility is consciously disturbing , but for some , it ’s subconsciously terrifying .
The prospect of reaching adulthood , especially the fall and winter of life , and discovering suddenly that one ’s foundational assumptions about the world are egregiously in error may be one of the most psychologically threatening things that can happen to a person .
For someone who harbors deep emotional fears about the certitude of nonexistence , such a discovery could mean having to admit that one ’s whole life amounts to little more than a mistake .
The common reaction is to dig in and stand one ’s ideological ground .
Our metaphor that blood is thicker than water is a truism , but many other kinds of associations can also trump our moral ideas about right and wrong .
It ’s not uncommon that we forgive our group members for most of their transgressions and hold those of our enemies against them for eternity .
Any group who perceives their identity is under attack experiences feelings of being marginalized ( and marginalization is metaphorically akin to death by degree ) , whether they are young , old , male , female , black , white , liberal , conservative , or any other defining distinction .
If one ’s sense of identity is diminished in any way , the effect is a subtle reminder of demise .
My point is profoundly important but seldom acknowledged publicly : at the heart of human anxiety about the essence of freedom is the reality that we can never be free of the thing we fear most — death .
Clinging to beliefs and to one ’s group identity may offer temporary solace , but ultimately it is not a satisfying refuge .
On the contrary , it exacerbates fear while it spawns contempt as a defensive reflex .
Further , the psychological conflict resulting from a diverse range of opinions and feelings about religious faith within our culture ratchets up group animosity to the level where it becomes commonplace for individuals to give voice to expressions of hatred in public ; rage masks real fears , and contempt serves as a bonding mechanism for intensifying group affiliation .
Today ’s Tea Partiers are a conspicuous assemblage incurring serious existential angst over their tenuous grip on their sense of identity .
A New York Times poll recently suggested that those who self - identify as Tea Partiers earn more than most people do on average and that they are better educated .
I can believe the former but not the latter .
Better educated by what standard and by whose measurement ?
Mind you , this was a poll , so I would n’t expect people unaware of their ignorance to do anything other than exaggerate their level of education .
Tea Partiers are anxious about their sense of identity and their economic security , and they have good reason for worry about the second point .
The purposeful middle class enabled by progressive tax policies both before and immediately after World War II has been eviscerated by special interests and by the Republican Party in particular .
Whereas a half - century ago almost any “ white ” adult male could get a full - time job and earn enough money to support a family , today even an advanced technical education guarantees neither employment nor a living wage .
Many white - and blue - collar communities have been ravaged by home foreclosures , unemployment , and factory shutdowns , while crime is rampant and fear - mongering politicians increasingly point to others as the cause of this misfortune .
Illegal immigrants catch the brunt of this dark - matter animosity , while the fearful among us ignore the prosperity we enjoy from their back - breaking efforts in America ’s farms , factories , and fields , performing jobs shunned by the general public .
Hispanic immigrants are only the latest to garner such attention .
Throughout American history there has never been a shortage of out - groups to absorb contempt - driven wrath for their overt otherness ; they pose an existential threat in the minds of the general populace .
In Arizona , for example , the crime rate has dropped appreciably in recent years , while the fearful unease of the middle class has escalated into a kind of paranoia , proportionately out of touch with the current reality .
In the meantime , the political power to be gained by politicians in fanning the flames of public sentiment is so great that there is little chance for achieving a reasonable solution to the problem of illegal immigration .
Lots of people are deeply worried because the president of the United States is of mixed race .
He ’s perceived by many as being a foreigner .
He ’s not of their group , and he speaks constantly of change .
Even the fact that he is an eloquent speaker is used as evidence that he is not a regular guy , but is instead an elitist and a liberal to boot .
People who ca n’t relate to him consider his presidency illegitimate , and hence the incessant complaints by those who have come to be known as birthers .
A significant number of people who call themselves Tea Partiers may earn above - average incomes and they may be technically literate in their career fields , but they are egregiously ignorant of the knowledge that serves as our aspirational guide toward civilization and helps us to mitigate our worst instincts .
Tea Partiers see their way of life as coming apart at the seams , and they are desperate to simplify their predicament by finding someone to blame .
They claim to want to put things right again and thus regain their freedom or “ take back our country , ” as they often describe it .
This freedom , however , is not so much to do as they please as to not be reminded of their existential fears by the overt presence of othernesss .
Tea Party pronouncements of what must be done to set the ship of state afloat show utter disregard for the conditions that find us run aground in deficit spending .
They tout remedies that bear no relation to a realistic approach for solving our current problems without throwing the country into a severe economic depression worse than the 1930s .
Listen closely as Sarah Palin stands before a crowd and asks , “ Do you love your freedom ? ” and it ’s easy to discern that it ’s not freedom but identity she ’s talking about .
Freedom , as Timothy Ferris explains in The Science of Liberty , is a product of liberalism .
He says , “ Liberalism is inherently nonpartisan :
It means freedom for all , or it means nothing at all .
It maintains that everyone benefits from everyone ’s freedom , and that all are diminished whenever one individual or group is not free . ”
But this is not how Palin characterizes freedom .
Practically everything she has to say about the subject is couched in dogmatic terms .
Her rhetoric is all us and them , and liberalism — or the freedom to do other than her group advocates — is precisely what she decries .
Railing against mandatory health insurance is not about the freedom to go without coverage ; it ’s about a surplus of social contempt aimed at people who are thought not to deserve health care because of their beliefs and moral shortcomings .
America is suffering an anemic economy , high unemployment , underemployment , skyrocketing debt , the threat of fanatical terrorists , and the effects of global warming , and yet , our undoing is more likely to come from ignorance or perhaps , more specifically , from a sad misunderstanding about the essence of personal identity and how our existential fears get tangled up with the notion of freedom .
In other words , we may self - destruct because of spite .
We are drowning in misinformation , and the shrillness of Palin ’s voice serves as a metaphor for an identity - based politics that is blind to reasoned negotiation in favor of an in - group ethos that says , “ If you are not one of us , then it does n’t matter what you do , or what you say , because we are right by nature of who we are . ”
One ca n’t reason with Palin supporters because they believe themselves to be locked into an emotional battle of good and evil , and those who do not belong to their group have no legitimate platform from which to present an argument .
If you belong to Palin ’s constituency you can say or do anything with impunity , as she so often demonstrates .
If you do n’t belong , however , then you can do nothing right , regardless of the circumstances or the nature of your argument or contribution .
There is no way to say this with decorum : Tea Party politics , to a significant degree , are driven by ignorance dressed up as patriotism and nonsense about preserving the Constitution .
At the same time , as I ’ve already said , it ’s not as if the Tea Party ’s arguments have no validity .
There are clearly a lot of things to be upset about .
But the current shrill rhetoric of public ire is being orchestrated by political ideologues and media pundits , who depend on public outrage for audience share — a situation that ’s antithetical to the sound judgment needed to sustain democracy .
Tea Party mania is not about freedom , it ’s about not being able to relate to the president personally .
Barack Obama ’s presidency is thought to be illegitimate , just as George W. Bush ’s presidency was by people who could not relate to him .
And all one has to do to affirm this assertion is let the majority of Tea Partiers explain themselves and prove for certain that they suffer from a MRSA - like form of ignorance .
There is nothing new in the problems they complain about .
The previous Bush administration brought us to the very edge of the economic abyss , and the Tea activists have been way late in paying attention and speaking up .
But not for their inattention to the matters they are now up in arms about , we would n’t be in such a mess .
By and large , the Tea Party movement to take the country back is not about freedom or the Constitution ; it ’s about identity and the existential angst that comes with the territory of human mortality .
Only a quarter of our population is college educated .
Of this quarter , many are well educated in the technical discipline of their chosen career field , but they are fundamentally uninformed of the many aspects of the humanities that function to keep us above the fray of political pettiness and moral collapse .
We do n’t rely on the humanities for our personal sense of morality ; that ’s something science reveals may be inborn and partly due to our upbringing .
But in a broader sense , the humanities keep our nation ’s “ eyes on the prize , ” so to speak , and help us resolve complex moral issues .
The humanities represent a guide to a just society as expressed aspirationally in the Declaration of Independence , our Constitution , and the Bill of Rights .
When contempt born of petty politics becomes the dominant consciousness of the day , we desperately need the wisdom of the ages , and we need to keep our eyes and our thoughts on those things that appeal to our better nature .
In other words , we need the guidance of the wisest among us , both living and dead .
In my forthcoming book , Existential Aspirations : Reflections of a Self - Taught Philosopher , I propose that what we need desperately as a culture is an existential education .
The humanities cannot be considered elective educational subjects unless we set out to be inhuman .
This is not , however , just an American problem .
In advocating a Socratic method of education in Not for Profit : Why Democracy Needs the Humanities , Martha Nussbaum writes , “ Democracies all over the world are undervaluing , and consequently neglecting , skills that we all badly need to keep democracies vital , respectful , and accountable . ”
Indeed , how do we do this if we ca n’t even be realistic about the source of our own existential anxieties ?
A noteworthy number of our citizens have always maintained an anti-intellectual life stance , disparaging the need to learn more about very things that make our lives possible .
My own father , when he was alive , would have stomped off cursing under his breath at the mere mention of the wordintellect or intellectual in any sentence , no matter how it was used .
I grew up under a veil of ignorance as part of a southern anti-intellectual culture , and I know firsthand how psychologically debilitating it can be .
But these days , in light of what recent research in psychology and neurology reveals about our political behavior , ranting about one ’s political opposition as being the incarnation of evil is like trying to pursue vacuum - tube computing in the age of digital formatting .
That so little is known by the public at large about issues so crucial to understanding human relations is disappointing beyond expression .
In an earlier essay about Tea Party political angst , I quoted Shankar Vedantam in his fascinating book , The Hidden Brain , where he argues that beneath human consciousness resides an “ unconscious bias ” whose job is to enable us to “ leap to conclusions . ”
This may well be the understatement of the decade .
How else can we explain the fact that so many of our citizens argue passionately about subjects they clearly know nothing about ?
Worse , how can a person attend four years of college and escape an education , as Palin clearly demonstrates ?
She is not inhibited by her lack of knowledge ; to the contrary , she is driven by it , proud of it even .
As the saying goes , “ the fewer the facts , the stronger the opinion . ”
But where does the arrogance come from that causes people to rant about subjects that they have knowledge of only through hearsay , Internet gossip , and Rush Limbaugh dittos ?
What causes systemically oppressed people to associate their economically downward trajectory with a lack of freedom instead of the sleight - of - hand , special - interest - lobby manipulation that is likely the cause ?
We do n’t need extensive formal education to tell us that things are not as they appear .
We experience this daily .
Most everything we take the time to look into turns out to surprise us .
And yet , there are hundreds , thousands , even millions of sign - carrying protestors who , when asked a few questions , will reveal that they clearly do not understand the complexity of the issue they are protesting about .
Worse still , they will repeatedly and without fail bite at the stick instead of the hand that holds it .
They will point fingers at people even more economically marginalized than themselves as being the problem for their plight instead of at the people with string - pulling power over the economy .
We do know that hatred feeds off its own misspent surplus of angst , which is itself fueled by ignorance .
But how is it possible to continue living this way when there is so much evidence demonstrating how destructive it is to invest hate - filled emotion into political conflict , call it democracy , and then argue incessantly about things without seriously studying them ?
Why do we scramble to run a democracy fueled mostly by contempt instead of our higher aspirations ?
For some levity , I picked up Idiot America by Charles P. Pierce and Deer Hunting with Jesus by Joe Bageant .
The books are both humorous and serious about the malignant nature of ignorance .
Pierce says the rise of idiot America amounts to a war on expertise and claims America is the best country in the world for crackpots and public cranks , in part because our country was founded on untested ideas .
No argument from me .
But I would point out , as many others have , that it takes a lot more effort and ingenuity to maintain a democracy than to start one , and we are coming up short on intellectual effort to do so .
Pierce says , “ Anything can be true if someone says it loudly enough , ” and that it ’s common for people to infer that fervent belief is proof of truth .
Sarah Palin is an archetype of this phenomenon .
Pierce argues that the terrorist acts of September 11 have acted as an accelerant for public lunacy , from the X — Files to the “ torture porn ” by Kiefer Sutherland ’s character on television ’s 24 series .
He reminds us that America “ was founded by people who considered self - government no less a science than botany . ”
And yet , these days we find placard - wielding Tea Partiers who ca n’t name the three branches of government , who do n’t know that Medicare is a government program , and who think President Obama is going to take away their guns and put a stop to sport fishing in America .
The hilarity of Joe Bageant ’s Deer Hunting with Jesus is offset by its deeper message about the utterly debilitating , destructive nature of ignorance .
Bageant ’s book is centered on his hometown of Winchester , Virginia , a place he characterizes as fast becoming the bedrock of a permanent underclass .
He tells us that our country is three - quarters working class but that most of us are conditioned not to think of ourselves as such .
With a flair for making the issue of class ring out , Bageant writes , “ If your high - school - dropout daddy busted his ass for small bucks and never read a book and your mama was a waitress , chances are you are not going to grow up to be president of the United States , regardless of what your teacher told you . ”
From here he gets into the mud and the blood and the beer and the sheer hopelessness of so many uneducated but well - meaning people locked into a merciless feedback loop of lashing out about the wrong things for the wrong reasons .
A self - described lefty agitator , Bageant was writing about the angst that fuels Tea Party sentiment long before there was a Tea Party .
He identifies the time - worn but dependable tools of the political right : propaganda , ignorance , fear , and emotion as a substitute for thought .
If you really want to understand our current knowledge deficit , I highly recommend Susan Jacoby ’s book , The Age of American Unreason .
Jacoby puts our predicament in historical perspective .
She characterizes the early nineteenth - century lyceum movement through the early 1960s as a culture of aspiration .
But today , Jacoby points out , we increasingly find ourselves in a culture ill with a “ mutant strain of intertwined ignorance , anti-rationalism and anti-intellectualism ” where un-mindfulness is promoted by politicians and media executives who depend upon non-thinking voters and vacuous sound bites .
In his essay “ Compensation , ” Ralph Waldo Emerson reminds us that , contrary to popular belief , we do experience justice in this world — and not the next — through the simple rules of cause and effect .
“ Every sweet hath its sour , ” he says , and elsewhere , “ All infractions of love and equity in our social relations are speedily punished .
They are punished by fear . ”
Finally , “ A man can not speak but he judges himself . ”
Carry around nonsensical signs that ring of hatred if you must , but first try hard to figure out what they really mean and what you are really afraid of .
If you do n’t , the injury will be to yourself .
In their book The Spirit Level : Why Greater Equality Makes Societies Stronger , Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett offer thirty years of well - documented research removing all doubt that growing inequality leads to contempt on steroids .
In other words , inequality results in an exponential increase in the range of angst in our cultural dark matter .
They write , “ The problems in rich countries are not caused by the society not being rich enough ( or even by being too rich ) but by the scale of material differences between people within each society being too big .
What matters is where we stand in relation to others in our own society . ”
To which I will add that a failure to understand how our unconscious fears lead us to disdain otherness is an existential booby trap and an emotional cul - de-sac that often results in social catastrophe .
Socrates declared that “ the unexamined life is not worth living . ”
I have always thought he overstated the case .
But if he had made an equal argument about the need for exploring the fears born of our mortality , then there would be no objection from me .
Had he done so , he might have saved countless numbers of people from an early death by enabling them to come to terms with their own existential angst , instead of attempting to take it out on others .
Of course , Socrates was disadvantaged .
He knew the human race is heavily populated with fools , but he did n’t know that our bicameral minds , with their split - brain architecture , enable us to park our fears in one hemisphere with only a vague awareness of it in the other .
This arrangement sets us up with a pattern - matching capability to make inferences that will allow us to mask our real concerns by focusing on small problems as substitutes for big ones , and the process haunts us with smoldering anxiety .
In the final analysis , the notion of freedom will always be tainted by the reality that there are some fears that we can never fully free ourselves of , and that we need desperately to learn to live without avoiding our fears through the seductiveness of distraction , diversion , and targeted blame .
Emerson said , “ All things are moral . ”
He also reminds us that no view of life is valid if it omits life ’s harshness .
Indeed , in spite of centuries of avoiding the subject of mortality , embracing it head - on is a shortcut to experiencing freedom as an aspiration of authenticity and an acknowledgment that genuine freedom is experienced in a life free of the angst of ignorance and the bias and pettiness of contempt .
By all means let ’s get on with a Tea Party political discussion , but first put down your nonsensical signs and do your homework .
Having spent my formative years in the grip of a regional ideological illusion , I can relate to George Bernard Shaw ’s illuminating line from Caesar and Cleopatra , “ Pardon him , Theodotus : he is a barbarian , and thinks that the customs of his tribe and island are the laws of nature . ”
It takes a sustained intellectual effort to get beyond the self - justifying parochial worldviews we internalize growing up .
But until we do , we can make no claims on having understood the concept of freedom or the psychological fears that , without our awareness , can serve as little more than a refuge of ignorance and as bastions of contempt .
The subject of freedom deserves serious study in its own right , but for starters it should not be confused with the notion of identity and as an escape from the existential reality that is part and parcel of being mortal .
So , I suspect that if Shaw were here nowadays to hear Sarah Palin ask an audience if they love their freedom , he would say , “ Pardon her , Theodotus , for she is from Wasilla . ”
But then , what can I say ?
So am I .

So after all the sturm und drang and building the November campaign around obstructionism and health reform repeal , what part of the bill does the American public want to repeal ?
None of it .
For context , from The Hill :
In the months since that bill became law , top Republicans like House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) have called repealing healthcare reform the GOP 's " number one priority , " though Republicans have battled internally over whether they should repeal it in full or in parts .
The Hill reports that a poll from 60 Minutes / Vanity fair shows that effort has failed .
A plurality of Americans said they would prefer Republicans to leave the new healthcare law alone and repeal no parts of it , a new poll found Tuesday .
Given the option to name the sections of the healthcare law they would most like to see the GOP repeal , 42 percent said they would leave the bill alone and repeal no parts , a new 60 Minutes / Vanity Fair poll found .
But if there is one section voters would like to see stricken from the healthcare law , it seems to be the individual mandate -- the requirement that all Americans buy health insurance , or face stiff penalties .
30 percent of Americans said they would like to see Republicans get rid of the individual mandate , by far the provision in the healthcare law that voters would most like to see removed , if they favor any kind of repeal at all .
Here are the numbers :
Do n't look for the GOP to run against the mandate ; that 's the only part their insurance industry patrons likes .

The gunman drove through Whitehaven with a gun hanging out of his car window , witnesses say .
He then headed south through Gosforth and Seascale before turning inland , leaving a trail of bloodshed .
Here a damaged car stands under tarpaulin in Seascale .
Police declared 30 separate crime scenes in England 's picturesque Lake District .
Police identified the gunman as Derrick Bird , 52 , who lived in the Cumbrian town of Rowrah .
Image caption Snoop Dogg is due at UK festivals including Glastonbury this summer
Snoop Dogg has been banned from a free festival in the Netherlands after police said they wanted to guarantee its " open and friendly character " .
Authorities asked organisers to find a replacement act for Parkpop in The Hague because they thought the US rapper was inappropriate .
Organisers say they have been left with little time ahead of the 27 June gig .
In 2007 , the rapper was denied a UK visa after a fracas at Heathrow Airport involving members of his entourage .
The 38 - year - old is scheduled to appear at UK festivals including Wireless and Glastonbury this summer .
Last year , he was cleared of hitting a fan who jumped on stage during a 2005 concert in Seattle , but his record company was ordered to pay damages .
( CNN ) --
It 's a familiar scenario :
When clues are scarce , witnesses wo n't talk and police are stymied , they turn to DNA .
The genetic building blocks can identify a victim , implicate a suspect or clear the wrongly accused .
Now the science is expanding beyond human beings .
Researchers have developed a database of canine DNA , and law enforcement officials are hoping it can help prosecute people who run dogfighting rings .
Dogfighting is an underground " blood sport " that is difficult to track , and it's often impossible to prove a case against suspects accused of promoting and participating in dogfights , said Dr. Melinda Merck , senior director of veterinary forensic sciences with the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals .
But because the dogs are highly inbred for their fighting qualities , their bloodlines may provide the evidence investigators need .
The Canine CODIS ( Combined DNA Index System ) is similar to the human DNA index system used by the FBI .
And , it 's ready to be used to investigate and prosecute dogfighting operations , Merck said .
While investigating one of the largest dogfighting rings last year in U.S. history , Merck teamed up with officials at the ASPCA , The Humane Society of Missouri and researchers at the Veterinary Lab at University of California , Davis , to create the Canine CODIS system .
The 18 - month investigation involved federal , state and local law enforcement agencies and led to the arrest of at least 19 people in July 2009 in five states .
Some 400 dogs were confiscated , and investigators say they were bred for dogfighting .
After the DNA samples were collected , Merck and her colleagues turned for help to the Veterinary Lab at the University of California , Davis .
They asked the lab to set up an operation similar to the FBI 's CODIS to analyze the data , which they hope will link dogs to those collected in other cases .
" We wanted to link different defendants together , some across state lines , " Merck said , explaining that the dogs ' bloodlines can now be traced across generations .
" If we find one location where there was a first - generation breeding , we could connect them to different dogs from a different crime scene . "
The ASPCA says the database will help investigators establish connections between dog breeders , trainers and operators by using canine blood collected during suspected dogfighting raids .
Once the program was up and running , Merck was able to link DNA from 100 dogs .
Today , the lab has DNA specimens from more than 400 dogs , she said .
The 2007 dogfighting prosecution of NFL star quarterback Michael Vick focused national attention on dogfighting .
Vick pleaded guilty in 2007 to a federal charge that he bankrolled a dogfighting ring from his Virginia home .
Merck , who took a lead role in the Vick investigation , says the Vick case expanded public awareness of a federal crime that generates millions of dollars , she says .
Vick , who played for the Atlanta Falcons for six seasons , pleaded guilty in the federal and state dogfighting cases and served 21 months in prison .
He was suspended from football and declared bankruptcy .
He returned to the field in 2009 and now plays for the Philadelphia Eagles .
Vick spoke last week to students in Snow Hill , Maryland , urging them to make the " right decision " in life .
Responding to a question from a student , Vick said that while growing up , he never saw dogfighting as wrong , said the school 's principal , Tom Davis , who attended Vick 's talk with the students .
Although there are no official statistics , the ASPCA estimates that tens of thousands of people are involved in dogfighting , which is a felony in all states .
Merck hopes the canine DNA database will grow as law enforcement officials from the U.S. and abroad contribute samples .
" If you got the dogs , you got the DNA , " Merck said .
" I think it 's going to be interesting to see how this database enhances criminal cases .
It should make dog- fighters very nervous . "
When a Muslim uses the name of Muhammad , they tag on the expression Alayhis salaam ( “ peace be upon him ” ) .
In written English , “ Peace be upon him ” is abbreviated “ PBUH ” .
“ PBUH ” is thus a mandatory tagged - on honorific salutation called a “ salwat “ .
PBUH is also used for the other great prophets recognized by Islam ( Jesus , Moses , Jacob , Noah , Adam , Solomon , David , Jonah , etc… ) .
There has been lots of recent blogging discussions about whether Jesus was real or a myth .
Atheists are divided on this issue .
But even the non-mythicist atheists are tip - toeing when they speak of Jesus in order to let their fellow mythicists
Atheists know that they realize that Jesus may have been totally or even largely a fictitious invention .
But such caveats are often verbose and break the flow of the posts .
So to make it easy for atheists to acknowledge possible validity of mythicist ’s arguments while keeping their writing fluid , I suggest we create a salawat to acknowledge that Jesus was possibly not real .
Please give us suggestions for a salawat in the comments .
For example , let me start with one :
Jesus ( ihweritfp ) = “ if he was ever real in the first place ” .
Nah , you see , that is too long .
I will add your good suggestions to this list .
Thanks .

I like to call it the circle of life , as it is now understood in America .
As a relative newcomer to the crazy that is the far right wing , I do not now , nor am I likely to ever understand the obsession they have with George Soros .
The right wing non-profit money machine outspends progressive non-profits by amounts in the billions .
What Soros spends in a year on American politics is a big zero .
Yet FreedomWorks grinds more tea in our face every day with full - throated ( and walleted ) support from the right .
There was a time in this country where people as paranoid and self - focused as Glenn Beck were placed in a room with padding and round corners until the meds took hold .
Now they go on national television .
Rupert Murdoch 's epitaph should read " He mainstreamed crazy . "

My friend , Mark Mykleby , who works in the Pentagon , shared with me this personal letter to the editor he got published last week in his hometown paper , The Beaufort Gazette in South Carolina .
It is the best reaction I ’ve seen to the BP oil spill  and also the best advice to President Obama on exactly whom to kick you know where .
“ I ’d like to join in on the blame game that has come to define our national approach to the ongoing environmental disaster in the Gulf of Mexico .
This is n’t BP ’s or Transocean ’s fault .
It ’s not the government ’s fault .
It ’s my fault .
I ’m the one to blame and I ’m sorry .
It ’s my fault because I have n’t digested the world ’s in - your - face hints that maybe I ought to think about the future and change the unsustainable way I live my life .
If the geopolitical , economic , and technological shifts of the 1990s did n’t do it ; if the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 did n’t do it ; if the current economic crisis did n’t do it ; perhaps this oil spill will be the catalyst for me , as a citizen , to wean myself off of my petroleum - based lifestyle .
‘ Citizen ’ is the key word .
It ’s what we do as individuals that count .
For those on the left , government regulation will not solve this problem .
Government ’s role should be to create an environment of opportunity that taps into the innovation and entrepreneurialism that define us as Americans .
For those on the right , if you want less government and taxes , then decide what you ’ll give up and what you ’ll contribute .
Here ’s the bottom line :
If we want to end our oil addiction , we , as citizens , need to pony up : bike to work , plant a garden , do something .
So again , the oil spill is my fault .
I ’m sorry .
I have n’t done my part .
Now I have to convince my wife to give up her S.U.V. Mark Mykleby . ”
I think Mykleby ’s letter gets at something very important :
We cannot fix what ails America unless we look honestly at our own roles in creating our own problems .
We  both parties  created an awful set of incentives that encouraged our best students to go to Wall Street to create crazy financial instruments instead of to Silicon Valley to create new products that improve people ’s lives .
We  both parties  created massive tax incentives and cheap money to make home mortgages available to people who really did n’t have the means to sustain them .
And we  both parties  sent BP out in the gulf to get us as much oil as possible at the cheapest price .
( Of course , we expected them to take care , but when you ’re drilling for oil beneath 5,000 feet of water , stuff happens . )

As Pogo would say , we have met the enemy and he is us .
But that means we ’re also the solution  if we ’re serious .
Look , we managed to survive 9/11 without letting it destroy our open society or rule of law .
We managed to survive the Wall Street crash without letting it destroy our economy .
Hopefully , we will survive the BP oil spill without it destroying our coastal ecosystems .
But we dare not press our luck .
On your new album , “ Recovery , ” which comes out on Monday , you assume a confessional tone and back off from the misogyny and demented violence you pushed in your earlier work .
Would you agree ?
I think I ’d have to go back and listen to it .
Did I ?
Does Slim Shady , your raping and killing alter ego , still exist ?
Or have you split with him ?
Shady still exists .
But I do n’t think the subjects on this record call for , you know , bring the chainsaws and axes out and murder everyone on this record .
There was so much stuff like that off the last record that I felt like I was starting to run it into the ground .
I think consciously I went in a different direction with this record .
Do you regret having written so many songs that refer to women as “ bitches ” and “ hos ” who exist solely for your pleasure ?
Anything I ’ve ever said , I certainly was feeling at the time .
But I think I ’ve calmed down a bit .
My overall look on things is a lot more mature than it used to be .
Even your mother sued you for defamation .
Is she still in Detroit , where she raised you as a single mom ?
I ’m not sure , to be honest .
It ’d be very hard to repair that relationship .
> In his opening statement at today 's BP hearing in the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations , Alabama Republican Parker Griffith downplayed the oil spill :
The greatest environmental disaster in America has been cigarettes ...
If we 're gonna talk about the environment , let 's be sure we do n't leave that out ...
The environment is an important concept , and we regret the loss of life , but there 's much we can do .
We 'll put this in perspective .
This is not going to be the worst thing that ever happened to America .
Griffith 's district does not contain any coastline ( it 's actually furthest from the Gulf of any Alabama district ) .
Contrast his comments with those of coastal Alabama Republican Jo Bonner , whose First Congressional District encompasses Mobile and about half of the state 's Gulf shoreline .
Bonner issued a grave statement nine days after the rig exploded , and his website has morphed into a resource center for those affected by the spill .
Locating a mention of the spill on Griffith 's site , however , takes serious digging .
Griffith switched parties at the end of last year , nine months after entering Congress as a freshman Democrat , becoming him the first Republican to represent his district in over a century .
He cited the Democratic health care bill , which he strongly opposed , as one of his motivations .
After switching parties , he gave up his committee assignments and lost much of his staff , only to get snubbed by his local GOP executive committee , which endorsed both of his opponents during the Republican primary .
He lost the primary two weeks ago and has not filed to run as an independent , meaning that Griffith has a mere seven months left in Congress .
Many of us slung the dice in high school , enjoying long games of Dungeons and Dragons in the garages or basements of our friends .
The game was social , and it allowed us to argue about arcane rules as we pretended to slaughter the bad guys , all while giving us a reason to get together and imbibe various substances .
As we get older , there is less time to game , and the old groups drift apart .
Luckily for us , Wizards of the Coast has devised a way to get us back into the sublime activity of tabletop role - playing .
The company is helping comic book or gaming store owners and their friends host an ongoing adventure aimed at new players and those looking to get back into the habit .
Every week a new one - to two - hour encounter is hosted at the comic or gaming store , making up a 12 week adventure .
The name of the program is Dungeons and Dragons Encounters .
Here 's how it works .
Store employees who want to participate contact Wizards of the Coast , and the company provides everything .
" You receive a kit of materials , and it has character sheets , it has the adventure content , and it has the basic ruleset ... it has all the components you need to run the game , " Wizards of the Coast said .
" It 's a one - encounter , hour - and - a - half setup where you can play if you do n't have any of the books , or you do n't have anyone to play with ... it 's really exploratory . "
That 's the key : players do n't need to know the game , they do n't need to own books , and they do n't need to bring a group .
The encounters are set up to be an easy way to join a game , even if you have never gamed before .
Dungeons and Dragons can be an intimidating thing if you 've never played , and this way anyone who is curious can join a game and see what all the fuss is about .
Around 1,000 stores are carrying the encounters right now , with more signing up as the program runs its course .
" We have all of these retail partners that have people coming into their store and want a way to build community , and to get customers to connect with each other , " we were told .
" We also heard from people who used to play and want to get back into it . "
For those who may be in an area where they do n't have a gaming group , it 's also a way to meet other people who like to game without having to leave their comfort zone since the games are hosted at the store .
" It 's kind of a neutral turf , you 're not going to someone 's house that you do n't really know . "
There are no downsides
This makes getting into Dungeons and Dragons much easier and less intimidating even if you 're a first - time gamer .
Retail stores get an excuse to run a newbie - friendly game and try to convert interested parties into paying customers .
If someone finishes a season of these quick encounters and wants to pick up the source book and some dice to help their friends learn how to play ... they 're already in the right place .
The first season has already ended , and the next one is coming up .
" Each season is around 12 weeks long , and it's a series of encounters that take you through an entire adventure . "
Season two will be an adventure set in Dark Sun , making the encounters something of a preview of the new Dark Sun content .
Each season is a standalone story , so you can jump right into the next season if you did n't play in the original .
I 'm an adult who still gets together with his friends once a month or so to play D&D , because it 's a fun game that gives you a good excuse to be social .
Our wives make desserts for us to eat , we order a pizza and mix some drinks , and we go adventuring ; it 's a wonderful way to play a game that does n't require an Internet connection .
If I was n't fortunate enough to be around those who still liked to game , I would love to head to a comic store to try to find something like this in order to tap into the local community .
More and more gamers are getting their role - playing fix online ; the easier it is for gamers to leave their house and find a good tabletop game , the higher the chance that real , in - person role - playing will survive .
If you 'd like to join a game , call your local comic or gaming store to see if they 'll be hosting the encounters .
If not , convince them to sign up .
NEW ORLEANS / LAFITTE , Louisiana ( Reuters ) - Oil services companies went to court on Monday seeking to overturn President Barack Obama ’s six - month ban on deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico after the worst oil spill in U.S. history .
U.S. District Court Judge Martin Feldman said he would decide by Wednesday whether to temporarily lift the ban while the case is heard .
More than a dozen companies involved in offshore drilling operations filed the lawsuit , calling the ban “ arbitrary and capricious . ”
“ The government ’s unchecked authority has shut down this entire industry , ” argued lawyer Carl Rosenblum , representing the oil industry .
The lawsuit is the first seeking to reverse Obama ’s May 28 moratorium , which the companies say will force job cuts in the labor force needed to service offshore oil platforms .
The ban has caused the shutdown of 33 deepwater drilling rigs .
Obama imposed the ban after an explosion aboard an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20 killed 11 workers and ruptured a well owned by BP Plc , unleashing millions of gallons of crude into the ocean .
The Obama administration argues that the moratorium is necessary to prevent further accidents while a presidential commission investigates the cause of the BP spill .
Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal , a Republican critic of the Obama administration ’s handling of the spill , has sided with the companies in the case .
The lawsuit is another example of the administration ’s strained relations with big business , which was on display last week when BP bowed to pressure from Obama and agreed to set up a $ 20 billion oil spill damages fund .
The spill , now in its 63rd day , has soiled the coastline of four U.S. states , threatening tourism and fishing industries ; seeped into ecologically sensitive wetlands and marshes ; battered BP ’s image ; and tested Obama , who has come under fire over his handling of the crisis .
If spill spreads , BP could face challenges beyond the Gulf Coast .
Attorneys general from 11 states on the U.S. East Coast warned they would hold the company responsible for injury to wildlife that could affect their coastline .
SAFETY PROBE
An independent federal agency that investigates chemical accidents -- the U.S. Chemical Safety Board -- is launching a probe into the root causes of the spill .
The case will be handled by the investigators who examined BP ’s safety practices after a deadly 2005 refinery explosion in Texas .
BP said it has spent $ 2 billion so far on clean - up .
Slideshow ( 30 images )
Fueling investor concern about BP ’s final bill for the spill , a Democratic U.S. lawmaker on Sunday released an internal company document that said , in a worst - case scenario , up to 100,000 barrels ( 4.2 million gallons / 15.9 million liters ) of oil a day could gush from its ruptured deep - sea well .
The British energy company dismissed it , saying the figure was being taken out of context .
But investors , apparently worried it could mean higher fines and clean - up costs for BP , drove its shares down 4.5 percent in New York trading .
BP plans to raise cash from banks to ensure it has enough money on hand to pay for the clean - up but does not plan a bond offering , sources familiar with the company ’s thinking told Reuters on Monday .
Banking sources said last week that BP was seeking some $ 7 billion from banks .

BP has considered several ways to raise more money , such as selling assets .
But for now , it is confident its cash resources can cover the bulk of the clean - up costs , one source said .
Seeking to keep the focus on the ecological disaster , New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu hosted mayors from 17 U.S. cities on a visit to the Mississippi Delta , where oil has coated fragile marshlands , tarred wildlife and decimated fisheries .
During the mayors ’ visit to marshes in Louisiana ’s Barataria Bay , the stench of coagulating oil hung in the air as miles of boom encircled oil - stained marshes and scores of boats skimmed oil from the bay ’s waters .
BP continued to siphon more oil from the blown - out deep - sea well .
It said it collected or burned off 23,290 barrels ( 978,180 gallons / 3.7 million liters ) of crude on Sunday , still well below the 35,000 - 60,000 barrels a day that government scientists estimate are gushing from the well .
Both BP and the U.S. government are placing their hopes on two relief wells that are being drilled to permanently cap the leak .
Those wells are expected to be finished in August .
BP Managing Director Bob Dudley is in day - to - day charge of the company ’s response to the spill after Chief Executive Tony Hayward returned to Britain last week , the company said .
The Mass Effect Trilogy
One of the great things about planning to make a trilogy in advance is that you can design a coherent three - game story arc ahead of time .
You do n’t have to weld a series of self - contained stories together , but instead can weave the tales together elegantly .
You can set up foreshadowing and plant characters that will pay off in later installments , and you do n’t have to hide the seams between the games with a bunch of messy retcons and plot hacks .
The usual franchise works like this :
At the end of the first game the hero becomes super - powerful , defeats the bad guy , gets the girl , and retires .
Then the sequel has to take away his powers , eliminate the girl , and resurrect the bad guy so the hero can come out of retirement .
A writer that is able to plan ahead will be able to wrap up story 1 without walling off story 2 like this .
When you plan ahead for a trilogy , then everything can be made to fit , and the three games together can end up greater than the sum of their parts .
So many games are written as if each game will be the last , and knowing you have three games to tell your story is a rare and unique opportunity .
BioWare took this opportunity , and pissed it away with Mass Effect 2 .
The core story is a really small part of the game , which is good because it ’s also the worst part of the game .
Everything else is polished , engaging , and witty , while the central story features some of BioWare ’s sloppiest plot - work in years .
The main plot of Mass Effect 2 not only fails to stand up to scrutiny , but it retroactively goes back and messes up parts of Mass Effect 1 which worked perfectly fine .
It ’s cheap , obvious , and tacked - on .
It fails to exploit any of the great ideas set up in the original , and instead does a messy reboot and burns all of the bridges built by the first game .
The only thing it keeps is the idea that “ Reapers are coming from beyond known space to kill us all ” .
But it even screws that up , because it takes the very small number of things we know about Reapers and changes them for no good reason .
But what ’s interesting is that this mess is carefully ( perhaps even deliberately ) quarantined , and the rest of the game is much more satisfying .
Furthermore , the plot holes , while numerous , are all spiderweb cracks radiating out from two problem areas :
1 ) The first ten minutes of the game .
2 ) The last ten minutes of the game .
I ’m going to go over the plot in detail , but I want to stress that I do n’t think that BioWare has suddenly let a crayon - wielding imbecile write their games .
This is something else .
I ’ll talk more about this later .
From here on are heavy spoilers .
Proceed at your own risk .
Opening
The game starts with the Collectors destroying the Normandy and killing off commander Shepard .
You could argue that this was how they introduced the New Threat , but they already had a dire threat which was already firmly established as an insurmountable foe .
One lone Reaper was nearly a match for the entire Citadel fleet , and it was hinted that there are limitless numbers of them lurking somewhere out there .
The game then has the terrorist organization Cerberus bring Commander Shepard back from the dead because they recognized that he was the only one who could save humanity from the Reaper threat .
This is the first giveaway that nobody was trying to make the games fit together .
Cerberus in the first game was unambiguously evil and ruthless and it was never demonstrated that they had any goals besides the acquisition of power .
( They claimed to be pro-human , but they arguably killed more humans than the bad guys .
Never once were we shown how Cerberus was helping humans . )
Shepard was their chief nemesis .
Cerberus in Mass Effect 2 presents itself as a group with noble intentions and questionable methods .
If they had planned on having us work for Cerberus in part two , they could have set things up for us in part one so this felt like a twist and not a rewrite .
The Cerberus missions you foiled in the first game could have been part of an overarching scheme that is revealed at the start of the second game .
There are so many interesting things they could have done with this .
They could have connected the dots and shown how Cerberus were n’t as bad as they seemed .
Instead , they simply shoved you into service of Cerberus and then threw in a few dialog options to let you bitch about it in petty , non-specific ways .
The Reboot
Why did they need to reboot the story by killing and reviving Shepard ?
This is something you should only do if you ’ve been painted into a corner .
But Mass Effect 1 left plenty of wiggle room to put Shepard into whatever situation they needed .
When you ’re planning to write a three - game trilogy , scene one of Act II should not begin with “ start over ” .
This is particularly frustrating when , after the messy reboot , they have to come up with a bunch of contrivances to put nearly everything back where it was !
1 ) Your entire body is pulverized , but they bring you back exactly as you were before .
2 ) Your ship is destroyed , but they build you a new one that ’s very similar and then give it the same name .
( Except the new one has the CERBERUS LOGO stenciled on the side , which is a bit odd for a super - secret shadow organization .
Somehow this does n’t cause constant problems for you every time you try to dock somewhere civilized . )
3 ) You ’re declared dead , but when you show up again the Alliance accepts you and your new career working for their enemy .
4 ) All of your original crew resign the Alliance and ( on their own , apparently ) join up with this terrorist organization .
They seem to do so without knowing ahead of time that they will end up working for you again on a copy of the original ship .
Apparently your entire crew was teetering on the edge of treason at the end of the last game ?
( Really .
Dr. Chakwas ’ excuse for signing up with Cerberus is that she missed space travel .
She signed up with one of the most ruthless organizations in the galaxy – an organization that you had fought many times in the first game – because that was the only way she could think of to get back into space !?!)
So by the time you take command of the new Normandy , everyone is already waiting for you .
So after all of this vandalism to the original plot and characters , we end up almost exactly back where we were at the end of game 1 , with the same ship , same crew , same setup .
The only thing different is who we ’re working for .
Which brings us to …
The Illusive Man
“ Illusive Man ” .
Really BioWare ?
( Keep in mind this universe already has a character named “ Shadow Broker ” . )
Exhibit B in the case that nobody bothered to plan ahead : Nowhere in game 1 does anyone refer to the Illusive Man .
You are sent to meet him a few minutes into the game .
If the first game had been seeded with allusions to this guy , this could have been a mind - blowing moment .
“ Woah !
I ’m going to get to meet the Illusive Man ? ! ? ”
Instead I was like , “ Who ? ”
In the recruitment dialog , you ’re never given the chance to confront him about any of the past crimes of his organization or give him a chance to tell you his side of the story .
Note that if you have the “ Sole Survivor ” background , then Cerberus is responsible for the life - changing backstory events that led to you undergoing severe physical and mental trauma and killed your entire unit .
You ca n’t even bring this up during your chat with Illusive Man .
In return , he never brings up any of the plans of his that you wrecked in the first game .
He never tries to change your mind about Cerberus .
In fact , you ca n’t really say anything of value to him .
Your only dialog options are halfhearted resignation or Luke Skywalker - level , “ I ’ll never join you ! ” bravado .
The latter is particularly risible since , by the end of the conversation , you ’ve done exactly that .
Building Your Team
Once the game is done messing up your backstory , the characters , and the setting itself , it cuts you loose to recruit your team .
And then Mass Effect 2 becomes completely awesome .
Once the introduction is out of the way , you start collecting teammates and seeing their interesting stories .
This is where you will spend a majority of the game .
Assuming you recruit all the characters and do all of their personal missions , you ’ll spend 75 % of the game on the fun missions and only 25 % on the annoyingly porous story .
But we ’ll talk about the good stuff later .
Leurs silhouettes nous sont familières .
Courbés en deux , ils fréquentent la fin des marchés ou s'attroupent autour des poubelles des magasins et supermarchés .
Mais le profil et les motivations de ses glaneurs étaient jusque là peu connus .
Une étude très fouillée publiée mercredi 16 juin 2010 par le Centre d'étude et de recherche sur la philanthropie ( Cerphi ) , nous éclaire sur cette population qui a pour point commun , les difficultés économiques .
De juillet à novembre 2009 , les chercheurs ont suivi à Paris sur la longueur une vingtaine de glaneurs , âgés de 17 à 69 ans .
Ce corpus limité n'en reste pas moins intéressant , tant la captation de ce public est difficile .
Le glaneur des villes n'a pas de profil sociologique type .
Hommes ou femmes de tous âges , français ou d'origine étrangère , plus ou moins précaires , se livrent à cette pratique .
Les 30 - 40 ans sont néanmoins moins présents sur les sites de glanage , les plus de 60 ans fortement représentés .
Cette activité n'est pas l'apanage des personnes sans logement , au contraire .
Avoir un logement est souvent une des conditions d'une collecte efficace .
La conservation des aliments et leur préparation est plus facile quand on dispose d'un toit .
Le fait de pouvoir cuisiner permet aussi d'élargir le choix des aliments .
" SE SENTIR ACTIF ET AUTONOME "
L'étude a permis d'identifier trois catégories de glanage selon la part qu'il prend dans l'approvisionnement des personnes .
Le glanage " de substitution " remplace l'achat qui devient très marginal et ne s'accompagne d'aucun recours à l'aide alimentaire .
Le glanage de " complément " et celui d'" appoint " interviennent de manière plus ou moins marginale , et permettent d'améliorer l'alimentation ordinaire .
Pour nombre de glaneurs , la collecte permet d'éviter le recours à l'aide alimentaire souvent associée à l'assistanat et à une nourriture peu diversifiée .
Elle est aussi un moyen pour les personnes en situation d'exclusion " de se sentir actif et autonome au moins dans le champ de l'alimentaire " , analysent les chercheurs .
Impossible à quantifier , le phénomène s'est accentué avec la crise .
Cette augmentation semble aller de pair avec une diminution du nombre de lieux de glanage .
Les chercheurs ont ainsi noté que certains lieux de glanage repéré dans un précédent travail de recherche étaient devenus impraticables : " Certains commerçants interdisent l'accès aux poubelles au motif d'une trop forte fréquentation ayant entraîné des désordres ou par craintes de futurs désordres " .
Dans ce contexte , les glaneurs s'inquiètent d'un durcissement des conditions de récupération .
Pourtant , la tolérance sociale autour de cette pratique tend à augmenter , notamment parce que le gaspillage est de plus en plus mal perçu par l'opinion publique .

2009 to 2036 ( Previous release
All growth scenarios considered , Canada 's population could exceed 40 million by 2036 .
The ageing of the population is projected to accelerate rapidly , as the entire baby boom generation turns 65 during this period .
The number of senior citizens could more than double , outnumbering children for the first time .
From 2009 to 2036 , Canada 's population could grow from 33.7 million to between 40.1 million under the low growth scenario and 47.7 million under the high growth scenario .
Results at the provincial and territorial levels vary according to the scenario considered , mainly due to differences in interprovincial migration patterns .
Overall , regardless of the scenario , growth would be higher than the national average in Ontario and British Columbia .
The population of every province and territory would increase during this time , except in some scenarios in the case of Newfoundland and Labrador .
Canada 's population would age rapidly until 2031 , by which time the entire baby boom generation would have turned 65 .
It would continue ageing after 2031 , but at a less rapid pace .
By 2036 , the number of seniors is projected to reach between 9.9 million and 10.9 million , more than double the level of 4.7 million in 2009 .
They would surpass the number of children aged 14 or under for the first time ever between 2015 and 2021 , depending on the scenario .
By 2036 , the median age of the population would range between 42 and 45 years , compared with the current median of 39.5 .
Contributors to demographic growth
Canada 's population growth depends on two factors : natural increase ( births minus deaths ) , and net international migration ( immigrants minus emigrants ) .
The number of deaths is projected to increase during the entire period between 2009 and 2036 , as the baby boom generation gets older .
Under the medium - growth scenario , natural increase would remain positive until 2036 , although the levels of births and deaths would get closer over time .
Note to readers
This release presents new population projections by age and sex for Canada , the provinces and territories from 2009 to 2036 .
Population projections are not forecasts .
Forecasts tell what the most likely future will be .
These projections represent an attempt to establish plausible long - term scenarios based on assumptions of fertility , life expectancy and migration .
These projections use the population estimates for July 1 , 2009 , as starting point .
They take into account emerging trends in the components of population growth , to project the population up to the year 2036 for Canada , the provinces and territories .
They also project Canada 's population to 2061 .
This release presents the main results of six projections scenarios including high - , medium - and low - growth scenarios .
The medium - growth scenario assumes a continuation in the recent trends in fertility , mortality and immigration .
It is bracketed by high - and low - growth scenarios , in which fertility , mortality and immigration levels are higher or lower as the case may be .
Four interprovincial migration patterns are associated to the medium growth scenario and provide different results at the provincial and territorial level .
Also available is a supplementary " short - term " scenario based on very recent trends in Canadian demographics .
This scenario projects the population over a 5 - year period only , compared with 25 years for long - term scenarios .
Detailed tables for all those scenarios are available on CANSIM or on a CD - ROM .
Regardless of the scenario , immigration levels would represent a larger share of the projected population growth at the national level .
Because large numbers of new immigrants consist of younger individuals in the child - bearing age , sustained levels of immigration would also have a positive impact on the number of births .
According to the medium - growth scenario , Canada would receive roughly 333,600 immigrants a year by 2036 , compared with 252,500 in 2010 .
Age structure of the population
Projections show that seniors would account for between 23 % and 25 % of the total population by 2036 , nearly double the 13.9 % in 2009 .
Higher immigration levels would do little to change the forthcoming ageing of the Canadian population .
At the same time , the proportion of the working - age population aged 15 to 64 would decline steadily from about 70 % to about 60 % .
Consequently , ratios of children and seniors to the working - age population would increase in the future , particularly the latter .
The number of children aged 14 or under for every 100 people in the working - age population would increase from 24 in 2009 to 26 by 2036 , according to the medium - growth scenario .
The increase would be larger for seniors aged 65 and over , where by 2036 their numbers according to this scenario would rise from 20 to 39 for every 100 people in the working - age population .
Corresponding to this change , the ratio of working - age population to seniors would decrease from five to one in 2009 to just over two and half to one by 2036 .
Projections also show Canada would have far more very elderly people .
In 2009 , there were roughly 1.3 million people aged 80 or over .
According to the medium - growth scenario , this could increase to 3.3 million by 2036 .
The number of centenarians is projected to triple or quadruple , depending on the scenario .
There were about 6,000 centenarians in 2009 .
Provincial and territorial projections
Ontario and British Columbia are the only provinces in which average annual growth would exceed the growth rate for Canada as a whole between 2009 and 2036 , according to all scenarios .
Ontario's population would increase from nearly 13.1 million in 2009 to between 16.1 million and 19.4 million in 2036 , depending on the scenario .
Under the medium - growth scenario , it would account for 40.5 % of the national population in 2036 , up from 38.7 % in 2009 .
The population of British Columbia would increase from nearly 4.5 million in 2009 to between 5.8 million and 7.1 million in 2036 .
Under the medium - growth scenario , its share of Canada 's total population would rise from 13.2 % to 14.5 % .
Quebec would remain the second most populous province .
Its population would rise from 7.8 million in 2009 to between 8.6 million and 10.0 million in 2036 .
Under the lowest - growth scenario , Newfoundland and Labrador 's population would decline from 508,900 in 2009 to 483,400 in 2036 .
Under the highest - growth scenario , it would rise to 544,500 .
Age structure in the provinces and territories
Provincially , population ageing would differ from region to region .
In almost every scenario , the four Atlantic provinces would continue to have the highest median ages by 2036 .
Northwest Territories and Nunavut would have the youngest .
Between those two extremes , the median age would be lower than the national level in three provinces : Ontario , Manitoba and Alberta .
In the medium - growth scenario , Manitoba would be the youngest province by 2036 , and Newfoundland and Labrador the oldest .

Frenchman with no arms or legs set to swim the 22 miles across English Channel
A Frenchman who lost all his arms and legs in a freak accident is preparing to swim cross the English Channel .
Philippe Croizon will instantly earn himself a place in the record books if his 22 miles crossing from Folkestone , Kent , to Cap - Gris - Nez , near Calais , is successful .
He has flippers connected to his specially designed swimsuit and an extra long snorkel that runs straight up between his eyes .
Amazingly though , he was was barely able to swim two lengths of his local pool two years ago .

This little gem is published by Living Waters Publications and portrays a very simple , albeit headache inducing , visual phenomena that involves the way that the brain processes glyphs .
The front has a highly stylized word that may take a few moments to decipher .
“ The answer is ‘ Eternal Life ’ ( ‘ Eternal ’ is hidden in the ‘ L ’ of Life — see Romans 6:23 ) . ”
I guess it is , as you can see in the scan of the card the actual word hidden on the inner curve of what is an “ L ” upside - down and an “ h ” if oriented otherwise .
We have to trust the message on the back as to what exactly those blobs say , their font is so small that they greek into the ink bleed .
Does this mean that it reads “ Death Lanrete ” when right side - up ?
Then the propaganda starts .
First , the reader is subjected to what in propaganda jargon could be called a “ framing sentence . ”
The point of this is to set the frame of mind of the reader to the singular context that the propagandist wants :
“ Here is another intelligence test . ”
What follows is n’t exactly what it says on the tin .
“ Answer Yes or No OUT LOUD : 1 / Is there a God ?
2 / Does God care about right and wrong ?
3 / Are God ’s standards the same as ours ?
4 / Will God punish sin ?
5 / Is there a Hell ?
6 / Do you avoid Hell by living a good life ? ”
At this point the savvy reader will realize that this is not a test of intelligence .
It ’s not even a proper test of knowledge .
It is a memory test for the particular dogma of the Living Waters Publications editor who prepared this text .
A person who answers most of these differently than the answers given immediately afterwards is no more or less intelligent than anyone else for their answers .
Here the propaganda makes the assumption that the reader knows what it ’s talking about .
It ’s reaching out to someone who is culturally Christian .
Mostly in the phrase “ Is there a God ? ” I find myself bemused by the phrase .
It ’s a lot like saying , “ Is there an Elaine ? ”
The question is pandering , but only with its capital letter — I guess that “ Is there the God ? ” just does n’t have the same ring , we just do n’t speak that way ; and they wanted to avoid saying “ Is there a god ? ” or “ Are there gods ? ”
This goes back to pandering to assumed knowledge .
A pagan , Hindu , or other polytheist would snicker at this line .
The “ correct ” answers are , of course , amusing in of themselves .
There is a God who cares about right and wrong ; but does n’t have the same “ standards ” as we do …
Invocation of threat of Hell .
I understand they ’re working under a lot of pressure to fit this 10 - point font paragraph onto the back of a business card , but I ’m not impressed .
“ You ca n’t afford to be wrong .
Find out the truth – ask God to forgive your sins , then trust in Jesus Christ .
He took your punishment by dying on the Cross for you .
Then
He rose from the dead .
Read the Bible daily and obey what you read …
God will never let you down . ”
Another feature of religious propaganda is the use of designed jargon ; these are often words coherent only to the culture of the religion .
First there ’s elements from Christian mythology : the Cross , Jesus Christ , death and resurrection of the former .
Then there ’s the jargon word “ sin ” which is only meaningful in the frame already set up based on the assumptions of the Living Waters dogma .
Did anyone else notice that the word “ Cross ” got a capital ?
Symbolism and semiotics lay at the heart of a lot of social propaganda but are also central to cultural context .
In this case the tract editor is trying to connect with the implied cultural Christianity of the reader by using a shared symbol .
It ’s not just any mundane crucifix used by the Romans to torture and murder people , no , it ’s the specific device used to torture Jesus .
Is it just me who felt their skin crawling when they saw “ Read your Bible daily and obey what you read ” ?
Do the people who edit these tracts actually read their Bible ?
I only have one thing to say to this :
What is an Amalekite and if I ever meet one must I really murder him or her ?
Who in their right mind in this day and age would obey such a command ?
Further : Obey ?
Bob the Angry Flower “ Submission Channel ” much ?
SUBMIT .
SUBMIT .
SUBMIT .
And finally , my favorite part of this review .
The very last line of the tract :
“ God will never let you down . ”
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you .
Police have found insufficient evidence to substantiate claims Green Party co-leader Russel Norman was assaulted during the arrival of Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping at Parliament .
Photographs clearly showed Dr Norman being grabbed by Chinese security personnel travelling with the vice president at Parliament this afternoon while the Green MP protested the visit by waving a Tibetan flag .
Wellington City Area Police Commander , Inspector Peter Cowan , said police had investigated the complaint but did n't find enough evidence to lay charges .
" Police have spoken to a number of people who witnessed the incident , reviewed available footage , and approached the Chinese delegation who declined to comment with information that might assist the inquiry , " Inspector Cowan said .
" Within the timeframes available to us police have decided there is insufficient evidence to substantiate any assault charges at this time . "
Inspector Cowan said police will continue with inquiries over the weekend .
DON SCOTT PROTEST STIFLED : Green co-leader Russel Norman said he believed his Tibetan flag was torn from his hands by one of the vice president 's security guards .
Meanwhile , Prime Minister John Key says an " altercation " between Dr Norman and Chinese security personnel is " disappointing " but says it is too early to say if the Chinese government should apologise .
Mr Key told reporters this afternoon it was disappointing that the incident might overshadow the vice - president 's visit and said it was too early for him to say if an apology was due .
He had not seen film footage of the incident so could not comment on whether the force used by Chinese security personnel was disproportionate .
That was for police to decide , along with Parliament 's Speaker , he said .
MICHAEL FOX / Stuff.co.nz PARLIAMENT VISIT : Around 30 pro-Chinese government supporters were on site to welcome the second - most powerful man in their country .
And while Mr Key valued the relationship with China , he also valued freedom of speech and the rights of New Zealanders and MPs to make their opinions known to others , he said .
It was a " sad incident " given that the visit up till today had been " very successful " , Mr Key said .
He hoped that the strong relationship with China and the vice president - who was a " very important person " - was not tainted by a " one off incident " .
JOHN SELKIRK CHEERS : Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping makes a toast in Auckland yesterday during a lunch held by the Government .
Labour leader Phil Goff said after a meeting with Mr Xi that the vice president had " acknowledged " the incident with Dr Norman .
Mr Goff said he had explained the right to protest was an important one in New Zealand and the vice president said he was aware of that and had been prepared for it .
He had not seen the footage but it was wrong for foreign security to take such action while in New Zealand .
VIP'S ARRIVAL QUICKLY TURNS CHAOTIC
Arriving in a convoy of around six vehicles with a police escort , the guards initially tried to shield the flag with their bodies and umbrellas before it was torn from Dr Norman 's hand with a member of the vice president 's entourage standing on it as the VIP was rushed through the front entrance of Parliament .
" I think it 's pretty outrageous that Chinese security can come to our country and push around an elected Member of Parliament simply because you 're standing up for democracy and freedom in our own country on our own parliamentary grounds , " Dr Norman said afterwards .
" I mean , the Chinese security guards , they elbowed me out of the way , they put an umbrella over the top of me and they took the flag out of my hands and trampled on it . "
Dr Norman said he had complained to police " because New Zealanders need to know they are free to speak without fear of violence or recrimination ” .
The Government needed to defend the right of its citizens to free speech because it was one of the cornerstones of democracy .
" I 'm asking that John Key make a clear statement that this sort of behaviour is not acceptable in New Zealand , " Dr Norman said .
Speaker Lockwood Smith has also said he would investigate the incident .
With some blood on his hand following the scuffle , Dr Norman said he had never experienced such treatment on Parliament 's grounds .
He believed it was one of the vice president 's security guards .
" We were roughed up , they grabbed us and pushed us around . "
He said he was pushed when he tried to grab the flag back .
Around 30 pro-Chinese government supporters were on site to welcome the second - most powerful man in their country .
" Do n't bring your undemocratic processes to our country , " Dr Norman had told the Chinese VIPs .
After meeting the vice president , Speaker Lockwood Smith said he would investigate the incident but had not seen it .
Meanwhile , the diplomatic incident appears to have forced a change in the venue for a meeting with Labour leader Phil Goff .
Mr Goff 's office confirmed that a scheduled meeting at Parliament between him and the Chinese Vice President had been moved to the Hotel InterContinental .
A spokesman said the change in venue had been advised by the Visits and Ceremonial Office but they had been given no reason for the switch .
VIP TREATMENT
Relations between China and New Zealand had so far on this trip been at an all - time high , with Prime Minister John Key " pulling out all the stops " for Mr Xi's visit .
Last night Mr Key was host at a dinner held for the Vice President at Government House in Auckland .
Mr Xi's visit yesterday included his first public speech to a major business audience in New Zealand .
Mr Key said Mr Xi's visit was part of an important exercise in diplomacy .
" Our understanding is that there is a very good chance that Xi Jinping is going to be a potential future president of China , " he said .
" In the pecking order , he is right up there to replace President Hu . "
Mr Key rearranged his schedule to meet Mr Xi .
He was forced to use an air force plane to make it to Auckland in time from a visit to Bay of Plenty .
" We 're definitely pulling out all the stops , " he said .
Mr Xi is meeting all New Zealand 's top elected officials during his three - day visit .
There will be further talks with Mr Key this morning , followed by lunch with Deputy Prime Minister Bill English at Premier House in Wellington .
Mr Xi will also meet Speaker Lockwood Smith and have talks with Labour leader Phil Goff today .
Mr Xi , who is travelling with about 120 Chinese businesspeople , told an audience in Auckland that he wanted to elevate bilateral relations .
A summary of his translated speech said there had been frequent exchanges of high - level visits and the economies of the two countries were highly complementary " with huge potentials in economic and trade co-operation " .
Mr Xi proposed a four - point plan , the first focusing on New Zealand 's rich resources and its advanced science and technology .
China had large markets and cheap labour .
" So the two countries can put the improvement of economic and trade quality as their future focus . "
The two could also increase co-operation in new energy , environment , biological technology and high and new technologies .
Trade Minister Tim Groser said China had played a major role in sheltering New Zealand from the full impact of a global recession .
" I believe that more and more New Zealanders understand this and very much appreciate the contribution China is making to our own economy and society , " he said .
Mr Norman earlier said the top - level visit would add pressure from China to win approval for a bid to buy thousands of hectares of dairy farm land from the Crafar family .
But Mr Key said the Overseas Investment Office , which must approve the bid , was independent .
" There is no correlation between this trip and the desire by the Chinese consortium to buy the Crafar farms . "
This year China became New Zealand 's second - largest trading partner , overtaking the United States and Japan after the signing of a free - trade deal between the two countries in 2008 .
In the year to April , the deal sparked an $ 860 million boost in Kiwi exports to China .
WHO IS XI JINPING ?
The top-ranking member of the Secretariat of the Communist Party of China ; the country 's Vice President ; principal of the Central Party School ; and the 6th ranked member of the Politburo Standing Committee .
Mr Xi , 57 , was put in charge of preparations for the 2008 Beijing Olympics , and is the top Chinese figure in Hong Kong and Macau affairs .
His father , Xi Zhong , was a major figure in the 1920s Communist Party .
Mr Xi was named as one of the most influential people in the world in the 2009 Time 100 list .
He is married to Chinese folk singer Peng Liyuan , his second wife .
Recent business has included , on May 19 , a meeting with Gennady Zyuganov , chairman of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party .
New Zealand is his third stop on a four - nation tour , which includes Australia , Bangladesh and Laos .

Okay , that ’s not true .
But it ’s no different than this :
Prosecutors Ask if 8 Banks Duped Rating Agencies
Wall Street played a crucial role in the mortgage market ’s path to collapse .
Investment banks bundled mortgage loans into securities and then often rebundled those securities one or two more times .
Those securities were given high ratings and sold to investors , who have since lost billions of dollars on them .
…
At Goldman , there was even a phrase for the way bankers put together mortgage securities .
The practice was known as “ ratings arbitrage , ” according to former workers .
The idea was to find ways to put the very worst bonds into a deal for a given rating .
The cheaper the bonds , the greater the profit to the bank .
The rating agencies may have facilitated the banks ’ actions by publishing their rating models on their corporate Web sites .
The agencies argued that being open about their models offered transparency to investors .
But several former agency workers said the practice put too much power in the bankers ’ hands .
“ The models were posted for bankers who develop C.D.O. ’s to be able to reverse engineer C.D.O. ’s to a certain rating , ” one former rating agency employee said in an interview , referring to collateralized debt obligations .
I just finished reading Michael Lewis ’ The Big Short , and it ’s pretty clear that the banks knew enough about the rating agencies ’ models to pretty successfully turn shit into shinola .
In fact , the agencies made enough of their ratings models public to make it absolutely certain that the banks would game the system .
Not * dupe * the rating agencies , mind you , because the ratings agencies were willing partners .
But I thought about it a little bit more , and I was struck by another thought .
The Democratic house leadership wanted to cost projection of the healthcare bill to come in within a certain number .
So what did they do ?
They duped gamed the CBO rating system to ensure that the bill they wrote would have the price tag they wanted it to have .
The CBO is a respected and non-partisan office , but they ’re asked only to score what legislators give them , NOT what they think the legislators will do in other bills immediately or a few years down the line .
Essentially both the Wall Street banks and Congressional leadership did the same thing : they were teaching to the test .
They knew specifically what was needed in order to generate a favorable outcome from the “ test ” , and they made sure they did exactly what they wanted , but in such a way that got the right score .
So who ’s going to prosecute the Democratic leadership when this healthcare bill inevitably costs the American people more than they advertised ?

Introduction
And It Came to Pass
And it came to pass ,
When men began to multiply on the face of the Earth
and daughters were born unto them ,
that the sons of God saw the daughters of men
that they were fair , and they took them wives
of all which they chose .
There were giants upon the Earth
in those days and also thereafter too ,
When the sons of God
came in unto the daughters of men
and they bare children to them -
the same Mighty Men of old ,
Men of Renown .
The reader , if familiar with the King James English version of the Bible , will recognize these verses in chapter 6 of Genesis as the preamble to the story of the Deluge , the Great Flood in which Noah , huddled in an ark , was saved to repopulate the Earth .
The reader , if familiar with my writings , will also recognize these verses as the reason why many decades ago , a schoolboy was prompted to ask his teacher why it is “ giants ” who are the subject of these verses , when the word in the original Hebrew text is Nefilim — which , stemming from the Hebrew verb NaFoL , means to fall down , to be downed , to come down - and in no way ‘ giants ’ .
The schoolboy was I . Instead of being congratulated on my linguistic acumen , I was harshly reprimanded .
“ Sitchin , sit down ! ” the teacher hissed with repressed anger ; “ you do n’t question the Bible ! ” I was deeply hurt that day , for I was not questioning the Bible — on the contrary , I was pointing out the need to understand it accurately .
And that was what changed my life ’s direction to pursue the Nefilim .
Who were they , and who were their “ Mighty Men ” descendants ?
The search for answers started with linguistic questions .
The Hebrew text does not speak of “ Men ” who began to multiply , but of Ha’Adam — “ The Adam , ” a generic term , a human species .
It does not speak of the sons of “ God , ” but uses the term Bnei Ha-Elohim — the sons ( in the plural ) of The Elohim , a plural term taken to mean “ gods ” but literally meaning “ The Lofty Ones . ”
The “ Daughters of The Adam ” were not “ fair , ” but Tovoth — good , compatible . . .
And unavoidably we find ourselves confronting issues of origins .
How did Mankind happen to be on this planet , and whose genetic code do we carry ?
In just three verses and a few words — forty - nine words in the original Hebrew of Genesis — the Bible describes the creation of Heaven and Earth , then records an actual prehistoric time of early Mankind and a series of amazing events , including a global Flood , the presence on Earth of gods and their sons , inter- species intermarriage , and demigod offspring . . .
And so , starting with one word ( Nefilim ) , I told the tale of the Anunnaki , “ Those who from Heaven to Earth came ” — space travelers and interplanetary settlers who came from their troubled planet to Earth in need of gold , and ended up fashioning The Adam in their image .
In doing so I brought them to life — recognizing them individually , unraveling their tangled relationships , describing their tasks , loves , ambitions , and wars — and identifying their inter-species offspring , the ‘ demigods ’ .
I have been asked at times where my interests would have taken me were the teacher to compliment rather than reprimand me .
In truth , I have asked myself a different question :
What if indeed “ there were giants upon the Earth , in those days and thereafter too “ ?
The cultural , scientific , and religious implications are awesome ; they lead to the next unavoidable questions :
Why did the compilers of the Hebrew Bible , which is totally devoted to monotheism , include the bombshell verses in the prehistoric record — and what were their sources ?
I believe that I have found the answer .
Deciphering the enigma of the demigods ( the famed Gilgamesh among them ) , I conclude in this book — my crowning oeuvre — that compelling physical evidence for past alien presence on Earth has been buried in an ancient tomb .
It is a tale that has immense implications for our genetic origins — a key to unlocking the secrets of health , longevity , life , and death ; it is a mystery whose unraveling will take the reader on a unique adventure and finally reveal what was held back from Adam in the Garden of Eden .
Sumer : Where Civilization Began
Sumer , it is now known , was the land of a talented and dexterous people in what is now southern Iraq .
Usually depicted in artful statues and statuettes in a devotional stance ( Fig. 28 ) , it was the Sumerians who were the first ones to record and describe past events and tell the tales of their gods .
It was there , in the fertile plain watered by the great Euphrates and Tigris Rivers , that Mankind ’s first known civilization blossomed out some 6,000 years ago — “ suddenly , ” “ unexpectedly , ” “ with stunning abruptness , ” according to all scholars .
It was a civilization to which we owe , to this day , virtually every  First ’ of what we deem essential to an advanced civilization :
The wheel and wheeled transportation ; the brick that made ( and still makes ) possible high - rise buildings ; furnaces and the kiln that are essential to industries from baking to metallurgy ; astronomy and mathematics ; cities and urban societies ; kingship and laws ; temples and priesthoods ; timekeeping , a calendar , festivals ; from beer to culinary recipes , from art to music and musical instruments ; and , above all , writing and record keeping - it was all first there , in Sumer .
We now know all that thanks to the achievements of archaeology and the decipherment of ancient languages during the past century and a half .
The long and arduous road by which ancient Sumer moved from complete obscurity to an awed appreciation of its grandeur has a number of milestones bearing the names of scholars who had made the journey possible .
Some , who toiled at the varied sites , will be mentioned by us .
Others , who pieced together and classified fragmented artifacts during a century and a half of Mesopotamian archaeology , are too many to be listed .
And then there were the epigraphers — sometimes out in the field , most of the time poring over tablets in crammed museum or university quarters — whose persistence , devotion , and abilities converted pieces of clay incised with odd  cuneates ’ into legible historical , cultural and literary treasures .
Their work was crucial , for while the usual pattern of archaeological and ethnographic discovery has been to find a people ’s remains and then decipher their written records ( if they had them ) , in the case of the Sumerians recognition of their language — even its decipherment — preceded the discovery of their land , Sumer ( the common English spelling , rather than Shumer ) .
And it was not because the language ,  Sumerian ’ , preceded its people ; on the contrary — it was because the language and its script lingered on after Sumer was long gone — just as Latin and its script had outlived the Roman empire thousands of years later .
The philological recognition of Sumerian began , as we have illustrated , not through the discovery of the Sumerians ’ own tablets , but through the varied use , in Akkadian texts , of loan words ’ that were not Akkadian ; the naming of gods and cities by names that made no sense in Assyrian or Babylonian ; and of course by actual statements ( as that by Ashurbanipal ) about the existence of earlier writings in  Shumerian ’ .
His statement was borne out by the discovery of tablets that rendered the same text in two languages , one Akkadian and the other in the mysterious language ; then the next two lines were in Akkadian and in the other language , and so on ( the scholarly term for such bilingual texts is  interlinears ’ ) .
It was in 1850 that Edward Hincks , a student of Rawlinson ’s Behistun decipherments , suggested in a scholarly essay that an Akkadian  syllabary ’ — the collection of some 350 cuneiform signs each representing a full consonant + vowel syllable - must have evolved from a prior non-Akkadian set of syllabic signs .
The idea ( which was not readily accepted ) was finally borne out when some of the clay tablets in the Akkadian - language libraries turned out to be bilingual  syllabarial ’ dictionaries — lists that on one side of the tablet gave a cuneiform sign in the unknown language , and a matching list on the other side in Akkadian ( with the signs ’ pronunciation and meaning added , Fig. 29 ) .
All at once , archaeology obtained a dictionary of an unknown language !
In addition to tablets inscribed as a kind of dictionaries , the so - called Syllabaries , various other bi-lingual tablets served as invaluable tools in deciphering the Sumerian writing and language .
Figure 29
In 1869 Jules Oppert , addressing the French Society of Numismatics and Archaeology , pointed out that the royal title “ King of Sumer and Akkad ” found on some tablets provided the name of the people who had preceded the Akkadian - speaking Assyrians and Babylonians ; they were , he suggested , the Sumerians .
The designation has been applied ever since — although , to this day , museums and the media prefer to name their exhibits or title their articles and programs “ Babylonian ” or at best “ Old Babylonian ” rather than the unfamiliar “ Sumerian . ”
Though virtually everything that we consider essential to a developed civilization has been inherited from the Sumerians , many people still respond with a blank “ Who ? ” when they hear the word  Sumerian ’ . . .
The interest in Sumer and the Sumerians constituted a chronological as well as a geographical shift : From the 1st and 2nd millennia B.C. to the 3rd and 4th millennia B.C. , and from northern and central Mesopotamia to its south .
That ancient settlements lay buried there was indicated not only by the numerous mounds that were scattered over the flat mudlands , mounds that resulted from layers of habitats built upon layers ( called strata ) of the remains of previous habitats ; more intriguing were odd artifacts that local tribesmen dug up out of the mounds , showing them to the occasional European visitors .
What we know now is the result of almost 150 years of archaeological toil that brought to light , to varying degrees , Sumer ’s fourteen or so major ancient centers ( map , Fig. 30 ) , virtually all of which are mentioned in the ancient texts .

* * *
Systematic field archaeology of Sumer is deemed to have begun in 1877 by Ernest de Sarzec , who was then the French Vice - Consul in Basra , Iraq ’s southern port city on the Persian Gulf .
( Rumors at the time were that having been fascinated by the local trade in finds , his real interest was in finding objects for private sale . )
He started excavating at a site locally called Tello (  The Mound ’ ) .
The finds there were so great — and they did go to the Louvre Museum in Paris , where they fill up galleries — and so inexhaustible , that French archaeological teams kept coming back year after year to this one site for more than fifty years , through 1933 .
Tello turned out to be the sacred precinct , the Girsu , of a large Sumerian urban center called Lagash .
Archaeological strata indicated that it had been continuously settled almost since 3800 B.C. Sculpted wall reliefs dating from a so - called Early Dynastic Period , stone sculptures bearing inscriptions in immaculate Sumerian cuneiform ( Fig. 31 ) , and a beautiful silver vase presented by a king named Entemena to his god ( Fig. 32 ) attested the high level of Sumerian culture millennia ago .
To top it all , more than 10,000 inscribed clay tablets were found in the city ’s library ( the importance of which will be discussed later on ) .
Some inscriptions and texts named a continuous line of kings of Lagash who reigned from circa 2900 B.C. to 2250 B.C. — an uninterrupted reign of almost seven centuries .
Clay tablets and commemorative stone plaques recorded large construction undertakings , irrigation and canal projects ( and named the kings who initiated them ) ; there was trade with distant lands , and even conflicts with nearby cities .
Most astounding were the statues and inscriptions of a king named Gudea ( circa 2400 B.C. , Fig. 33 ) in which he described the miraculous circumstances leading to the building of a complex temple for the god Ningirsu and the god ’s spouse , Bau .
The task , detailed later on , involved divine instructions given in  Twilight Zone ’ circumstances , astronomical alignments , elaborate architecture , the importation of rare building materials from distant lands , calendrial know - how , and precise rituals - all taking place some 4,300 years ago .
The Lagash discoveries have been summed up by its last French excavator , Andrè Parrot , in his book Tello ( 1948 ) .
A few miles northwest of the mounds of Lagash , a mound locally called Tell el - Madineh was located .
The French excavators of Lagash peeked at it too ; but there was not much to excavate , for the ancient city that had been there was , at some time , completely destroyed by fire .
A few finds , however , helped identify that ancient city as Bad - Tibira .
The ancient city ’s Sumerian name ,  Bad Tibira ’ , meant  The Metalworking Fort ’ ; as other discoveries clarified later , Bad -Tibira was indeed considered to have been a metalworking center .
A decade after de Sarzec began excavations at Lagash , a new major archaeological player joined the effort to uncover Sumer : The University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia .
It had been known , from preceding finds in Mesopotamia , that the most important religious center in Sumer was a city called Nippur ; in 1887 John Peters , a professor of Hebrew at the university , succeeded in lining up academic support at the university and financial support from individual donors to organize an “ archaeological expedition ” to Iraq to find Nippur .
The location of Nippur seemed easy to guess :
At the geographical center of southern Mesopotamia , a can ’t - be - missed huge mound rising some 65 feet above the mudplain was called Niffar by the locals ; it fitted references to ancient Nippur as “ Navel of the Earth . ”
The University of Pennsylvania ’s Expedition conducted four excavation  campaigns ’ at the site from 1888 to 1900 , at first under the direction of John Peters , then under the leadership of Hermann Hilprecht , a German - born Assyriologist of international standing .
Nippur , the archaeologists ascertained , had been continuously settled from the 6th millennium B.C. to about A.D. 800 .
The excavations focused at first on the city ’s Sacred Precinct whose location - as incredible as it may sound - was indicated on a millennia - old city map inscribed on a large clay tablet ( Fig. 34 , transcript and translation ) .
There , the remains of a high - rising ziggurat ( step - pyramid ) in the city ’s sacred precinct ( reconstruction , Fig. 35 ) attested its dominance above the city .
Called E. Kur ( =  House which is like a mountain ’ ) , it was the main temple dedicated to Sumer ’s leading god En.lil ( =  Lord of the Command ’ ) and his spouse Nin.lil ( =  Lady of the Command ’ ) .
The temple , inscriptions stated , included an inner chamber in which “ Tablets of Destinies ” were kept .
According to several texts , the chamber was the heart of the
Dur.An.Ki (= “ Bond Heaven - Earth ’ ) - a Command and Control Center of the god Enlil that connected Earth with the heavens .
The Expedition ’s finds at Nippur , deemed by some to be “ of unparalleled importance , ” included the discovery of nearly 30,000 inscribed clay tablets ( or fragments thereof ) in a library of what had apparently been a special Scribal & Science quarter of the city , adjoining the Sacred Precinct .
Hilprecht planned to publish no less than twenty volumes with the tablets ’ most important texts , many with “ mythological ” context , others dealing with mathematics and astronomy and dating back to the 3rd millennium B.C. Among the Nippur inscriptions that were transcribed , translated and published was a remnant of the original Sumerian tale of the Deluge , naming its “ Noah ” Ziusudra ( =  [ His ] Lifedays Prolonged ’ ) –the equivalent of the Akkadian Utnapishtim .
In this Sumerian inscription ( known to scholars by its reference number CBS 10673 ) , it is the god Enki who reveals to his faithful follower Ziusudra a “ secret of the gods ” — that , at the instigation of an angry Enlil , the gods decided to “ destroy the seed of Mankind by the Deluge ” that was about to happen ; and Enki ( Cronos ’ in the Berossus Fragments ) instructs Ziusudra ( the  Xisithros ’ of Berossus ) to build the salvaging boat .
But all the Expedition ’s plans were cut short by a spate of accusations by Peters that Hilprecht was providing misleading  provenances ’ ( discovery locations ) for announced finds , and that Hilprecht had made a deal with the Turkish Sultan in Constantinople ( today ’s Istanbul ) to send most of the finds there — rather than to the university in Philadelphia — in exchange for the Sultan letting Hilprecht keep some finds as gifts ’ for his private collection .
The controversy , which divided Philadelphia ’s highest echelons and made headlines in the New York Times , raged from 1907 to 1910 .
A commission of inquiry formed by the University in the end found the accusations of professional misconduct against Hilprecht to be “ unsubstantiated ” ; but in fact many of the Nippur tablets did end up in Constantinople / Istanbul .
Hilprecht ’s private collection ended up in Jena , Hilprecht ’s university town in Germany .
The University of Pennsylvania , through its Archaeological Museum , returned to Nippur only after World War II , in a joint expedition with Chicago University ’s Oriental Institute .
The Peters - Hilprecht controversy is still regarded by historians as a major disruption of Near Eastern archaeology .
But due to the ever - intervening Law of Unintended Consequences , in the end it led to one of the greatest advances in Sumerology , for it provided the first job to a young epigrapher named Samuel N. Kramer who then became an outstanding  Sumerologist ’ .
* * *
The excavations at Lagash and Nippur , requiring continuous archaeological efforts year after year after year , revealed the existence of major urban centers in Sumer that rivaled in size the Babylonian and Assyrian sites in the north , even though the ones in Sumer were older by more than a thousand years .
The existence of walled sacred precincts , each with a skyscraping ziggurat , indicated a high level of ancient building technology that preceded and served as a model for the Babylonians and Assyrians .
The ziggurats — literally  That which rises high ’ — rose in several steps ( usually seven ) to heights that could reach 90 meters .
They were built of two kinds of mud bricks — sun-dried for high - rise cores , and kiln - burned for extra strength for stairways , exteriors , and overhangs ; the size , shape , and curvature of the bricks varied to fit their function ; and they were held together with bitumen as mortar .
( Modern laboratory tests show that kiln - burnt mud bricks are fivefold stronger than sun-dried ones . )
The discovered ziggurats literally confirmed the biblical statement in Genesis 11:1 - 4 regarding the construction methods of the settlers in Shine ’ar after the Deluge :
And the whole Earth was of one language
and one kind of words .
And it came to pass ,
as they journeyed from the east ,
that they found a plain in the land of Shine ’ar
and they settled there .
And they said unto each other :
Come , let us make bricks ,
and burn them thoroughly .
And the brick served them for stone ,
and bitumen served them for mortar .
And they said :
Come , let us build us a city ,
and a tower whose head shall reach heaven .
In lands like Canaan , where stones were used for building and lime is still used as mortar ( for they lack bitumen ) , the reference to bricks and brick - making technology ( “ burn them thoroughly ” ) and to bitumen ( which seeps out of the ground in southern Mesopotamia ) represent a remarkably detailed and amazing knowledge of past events in a stone - less land like Sumer .
Uncovering ancient Sumer , the archaeologists ’ spades were corroborating the Bible .
Beside the various technological accomplishments of those settlers in the plain between the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers — they also included the wheel and wagon , the kiln , metallurgy , medicines , textiles , multicolored apparel , musical instruments - there were countless other  firsts ’ of what are still deemed essential aspects of an advanced civilization .
They included a mathematical system called sexagesimal ( Base 60 ′ ) that initiated the circle of 360° , timekeeping that divided day / night into 12  double - hours ’ , a luni - solar calendar of 12 months properly intercalated with a 13th leap month , geometry , measurement units of distance , weight and capacity , an advanced astronomy with planetary , star , constellation , and zodiacal knowledge , law codes and courts of law , irrigation systems , transportation networks and customs stations , dance and music ( and musical notes ) , even taxes — as well as a social organization based on kingship and a religion centered at temples with prescribed festivals and a specialized priesthood .
Additionally , the existence of scribal schools and temple and royal libraries indicated astounding levels of intellectual and literary achievements .
The Sumerologist Samuel Noah Kramer , in his trailblazing book History Begins At Sumer ( 1956 ) , described twenty - seven of those Firsts , including the First Legal Precedent , the First Moral Ideals , the First Historian , the First Love Song , the First  Job ’ , and so on — all culled from Sumerian inscribed clay tablets .
Actual archaeological finds of artifacts , and pictorial depictions , enhance and affirm that extensive textual record .
The realization in Europe and America of all of that served to increase the pace of uncovering Sumer ; and the more archaeologists dug , the more they found themselves facing earlier and earlier times .
A site , called Bismaya , was excavated by an expedition of the University of Chicago .
It was an ancient Sumerian city called Adab .
Remains of temples and palaces were found there , with objects bearing votive inscriptions ; some identified a king of Adab named Lugal - Dalu , who reigned there circa 2400 B.C .
At mounds grouped around the locally named Tell Uhaimir , French archaeologists uncovered the ancient Sumerian city of Kish , with remains of two ziggurats ; they were built of unusual convex bricks ; a tablet inscribed in early Sumerian script identified the temple as dedicated to the god Ninurta , Enlil ’s warrior son .
The earliest ruins , dated to the Very Early Dynastic period , included a palace of “ monumental size ” ; the building was columned — a rarity in Sumer .
The finds in Kish included remains of wheeled wagons and metal objects .
Inscriptions identified two kings by their names - Mes-alim and Lugal - Mu ; it was later determined that they reigned at the start of the 3rd millennium B.C.
Excavations at Kish were resumed after World War I by Chicago ’s Field Museum of Natural History and Oxford ’s Ashmolean Museum .
Among their finds were some of the earliest examples of cylinder seal impressions .
( In 2004 the Field Museum launched a project to unify , digitally on computers , the more than 100,000 Kish artifacts that have been dispersed between Chicago , London , and Baghdad . )

In the 1880s a site called Abu Habbah drew the attention of L. W. King of the British Museum when “ interesting tablets ” — dug up at the site by local plunderers — were offered for sale .
A colleague , Theophilus Pinches , correctly identified the city as ancient Sippar — the very city of the god Shamash , mentioned by Berossus in the story of the Flood !
The site was briefly excavated by Layard ’s assistant Hormuzd Rassam ; one of the best known finds there has been a large stone tablet depicting none other than the god Shamash , sitting on his canopied throne ( Fig. 36 ) .
The accompanying inscriptions identified the king being presented to the god as King Nabu - apla - iddin , who in the 9th century B.C. refurbished the Shamash temple in Sippar .
The city ’s twin mounds were more thoroughly excavated in the 1890s by a joint expedition of the Deutsche Orient Gesellschaft and the Ottoman Antiquities Service .
They not only discovered undisturbed hoards of textual tablets — shared between Berlin and Constantinople — but also some of the tablets ’ oldest and oddest libraries :
The tablets were kept in  pigeonhole ’ compartments cut into the mud - brick walls , rather than ( as in later periods ) on shelves .
The library ’s texts included tablets whose colophons explicitly stated that those were copies of texts from earlier tablets coming from Nippur , from a city called Agade , and from Babylon - or found in Sippar itself ; among them were tablets belonging to the Sumerian Atra - Hasis text !
Did that indicate that Sippar had been an early repository of “ writings , ” as the statements by Berossus have suggested ?
No certain answers can be given , except to quote Berossus again : First ,  Cronos ’ ordered Xisithros “ to dig a hole and to bury all the writings about the Beginnings , Middles , and Ends , in Sippar , the city of the Sun god [ Shamash ] . ”
Then , the Flood ’s survivors “ came back to Babylon , they dug up the writings from Sippar , founded many cities , set up shrines , and once again established Babylon . ”
Was the unique storage in cutout compartments a reminder of the “ digging of holes ” to preserve the most ancient tablets ?
We can only wonder .
At Sippar , the tale of the Deluge began to assume physical reality ; but it was only the beginning .
In the decade preceding World War I , German archaeologists , under the auspices of the Deutsche Orient Gesellschaft , began excavating at a site locally named Fara .
It was an important Sumerian city called Shuruppak , which had been settled well before 3000 B.C.
Among its interesting features were buildings that were , without doubt , public facilities , some serving as schools with built - in mud - brick benches .
There were plenty of inscribed tablets whose contents threw light on daily life , the administration of laws , and the private ownership of houses and fields — tablets that mirrored urban life five thousand years ago .
Inscribed tablets asserted that this Sumerian city had a pre-Diluvial predecessor — a place that played a key role in the events of the Deluge .
The discoveries there stood out by their unusual hoard of cylinder seals or their impressions — a unique Sumerian invention that , as the cuneiform script , was in time adopted throughout the ancient lands .
These were cylinders ( mostly an inch or two in length ) that were cut from a stone ( often semiprecious ) , into which the artisan engraved a drawing , with or without accompanying writing ( Fig. 37 ) .
The trick was to engrave it all in reverse , as a negative , so that when it was rolled on wet clay the image was impressed as a positive - an early rotary press ’ invention .
These cylindrical works of art are called  seals ’ because that was their purpose :
The seal ’s owner impressed it on a lump of wet clay that sealed a container of oil or wine , or on a clay envelope to seal a clay letter inside .
Some seal impressions had already been found in Lagash , bearing the name of their owner ; but the ones in Fara / Shuruppak exceeded 1,300 in number , and in some cases were from the earliest times .
But no less an amazing aspect of uncovering Shuruppak was its very finding - for , according to Tablet XI of the Akkadian version of the Epic of Gilgamesh , Shuruppak was the hometown of Utnapishtim , the  Noah ’ of the Deluge !
It was there that the god Enki revealed to Utnapishtim the secret of the coming Deluge and instructed him to build the salvage boat :
Man of Shuruppak , son of Ubar - Tutu :
Tear down the house , build a ship !
Give up possessions , seek thou life !
Forswear belongings , keep soul alive !
Aboard ship take thou the seed of all living things .
That ship thou shalt build -
Its dimensions shall be to measure .
( Enki , it will be recalled , was reported to have been the revealer of the gods ’ secret decision also in the Sumerian text mentioned earlier . )
The discoveries of and at Shuruppak , together with those at Sippar , transformed the Deluge tale from legend and myth ’ to a physical reality .
In Divine Encounters I have concluded , based on ancient data and modern scientific discoveries , that the Deluge was a colossal tidal wave caused by the slippage of the eastern Antarctic ice sheet off that continent .
World War I ( 1914 - 1918 ) interrupted those and other archaeological explorations in the Near East , which was part of the Ottoman empire until its dismemberment after the war .
Mesopotamia was left in the hands of local excavators — both official , and ( mostly ) private site - robbers .
Some of the finds did reach the Museum of the Ancient Orient in Constantinople / Istanbul , revealing that during the war years excavations in Iraq had taken place at Abu Habbah , ancient Sippar ; but there was so much to uncover there , that varied excavations have continued into the 1970s — almost a full century after excavations there began .
* * *
A continuous and most determined series of excavations , lasting from the end of World War I until the outbreak of World War II in 1939 ( and resumed in 1954 ) took place at a southern Sumerian site locally called Warka - the very Uruk of the Epic of Gilgamesh , the Erech of the Bible !
Adopting an excavating technique that cut a vertical shaft through all the strata , the German archaeologists of the Deutsche Orient Gesellschaft were able to see at a glance the site ’s settlement and cultural history — from the latest settlement at the top to a beginning in the 4th millennium B.C. at the bottom .
At all times since at least 3800 B.C. , it appeared , every power from Sumerian , Akkadian , Babylonian , and Assyrian to Persian , Greek , and Seleucid wanted to leave a footprint at Uruk .
Uruk , it was apparent , was a special place .
At Uruk the German archaeologists found several  firsts ’ — the first items of colored pottery baked in a kiln , the first use of a potter ’s wheel , the first objects of metal alloys , the first cylinder seals , and the first inscriptions in the pictorial predecessor of cuneiform .
Another first was a pavement made of limestone blocks , part of an unusual use of stones rather than mud bricks for construction — unusual because the stones had to be brought from mountains situated more than fifty miles to the east .
The archaeologists described some of the city ’s stone buildings as of “ monumental proportions . ”
A massive wall surrounded the city — the archaeologists found its remains over a length of more than 10 kilometers ( more than six miles ) .
It embraced the city ’s two sections — a residential one , and a sacred precinct where they discovered the earliest ziggurat ’ — a platform , raised in stages serving as a base for a temple .
By the time of its excavation it was more like an artificial mound of no less than seven strata of rebuilding .
On top , upon an artificially made platform , there stood a temple .
Called E.Anna (=  House / Abode of Anu ’ ) it is also known to archaeologists as the White Temple because - another unusual feature , a first — it was painted white ( Fig. 38 , a reconstruction ) .
Next to the E.
Anna were remains of two other temples .
One , painted red , was dedicated to the goddess In.anna ,  Anu ’s Beloved ’ ( better known by her later Akkadian name Ishtar ) .
The other standing was a temple dedicated to the goddess Ninharsag .
Without doubt , the archaeologists ’ spade brought to light the city of Gilgamesh , who had reigned there circa 2750 B.C. ( or even earlier by another chronology ) .
The archaeologists ’ finds echoed literally the very words of the Epic of Gilgamesh -
About all his toil he [ Gilgamesh ]
engraved on a stone column :
Of ramparted Uruk , of the wall he built ,
Of hallowed E.Anna , the pure sanctuary .
Behold its outer wall , which is like a copper band ,
Peer at its inner wall , which none can equal !
Gaze upon the stone platform , which is of old ;
Go up and walk around on the walls of Uruk ,
Approach the E.Anna and the dwelling of Ishtar !
Among the “ small finds ” in the 3200 - 2900 B.C. stratum were sculpted objects that were designated  The Most Prized ’ in the Iraq Museum in Baghdad - a life - size marble sculpture of a woman ’s head ( Fig. 39 ) — nicknamed “ The Lady from Uruk ” — that had once been fitted with a golden headdress and eyes made of precious stones , and a large ( more than 3 ft. high ) sculpted alabaster vase that depicted a procession of adorants bearing gifts to a goddess .
All at once , Sumer ’s art of more than 5,000 years ago matched the beauty of Greek sculpture of 2,500 years later !
Figure 39
At the southernmost part of Sumer , where the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers come together in marshlands bordering the Persian Gulf , a site locally called Abu Shahrain had attracted the attention of the British Museum as early as 1854 .
One of its experts , J. E. Taylor , reported after preliminary diggings that the effort was “ unproductive of any very important results . ”
He did bring back with him some of the “ unimportant ” finds — some mud bricks with writing on them .
Fifty years later , two French Assyriologists determined from those bricks that the site was ancient Eridu ; its name meant  House in the Faraway Built ’ , and it was Sumer ’s first city .
It took two world wars and the time in - between for the first methodical and continuous archaeological excavations to take place at the site , under the auspices of the Iraqi Directorate General of Antiquities .
As the archaeologists dug away occupation stratum after occupation stratum from the latest on top to the earliest at the bottom , they uncovered no less than seventeen levels above the first one ; they could count time backward as they kept excavating : 2500 B.C. , 2800 B.C. , 3000 B.C. , 3500 B.C.
When the spades reached the foundations of Eridu ’s first temple , the date was circa 4000 B.C. Below that , the archaeologists struck virgin mud-soil .
The city ’s original temple , which had been rebuilt time and time again , was constructed of fired mud bricks and rose upon an artificial level platform .
Its central hall was rectangular in shape , flanked on its two longer sides by a series of smaller rooms - a model of other temples in millennia to come .
At one end there was a pedestal , perhaps for a statue .
At the other end a podium created an elevated area ; the astounded excavators discovered there , at levels VI and VII , large quantities of fish bones mixed with ashes — leading to the suggestion that fish were offered there to the god .
The excavators should not have been puzzled :
The temple was dedicated to the Sumerian god E.A , whose name meant “ He Whose Home Is Waters . ”
It was he , as his autobiography and many other texts make clear , who had waded ashore from the Persian Gulf at the head of fifty Anunnaki spacemen who had come to Earth from their planet .
Customarily depicted with outpouring streams of water ( Fig. 40 ) , it was he who was the legendary Oannes .
In time — as explained in the preamble of the Atra - Hasis epic —
Ea was granted the epithet En.ki —  Lord [ of ] Earth ’ .
And it was he who had alerted Utnapishtim / Ziusudra of the coming Deluge , instructing him to build the waterproof boat and be saved .
* * *
Though wholly unintended , the unearthing of Eridu opened the way to archaeological confirmation of one of Sumer ’s most basic  myths ’ — the coming of the Anunnaki to Earth and the establishment by them of Cities of the Gods in pre-Diluvial times .
It was in 1914 that one of the early  Sumerologists ’ , Arno Poebel , made known the astounding contents of a tablet kept in a fragments - box catalogued CBS 10673′ in the collection of the Philadelphia University Museum .
Less than half preserved ( Fig. 41 ) , this remainder of the original Sumerian Deluge record provides on the obverse side the bottom part of the first three columns of text ; and turned over , it retains on the reverse the upper part of columns iv -vi .
The extant lines in the latter section relate how Ziusudra had been forewarned ( by the god Enki ) about the Deluge and the boat he was instructed to build , how the Deluge had raged for seven days and seven nights , and how the gods led by Enlil granted Ziusudra “ life , like a god ” — thus his name , “ He of Prolonged Lifedays . ”
The obverse columns I - III , however , considerably expand the tale .
The text describes the circumstances of the Deluge and the events that preceded it .
Indeed , the text harks back to the time when the Anunnaki had come to Earth and settled in the Edin — a tale that has led some to call this text The Eridu Genesis .
It was in those early days , when the Anunnaki brought  Kingship ’ down from Heaven , the text asserts ( in column ii ) that five Cities of the Gods were founded :
After the [ . . . ] of Kingship
was brought down from heaven ,
After the lofty crown and throne of kingship
were lowered from heaven ,
[ . . . ] perfected the [ . . . ] ,
[ . . . ] founded [ . . . ] cities in [ . . . ] ,
Gave them their names ,
allocated their pure places :
The first of these cities , Eridu ,
to the leader , Nudimmud , was given .
The second , Bad -Tibira , he gave to Nugig .
The third , Larak , to Pabilsag was given .
The fourth , Sippar , he gave to the hero Utu ,
The fifth , Shuruppak , to Sud was given .
The disclosure that some time after they had arrived on Earth - but long before the Deluge - the Anunnaki established five settlements is a major revelation ; that the cities ’ names , and names of their god-rulers , are stated , is quite astounding ; but what is even more amazing about this list of Cities of the Gods is that four of their sites have been found and excavated by modern archaeologists !
With the exception of Larak , whose remains have not been identified though its approximate location has been ascertained , Eridu , Bad -Tibira , Sippar , and Shuruppak have been found .
Thus , as Sumer , its cities , and its civilization have been brought back to light , not only the Deluge but events and places from before the Deluge emerged as historical reality .
Since the Mesopotamian texts assert that the Deluge devastated the Earth and all upon it , one may well ask how those cities were still extant after the Deluge .
For the answer — provided by the same Mesopotamian texts — we have to pull away the curtains of time and obscurity and reveal the full story of the Anunnaki , “ Those Who From Heaven to Earth Came . ”
As before , it will be the ancient texts themselves that will tell the story .
The Land of ‘ Eden ’
The name Shumer by which southern Mesopotamia was known in ancient times stems from Akkadian inscriptions about the kingdom of  Shumer and Akkad ’ — a geopolitical entity formed after the installation of the Semitic - speaking Sargon I ( Sharru - kin =  The Righteous King ’ ) as ruler of Greater Sumer , circa 2370 B.C.
( When the kingdom of David split up after his death to the kingdoms of Judea and Israel , the northern region was affectionately called Shomron - Little Shumer ’ . )
Stemming from the Akkadian ( and Hebrew ) verb meaning  to watch / to guard ’ , the name Shumer identified the realm as “ Land of the Watchers ” or “ Land of the Guardians ” — the gods who watch over and safeguard Mankind .
The term matched the ancient Egyptian word for  gods ’ — Neteru — which stemmed from the verb NTR and meant “ to guard , to watch over . ”
According to Egyptian lore , the Neteru came to Egypt from Ur - Ta , the  Ancient Place ’ ; their hieroglyphic symbol was a miners ’ ax .
Before Sumer & Akkad , when there were only Cities of the Gods in the land , it was called E.din —  Home / Abode of the Righteous Ones ” — the biblical Eden ; the term stemmed from the determinative Din.gir that preceded gods ’ names in Sumerian .
Meaning the  Just / Righteous Ones ’ , its pictographic depiction displayed their two - stage rocketships .
Diners are buying a new version of ordinary water for £ 1 a litre , 1,000 times more than it would cost if it came out of a tap .
Saf , a vegan restaurant in the Whole Foods department store in Kensington , London , uses a machine to turn ordinary mains supply into ionised water , which it serves in re-usable glass bottles .
According to one of Saf 's founders , Joe McCanta , the result is a highly alkaline water healthier than other waters and acidic drinks such as coffee , tea and alcohol .
Saf in Kensington , as well as its forerunner in Shoreditch , London , sells an initial litre of ionised water for £ 1 , although diners can request more bottles for free .
By comparison , 1 p buys 10 litres of tap water from Thames Water , 99.9 per cent of whose water meets European and national standards .
Coca -Cola was forced to withdraw its Dasani water in 2004 after derision greeted the news that it was little more than treated mains water from Thames Water in Sidcup .
That mishap drew parallels with an episode of the BBC comedy Only Fools and Horses in which the main character , Del Boy played by David Jason , bottled " Peckham Spring Water " from the tap in his high - rise flat .
Despite acknowledging that some people would inevitably be unimpressed with his product , Mr McCanta insisted the fee for his water – which he described as a " service charge " to cover the cost of the ionising machine and carbon filters – was good value .
Costing £ 1,200 , the ionising machine charges the mains water in two chambers , before the more alkaline water is passed through a carbon filter , which removes chlorine and other chemicals , while retaining fluoride and minerals .
Diners may also order free tap water , although the benefits of the pH 10 ionised water will be explained to them .
" A number of sustainable restaurants are charging £ 1 for a bottle of filtered water but it's not really doing anything , " Mr McCanta said .
" I can see why people think it is a scam but it 's something that 's an option , we do n't push it and we have a lot of information to back up why it 's different to the filtered option . "
While restaurants have been selling bottled water for years , the sale of filtered or otherwise treated tap water is part of a trend that is re-inventing ordinary mains or spring water as a life - affirming elixir that , it is usually hinted , bestows extra health benefits .
Indeed , far from being on the way out , the bottled market is thriving .
After a couple of years when sales fell due to the recession , bad weather and environmental concerns , the amount of bottled water drunk by Britons rose by 1.4 per cent to just over 2 billion litres last year , according to market researchers Zenith .
Natural mineral waters such as Perrier and Evian take the lion 's share of the market , 61 per cent , followed by spring water on 27 per cent .
Flushed by the industry 's recovery , Zenith estimates sales will rise by 12 per cent to 2.3 billion litres by 2014 .
Central to the revival is the message that bottled is purer than tap , and healthier than alternatives such as sugary colas .
" There is no healthier drink than bottled water – it is the ultimate thirst - quencher minus the calories , sugar or additives that other bottled drinks may have , " says the industry body , the Natural Hydration Council .
Among the new waters are Pepsi's V Water , which combines spring water , vitamins , minerals and herbal extracts " into one refreshing drink " , and comes in six flavours – De-stress , Detox , Glow , Kick , Shield , Vital V .
Also popular are lightly flavoured spa waters with fruit juices , with supermarkets and mineral water companies stocking a range of grapefruit , elderflower and peach - infused waters .
At the glossier end of the market , enterprising people have been devising ever more expensive products for the public , often with the effervescent approval of celebrities .
Bottles of Bling h2o , from Dandridge , Tennessee , for instance , come in frosted and corked limited editions with hand - applied Swarovski crystal .
Paris Hilton has been spotted drinking it .
At £ 59 per litre , Bling h2o was the most expensive of 57 bottled water brands surveyed last year by Excellent Development , a charity which provides drinking water in Africa at a cost of half a penny per litre .
Other expensive bottles were Love H20 , averaging £ 35.60 , from Wenlock Springs in Shropshire , and White Hole Springs , £ 16.73 , from the Mendip Hills in Somerset .
Simon Madrell , Excellent Development co-founder , said : " We wanted to explore the contrast between the sheer choice of waters we have in the UK , to the limited access to water experienced by the communities we work with in Africa .
At any one time a UK resident can choose from 57 bottled waters , all of them with different tastes , branding and market appeal . "
Despite the high prices charged , many people view bottled water as a rip - off .
A YouGov poll last month found that 60 per cent of UK adults saw bottled water as a waste of money , with almost three quarters of respondents ( 71 per cent ) agreeing that tap water was as clean as bottled water .
They were not asked for their views on ionised water .
Other new waters ...
* Coca -Cola launched Dasani in the UK in 2004 , neglecting to alter its US marketing strategy , which saw it labelled " bottled spunk " , a PR disaster soon topped when it was revealed to be treated water from a tap in Sidcup .
* Rather than sell boring mineral water at a mark - up , Pepsico launched a new power drink , V Water .
" Tired ?
Stressed ?
Run Down ?
V Water gets you through your day , " declared the company 's marketing campaign .
Eyewitness accounts from ships raided by Israeli commandos have cast doubt on Israel 's version of events that led to the deaths of at least nine people .
German pro-Palestinian activist Norman Paech said he had only seen wooden sticks being brandished as troops abseiled on to the deck of the ship .
Israel says its soldiers were attacked with " knives , clubs and other weapons " and opened fire in self - defence .
The raid led to widespread condemnation and the UN has called for an inquiry .
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Tuesday that Washington would support an Israeli investigation of the raid , but said it must be " prompt , impartial , credible and transparent " , as called for by the UN .
The six ships , carrying aid and campaigners , had sailed from Cyprus in a bid to break Israel 's blockade of the Gaza Strip .
Israel seized more than 670 people with the ships and deported 50 on Tuesday .
The Israeli cabinet later announced that all those still being held would be deported within 48 hours .
' Act of piracy '
Speaking as he arrived back in Berlin wrapped in a blue blanket , Mr Paech , a member of a German opposition party , said Israel 's operation " was not an act of self - defence " .
" Personally I saw two - and - a - half wooden batons that were used ...
There was really nothing else .
We never saw any knives .
" This was an attack in international waters on a peaceful mission ...
This was a clear act of piracy , " he added .
Mr Paech had been a passenger on the Turkish passenger ship Mavi Marmara where most , if not all , of the deaths occurred .
Fellow German activist Inge Hoeger said they had been on the ships " for peaceful purposes " .
" We wanted to transport aid to Gaza , " she said .
" No - one had a weapon . "
LEGALITY OF CONVOY RAID
The UN Charter on the Law of the Sea says only if a vessel is suspected to be transporting weapons , or weapons of mass destruction , can it be boarded in international waters .
Otherwise the permission of the ship 's flag carrying nation must be sought .
The charter allows for naval blockades , but the effect of the blockade on civilians must be proportionate to the effect on the military element for the blockade to be legally enforceable .
A ship trying to breach a blockade can be boarded and force may be used to stop it as long as it is " necessary and proportionate " .
The Israeli Defense Forces say soldiers acted in self - defence .
An investigation , either by the UN or by the ship 's flag - carrier Turkey , is required to find if the use of force was proportionate to a claim of self defence .

She added : " We were aware that this would not be a simple cruise across the sea to deliver the goods to Gaza .
But we did not count on this kind of brutality . "
Activist Bayram Kalyon , arriving back in Istanbul , had also been a passenger on the Mavi Marmara .
" The captain ... told us ' They are firing randomly , they are breaking the windows and entering inside .
So you should get out of here as soon as possible ' .
That was our last conversation with him . "
Meanwhile , in Nazareth , Israeli Arab MP Haneen Zuabi - who was on the flotilla - told a press conference that Israeli forces began firing while still in the helicopters hovering over the ships .
" We are calling for an international committee to investigate this tragedy , " she said .
Diplomatic sources in Ankara have said at least four of those killed were Turkish .
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the assault was a " bloody massacre " and must be punished .
He said Israel should not test Turkey 's patience .
Further criticism of Israel came from UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on Tuesday .
In an interview with the AFP news agency , he said Israel 's blockade of Gaza was responsible for the deadly raid .
" Had Israelis heeded to my call and to the call of the international community by lifting the blockade of Gaza , this tragic incident would not have happened , " he said .
Nato Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen called on Israel to release people and boats it had seized .
He spoke after an emergency meeting of Nato ambassadors in Brussels called by Turkey .
Gaza violence
Renewed violence broke out in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday , with five Palestinians reportedly killed by Israeli fire .
Two Palestinian gunmen were shot dead after crossing the border in the south of the territory , a military spokesman said .
Three more people died in an Israeli strike in the north of Gaza , according to Gaza 's emergency services .
Israel said it had carried out an air strike after two rockets were fired from Gaza .
Following the Israeli sea-born raid , Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak ordered the border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip to be opened .
The Rafah crossing has been closed since 2007 , although special medical cases are occasionally allowed through .
The Egyptian state news agency said the latest opening was to allow humanitarian aid through .
It is not clear how long it will be kept open .
The UN Security Council issued its statement after deliberating through Monday night .
AT THE SCENE
Here at Beersheva prison in the Negev Desert , in the sweltering heat , a procession of foreign diplomats and lawyers has been trying to gain access to the prisoners .
Most have been let in and so has a party from the International Red Cross .
Those who have come out have not said much more than that they have been able to see their prisoners .
Behind the blue and white 8 m - high concrete walls , more than 600 people are being held .
For how long and to what purpose is not yet clear .
Perspiring journalists can be seen scanning the Israeli newspapers , the headlines reading " Botched raid on Free Gaza Flotilla " and " Flotilla Fiasco " .
It said an investigation should be " prompt , impartial , credible and transparent " .
It also condemned the " acts " which led to the deaths .
Barbara Plett , the BBC's UN correspondent in New York , said the statement was the result of a compromise between Turkey and the US , Israel 's closest ally .
In its defence , Israel released footage showing soldiers landing on the Turkish ship and being apparently attacked .
Captain Arye Shalicar of the Israel Defense Forces , who was part of Monday 's operation , says the commandos began the raids armed with paintball guns .
" I was , myself , on one of the boats , the Israeli boats , approaching the flotilla , " he told the BBC's World Today programme .
" It is true that the Israeli commander unit ... came on board with paintball weapons ... in order to disperse [ people ] if there was violence .
They were ready for a violent ... demonstration on board the flotilla , especially on the big boat , the Marmara .
" No - one really expected that there would be such a violent outcome of what happened .
" First , you know , the soldiers tried to disperse , but in the end when they were shot at , you know when there was shooting ... from the other side , there 's no other way than turning from paint ball to live ammunition . "
The Israeli government has accused the activists of having links to Islamist groups .
HOW ISRAEL RAID UNFOLDED
The flotilla of six ships , including the Turkish ferry Mavi Marmara , was on its way from Cyprus to Gaza carrying supplies including cement , paper and water purification tablets .
HOW ISRAEL RAID UNFOLDED
As the flotilla , still in international waters , neared Gaza , Israeli commandos intercepted the boats from air and sea .
This image shows a soldier rappelling from a helicopter onto the upper deck of the ferry .
HOW ISRAEL RAID UNFOLDED
The Israelis say their soldiers were set upon and beaten with bats , chairs and metal poles as soon as they boarded the Mavi Marmara .
Activists say the soldiers attacked them first .
HOW ISRAEL RAID UNFOLDED
As the incident escalated , the Israelis used live weapons on the activists , although the exact circumstances are unclear .
This still from Turkish TV footage shows first aid being given to an injured activist .
HOW ISRAEL RAID UNFOLDED
At the end of the incident at least nine activists were dead .
Israel escorted the flotilla to the port of Ashdod and detained the protesters .

Video has emerged showing some on board the aid ship shouting anti-Jewish and radical Islamist slogans as they prepared to sail to Gaza last Friday .
The pictures , from Arabic TV , showed the campaigners in a jubilant mood .
One said she was determined either to get to Gaza or to die a martyr .
Of the 679 activists brought to the Israeli port of Ashdod , only 50 agreed to be voluntarily deported and more than 30 are being treated in hospital for their injuries , reports the BBC's Wyre Davies in Jerusalem .
That means that almost 600 people , from several countries , are still being held in detention centres across Israel and being questioned by the authorities .

One soldier was killed instantly .
The second was given emergency first aid by his fellow soldiers and taken to a nearby hospital but later died .
Lieutenant - General Hurley said the two soldiers , who were part of a foot patrol , were evacuated to the Tarin Kowt base by helicopter following the explosion .
" It was about 10 minutes out to the site and back .
" It was 38 minutes from wheels off , from the incident being announced , to the two soldiers returning to the base . "
Lieutenant - General Hurley said Monday had been " a hard day in theatre " .
" There 's a lot of troops in action and a lot going on .
" This has just been a difficult day for us . "
He said military investigators were already looking into the deaths .
" We have sent in our weapons intelligence team to conduct a technical inspection , " he said .
Asked if the NATO - led coalition was winning the almost decade long war , he said : " Bodies are n't going to tell whether you win or lose this war .
" Some good things are happening and we 're heading in the right direction . "
Lieutenant - General Hurley said it was the first time since the Vietnam war that two Australian soldiers had died in combat on the same day .
10 NATO soldiers killed In total 10 NATO soldiers were killed on Monday .
Lieutenant - General Hurley said there were no other Australian or Afghan casualties .
" However , an explosive detection dog also died in the incident , " he said .
An investigation will be held to determine the " exact details of the incident " .
" I speak for the entire ADF [ Australian Defence Force ] and Defence community when I tell you I am deeply saddened by the loss of these two brave Australian soldiers , " Lieutenant - General Hurley said .
Houston devastated Defence force chief Angus Houston in a statement read out by his deputy said he was devastated to hear about the deaths .
" Foremost in my thoughts at this time are the families of these two soldiers ... who today are suffering overwhelming shock and anguish . "
It was too early for words to provide comfort to the families of the men , but Air Chief Marshal Houston said he wanted them to know both were outstanding Australians .
" Quietly serving our nation and demonstrating every day the very best of what Aussies pride themselves on displaying to the world - courage , determination , mateship and selfless service . "
He also had a message to Australian troops still serving in Afghanistan .
" I ask you to look after and support each other .
" We will support you but I need you to make sure you seek any assistance that you may need to come to terms with your loss .
" Draw strength from one another and pay tribute to your mates . "
Air Chief Marshal Houston , who is overseas with Senator Faulkner , asked the media to respect the wish of the families not to make public the names of the dead soldiers .
Constant dangers : Faulkner
The deaths were a reminder of the constant dangers faced by Australian troops in Afghanistan , Defence Minister John Faulkner said in a statement , which was read out by Defence Personnel Minister Greg Combet .
" While all Australians will mourn along with those two families , the immensity of their grief cannot be shared , " Senator Faulkner said .
" The manner of their deaths from an insidious and indiscriminate improvised explosive device again shows the callous and truly despicable nature of our enemy . "
It was a great loss to the nation and Senator Faulkner sent his sincere condolences to the families of both men .
Seven US soldiers killed Five US soldiers were killed by an improvised explosive device ( IED ) in eastern Afghanistan , while another American died in a separate IED attack and the seventh one from small arms fire in the south , said Lieutenant Colonel Beth Robbins in Washington .
Three other NATO service members from other countries were also killed in attacks on Monday , two of whom were the Australians .
The French government announced that one of the deaths was a sergeant in the French Foreign Legion .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy " forcefully condemned this blind violence and expressed France 's determination to continue working as part of the International Security Assistance Force [ ISAF ] " , his office said .
Suicide attack on an Afghan police training centre Separately , two foreign contractors , one of them an American , were killed on Monday in a suicide attack on an Afghan police training centre in the southern city of Kandahar , the US embassy said .
Three militants armed with bombs and guns were killed in the attack .
One of the rebels detonated a bomb - filled car along the wall of the facility hoping to punch open a route for his comrades , the interior ministry said in Kabul .
The two others were shot dead by police guards , ministry spokesman Zemarai Bashary told AFP .
There was no claim of responsibility for the bombing but Afghanistan 's Taliban is leading a nearly nine - year insurgency to bring down the Western - backed government and evict foreign troops .
Elsewhere , in the southern province of Ghazni , police said five Afghan security guards were killed in two separate attacks while they were escorting NATO logistics convoys .
" There were two roadside bomb attacks against the convoys in Andar and Ab Band districts .
Three guards were killed in Andar district and two were killed in Ab Band district , " said Ghazni police chief Khial Baz Shairzai .
NATO , US and Afghan troops are preparing their biggest offensive yet against the Taliban in Kandahar province , with total foreign troop numbers in the country set to peak at 150,000 by August .
US President Barack Obama hopes the counter - insurgency strategy focused on the south can allow US troops to start withdrawing next year .
According to an AFP tally , based on one kept by the independent website icasualties.org , 245 foreign soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan so far this year .
Last year was the deadliest yet with 520 killed .
Monday 's toll was the highest for a single day since the deaths of 11 French soldiers on one day in August 2008 .
The latest deaths follow Sunday 's killings of five NATO soldiers , four of them Americans , in two separate attacks and a vehicle accident .
Plan to reintegrate Taliban fighters
In Madrid , US special envoy Richard Holbrooke said more funds for Afghanistan 's plan to reintegrate Taliban fighters who renounce violence were likely to be pledged next month at a conference in Kabul .
The July 20 conference is a follow - up to a London summit in January , when donors pledged an initial $ US140 million to a so - called Afghanistan Peace and Reconciliation Programme trust fund .
" Almost $ US200 million has been committed under a programme led by the Japanese ... and there will more developments on this at the Kabul conference , " Mr Holbrooke said .
US soldier charged with murdering civilians
In Washington a US army spokeswoman said an American soldier had been charged with the murder of three civilians in Afghanistan and four others had been implicated but not charged in the crimes .

What Is A Safecall ?
As Courtny Hopen explains at Feministing Community and at Guy ’s Guide to Feminism , Safecall is an idea drawn from the BDSM community , that could be very useful for folks who do n’t do BDSM or do not travel in BDSM circles .
I ’m often glad to see ideas from the BDSM community get a wider airing .
Some things BDSMers pioneered have already achieved a certain currency ; lots of non-BDSM folks , for example , know what safewords are , and even safesigns .
Safewords even got airtime on CSI .
Another thing BDSMers started that gets a fair amount of play in feminist discussion is explicit negotiation .
In fact , drawing on BDSM negotiating practices for non-kinksters was the subject of one of Courtny ’s previous Guy ’s Guide posts .
The machanics of a safecall are simple enough :
safecall is an arrangement that you make to check in with a trustworthy person when you ’re meeting with an acquaintance or someone new with whom you have n’t yet developed trust .
Your trustworthy person should know where you ’re going to be ( specific addresses ) , who you ’re going to be with ( real names ) , and what time (s ) you will be checking in .
If you do n’t check in , they ’ll assume something has gone wrong and will contact the local authorities .
It may or may not include a “ silent alarm . ”
Courtny explains :
For example , you could agree beforehand that “ can you please feed the cat ” means “ ‘ I ’m seriously afraid for my safety ” and that “ yeah , I picked up your mail ” means “ all clear ” .
The genesis of the idea is a personal safety measure , of course .
But nothing works in every circumstance ; and it is hard to talk about personal safety measures and rape risk management at all without creating space for victim - blamers to put yet another burden on women .
So much so , in fact , that I tend to avoid talking about it entirely .
The people who are to blame for rape are the rapists ; the people in the best position to prevent rape are really nonrapist men .
I ’ve talked about that at some length here , here and here .
So , other than to say that the individual benefit is obvious , I ’m not going to address this from the personal safety standpoint .
The implication I want to analyze is the one that I think matters from a public health standpoint , from the standpoint of restricting ( and over time revoking ) what I call rapists ’ social license to operate .
I ’ve written a ton now about Dr. David Lisak and what I ’ve termed the Predator Theory , his findings that the overwhelming majority of rapes are committed by a small percentage of men , who commit the same offense again and again , using the methods that they know they can get away with again and again : picking vulnerable targets ; usually women they know , if not very well ; testing boundaries to see which potential targets will put up the least resistance ; selecting for intoxication and often encouraging alcohol consumption to make the target more vulnerable ; and finally physically isolating the target .
Recently , Lisak explained his findings on CBS , and Amanda Hess ( who like me has followed his work closely ) has the video here .
I do n’t think we can change rapists .
They know what they are doing .
But I do think we can change the risk profile of their activities .
They do what they do the way they do it because it works .
The rapes they commit are rarely even reported ; if reported , rarely give rise to any accountability process , whether criminal , civil , community or otherwise .
When pursued , the consequences are rarely severe , and that ’s why they keep doing it .
They can .
As Jaclyn Friedman pointed out in the Hartford Courant , one big problem with victim blaming is that it lets these rapists off the hook to do it again .
So what do safecalls have to do with the risk profile that a rapist faces ?
It raises the stakes for the rapist in several important ways .
Courtny explains it like this :
One way to use safecalling to actively deter predators is simply to tell your date that you have a safecall , and that if you do n’t take ( or make ) a phone call at a prescribed time during or after the date , the police will be summoned .
Also , make sure to mention that your friend is waiting to hear that you got home safely after you leave the date .
While this may seem like the most major buzz kill on earth , it ’s something that can be explained through email before your date–and anyone who cares more about your personal safety than their own feelings will understand that .
This type of safecall is a good litmus test to see whether your date is actively on your side–a considerate ( or halfway intelligent ) date will remind you to make ( or take ) your safecalls .
It also creates a sense of dual accountability : you both have to make sure someone ’s phone is charged , make sure you ’re not too drunk to make the call , and keep track of the time on the date–and you may even bond over the shared task .
Lastly , anyone who you do n’t know very well or trust very much who protests against the idea of you keeping yourself safe is raising a big , shiny red flag .
[ Emphasis supplied . ]
I want to unpack that a little .
The first scenario that comes to mind is meeting someone for a date , but a safecall is a more flexible tool than that .
Let ’s take a common example of a woman out at a party , maybe having a few drinks , who starts talking to a guy , and the guy wants to go somewhere more to be alone together .
First , if she calls someone and sets up a safecall , getting her so drunk she passes out is a big problem .
She ca n’t make the safecall while unconscious .
And she knows she can’t , so she obviously intends to stay at least sober enough to function and make a phone call .
It is now more risky for him to roofie her or to try to get her to do several shots than it otherwise would have been .
Wherever he goes with her , someone knows who she is with ( and if he gives a fake name , that could backfire since giving a fake name tends to suggest that he had bad intentions all along ) .
That raises the risk to him .
If he rapes her , she is going to talk to someone she can rely on very soon after .
Not only does that encourage reporting , but that encourages reporting immediately after the fact , which is the toughest to explain away .
Our culture is so fucked up that no amount of prompt reporting ( or , frankly , anything else ) will ensure that a woman who reports being raped will be believed , but it does increase the chances , and therefore the risk that the rapist will face actual consequences .
Finally , just the act of setting up a safecall tells the rapist that he may have picked the wrong target : if she is willing to set up a safecall , she is likely to be willing to do other things to affirm her boundaries — like tell her friend , “ he raped me , call the police . ”
If a rapist gets the sense that he has picked too hard a target , wo n’t he just rape someone else ?
Immediately , maybe , but in the aggregate , no .
Rapists use the tactics that work ; that they know are socially defensible .
If there are counter - rape tactics that make those avenues less safe for rapists , their choices are either to rape less , or to take bigger risks .
In the latter case , more of them get caught , ostracized , or even jailed , and more of the serial rapists end up out of circulation .
In the former case , there are fewer rapes .
Either is a better outcome than the status quo .
Courtny notes that setting up a silent alarm takes away the deterent effect of a safecall , but that ’s not necessarily so .
Just telling a potential date or ride home or hookup that a safecall is in place has a deterrent effect ; but even if he is an abuser who has a gun to the victim ’s head while she makes the call , he will not necessarily know that “ please feed my cat ” is the silent alarm .
He may think he ’s defused the safecall , while in fact the police are on their way .
Right now , safecalls are mostly a BDSM community thing .
But they do not have to be .
They can be a thing that friends do for each other .
They can be something that friends set up before they split off and leave a party with potential hookups .
And eventually the national network that runs for BDSMers on an activist shoestring could be bigger and stronger and better publicized , with iterations in particular campuses and communities .
Safecalls could put rapists all over the place on notice that someone is paying attention to what they do after they leave the party .
Matt 28:18
And Jesus came and spoke to them , saying , " All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth .
19
Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit , 20 teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you ; and lo , I am with you always , even to the end of the age . "
Amen . NKJV
Jesus told His the Apostles that He would be with His church to the end of the age .
If we can determine when the end of the age we should be able to determine when the rapture is .
Matt 13:36
Then Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house .
And His disciples came to Him , saying , " Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field . "

I can't even read some of the comments down there without bile rising .
The point is not to cast a black or minority character just to stir the pot .
The point is to stop limiting ourselves to one goddamn ethnicity when casting roles like this .
Here is Peter Parker :
Loner .
Nerd .
Victim of bullies .
Loyal to his family .
Poor .
Resourceful .
Genius .
Insecure .
For a bunch of other people , here is the other criteria :
White .
You can bitch all you want about your goddamn " true to source material " bullshit , but when the chips are down you are claiming a white actor is better than a black actor for the role literally because of his skin color .
You are saying the person of a specific skin color is better than another based solely on nostalgia - no other reason .
Get pissed if that 's your only reaction .
But you 're racist .
Being white is not a crucial aspect of Peter Parker 's identity .
He has never to my knowledge been big on his family 's European heritage in the comics .
This has never been a huge plot point in the greatest stories .
He 's white mainly because he was created by two white guys .
Now , he can be any other ethnicity - it should not receive such a level of vitriol .
It 's not about saying Spider - Man should be black .
It 's that they should chose the best actor for the role , regardless of that actor 's ethnicity .
I would really love to write an exciting introduction here , but the problem is that .. well , pandas usually are too lazy to procreate , so nor do I need condoms , nor do I know anything about the condom brands .
If you have n’t read about me in my “ About ” page yet , here ’s the excerpt :
[ Pandas are .. ]
“ Usually very cute and cuddly , they usually spend their lives eating bamboo and sitting on their haunches .
Their population is very low due in part to the fact that they are too lazy to procreate . ”
See now ?
I ’ve told you .

I expected a piece of crap with a few random instruments with the Lavender Town theme in reverse , as that seems to happen when people overly apply the word " dubstep " .

Norske surrogatbabyer strandet i India
( VG Nett ) Hjerteknuserne Aron , Siren , Alexander og Mia Indira må bli i India på ubestemt tid .
Nå frykter foreldrene til Mia at de mister datteren .

Strengere regler for surrogatavtaler i utlandet gjør at det bittelille norske firkløveret ennå ikke har fått norske pass .
Christian Sørlie og ektemannen Rolf Edgar Anggong har lenge drømt om å få barn .
Løsningen for paret ble en surrogatklinikk i India , hvor en indisk surrogatmor ble befruktet med sædceller fra Rolf Edgar .
For seks uker siden kunne paret endelig sette kursen mot India og se datteren sin bli født .
De kalte henne Mia Indira .
Men få dager etter at paret hadde landet i India kom e-posten ingen av dem hadde forutsett .
- Vi fikk beskjed om at saken vår var stoppet i påvente av nye retningslinjer vedrørende anerkjennelse av farskap i utlandet .
Vi er rett og slett surrogatfast i India , fortviler Christian Sørlie .
Har du tips eller innspill ?

SURROGATMOR -DEBATTEN :
Like saker behandles ulikt
Redde for å miste datteren
Før de vordende foreldrene dro ned til India hadde de pleiet jevnlig kontakt både med Nav Utland , den norske ambassaden i Delhi og folkeregistreringskontoret hjemme i Norge .
Samtlige bekreftet ifølge Sørlie at alle papirer var i skjønneste orden .
Så enkelt skulle det vise seg at det ikke var .
Nye retningslinjer for anerkjennelse av farskap i utlandet krever nå at både surrogatmoren og hennes mann må fylle ut et skjema der de fraskriver seg foreldreretten , noe de norske parene ikke var informert om .
For den norske familien på tre begynner tiden å renne ut .
Surrogatmoren og ektemannen hennes ønsker å komme seg hjem til landsbyen sin , og Sørlie og mannen hans frykter at de ikke vil klare å få tak i dem igjen dersom de gjør dette .
- Uten signaturen deres forblir Mia Indira deres .
I slike tilfeller blir ungen statsløs og kan havne på barnehjem .
Det er forferdelig , sier Sørlie .

Får hjelp av norske myndigheter
HER ER REGLENE:Bioteknologiloven
Flere familier i samme situasjon
Til tross for jevnlig kontakt med både ambassaden i Dehli og myndighetene i Norge , aner ikke familien når de får papirene som nå er nødvendige for å bli barnets foreldre i henhold til norsk lov .
- Vi har forsøkt å få tak i skjemaet som kreves , men ingen kan svare på hvor det befinner seg i systemet og når det vil bli sendt til konsulatet her nede slik at vi får signert det .
Det er utrolig frustrerende at regelverket endres midt i prosessen uten at noen informerer oss , forteller Sørlie .
Christian Sørlie og Rolf Edgar Anggong er ikke alene om å sitte fast i Mumbai i India .
På samme hotell befinner det seg to norske foreldrepar til som også venter på et skjema ingen har kunnet svare på hvor befinner seg .
Sørlie er fortvilet .
- Datteren vår er statsløs .
Hva skjer dersom hun blir syk eller noe annet skjer ?
I henhold til norske lover er Mira Indira indisk statsborger , mens indiske myndigheter sier hun er norsk .
Vi får ikke pass til Mia Indira før dette skjemaet er fylt ut og sendt til norske myndigheter , fortviler Sørlie .
For Sørlie og partneren hans begynner situasjonen å bli vanskelig .
Flere uplanlagte uker i India er en tung økonomisk belastning å ta i tillegg til de 200.000 norske kronene som er betalt til surrogatklinikken .
Samtidig forsterker monsunen over India seg .
- Det er flom flere steder og utbrudd av flere monsunrelaterte sykdommer , forteller Sørlie .
- Sent brev til Utenriksdepartementet
Fra Barne - , likestillings og inkluderingsdepartementet ( BLD ) får VG Nett opplyst at det ikke er snakk om noen nye retningslinjer , men presiseringer av « noen vanskelige problemstillinger » rundt erkjennelse av farskap av en norsk mann i saker hvor barnet er født av utenlandsk kvinne .
Ifølge BLD ble det nye skjemaet som de norske familiene har etterspurt , sendt til Utenriksdepartementet ( UD ) og ambassaden i Delhi torsdag .
- Vi har vært opptatt av at alle som skal erklære farskap i utlandet får en forutsigbar og lik behandling .
Derfor har vi sendt et brev til Utenriksdepartementet om hvordan regelverket skal forstås .
Det er nå Utenriksdepartementet og norske utenriksstasjoner som bistår norske borgere i utlandet , sier statssekretær Henriette Wethrin i BLD i en e-post til VG Nett .
BLD ønsker ikke å kommentere saken utover dette .

- Viktig med grundig saksgang
I UD får VG Nett bekreftet at det nødvendige skjemaet er mottatt og sendt til ambassaden i Delhi .
- Skjemaene ble videresendt ambassaden så snart vi mottok dem fra BLD .
Vi har også videresendt DNA - testene .
Så snart disse mottas av ambassaden kan de fortsette saksbehandlingen etter gjeldende retningslinjer , opplyser pressevakt Marte Lerberg Kopstad i UD .
Hun kan derimot ikke love når de norske parene kan ta med seg barna hjem .
- Vi kan ikke si når prosessen blir sluttført .
Sakene prioriteres av både UD og ambassaden .
Det er viktig at saksgangen er grundig i denne type saker .
Verken Nav , UD eller BLD ønsker å uttale seg om hvorfor de norske parene ikke ble informert om at en nytt skjema var påkrevd for at de kunne få med seg barna hjem til Norge .

A classic RPG quest setup :
You need to get the Knickknack of Awesome , which is in the hands of King Bob .
In exchange for the Knickknack , Bob wants you to rescue Princess Nancy from another kingdom .
Because he'd rather not start a war , he 'd prefer if you did n't kill a bunch of prison guards in the process .
So we have a quest with loot , risk , travel , and optional goals .
If this were an old - school RPG like Fallout or Planescape Torment , then we 'd probably have many , many ways we could approach this challenge :
1 ) Sneak or scam your way into prison and free Nancy , claim the knickknack .
2 ) Murder your way into prison and free Nancy , claim the knickknack .
3 ) Swipe the knickknack outright .
4 ) Kill King Bob , then take the knickknack .
5 ) Get Nancy killed ( or kill her yourself ) and then end up having to obtain the knickknack some other way .
6 ) Kill Bob , take the knickknack , but later rescue Nancy anyway .
7 ) Kill Bob , take the knickknack , enter prison , kill Nancy .
8 ) Free Nancy on your own , then meet Bob for the first time and get the knickknack .
9 ) Bribe Bob for the knickknack with a huge sum of money .
That 's a lot of options , and players can have a lot of fun running through the game again and again , experimenting with different actions and seeing what the NPC 's have to say .
Roleplayers will approach the quest by asking themselves , " What would my character do ? "
Other players will just do whatever sounds like fun .
" Stealth mission ?
Awesome ! "
And others will just look for whatever route gives them the greatest mechanical advantage .
" If I wipe out the guards , I can make a fortune looting them ! "
The game is able to appeal to a lot of different play styles and moods .
But if we were talking about a more modern RPG like Oblivion or Fallout 3 , then this quest is likely going to be a lot less flexible .
On the back of the box the game might brag about how you 'll have all kinds of choices to solve problems the way you want , but in the end your options will boil down to :
1 ) Sneak into prison and free Nancy , claim the knickknack .
2 ) Murder your way into prison , free Nancy , claim the knickknack .
Maybe the two routes will have a good / evil bent to them , and maybe you 'll sometimes get a third option , but in general the days of inventing our own solutions to freeform quests are gone .
Usually the game world will be " hardened " against the player by making certain NPCs ( like Bob and Nancy ) invincible .
Some doors , no matter how flimsy , will be indestructible and have an unpickable lock .
And Nancy wo n't appear in the prison cell until Bob tells you to rescue her .
Now the game is less about inventing your own solutions to problems and more about just doing what you 're told .
While the newer games supposedly evolved from the older ones , they have very little in common at this point .
Usually when a genre changes radically fans will blame it on the designers " dumbing down " the game for a wider audience .
But in this case I think the culprit is technological advance : I think games have been simplified because of voice acting .
If the game is all in text , then King Bob can have dozens - maybe even hundreds - of different lines of dialog to respond to all of the possible player actions .
If the game is fully voice acted , then this is completely infeasible .
Voice acting might not be the only reason games are offering less freedom , but I think it 's a major culprit .
Going back twelve years or so you can see the trend :
The more voices we get the more linear games get , because having both at once is too danged expensive .
Freelance journalist Alexander Zaitchik wrote several stories about Glenn Beck for Salon late last year .
This February , the Daily Beast 's book imprint published John Avlon 's book , Wingnuts .
Avlon 's chapter on Glenn Beck borrows very liberally from Zaitchik 's work .
[ UPDATED ] .
Here is TDB 's excerpt of John Avlon 's ( pictured at left ) section on Glenn Beck .
The end of Avlon 's chapter is the most problematic .
Last November , Zaitchik ( pictured at right ) wrote a story for Salon called " Glenn Beck 's white nationalist fans . "
In it , Zaitchik visited white power website Stormfront.org , and pulled out several comments there about Glenn Beck .
Avlon also cites several of the very same comments about Beck from Stormfront.org — but he cites Stormfront.org itself as his source , with no indication at all that he read Zaitchik 's article three months earlier .
For example , Zaitchik :
" Glen [ sic ]
Beck can be useful , " said one frequent Stormfront contributor who posts under the name SS_marching .
" When Glen beck said ' Obama Has A Deep - Seated Hatred For White People ' he is able to reach a much wider audience than we can .
They will [ be ] predisposed to the idea and the next time Obama pushes an anti-white policy they will see it as such . "
Avlon :
Beck 's message resonates beyond Main Street and the Tea Party protests .
Down in the white - supremacy cesspool of Stormfront.org , some contributors thought they recognized a fellow traveler .
" Glen [ sic ]
Beck can be useful , " wrote SS_marching .
" When Glen beck said ‘ Obama Has A Deep - Seated Hatred For White People ' he is able to reach a much wider audience than we can .
They will [ be ] predisposed to the idea and the next time Obama pushes an anti-white policy they will see it as such . "
Zaitchik :
Later in the same discussion thread , Thor357 added : " I have talked to 6 people in two days because Glenn Beck woke them up , it 's amazing how angry they are .
They are pissing fire over Obama , this is a good thing .
Now I educate them .
If out of 100 of the Glen Beckers I keep 20 then I have won 20 more to cover my back side .
I never lost the 80 as they never were . "
Avlon :
Frequent Stormfront poster Thor357 sees Beck as a recruiting tool : " I have talked to 6 people in two days because Glenn Beck woke them up , it 's amazing how angry they are .
They are pissing fire over Obama , this is a good thing .
Now I educate them . "
Zaitchik :
Carolina Patriot , whose member picture features a kitten aiming an assassin 's rifle , was conflicted but admiring : " Every now and again when an infomercial takes the place of hunting or fishing , I 'll turn over to Glenn Beck if he 's on and watch his show .
Sometimes it is amusing , sometimes it is informed , and sometimes , I think he comes to SF [ Stormfront ] to steal show idea 's "
Avlon :
Carolina Patriot poster takes a down - home view : " Every now and again when an infomercial takes the place of hunting or fishing , I 'll turn over to Glenn Beck if he 's on and watch his show .
Sometimes it is amusing , sometimes it is informed , and sometimes , I think he comes to [ Stormfront ] to steal show ideas . "
Zaitchk 's final two sentences :
" By no means do I think [ Beck ] is aware of the racial issue , and for the moment that is ok , " wrote Stormfront member QHelios .
" He is stirring the pot , and I thank him for that . "
Avlon 's final two sentences :
QHelios gives
Beck the benefit of the doubt : " By no means do I think [ Beck ] is aware of the racial issue , and for the moment that is ok …
He is stirring the pot , and I thank him for that . "
Zaitchik included links to all of the Stormfront.org comments in his story last November .
It 's fairly obvious that Avlon just ripped off those comments from Zaitchik and then failed to cite him .
Which is , if not plagiarism , at least taking someone 's research with no credit .
Zaitchik also wrote a three - part series on Beck for Salon last September .
Avlon cites parts two and three of that series in his endnotes , indicating he pulled from them at specific points in his chapter .
He never cites part one of Zaitchik 's series , although at least one of Avlon 's paragraphs on Beck 's upbringing in Washington hews closely to a paragraph of Zaitchik's .
This could , however , be a case of two men producing similar work with similar research .
John Avlon , TDB 's senior political columnist , is clearly not in the same league as Gerald Posner , who quit The Daily Beast in February after being caught in a spectacular number of plagiarism violations .
But no one should see their work taken without credit ( as we are constantly reminded ) .
Zaitchik declined to comment to us ;
We 've emailed The Daily Beast and Avlon , and we 'll update if they respond .
UPDATE : Daily Beast PR man Andrew Kirk sent this letter in response to our post .
Last week , we reported about five actors rumored to be on the shortlist to play Peter Parker in Marc Webb ’s Spider - Man reboot .
The website io9 ran an editorial about why they did n’t want yet another white guy superhero–a sentiment I could n’t agree with more .
The people in the comments section of the editorial came up with a sixth name that should be on the list : Donald Glover ( Community , Mystery Team ) .
Glover is charismatic , funny , and age - appropriate for the role .
He ’s also a huge fan of the character .
In response , the actor / writer / comedian began a Twitter campaign for the chance to audition for the role .
Tonight # donald4spiderman became the third - highest trending topic on Twitter .
The Facebook campaign has also amassed over 3,000 fans and climbing .
For more of my thoughts on why casting Glover would make the Spider - Man reboot worth it , hit the jump .
I ’ve had trouble finding a single person who thinks that Sony ’s decision to reboot Spider - Man was a good idea .
We ’ve heard “ Oh , it will be gritty and contemporary ” this time , as if the Raimi Spider - Man movies were mindless action films .
To cast Glover or any actor who challenges the notion of what Spider - Man has been or can be would provide a reason for this reboot ’s existence , elevating it from the cynical cashgrab it currently is .
We ran an editorial last year suggesting that Will Smith would make a good Captain America .
The comments section exploded in controversy , even though there was at least some basis in the comics for a black Captain America .
I do n’t know if fans would accept a non-white Spider - Man , but I do n’t really care .
It ’s not an affirmative - action move .
It ’s asking the question : is there anything inherently white about Spider - Man ’s story ?
Yes , Stan Lee wrote Peter Parker as a white character , but is there anything about that character ’s story that would n’t work for a man of any non-white ethnicity ?
Even Glover says he should n’t be given the part outright , but I agree that he deserves the chance to at least audition .
I know studios are scared to do anything risky when it comes to an $ 80 million movie , but I ’m willing to bet there ’s going to be a lack of enthusiasm for this reboot if people do n’t see anything fresh about it .
Casting a young , talented non-white actor for Spider - Man would get people talking about what is currently a movie with no reason to exist .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Under intense pressure from President Barack Obama , BP Plc agreed on Wednesday to set up a $ 20 billion fund for damage claims from its huge Gulf of Mexico oil spill and suspended dividend payments to its shareholders .
The deal gave Obama his most tangible success since the crisis began 58 days ago and came after weeks of criticism of his handling of the disaster .
It also eased U.S. pressure on BP , whose share price has withered amid uncertainty over the spill ’s cost to the British energy giant .
Obama announced the agreement after White House officials held four hours of talks with BP executives , who emerged to offer an apology to the American people for the worst oil spill in U.S. history .
“ I do thank you for the patience that you have during this difficult time , ” BP Chairman Carl - Henric Svanberg said .
“ I hear comments sometimes that large oil companies are greedy companies who do n’t care .
But that is not the case in BP .
We care about the small people . ”
Svanberg promised to make sure damage claims are handled swiftly and fairly .
Chief Executive Tony Hayward , the public face of BP ’s response to the disaster , will appear on Thursday at a congressional hearing where he will face intense scrutiny over events leading up to the spill and BP ’s cleanup of the mess .
An April 20 explosion on an offshore rig leased by BP killed 11 workers and ruptured a deep - sea well .
The ensuing spill has fouled 120 miles of U.S. coastline , imperiled multibillion - dollar fishing and tourism industries and killed birds , sea turtles and dolphins .
“ THEY’LL NEED MORE ”
While Obama stressed the agreement would not cap BP ’s total liabilities , Wall Street appeared to cheer the small dose of clarity the deal provided , driving up the company ’s share price by 1.5 percent in New York .
Under the agreement , BP committed to pay $ 20 billion into an independently managed fund over four years , suspend dividend payments for the rest of the year and pay $ 100 million to workers idled by the six - month moratorium on deep - sea drilling that the Obama administration imposed after the spill .
The $ 20 billion figure is roughly equal to BP ’s average annual profits over the past four years .
BP is expected to report net profits of $ 18.9 billion in 2010 , according to Thomson Reuters I / B/ E/S consensus estimates .
“ We will continue to hold BP and all other responsible parties accountable , ” Obama said at the White House .
“ And I ’m absolutely confident BP will be able to meet its obligations to the Gulf Coast and to the American people . ”
The fund will be administered by Kenneth Feinberg , the Obama administration official who oversaw compensation for executives at companies that received federal bailout funds .
Obama had pressed BP to set up a fund administered by a third party after hearing first - hand complaints from Gulf Coast residents that BP ’s claims process was too complicated and the company was paying out too little money .
With thousands of Gulf Coast commercial fishermen largely idled by the spill , Louisiana shrimper Clifton Bartholomew , 21 , wondered whether $ 20 billion would be enough .
“ If you add it all up together -- everybody in shrimping , fishing , the whole industry -- by the time this is all gone I think they ’ll need more than $ 20 billion , ” Bartholomew said .
BP said in a statement it would cut three quarters of dividends , significantly reduce its investment program and sell $ 10 billion of assets to create the fund .

The commitments are harsher penalties than most investors had hoped for .
They had not expected BP to be forced to sell assets and cut investment -- moves that would curb its growth .
BP said it would cancel the first - quarter dividend due for payment on June 21 and would not declare interim dividends for the second and third quarters of 2010 .
The payouts were expected to be about $ 2.6 billion per quarter , in line with recent quarters .
“ STRONG AND VIABLE COMPANY ”
Obama stressed BP was “ a strong and viable company , and it is in all of our interests that it remain so . ”

The oil giant represents a large part of investment portfolios in Britain .
Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron talked about the issues around the spill last weekend .
BP ’s shares gyrated in volatile New York trading , dropping as much as 5 percent before swinging to positive territory on news of the agreement on the fund , known as an escrow account .
“ It ’s a step in the right direction for BP but unfortunately I cannot say the same for Tony Hayward because it is going to get tougher for him , ” said Fadel Gheit , managing director of oil and gas research at investment firm Oppenheimer & Co in New York
“ Tomorrow he ’s going to be in the hot seat under glaring lights and tremendous animosity and criticism ” at the hearing .
The BP chief executive will tell lawmakers the entire oil and natural gas industry needs to be better prepared for deepwater accidents , according to his prepared testimony .
That is an apparent response to attempts by rival oil companies to distance themselves from BP ’s disaster at a hearing on Tuesday .
As BP stock saw some relief , shares in Anadarko fell 3.69 percent and Transocean lost 3.09 percent in New York .
Anadarko is part owner of the blown - out well and Transocean owned the rig that blew up .
Back in the Gulf , BP said it started a second system to siphon oil from the leak on Wednesday , a day after a team of U.S. scientists raised their high - end estimate of the amount of crude oil flowing from the well by 50 percent to between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels per day .
An abusive Australian husband wrote down the names of his four children and demanded his wife pick which one he would kill , a Brisbane jury has been told .
Lawyers for accused murderer Susan Falls told Brisbane Supreme Court yesterday the " normal mum " from Caloundra had been subjected to more than 20 years of violence from her husband , Rodney Falls .
Mrs Falls , 42 , has pleaded not guilty to murdering her husband by lacing his dinner with crushed sleeping pills then firing two bullets into his head as he dozed in his favourite recliner at their home on May 25 , 2006 .
The shooting took place in front of two of the couple 's teenage daughters , while another daughter was also in the Nicholas Street home and the Falls ' three - year - old son slept nearby .
In opening Mrs Falls ' defence case yesterday , barrister Jeff Hunter told jurors his client did not deny she killed her husband but claimed she did so because , she said , she " just wanted to end the violence and the fear me and my girls were feeling " .
" What has happened to her to make her ... think the only way out is to drug her husband and shoot him in the head ? " he asked .
" She firmly believed sooner or later she was going to be killed [ by him ] . "
Mr Hunter said days before Mr Falls ' death , his client 's parents had been planning to visit , which had angered Mr Falls and apparently prompted him to threaten to kill one of the couple 's children .
" He actually wrote their names down on a piece of paper and forced her to pick one , " he said .
Mr Hunter said the jury would hear evidence that Mrs Falls had police serve a domestic violence order against her husband and the police officer involved in that matter warned Mrs Falls that her husband " would eventually kill her " .
The officer , Mr Hunter said , would testify that after 16 years of police work she was deeply concerned for Mrs Falls .
Mr Hunter said the officer had written a statement saying : " I told Susan if she stayed with Rodney he would eventually kill her " .
Mr Hunter said Mrs Falls believed no one could protect her from her husband , admitting : " so I just got him .
He would kill me , it was just a matter of when .
I thought that my only escape was to do what I did " .
Earlier yesterday , the trial heard that after shooting her husband Mrs Falls " parked " his dead body in front of an air conditioner for three days where it " got smelly " , before she enlisted the help of three men , who face trial alongside her .
Christopher Anthony Cummings - Creed , 25 , Anthony James Hoare , 42 , and Bradley James Coupe , 30 , have each pleaded not guilty to being an accessory after the fact to Mr Falls ' murder .
The court was told Mr Coupe and Mr Cummings - Creed disposed of the recliner chair , the gun and the clothes Mrs Falls had been wearing at the time of the killing .
Mr Hoare is accused of helping to dump Mr Falls ' body - wrapped in bedding and tarpaulin - in the Mapleton State Forest where it was found in late June 2006 .
Prosecutors told the jury that after the " cold methodical killing " Mrs Falls had created " an intricate and elaborate lie " by telling police for several weeks that her husband was missing , even going to the media in a bid to find him .
It was only in late June - four weeks after his death - she admitted she had killed him and detectives were led to his decomposed corpse .
The trial , before Justice Peter Applegarth , continues today .
Mainstream 3D gaming is coming to the masses in mere months now .

Keep in mind that this will continue to be a dynamic and organic feature , constantly changing and evolving as Nintendo offers more about the system and we get closer to its launch .
Now let 's dive in . " 3DS " is the name of Nintendo's new successor to the Nintendo DS handheld gaming platform .
The brand was originally revealed to be tentative and a project title , but the official name was locked down at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in June 2010 .
While there are several enhancements that the Nintendo 3DS brings to the current Nintendo DS form factor , the official " hook " with the 3DS will be its ability to display stereoscopic 3D effects – similar to theatrical movies such as Avatar and How to Train Your Dragon – on the screen , but without the need to wear special glasses .
Other new features include improved processing power , two camera lenses on the outside of the system ( aligned to enable 3D photography ) , an analog controller called the " Analog Circle Pad , " motion - sensing accelerometer and gyroscope , an infrared port , a " Home " button that enables users to jump between tasks in - game , and a telescoping stylus .
The system retains the internal camera , the microphone , and the touch - sensitive lower screen of the Nintendo DSi , though the resolution of the bottom screen has been increased from 256x192 to 320x240 .
The 3DS was revealed by Nintendo on March 23 , 2010 in , just prior to the North American launch of the DSi XL on March 28 , 2010 .
It was officially revealed to the masses on June 15 , 2010 at the Nokia Theater in Los Angeles , California during Nintendo's Media Briefing at the Electronic Entertainment Expo .
On September 29 , 2010 , Nintendo held a press event to reveal even more details about the device , including price , release date , and system colors .
Finally , on January 19 , 2011 , the company held one final Preview Event to discuss the system 's release date , price and initial lineup of games .
The Nintendo 3DS will make its debut on Saturday , February 26 , 2011 in Japan .
One month later , the system will launch in Europe and Australia on Friday , March 25 , 2011 .
Finally , North American gamers will be able to get their hands on the device starting on Sunday , March 27 , 2011 .
Nintendo had announced that the system would be available worldwide before the end of March , and , sure enough , it looks like that will happen on schedule .
Nintendo revealed that the 3DS will land on shelves in Japan for a price of 25,000 yen .
In North America , the manufacturer 's suggested retail price has been set at $ 249.99 .
In Europe , Nintendo choice not to announce a set price , instead leaving the pricing decision up to individual retailers .
Many major chains in that territory have priced the system between £ 219.99 and £ 229.99 .
The 3DS looks very much like an updated Nintendo DSi .
The form factor remains nearly identical , though the D - Pad has been shifted down and the stylus placement has been moved towards the rear of the unit .
Side - by - side comparisons reveal that the 3DS is slightly less wide but also slightly thicker than the original Nintendo DSi .
In all three regions , the system will come in two colors : Aqua Blue and Cosmo Black .
Before the system announcement , revealed developer hardware for the 3DS , giving us an early glimpse of the system 's use of a widescreen display on top while retaining the 4:3 display on the bottom .
Nintendo has not revealed specific details regarding the processing capabilities for the 3DS system , but expect it to well surpass the Nintendo DS in both visuals and processor capabilities .
To provide stereoscopic 3D effects the system must have the ability to render each game field twice , one for each of the player 's eyes , a technique that will require significant horsepower to produce .
Japanese company Digital Media Professional ( DMP ) revealed .
The system is using the PICA200 graphics core , a chip designed for use in mobile phones , amusement machines , and game consoles .
The architecture uses DMP 's proprietary " Maestro Technology " to achieve high quality visuals with minimal power dissipation .
Several developers that have experienced 3DS in its current form have reported , off the record , that it has processing capabilities that exceed the Nintendo Wii , and with 3D shaders they can make games that look close to current generation visuals on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 on the lower resolution screens .
Off the record information from developers working on the system have indicated that Nintendo 3DS will pack not one , but two 266MHz ARM11 CPUs , along with a 133MHz GPU , 4MBs of dedicated VRAM , 64MBs of RAM , and 1.5 GBs of flash storage .
The 3DS device is not using , a rumor that 's been floating around since 2009 .
Nintendo has revealed several first - party projects in the works , including new installments in the Animal Crossing , Mario Kart , Paper Mario , Pilotwings and Nintendogs franchises , a long - desired new sequel for the Kid Icarus series , 3D remakes of the classic Nintendo 64 titles Star Fox 64 and The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time and at least one new IP , the submarine simulator Steel Diver .
The company has officially kept quiet on the development of a new Mario platformer so far , however Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto has been quick to mention in interviews how appropriately matched the 3D display would be for Mario 's running and jumping .

In addition to those retail titles , Nintendo is also developing a variety of games and applications that will be digitally distributed to the 3DS by way of a newly - revised download shop -- along with some software that will ship pre-loaded onto the system memory .
That software includes Face Raiders , a shooting game that has you first take a picture of yourself and then challenges you to attack swarms of enemies wearing copies of your own face , and AR Games , an " augmented reality " design that uses the system 's outward - facing cameras and a set of physical playing cards to make it appear that things like dragons and Mii characters are living on your kitchen table and out to get you .
There were several more tech demos shown at the Electronic Entertainment Expo , though it 's unclear if any of those projects will be turned into final 3DS software .
Nintendo's 3DS seems to have captured the immediate attention and imagination of several of the gaming industry 's biggest third - party developers , and right from the start there 's an avalanche of well - known brands and series making an appearance on the system .
Capcom will be one of the first out of the gates with a new 3D Edition of the wildly popular Super Street Fighter IV , and two installments in the Resident Evil franchise -- Resident Evil : The Mercenaries 3D and Resident Evil : Revelations , are on the way .
Konami will be bringing an updated 3D version of the PS2 classic Metal Gear Solid 3 : Snake Eater to the portable , along with a new Pro Evolution Soccer , Contra , and Frogger games .
And Hudson Soft , now fully owned by Konami , will be contributing Bomberman , Deca Sports and a new puzzler called Nikoli's Pencil Puzzle .
Ubisoft will claim the greatest volume of titles from one company in the early - going , as it 's pledged eight different games in the launch window .
They include Tom Clancy 's Splinter Cell 3D , Tom Clancy 's Ghost Recon : Shadow Wars , Combat of Giants : Dinosaurs 3D , Rabbids Travel in Time , James Noir 's Hollywood Crimes , new installments in the Asphalt and Driver racing franchises and a new port of the classic Rayman 2 : The Great Escape .
SEGA will be sending Super Monkey Ball 3D to the system , while Sonic the Hedgehog is set to show up at some point .
Sonic 's creator , Yuji Naka , has also announced a new IP called Rodea the Sky Soldier too .
Square Enix will be represented by the next Kingdom Hearts adventure , called Kingdom Hearts 3D : Dream Drop Distance , and Tecmo Koei's Team Ninja is developing Dead or Alive Dimensions , a fighting game that includes a Metroid crossover stage featuring Nintendo 's Ridley and Samus Aran .
Altogether there are tons of third - party projects in the works , and we 'll soon be presenting a detailed guide to them all in advance of the system 's launch .
The 3DS system employs technology that sends two individual images to the left and right eyes of the player .
With each screen displaying the same image slightly off - set , the system will force your brain to interpret depth in the same way it does with natural depth perception .
There is a " sweet spot " where players must hold the system straight in front of them and at a specific distance from their eyes , and though any drift outside of the sweet spot will kill the 3D effect , it 's a wide enough range to enable a certain range of freedom .
The 3DS features a 3.5 inch widescreen display , capable of resolutions of 400 pixels wide by 240 pixels wide -- the system renders a display at 800 pixels by 240 pixels , but the display resolution is cut in half to provide the 3D effect .
Prior to the system announcement , Nintendo .
The system has a slider control on the right side of the top half of the system that can intensify or weaken the 3D effect – pushing the slider all the way down turns the stereoscopic effect off completely .
An LED indicator will light up when the 3D effect is turned on , no matter its intensity .
When the 3D effect is turned off , you will no longer need to hold the system in its " sweet spot " as the screen will only display one of the two images .
Nintendo has not revealed which company is supplying the 3D screen technology , but it 's expected that Sharp , the current provider of LCD screens for the Nintendo DS , is supplying the 3D displays for the 3DS portable .
The company revealed , just a week after Nintendo's 3DS announcement in March 2010 , its portable 3D screen technology .
Social Security woes overhyped
As President Barack Obama ’s new debt reduction commission gets under way , everyone seems in agreement that a big part of the solution has to be Social Security cuts .
But nothing could be more devastating to our present and future prosperity than to weaken this national treasure .
Advertisement
While well - intended — the rising tide of debt is a challenge to our nation — the structure and timing of this commission looks like it could be a high - powered version of a longtime Republican parlor game : whack Social Security .
Just as many on the right used the health care reform debate to attack Medicare , the same thing is now happening to Social Security .
But putting aside the political folly of making this longtime Democratic program a piñata , the facts and recent polling suggest that , instead of backing away from this signature accomplishment , it ’s time to double - down .
Social Security needs to provide the same bedrock of stability and security for the 21st century as it did for the previous century .
As the debt commission meets , our discussion about Social Security should follow three basic rules .
First , let ’s not forget the primary lesson from the health care debate :
Do n’t bargain against yourself .
We spent a year looking for bipartisan approaches .
That did n’t work .
At every step , one side stood for reduced costs and better care , while the other side spun exaggerations — even outright fabrications — instead of real proposals .
Social Security is the same .
We should n’t assume the program is on the brink of collapse just because Republicans say it is .
We should n’t begin a discussion about the issue from their faulty premises .
We must work from the facts — and from our principles .
We already know where the American people stand .
A recent poll found that 77 percent of voters say cutting the growth in Social Security spending should not be the focus of how government approaches deficits .
Second , do n’t believe the hype .
Most doomsayers who point to declining Social Security revenues intentionally ignore some basic facts .
They ignore that Social Security is fiscally responsible .
By law , it cannot spend money that it does n’t have .
And the Social Security Trust Fund now has a $ 2.5 trillion surplus that can help pay out benefits for years to come .
Without any change , Social Security could cover three - quarters of benefits until 2083 — when people born today will be 73 .
Short - term projections of Social Security are also inherently flawed .
That ’s because Social Security is funded through a payroll tax .
It brings less money in during recessions — particularly one as pronounced as this current economic crisis .
Once the economy begins to recover and people get back to work , revenues are sure to rebound .
Then we can put money back into the trust fund surplus — ensuring that Social Security will be there for generations to come .
Concerns that the baby boomer generation would push us off a demographic cliff have also been overstated .
It is true that when the baby boomers retire , each Social Security beneficiary will be supported by fewer workers than the previous generation .
But this does n’t mean the system will go bankrupt .
There will still be more than one worker to each beneficiary , and projected earnings are expected to be far higher in the decades to come .
We wo n’t be in a recession forever .
A recovering economy , combined with long - term increases in productivity , will correct the short - term revenue imbalance that some critics use to paint a distorted picture of Social Security .
We can also help improve the system once we pass sensible immigration reform .
Immigrants who pay taxes contribute to Social Security , as do their working - age children .
Both the Social Security chief actuary and the Congressional Budget Office predict that immigration could improve Social Security ’s financial picture over the long term .
Third , we should take a hard look at minor tweaks to preserve the system .
Though Social Security ’s long - term health is not the concern that critics say , this does n’t mean we should shy away from considering small , common - sense improvements .
We can make modest changes that will strengthen and protect the system for years to come .
We can also consider tapping other sources of income , like capital gains and real estate .
What we should n’t do is take rash action to dismantle a wildly successful program .
Since 1937 , Social Security has paid out more than $ 15 trillion to retirees , people with disabilities and survivors of deceased workers .
More than 50 million Americans now depend on the program for basic financial stability and security .
The real crisis is n’t Social Security ; it ’s retirement security .
Pensions and household assets lost $ 7.4 trillion between the stock market ’s softening in October 2007 and its nadir in October 2008 .
Both traditional pensions and defined contribution plans like 401 ( k ) ’s shed nearly half their value during that time .
That ’s why American retirees need Social Security now more than ever to ensure a stable source of retirement income .
There ’s no question that the future of America requires us to bring budgets into line and focus on creating an economy that puts people to work .
The old game of whack Social Security wo n’t achieve any of those goals .
At a time when middle - class Americans are struggling , we should protect and strengthen this vital lifeline .

Pressure governments to start implementing trade sanctions and arms embargos .
We call specifically on transport and dock workers and unions around the globe to :
Refuse to load / offload Israeli ships and airplanes , following the historic example set by the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union ( SATAWU ) in Durban in February 2009 and endorsed by the Maritime Union of Australia ( Western Australia ) .
The Freedom Flotilla , which was attacked in international waters in violation of international law , was carrying relief supplies that Israel has persistently prevented from entering Gaza , including medical supplies , cement and food .
Israel ’s siege is considered a form of collective punishment , a war crime under Article 33 of the Geneva Convention .
All of the relief workers and activists on board the Gaza Freedom Flotilla ships were unarmed .
In legal terms , Israel ’s military assault against the Freedom Flotilla is an act of aggression against the countries whose flags the ships were carrying ; politically , it is an assault against human decency and all people of conscience around the world who support freedom and justice .
Israel ’s impunity is the direct result of the international community ’s failure to hold it accountable for its ongoing occupation , colonisation and apartheid against the Palestinian people .
Israel ’s most recent war crimes committed in Gaza and documented in the Goldstone report as well as crimes committed in 2006 against the Lebanese people did not trigger any UN or official sanctions , entrenching Israel ’s feeling of being above the law .
In fact , Israel ’s grave violation of international law was recently rewarded when the OECD voted unanimously to accept its membership .
The BNC urges international civil society to end this deep and fatal complicity .
The BNC also welcomes and affirms the call of the UN expert on human rights Professor Richard Falk who stated , “ It is time to insist on the end of the blockade of Gaza .
The worldwide campaign of boycott , divestment , and sanctions against Israel is now a moral and political imperative , and needs to be supported and strengthened everywhere . ” [ 1 ]
The UN Security Council has , unsurprisingly , failed to hold Israel accountable for its aggression against the Gaza Freedom Flotilla .
[ 2 ]
The BNC calls upon the UN General Assembly , the European Union , the Arab League and their member states to undertake practical measures which will end Israel ’s impunity for its massive and systematic violation of international law , including by :
Immediately ending all collusion with Israel ’s unlawful blockade of the Gaza Strip and pressuring Israel ’s to guarantee unrestricted humanitarian access and freedom of movement of people and products into and out of the Gaza Strip ;
Bringing to justice all Israeli officials and military personnel who took the decision and / or implemented this latest massacre as well as earlier war crimes ;
Pressuring your government to immediately suspend arms trade with Israel , and to implement trade sanctions and arms embargos against Israel .
In particular , we call on the EU to suspend the EU - Israel Association Agreement , the Mercosur to suspend the FTA , India to reverse decision to hold negotiations around an India - Israel FTA and to stop arms deals with Israel , and Turkey to impose an arms embargo on Israel .
The BNC also calls on people of conscience and citizen groups all over the world to intensify BDS campaigns against Israel as the most effective means of holding it accountable to international law and ending its fatal impunity .

Swedish port workers to block Israeli ships and Israeli goods
Wednesday , June 2 , 2010
By Bjorn Borg
The Svenska Hamnarbetarförbundet ( Swedish Port Workers Union ) has today given notice of the blockade of all Israeli ships and cargo to and from Israel which is managed by the union members .
The blockade will be effective at .
00:00 Tuesday , June 15 and lasts until at .

Swedish Port Workers Union , which supports the Ship to Gaza , like the action to protest against the state of Israel of international law perpetrated against a convoy of peace activists and material supplies due to the People also a legal blockade suffering population of Gaza .
Swedish Port Workers Union requires that the assault are brought to justice , that international law is respected by the State of Israel and that the blockade of Gaza immediately lifted .
Swedish Port Workers '
Union would urge other unions and other organizations to take similar initiatives and calls for a general blockade of Israeli goods until the Palestinian people 's rights have been satisfied in general and in particular the blockade of Gaza lifted .

COSATU condemns Israeli state piracy , supports boycott , divestment and sanctions campaign
May 31 , 2010 -- The Congress of South African Trade Unions ( COSATU ) is outraged at the murder by Israeli commandos ' of at least 20 people -- and injuries to a further 60 -- as a result of their armed attack on a convoy of ships carrying aid to the people of Gaza last night .
COSATU sends its condolences to the families and friends of those who lost their lives and calls upon the people of the world to condemn this act of Israeli state - sponsored piracy .
The six - ship flotilla , with 750 Palestine solidarity activists from around the world on board and carrying 10,000 tonnes of aid for the people of Gaza , left Cyprus on Sunday and had been due to arrive in Gaza today .
Then , when it was about 64 km out to sea , in international waters , Israeli armed forces boarded the largest vessel and fought with those on board .
The activists say Israeli troops came on board shooting .
Israel is now reported to be towing the boats to the port of Ashdod and says it will deport the passengers from there .
The ships were bringing the people of Gaza 10,000 tonnes of badly needed concrete , toys , workbooks , chocolate , pasta and substantial medical supplies .
It was acting in accordance with international law .
COSATU fully supports the call on the international community to pressure their governments to condemn this brutal deed and hold Israel accountable for the murder of foreign civilians at sea and illegal piracy of civilian vessels carrying humanitarian aid .
The federation welcomes the decision by the government of Spain and Sweden to withdraw their ambassadors from Israel and calls upon the South African government to follow their lead .
The flotilla was an international response to the plight of the people of Gaza , following Israel 's closure of the border .
Amnesty International in their Annual Human Rights Report concluded that the siege has " deepened the ongoing humanitarian crisis .
Mass unemployment , extreme poverty , food insecurity and food price rises caused by shortages left four out of five Gazans dependent on humanitarian aid .
The scope of the blockade and statements made by Israeli officials about its purpose showed that it was being imposed as a form of collective punishment of Gazans , a flagrant violation of international law . "
The United Nations has continuously stated that only a fraction of the required aid is entering Gaza due to what it calls " the medieval siege " .
John Ging , the director of UNRWA in Gaza , has specifically expressed the need for the flotilla to enter Gaza .
The European Union 's new foreign affairs minister , Catherine Ashton , has just reiterated its call for , " an immediate , sustained and unconditional opening of crossings for the flow of humanitarian aid , commercial goods and persons to and from Gaza " .
COSATU also calls for greater support for the international boycott , divestment and sanction campaign against Israel , which is proving again to be violent and ruthless in attacking and murdering those who stand in its way .
We urge all South Africans to refuse to buy or handle any goods from Israel or have any dealings with Israeli businesses .
COSATU reaffirms its support of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to national sovereignty and the same human rights as any other people .
We demand the immediate end to the Israeli siege and the illegal occupation of the sovereign territory which has been violently seized from the Palestinian nation .
Issued by Patrick Craven ( national spokesperson ) , Congress of South African Trade Unions .
South African government 's recall of Israeli ambassador welcomed , now cut all economic and trade ties !
Issued by the Coalition for a Free Palestine
June 3 , 2010
The Coalition for a Free Palestine , as well as numerous Palestinians and Palestinian civil society organisations that we are in touch with , welcome the announcement by South Africa ’s Deputy Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Ebrahim Ebrahim of the recall of South Africa ’s ambassador from Tel Aviv .
The action was taken in protest against Israel ’s murderous attack on unarmed civilians in an aid flotilla sailing in international waters .
The recall by the South African government – as well as similar actions by other countries such as Sweden , Spain and Turkey – are an indication to the Apartheid Israeli regime that the world is no longer willing to tolerate its brutal impunity and terrorism .
The regime ’s repeated violations of international law and United Nations resolutions make a mockery of the notion of international law .
That it has not , for the past six decades , been forced to comply with the decisions of the international community in respect of its gross human rights violations , war crimes and crimes against humanity is a serious blight on the members of the United Nations .
Even when Israel attacked unarmed civilians in open waters , the United Nations Security Council could only issue a presidential statement which did not even condemn Israel for its piracy .
Deputy Minister Ebrahim ’s comments today are the clearest indication that South Africa ’s patience with the Israeli regime is running out .
As President Zuma indicated in a radio interview yesterday that if any other country had undertaken action like the attack on the aid flotilla except for Israel it would be regarded as a pariah .
We call on local people of Jewish faith not to allow the South African Zionist Federation to speak on their behalf , by attempting to obscure the truth with outright lies and hopeful fables .
No excuses , no lies , no attempts at obscuring the truth will fool the people of the world .
We are appreciative of the actions of our government over the past four days in expressing condemnation of Israel , issuing the Israeli ambassador with a demarche , recalling our ambassador from Israel , and the genuine concern and comfort they have extended to both Khadija Davids and her family .
Nevertheless , as appreciative as we are , we still remain committed in calling on our government to :
Expel the Israeli ambassador from South Africa ; Break all diplomatic ties with Israel ; Cut all economic and trade ties with Israel , in response to the call for boycotts , divestment and sanctions from over 200 Palestinian organisations ;
Shut down Mossad and Shin Bet operations and terminating the business dealings of El Al Airlines in South Africa ; Actively promote an academic boycott of Israel by ensuring that all academic links with Israel by our tertiary institutions and research organisations are severed immediately ; Prosecute all South African citizens who serve in the Israeli armed forces , as is required by the Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act , and ; Ensure that Israeli war criminals will be prosecuted if they enter South Africa – as is South Africa ’s obligation under the Rome Statute .
South Africans will not be fooled by the lies that are now being told by the South African Zionist Federation on behalf of the Israeli apartheid state and on behalf of the Israeli military which was responsible for the heinous crimes on Monday .
As a country that has experienced the Sharpeville , June 16th , Langa , and many other apartheid massacres , we have heard all these lies and guilt - soothing excuses – heavily armed soldiers fearing for their lives from activists wielding knives , or stones , or slings , etc .
We did not believe the apartheid regime then ; South Africans will not believe these recycled lies today .
We demand that the Egyptian government keeps the Rafah Crossing open indefinitely to allow free access to and the Gaza strip .
We commit ourselves to mobilise our trade union members to organise active campaigns to isolate Israel by refusing to handle goods to and from Israel .
In this regard , we salute the workers of the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union who today decided that , in the light of Israeli piracy , they will not allow any Israeli ship to unload goods at South African ports .
Activities around the country will continue in protest against Israel and its murderous actions .
A mass protest rally will take place in Soweto on Saturday at the well - known protest venue , Uncle Tom ’s Hall and the campaign to deepen the South African boycotts , divestment and sanctions campaign against Israel will be intensified .

South African Municipal Workers Union declares , every municipality an apartheid - Israel - free zone !
By the South African Municipal Workers Union
June 4 , 2010 --
At its central executive committee ( CEC ) meeting Friday , SAMWU unanimously endorsed a motion to immediately work towards every municipality in South Africa to become an Apartheid Israel free zone .
As part of the global Boycott , Disinvestment and Sanctions Campaign ( BDS ) SAMWU has agreed to engage every single municipality to ensure that there are no commercial , academic , cultural , sporting or other linkages whatsoever with the Israeli regime .
Every SAMWU branch will immediately approach municipal and water authorities to become part of the BDS campaign , and to publicly declare their solidarity with the Palestinian people .
This decision was taken in response to the appalling actions of the Israeli regime against the Palestinian people , and especially the recent military intervention against the peace flotilla that aimed to deliver humanitarian aid to the besieged people of Gaza .
The SAMWU CEC congratulated the African National Congress government for exercising diplomatic pressure on the Israeli regime but urged the government to take further steps to isolate the regime until there is a genuine independent democratic state for all the people of Palestine .
SAMWU pledged its active support to the Coalition for a Free Palestine ( CFP ) , and also congratulated its sister union , the South African Transport and Allied Workers ' Union ( SATAWU ) , for refusing to handle Israeli goods at the ports .
Finally the CEC urged all unions and civil society organisations to join in this crucial campaign , to take whatever action they can to further isolate Israeli Apartheid , and to be a positive part of the solution to the terrible humanitarian catastrophe that faces the Palestinian people .
For further comment contact Steve Faulkner , SAMWU ’s International and Equality Officer on 0828175455 .
South African Transport and Allied Workers ' Union calls for escalation of union boycotts of Israeli goods
By Zenzo Mahlangu , SATAWU general secretary
June 3 , 2010 -- The South African Transport and Allied Workers ' Union ( SATAWU ) has condemned the attack on aid ships launched by the Israeli state .
This last act of Israeli state sponsored murder left nine people dead and many others injured .
The attack which took place in international waters is nothing less than an act of international piracy .
The ships were carrying aid to the beleaguered peoples of in Gaza .
This attack and Israel ’s continued closure of the border has worsened the appalling conditions that those who live in Gaza are forced to endure .
SATAWU salutes the Swedish dock workers for their blockade of all Israeli ships .
The union calls for an escalation of the boycott of Israeli goods and call upon our fellow trade unionists not to handle them .
We call upon our members not to allow any Israeli ship to dock or unload in any South African port .
While welcoming the recall of the South African ambassador to Israel we demand that our government now cut all diplomatic ties with this murderous regime .
We welcome the worldwide condemnation of this act of piracy but note with alarm the failure of the US government once again to take decisive action against Israel .
We condemn and reject their call for an internal enquiry into the events and call upon the US government to take this opportunity to reverse its support for Israel all other repressive regimes in the Middle East .
We reaffirm our support for Palestinian national sovereignty and demand the immediate withdrawal of Israel from all occupied territory .

“ Now is the time for a strong concerted effort on the part of the international community to let the Israeli leadership know that they have completely isolated themselves with their ongoing persecution and suppression of the Palestinian people .
“ A boycott of Israeli goods produced in the illegal settlements is a good way for the international community to send a strong message to the Israeli leadership that humanity will not turn a blind eye to the injustice that is being inflicted on the Palestinian people .
“ South Coast unions have reaffirmed the South Coast Labour Council ’s long - standing policy supporting the creation of a permanent and secure Palestinian state as a necessary condition for longer term ‘ peace with justice ’ in the region .
“ In Wollongong an urgent protest will be held on Saturday to give our community an opportunity to peacefully express their anger and send a message to Israel ’s leaders . "

Australian Services Union NSW and ACT branch supports BDS campaign
ASU NSW and ACT Branch executive resolution
June 4 , 2010 --
This Executive condemns violence in all its forms .
We also condemn racism , including anti-Semitism and discrimination against individuals or people because of their race or religion .
We also believe in the importance of international law and that all countries should abide by and uphold international law to ensure the human rights of all peoples are protected and not abused or undermined .
We believe that Israel and Palestine have the right to exist as states within the borders of the 1967 UN resolution and that both states should have the right to security within their borders .
We have heard the report from the secretary on the current situation in the occupied Palestinian territories and in Gaza .
We express our deep concern at the Israeli government ’s actions which contravene international law , violate the human rights of Palestinians and work against the securing of a long - term peace .
We condemn the building of illegal settlements and a wall that goes beyond the 1967 borders .
We also condemn the use of checkpoints within the occupied territories which humiliate and severely disrupt the economic and day to day life of Palestinians .
The situation for Palestinian refugees is unacceptable and we support their right of return or just compensation .
Finally , we condemn the siege on Gaza which is having extremely serious humanitarian consequences for the 1.5 million people living in the Gaza Strip .
As we believe that international law should be upheld , we resolve to support consumer boycotts of products made in the illegal settlements , as well as consumer boycotts of companies who assist in , or profit from , the occupation of Palestinian territories .
In addition , we resolve to review our investments and divest from such companies .
We believe that it is immoral for companies to profit from the violation of international law and that no support , including economic support , should be given to the illegal settlements .
We resolve to continue to participate in these boycotts and our divestment under the banner of the international BDS movement until Israel abides by international law as detailed above .
Labor for Palestine ( USA ) condemns flotilla massacre , supports worker action to boycott Israel
By Labor for Palestine
June 7 , 2010
“ Gaza today has become the test of our universal morality and our common humanity .
During the South African anti-apartheid struggle , the world was inspired by the brave and principled actions of dockworkers unions who refused to handle South African cargo , contributing significantly to the ultimate fall of apartheid .
Today , we call on you , dockworkers unions of the world , to do the same against Israel ’s occupation and apartheid .
This is the most effective form of solidarity to end injustice and uphold universal human rights . ” – Palestinian Trade Union Movement Calls on International Dockworkers Unions to Block Loading / Offloading Israeli Ships Until Israel Complies Fully with International Law and Ends its Illegal Siege of Gaza , June 7 , 2010 [ 1 ]
As trade unionists in the United States , we join with labor bodies around the world to condemn Israel ’s May 31 armed assault on the Gaza Freedom Flotilla .
To date , these include the South African Congress of Trade Unions ; National Union of Mineworkers ( South Africa ) , Irish Congress Of Trade Unions ; Maritime Union of Australia ; New Zealand Council of Trade Unions ; International Dockworkers Council ; Confederation of Revolutionary Workers ’ Unions ( Turkey ) ; GSEE ( Greek TUC ) ; ADEDY ( Greek public sector union federation ) ; Trades Union International of Workers in the Building , Wood , Building Materials and Allied Industries ; International Federation of Journalists ; World Federation of Trade Unions ; International Trade Union Confederation ; International Transport Workers ’ Federation ; Public Services International ; Unite ( U.K. ) ; Canadian Union of Postal Workers ; Canadian Union of Public Employees ; Education International ; and US Labor Against the War .
Notwithstanding Israeli propaganda — abetted by the corporate media — the Flotilla Massacre was a premeditated act of state terrorism .
Taking place in international waters under cover of darkness , it targeted 750 unarmed volunteers from 40 countries seeking to relieve the humanitarian crisis caused by Israel ’s illegal and immoral collective punishment against the 1.5 million people in Gaza .
This criminal assault killed and wounded scores of aid workers , while abducting , jailing and deporting hundreds of survivors .
This crime against humanity only symbolizes a regime rooted in more than six decades of piracy , ethnic cleansing , racism , and apartheid against Palestinians and other indigenous people of the region .
Most immediately , it is a direct extension of the 2008/2009 Gaza massacre that killed 1400 people , most of them civilians , which has been condemned by the UN , Amnesty International , Human Rights Watch and other human rights organizations , including those that are Israeli .
That Israel ’s crimes nonetheless continue unabated is due entirely to support from its international sponsors .
In the past ten years alone , the US government — with overwhelming bipartisan support — has given Israel $ 17 billion in military aid ; over the next decade , it will give another $ 30 billion .
Thus , this attack , like Israel ’s entire war on Palestine , was carried out with US - supplied naval vessels , Apache helicopters and other weapons .
Once again , through its not - so - silent complicity , the Obama administration is letting Israel get away with murder .
Workers in this country pay a staggering human and financial price for US - Israeli war and occupation from Palestine to Afghanistan , Iraq , Pakistan and Iran .
Yet , top US labor officials — often without the knowledge or consent of union members — collaborate with the Histadrut , the segregated Zionist labor federation that defends every attack on Palestinian rights , [ 2 ] including the Flotilla Massacre .
These same leaders invest billions from our union pension and retirement funds in State of Israel Bonds .
US labor officials ’ policies directly violate the Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions ( BDS ) campaign against apartheid Israel , initiated in 2005 by Palestinian civil society — including its entire labor movement .
Inspired by the international boycott that helped topple apartheid South Africa , the campaign demands Palestinian self - determination , including an end to Israeli military occupation , the right of refugees to return , and equal rights for all throughout historic Palestine .
BDS has been endorsed by labor bodies around the world , including the trade union congresses of South Africa , Ireland , Scotland and the UK , and labor bodies in Australia , France , Canada , Norway , Catalunya , and Italy .
Just one day before the Gaza Flotilla Massacre , the University and College Union ( UK ) voted to “ sever all relations with Histadrut , and to urge other trade unions and bodies to do likewise . ” [ 3 ]
South African workers play a leading role in the BDS movement because they remember that Israel was apartheid South Africa ’s closest ally , and they agree with the observation of numerous South African freedom fighters that Israel ’s treatment of Palestinians is “ worse than apartheid . ” [ 4 ]
In February 2009 , South African and Australian dockworkers refused to handle Israeli goods and the South African Congress of Trade Unions ( COSATU ) “ call[ed ] on other workers and unions to . . . do all that is necessary to ensure that they boycott all goods to and from Israel until Palestine is free . ” [ 5 ]
In response to the Gaza Flotilla Massacre , the Swedish Port Workers Union has announced it will blockade Israeli ships and cargo from June 15 - 24 .
The South African dockers ( SAWATU ) have “ salute [d ] the Swedish dock workers for their blockade of all Israeli ships ” and “ call[ed ] for an escalation of the boycott of Israeli goods and call upon our fellow trade unionists not to handle them . ” [ 6 ]
Now , the entire Palestinian trade union movement , “ calls on dockworkers ’ unions worldwide to block Israeli maritime trade in response to Israel ’s massacre of humanitarian relief workers and activists aboard the Freedom Flotilla , until Israel complies with international law and ends its illegal blockade of Gaza . ” [ 7 ]
Israel deliberately carried out the Gaza Freedom Flotilla Massacre in order to silence opposition to its strangulation of Gaza .
But just as the 1960 Sharpeville Massacre and the 1976 Soweto Massacre spelled the ultimate doom of South African apartheid , Israel ’s attack has already had the opposite effect .
New waves of volunteers are coming forward to break the siege , which is already beginning to crack .
The BDS movement is exploding .
Already , it is clear that the Flotilla martyrs did not die in vain .
Just as labor solidarity played a critical role in toppling South African apartheid , it now has the potential to cripple Israeli apartheid .
Therefore , we urge trade unionists in the US to call on our unions , the AFL - CIO and Change to Win to condemn the Gaza Flotilla Massacre and support the international labor BDS campaign to :
1. End US military and economic aid for , and ties with , Israel .
2. Divest from State of Israel Bonds .
3. Refuse to handle Israeli goods and cargo .
4. Break ties with all Israeli state institutions , including the Histadrut .

Officials at Israel ’s controversial embassy in Oslo do n’t want to move from their current location on a busy street just behind Norway ’s Royal Palace , reports Norwegian Broadcasting ( NRK ) .
They ’ve appealed a deadline set by the city that the embassy must either move or tear down its illegal security wall within two years .
Another Israeli conflict continues to play out in Oslo , on an albeit much smaller scale than in the Middle East .
Neighbours of the embassy have been complaining for more than a decade about its wall , erected in defiance of neighbourhood protests and in violation of local zoning regulations in 1999 .
The embassy also requires constant police protection and has been the target of noisy demonstrations that have disrupted traffic and hindered access to neighbouring properties .
The neighbourhood itself is one of Oslo ’s most fashionable and historic , featuring mansions built in the 1800s .
Israel chose one of them for its embassy , leading to conflicts with its neighbours ever since .
Israel has won repeated reprieves from the city , the latest just this spring when the city allowed the embassy to remain with its wall for another two years .
City officials once again overruled neighbourhood protests , believing the Israeli Embassy officials were making “ real ” efforts to find another location with the help of Norway ’s Foreign Ministry .
The city pointed out , though , that Israel also had been earlier given more than 10 years to find new quarters , so another two years should suffice .
NRK , citing the pro-Israeli journal Karmel , reported that officials at the Israeli Embassy say they still are n’t being given enough time , and that a move will be expensive .
They told Karmel that they want to stay where they are for at least another five years .
Embassy officials have declined to comment to Norwegian media .
Embassy neighbours are frustrated , and also have appealed the city ’s two - year extension , arguing it was too long .
“ If it ’s necessary for them to have a half - meter - thick concrete wall and police surveillance when they drive in and out , then they do n’t fit in to an area with offices and residences nearby , ” Njål Høstmælingen , director of the International Law and Policy Institute next door , told NRK .
The embassy ’s appeal itself further drags out the process .
City officials said it would be considered this summer .
The city politician in charge of zoning matters , Bård Folke Fredriksen , declined immediate comment .

According to a message posted to a public mailing list dedicated to Chrome OS , a new feature is in the works that will grant users access to " legacy PC applications " through some kind of remote desktop connection process .
Google software engineer Gary Kačmarčík , who first spilled the beans on the feature , calls the process , " Chromoting . "
One of the larger questions asked by novices to the Chrome OS experience is this : Can it run Windows apps ?
Up until now , the answer has been a resolute , " no . " Google 's Chrome operating system is entirely Web - driven , in the sense that there 's nothing you can actually install into the operating system .
Chrome OS is the Chrome browser running atop a Google - customized version of Linux .
You access Web - driven applications via the browser and , though you can " install " or save these Web apps into Chrome OS , you just can't grab your average application CD , throw it in an optical drive , and expect something magical to happen .
According to a message posted to a public mailing list dedicated to Chrome OS , however , a new feature is in the works that will grant users access to " legacy PC applications " through some kind of remote desktop connection process .
Google software engineer Gary Kačmarčík , who first spilled the beans on the feature , calls the process , " Chromoting . "
Details on how Chromoting actually works are , unfortunately , scant .
" We 're adding new capabilities all the time .
With this functionality ( unofficially named " chromoting " ) , Chrome OS will not only be great platform for running modern web apps , but will also enable you to access legacy PC applications right within the browser , " wrote Kačmarčík .
" We 'll have more details to share on chromoting in the coming month . "
The current speculation amongst Chrome enthusiasts is that the Chromoting process is more akin to a VPN / sharing functionality than anything else .
In that case , one would have to leave one 's Windows - based desktop or laptop system on in order to access apps via a connected Chrome OS computer which , itself , is hardly a technological leap given that numerous applications today offer users an analogous screen - sharing / remote access functionality .
But that 's just the thing it would be a different solution entirely if Google allowed users to " map " to applications on a networked system akin to how one can assign a drive letter to a network location in Windows .
That would eliminate the overhead of remote screen - sharing and accessibility , although it still would n't address enthusiasts ' pet peeve thus far :
Having to leave their other systems on just to access applications on those systems .
" When I first read about Chromoting I was hoping it'd be something more along the lines of OnLive - i.e , the ' legacy ' programs are running on super - powerful remote machines , " wrote Mark Lunney , a Flash Developer for Glue London .
" Google could set up a pay - per-use license with the software manufactures to allow them to be used remotely , which 'd also cut piracy down .
And the thought of rendering an entire 3D scene or movie on one of Google 's supercomputers in seconds would surely be enough of a reason to get a lot of power users switching . "
Creepy , if true though ZDNet is not a fly - by - night source .
The Rudd government is getting into some very disturbing territory .
It ’s even more extreme than the EU monitoring .
Last week we were duly shocked by the discovery that the government is looking into a proposal to make ISPs retain a log of every website you ever visit .
Now it ’s coming out that they may want ISPs to link that information to other personal data like your passport number .
Ben Grubb over at ZDNet broke the original story , and yesterday followed it up with a deeper insight into the proposed scheme .
While the government is denying it would capture individual browsing histories , unnamed sources from ISPs are saying that the original data set sent to ISPs from the government said that they ’d require allied personal information , including passport numbers .
Some of you may remember our current " governator " Arnold Schwarzaneggar .
Ahnold was swept into office back in 2003 in a wave of adulation .
The " girly men " in the Democratic controlled legislature groveled at his feet .
There was talk of changing the constitution so he could be president .
He was on top of the political world .
In late 2004 , with his approval ratings running around 70 % , he announced that he was rolling back the staffing ratio law that thousands of CNA nurses had fought for 12 years to achieve .
Bad idea .
Over the next year , nurses staged over 100 demonstrations at every public appearance he made .
We followed him all over California and to Texas , New York , Ohio and Boston .
Instead of strolling in the front door like a conquering hero , he was forced to sneak in back doors , protected by a horde of bodyguards from the ( mostly ) women in scrubs .
A year later , his approval sat at 30 % .
A massively inept Democratic campaign allowed him to win re-election , but he 's never been the same since .
Now , Meg Whitman has decided to pick a fight with those same nurses .
Some people are too dumb to be let out in public .
Perhaps we get a clue why she 's so anxious to avoid unscripted events .
Here 's the history :
Ever since last fall , Whitman has been carpet bombing the California airwaves with the most expensive television campaign in state history , financed largely with her own massive wealth .
With her anti-union , anti-regulation , anti-worker rhetoric , nurses saw her as a huge threat to the quality of care we give , and ultimately to our patients .
As a fairly small union , the amount of money we can spend on politics is a drop in the ocean compared to NutMeg 's wealth .
But we do have some creative minds .
With the help of a fine actress , we created Queen Meg , a parody character representative of Whitman 's wealth , sense of entitlement and disconnect from the lives of everyday Californians .
Here 's what happened :
So the Queen has been touring California , we 've been having fun with this and so have the press .
( http://www.kcra.com/... )
The real Meg however is not amused .
Having disposed of her GOP primary opponent , her campaign has decided to declare war on us .
The themes of her attack are tiredly familiar .
We 've heard them all before from other politicians we 've upset :
Nurses really love her , it 's just the nasty union that does n't like her .
The union has brainwashed the nurses
We should n't be wasting money on politics
Our Executive Director is paid too much ( A salary that probably equals the daily interest on Meg 's fortune . )
Her campaign wrote us a letter damanding that we give her our membership list so that she could communicate directly with the nurses .
Here 's a
report :
Gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman 's campaign asked the California Nurses Association this morning for its mailing list , the Republican billionaire lambasting the union 's leadership for " partisan theatrics " and asking for direct access to its members .
Read more : http://blogs.sacbee.com/...
In the corporate world , I 'm sure that what Meg wanted , Meg got , but nurses are not so easily pushed around .
So , our leadership sent back a nice , polite letter in which we declined to share our members ' private information with her , but offered to sponsor one or more public forums in which she and her opponent could appear before large audiences of real nurses and take unscripted questions directly from them .
Whitman , who has based her campaign so far on avoiding unscripted events and open questioning , was not interested .
So , we said , " OK , you do n't want to appear with your opponent , how about all alone ? "
We offered to sponsor a forum where she alone could take questions from nurses .
We even told her we'd set up video links to statewide venues so nurses all over could hear from her directly .
No dice on that one either .
Something about unscripted questions she just does not like .
Now Meg and her surrogates are making the rounds of the far - right , union hating talk radio ranters to attack us .
All the themes I mentioned above , repeated ad nauseum .
They 're even issuing statements telling nurses what we believe :
" The nurses do believe that the union leadership has gone too far , " said Pompei .
" They do n’t agree that the money that they ’re spending , you know , $ 50,000 on a wrapped bus to follow Meg around .
They do n’t think that ’s a good use of union dues . "
So here 's the matchup :
In one corner : the richest woman in politics , and surely one of the most arrogant , armed with more money that anyone can reasonably imagine .
In the other corner : the 85,000 working nurses of the California Nurses Assn. , armed with our honesty , our knowledge , our credibility and our creativity .
Anybody want to make a bet on this one ?
A final note : While Meg Whitman as Governor may seem like a joke , she 's a joke with a whole lotta money .
And the reality of Meg Whitman as Governor of our largest state would be no joke at all .
Please support
Jerry Brown .
And for those of you on Facebook , please friend our Queen Meg :
http://www.queenmeg2010.com/
Update Here 's a good one : Geri Jenkins , one of our co-presidents , was set to go on Fox Business News this evening to talk about all this , with someone from the Whitman campaign there too .
We just got word that the Whitman campaign had backed out of doing it - think they might be starting to regret starting this fight ?
I was procrastinating on an important feature in Chennai Bus Routes and Suburban Trains Information website , contemplating numerous options on how to implement it , since I feared it can make me go over the free quota in my Google App Engine deployment .
The feature was to enable users to identify hopping / switching points to travel between localities which are not directly connected by MTC buses / suburban trains .
This planned feature was going to be a bit resource intensive – either with CPU , if done dynamically or with storage - and - CPU if it is to be indexed and synced periodically for all possible travel combination .
I decided to take the CPU route and go the indexing route later , if required .
But , Google Webmaster informed me that even without the planned feature I was already very slow compared to a majority of the websites out on the internet .
So , using PageSpeed , I looked for the culprits .
The issues , apart from loading of a CSS file with lot of unused styles and the loading of separate JS file – both served from my Google App Engine instance , was the loading of numerous third party javascript files and their dependents .
These included files from StatCounter Analytics , Google Analytics , Google Adsense ( for 3 ads ) , Google Maps and AddThis sharing widget .
So , I set about fixing the issues ..
I first removed unused CSS and JS , reduced their size and embedded them within the web page – 2 lesser requests to the server and reduced bandwidth .
Enabled memcache of full web - pages – this was useful , because for each page being loaded , Mediapartners - Google , gzip ( gfe ) , gzip ( gfe ) ( Adsense ) was making a request for the same page again within a few milliseconds .
Next , I removed AddThis and replaced it my own sharing code and icon with just Twitter , Facebook and Delicious links .
This would mean limited sharing options and no sharing stats , but I felt it was OK .
Removed StatCounter code from the main pages ( routes for locality and route details pages ) – now on , it will not be possible to easily see the sequence of pages visited , for recent visitors .
Reduced the number of Google AdSense ads from a maximum of 3 per page to just 1 – possibly lesser revenue from ads .
Increased the expiration time for static resources to 40 days – when those resources are to be changed , I will have to rename them to serve the latest files .
Delayed initializing and loading Google Map images , until the route details are requested – much better experience on slower connections and less cluttered look initially .
As a result , the page loading time came down a lot .
Google Webmaster was quick to identify the changes in Page loading time ( which was now approximately 30 % of the original value ) and the Kilobytes downloaded per day came down to 25 % of original values , though the Pages crawled per day had actually increased a little during this time , as shown in the image below ..
While I also added a new “ find hopping / switching - point ” feature , which did increase the usefulness of the website , I believe the page speed alone was responsible for better traffic ( approximately 50 % higher now ) after these changes ..
The reduced number of Adsense ads per page , down from 3 to just 1 per page , currently has a negative effect on the ad revenue , but not on the same magnitude .
I believe it will grow better again with increased traffic .
Apart from coming up higher for popular keywords , now more people are searching for variations of “ metrocommute ” .
Which means they remember and recall the name of the useful website , which they had visited sometime earlier .
Better brand recall , can mean letting go of Adsense and possibly direct CPM ads related to local travel services .
Some other options I did not look into , for improving the page speed are : Asynchronous tracking in Google Analytics , which I may take up later and reducing the actual page size ( stripping out spaces , etc. , ) – because the typical web page size is already very small , not even big enough to trigger gzip on Google App Engine .
Hope this post encourages you to look into making your website faster .
Feel free to share your tips as comments .
Maintaining MetroCommute .in is more of a fun- project for me , while I work on iFreeTools , offering a free CRM app and an Online Database Application Builder over Google App Engine .

Slyvester Stallone could not stop the bust - up which saw David Arquette dragged into the scrum
But the presence of Sylvester Stallone could not stop the bust - up at the game in Los Angeles which saw Hollywood star David Arquette dragged into the melee .
Arquette , 38 , the husband of Friends star Courteney Cox , ended up on the floor in the middle of the scrum .
The devoted Los Angeles Lakers fan , a one - time wrestling champion , rushed to the aid of a bouncer who was struggling to hold back a supporter from rushing on to the pitch to celebrate their 128-107 victory over the Phoenix Suns .
But as others waded in to help , the actor was caught in the scramble and knocked down .
Eyewitnesses described Arquette as a “ peacemaker ” and “ hero ” for his efforts .
But Arquette , who is soon to star in Scream 4 , has not commented .
Sly , 63 , who watched the match with his 11 - year - old daughter Sistine , was content to stay out of the way of the brawl .
Apple has long applied a winning strategy in marketing - create well designed products , have a dedicated fan base , and let the hype build up before every product release .
This is also the case with the latest version of their iPhone .
But what I found interesting is the term they coined - " Retina display " and the promo image accompanying it .
What made me wonder is if it was possible to turn this static image into a fully functional " Retina effect " with only jQuery and CSS .
This is exactly what we are doing today .
So grab the demo files from the button above and read on .
UPDATE : Seems
Apple folks have also liked the idea , and they 've implemented it at apple.com .
Step 1 - XHMTL
The markup for the effect is quite straightforward .
You can see that we only have a number of divs and an image .
demo.html
< div id =" main " > < div id =" iphone " > < div id =" webpage " > < img src="img/webpage.png " width = " 499 " height = " 283 " alt = " Web Page " /> < div id =" retina " ></div > </div > </div > </div >
The #iphone div displays the iphone frame .
Inside it is the #webpage div with the screenshot of the webpage .
The screenshot is actually displayed at half its original size , as we are using the same image for both the small version ( displayed in the iPhone ) and big version , which is shown in the rounded tooltip .
Lastly we have the retina div , which is rounded with CSS3 and displays the big version of the webpage screeshot as its background as it is moved around with the mouse .
Step 2 - CSS
Moving to the CSS part of the tutorial .
We are going to style the iphone , webpage and retina divs , so we make the awesome effect possible .
styles.css
#iphone { /*
The iphone frame div */ width :750 px ; height :400 px ; background:url ( 'img/iphone_4G.png ' ) no -repeat center center ; } #webpage { /*
Contains the webpage screenshot */ width :499 px ; height : 283 px ; position : absolute ; top:50 % ; left:50 % ; margin : - 141px 0 0 - 249 px ; } #retina{ /* The Retina effect */ background:url ( 'img/webpage.png ') no -repeat center center white ; border : 2 px solid white ; /* Positioned absolutely , so we can move it around */ position : absolute ; height : 180 px ; width : 180 px ; /* Hidden by default */ display : none ; /* A blank cursor , notice the default fallback */ cursor:url ( 'img/blank.cur ' ) , default ; /* CSS3 Box Shadow */ - moz-box - shadow:0 0 5 px # 777 , 0 0 10 px #aaa inset ; - webkit - box - shadow:0 0 5 px # 777 ; box - shadow:0 0 5 px # 777 , 0 0 10 px #aaa inset ; /* CSS3 rounded corners */ - moz- border -radius:90 px ; - webkit- border -radius:90 px ; border - radius :90 px ; } #retina.chrome{ /*
A special chrome version of the cursor */ cursor:url ( 'img/blank_google_chrome.cur ' ) , default ; } #main { /*
The main div */ margin : 40 px auto ; position : relative ; width : 750 px ; }
By specifying an absolute positioning on the webpage div , we can apply the vertical and horizontal centering technique , effectively putting the webpage screenshot in the middle of the iphone frame .
The retina div is also assigned an absolute positioning , so it is possible to move it in the jQuery part of the tutorial by just specifying a top and left offsets .
This div also has the webpage screenshot as its background ( in its original size ) .
Offsetting the background with the movement of the div creates the illusion that it magnifies the small screenshot below it .
The retina div also has applied a border radius with a value of exactly half its width , which turns it into a perfect circle ( at least in browsers which support the border - radius CSS3 property - Chrome , Safari , Opera & Firefox ) .
And finally we hide the mouse pointer by providing a blank cursor file ( Google Chrome fails to render completely blank cursors , so we provide a special 1 px white cursor for it - at least it is better than nothing ) .
The Opera browser completely ignores custom cursors and there are no workarounds , so users using this browser might not enjoy the full experience .
Step 3 - jQuery
If you can remember , a few months ago we did a tutorial here at Tutorialzine , in which we used jQuery to create a photoshoot effect .
This time we are using a similar technique to make the " retina effect " , as seen on Apple 's web site .
And since we have all the styling in place , it is a matter of some JavaScript coding with the help of the jQuery library .
script.js
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) {
/*
This code is executed on the document ready event */ var left = 0 , top = 0 , sizes = { retina : { width : 190 , height :190 } , webpage : { width:500 , height :283 } } , webpage = $ ( ' # webpage ' ) , offset = { left : webpage.offset ( ) .left , top : webpage.offset ( ) .top } , retina = $ ( ' #retina ' ) ; if( navigator.userAgent.indexOf( ' Chrome ' ) != -1 ) { /*
Applying a special chrome curosor , as it fails to render completely blank curosrs .
*/ retina.addClass (' chrome ' ) ; } webpage.mousemove(function(e ) { left = ( e.pageX-offset.left ) ; top = ( e.pageY-offset.top ) ; if ( retina.is ( ': not ( : animated ) : hidden ' ) ) {
/*
Fixes a bug where the retina div is not shown */ webpage.trigger(' mouseenter ' ) ; } if ( left < 0 || top < 0 || left > sizes.webpage.width || top > sizes.webpage.height ) { /*
If we are out of the bondaries of the webpage screenshot , hide the retina div */ if(!retina.is ( ' : animated ' ) ) { webpage.trigger(' mouseleave ' ) ; } return false ; } /*
Moving the retina div with the mouse ( and scrolling the background ) */ retina.css ( { left : left - sizes.retina.width/2 , top : top - sizes.retina.height/2 , backgroundPosition : '-'+( 1.6*left ) +'px -'+( 1.35 *top ) +' px ' } ) ; }).mouseleave(function ( ) { retina.stop ( true , true ).fadeOut(' fast ' ) ; }).mouseenter(function ( ) { retina.stop ( true , true ) .fadeIn( ' fast ' ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
In the mousemove function , the current coordinates of the mouse are passed as e.pageX and e.pageY , but they are absolute with relation to the document .
Subtracting the position offset of the website div , we end up with relative coordinates for the mouse , which are later used to position the retina div .
This , combined with the blank cursor we set up in the CSS part of the tutorial , creates the retina effect in pure JavaScript and CSS .
Conclusion
As the Flash / HTML5 debate heated up recently , people started looking for ways to achieve the same level of functionality that flash provides , without depending on an external plugin .
This is possible for simple interactions , but we still have to make sure that the solution is cross - browser compatible , which is sometimes rather impossible ( think of IE here ) .
Hopefully , today we made something that would easily rival an equivalent Flash solution .
What do you think ?
How would you improve this effect ?
Australia 's going all - in with its government - run fiber network .
The government has now convinced the country 's dominant telco , Telstra , to sign on with the scheme , get rid of its copper and cable lines , and transition its subscribers to the open- access national fiber program .
When the project is complete , Australia will have taken an almost unprecedented step for a country of its size : legacy telecommunications infrastructure will be almost gone .
Although Australia had planned to move forward with its AUS $ 43 billion fiber network with or without Telstra , Telstra 's decision to join the party is a significant one — the company could have held out and fought to keep its customers from defecting to fiber , setting the stage for a long platform war .
In the end , though , there just were n't many benefits to doing this ; a recent report from McKinsey and KPMG reemphasized the fact that the new fiber buildout would " accelerate the evolution of the industry , " and it would be hard to compete with open - access fiber - to - the - home on speed .
Telstra could hardly afford not to become part of Australia 's future , which is why it penned the deal with the government after a year of negotiations .
For AU$ 9 billion , Telstra agreed to transfer all of its customers away from copper and cable and onto the new fiber network ; it also opened all of its ducts and existing fiber backhaul to the government for its use .
In the end , Australia will have an open - access fiber network that reaches most homes in the country , with the rest served most by high - speed wireless ( 12 Mbps minimum ) and a few isolated places with new higher - speed satellites .
The fiber network will be run as a pure infrastructure company that leases out access to any ISP who wants it at nondiscriminatory rates , paving the way for major competition in the ISP space .
Australia 's Minister for Communications , Stephen Conroy , praised the deal by saying that Telstra 's participation will mean the government can reduce the overall cost of building out the network .
" This is an important step in the delivery of the single largest nation building infrastructure project in Australian history , which will increase national productivity and help build a stronger economy , " Conroy 's office said in a statement .
The deal is not quite done yet , as the government must first sort out binding agreements with Telstra that must then be approved by shareholders .
Once it is approved — and there 's not much reason not to be — the government will take over Telstra 's phone services , payphones , and emergency call services until the new system is in place .
From other parts of the world , regulators often watch the US telecommunications market in amazement , shocked that ISPs and phone companies so aggressively challenge every FCC decision and Congressional bill they do n't like .
Even asking Comcast to stop blocking P2P traffic was met with a lawsuit .
Indeed , it 's almost impossible to imagine something like this happening in America , with the government going to AT&T , announcing that it 's building a massive fiber network that will make the copper telephone lines obsolete , and that AT&T can join it or die a slow death in the marketplace .
( See the recent National Broadband Plan for evidence of the FCC 's almost total lack of interest in trying to spur ISPs to do big things . )
There are some good reasons for these differences , and the US market is n't like Australia 's ; fiber is more widely deployed here by companies like Verizon ( to the home ) and AT&T ( to the node ) , while widespread DOCSIS 3.0 cable systems increasingly offer 50 and 100 M bps speeds .
But it 's still not hard to watch what Australia has decided to do with something like awe ; in essence , it is making Google 's dream of high - speed , widespread , open - access fiber a reality , and it 's willing to browbeat even the largest telco in the country into compliance with the plan .
His habit of wearing a loincloth onstage earned him the nickname " Diaperman . "
But there was nothing infantile about Garry Shider 's approach to the funk .
The Plainfield native and Rock and Roll Hall of Famer , best known as the musical director of George Clinton ’s Parliament and Funkadelic bands , died today at the age of 56 , from complications arising from brain and lung cancer .
Like many funk pioneers of the ’ 70s , Shider got his start by playing in church .
As a teenager , he sang and performed in support of the Mighty Clouds Of Joy , Shirley Caesar , and other prominent gospel artists .
Years later , singing far - out funk with Parliament , that gospel spirit was still evident in his vocal performances .
He was still bringing them to church — only that church was located somewhere in deep innerspace .
Shider met George Clinton in the late ’60s at the famous Plainfield barbershop that acted as P - Funk ’s base of operations .
Shider ’s vocal and instrumental talent impressed Clinton .
After a detour to Toronto , Shider was called back to Jersey by the head honcho himself .
Over the years , Shider became one of Clinton ’s most trusted lieutenants , calling the P - Funk army to attention with his vocal on “ One Nation Under A Groove , ” and sailing bravely into the ether on “ Cosmic Slop . ”
He co-wrote some of the band 's biggest hits and , as a guitarist , he could be incredibly patient , repeating the same phrase over and over — until he combusted into a fiery solo or a stinging riff .
Guitar Player magazine featured him three times .
After playing on Funkadelic ’s “ Maggot Brain , ” Shider joined P - Funk for good in 1972 .
He contributed guitar and vocals to most P - Funk releases thereafter , including Bootsy Collins ’ solo albums .
In recent weeks , friends and fans who had learned about his illness organized a series of benefits on his behalf .
One was scheduled for the Multi Media Arts Center in Bloomfield on July 10 .
He is survived by his wife of 32 years , Linda , and mourned by the city of Plainfield and wherever the language of funk is spoken .
AG Holder calls shooting ‘ extremely regrettable ’
A cell phone video has surfaced showing a US border patrol officer shooting a Mexican boy in Ciudad Juarez .
Fourteen - year - old Sergio Adrian Hernandez Guereca was on the Mexican side of the border when he was shot and killed .
The video , obtained by CNN , captures several people running below a railroad bridge that connects the U.S. to Mexico .
An officer can be seen getting off his bicycle and moving towards the figures .
One person is apprehended by the officer on the Mexican side of the border .

Soon after , the officer is seen pointing his gun at a suspect who is standing on the Mexican side of the border .
At least two gunshots can be heard on the tape .
A third gunshot is heard moments later .
“ They ’re throwing rocks , ” can be heard in Spanish , according to CNN .
“ They hit him … they hit him , ” the witness says .
Following the shooting , US officials have been scrambling to deflect criticism and paint the dead teenager as a “ juvenile smuggler . ”
CNN noted that FBI spokesperson special agent Andrea Simmons ’ account differed from the video .
The video contradicts Simmons ’ account who said : “ This agent , who had the second subject detained on the ground , gave verbal commands to the remaining subjects to stop and retreat .
However , the subjects surrounded the agent and continued to throw rocks at him .
The agent then fired his service weapon several times , striking one subject who later died . ”

The tape does not appear to show the suspects throwing rocks .
AG Holder calls shooting ‘ extremely regrettable ’
Attorney General Eric Holder made a statement Thursday on the shooting .
CNN reported :
ADVERTISEMENT
Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday declared the fatal shooting of a Mexican teenager at the border “ extremely regrettable , ” and said the FBI was leading an investigation into the incident involving the U.S. Border Patrol .
“ Let me express our sincere regrets about the loss of life for that 14 - year - old youngster .
That was extremely regrettable , ” Holder told reporters at a Justice Department news conference .
Holder said he had seen some of the video which has surfaced showing Mexican youths retreating about the time of the shooting .
“ I ’ve only seen a bit of the tape .
I ’ve not seen it in its entirety , but that would be something that will obviously be examined as the investigation goes on .
I wo n’t say that will be a critical piece of the investigation , because we do n’t know what the dimensions of the investigation will be , but that will certainly be a part of what the investigators will look at , ” the attorney general said .
This video is from CNN.com , broadcast June 9 , 2010 .
Who would ever want federal government programs helping " minorities " or people who are " defective " in some unacceptable way ?
Government assistance , as everyone knows , should go instead to " average , good American people . "
Like the ones Pennsylvania 's Rep. Paul Kanjorski has in mind .
The 73 - year - old Democratic House member was arguing this week in a joint House - Senate conference committee session for national expansion of a government assistance program to help financially beleaguered families avoid foreclosure on their homes .
He made his case that the money was not being wasted on defective people or minorities or those who had been imprudent .
" They are not minorities , " the congressman said , " and they 're not defective , and they 're not all the things you like to insinuate that these programs are about .
These are average , good American people . "
Watch his entire statement in context below and see if you think , as some critics suggest , that the 13 - term Kanjorski 's comments were defective , which his spokesman denies .
Also , listen for one other revealing Kanjorski statement on this video .
It could probably only be uttered with a straight face in a city with the money mindset of Washington , D.C. , certainly not by many average , good American taxpayers , whoever they are .
In his pitch , Kanjorski tells Capitol Hill legislative colleagues that expanding his state 's mortgage aid program nationally would only cost " 3 lousy billion dollars . "
Now , who could ever object to such a measly sum ?

You need to read the problem first , to follow the article , so here ’s the link : http://code.google.com/codejam/contest/dashboard?c=433101#s=p0&a=0
If you ’re a hands on programmer first you might just want implement the chain without looking at the problem more extensively .
So you might end up with something like this :
// snapping // snapping boolean toggle = true ; for ( int j = 0 ; j < snaps ; j++ ) { toggle = true ; for ( int k = 0 ; k < snapperCount ; k++ ) { if ( toggle == false ) { break ; } if ( toggle == true ) { snapper [ k ] = ! snapper[k ] ; } if ( snapper[k ] == true ) { toggle = false ; } } } // we need power on all snappers boolean power = true ; for ( int j = 0 ; j < snapperCount ; j++ ) { if ( snapper[j ] == false ) { power = false ; break ; } }
This basically simulates the toggling of the switch .
Works fine .
Does solve the small input set without a problem .
The thing is , it does n't perform that good and is really ugly to read .
So it 's time to take a closer look to the different states of the snappers .
Try writing down the first couple of steps on a piece of paper .
You will notice that it 's just a binary count .
So instead of iterating you can define the output right away , I do n't have to tell you what performance benefit this will give .
So let 's do this here , with an example .
We take 4 snappers and we snap 47 times .
Ok you might notice that is the last example of the challenge , but it 's good enough .
So let 's look at the binary representation of 47 :
101111
We have to read the chain from right to left , so that we can see how far the power actually travels .
Now we have 6 digits but only 4 snappers .
So we need to truncate the top .
So we AND our binary number with our desired result .
If we get the desired number , the light 's on , if not , it 's off .
101111 ( the 47 ) 001111 ( we need 4 snappers powered on ) --------------
( AND ) 001111 ( light is on )
Let 's do snap nr. 48
110000 ( 48 snaps ) 001111 ( the 4 snappers powered )
---------- 000000 ( well , the ligh 's off now )
So let 's see how the code could look like for this way of implementing the problem
int n=4 ; int k=47 ; String needed = Integer.toBinaryString ( ( 1<<n ) -1 ) ; String current = Integer.toBinaryString ( 47 ) ; System.out.println ( " state needed : "+ needed ) ; System.out.
println ( " current state : " + current ) ; System.out.println ( " result of AND : " + Integer.toBinaryString(k & ( 1 <<n ) -1 ) ) ;
For me , with my somewhat rusted binary skills , the tricky part was to convert the decimal 4 into the four bits we need : 1111 .
To achieve this , take a 1 and shift it 4 times to the left ( the 1 << n part ) .
Then we end up with 10000 .
If we now subtract 1 we have 01111 or 1111 , exactly what we need .
With this approach you can calculate the result without stressing your CPU with loops .

Thanks to David Conrad and Ronald Bultje who committed their native VP8 video decoder to the FFmpeg codebase yesterday .
At this point , it can decode 14/17 of the VP8 test vectors that Google released during the initial open sourcing event .
Work is ongoing on those 3 non-passing samples ( missing bilinear filter ) .
Meanwhile , FFmpeg ’s optimization - obsessive personalities are hard at work optimizing the native decoder .
The current decoder is already profiled to be faster than Google / On2 ’s official libvpx .
Testing
So it falls to FATE to test this on the ridiculous diversity of platforms that FFmpeg supports .
I staged individual test specs for each of the 17 test vectors : vp8-test-vector-001 … vp8-test-vector-017 .
After the samples have propagated through to the various FATE installations , I ’ll activate the 14 test specs that are currently passing .
Initial Testing Methodology
Inspired by Ronald Bultje ’s idea , I built the latest FFmpeg - SVN with libvpx enabled .
Then I selected between the reference and native decoders as such :
$ for i in 001 002 003 004 005 006 007 008 009 \ 010 011 012 013 014 015 016 017 do echo vp80-00-comprehensive-${i}.ivf ffmpeg -vcodec libvpx - i \ / path/to/vp8-test-vectors-r1/vp80-00-comprehensive-${i}.ivf \ -f framemd5 - 2 > / dev/ null done > refs.txt $ for i in 001 002 003 004 005 006 007 008 009 \ 010 011 012 013 014 015 016 017 do echo vp80-00-comprehensive-${i}.ivf ffmpeg -vcodec vp8 - i \ / path/to/vp8-test-vectors-r1/vp80-00-comprehensive-${i}.ivf \ -f framemd5 - 2 > / dev / null done > native.
txt $ diff -u refs.

That reveals precisely which files differ .
If you 're looking for the Armageddon version of net neutrality analysis , search no further than a new study released by New York Law School 's Advanced Communications Law & Policy Institute .
The assessment , titled Net Neutrality , Investment & Jobs , damns the Federal Communications Commission 's proposed net neutrality rules as " destabilizing " and suggests they could " place the nation 's economy at even greater risk . "
The passage of such rules " could have devastating impacts across the ecosystem between 2010 and 2015 , " warn authors Charles M. Davidson and Bret T. Swanson .
The assessment comes as the FCC released a Notice of Inquiry on its new Open Internet proposals on Thursday , and AT&T's threat that such proposals could cause it to downgrade its investment in its U - Verse IP - video network .
How devastating would this impact be ?
The paper claims that wireless and wireline broadband could suffer huge investment losses as a consequence of the rules .
A ten percent drop in investment could rob the United States of 502,000 jobs with a $ 62 billion impact on its Gross Domestic Product .
Three times that decline could punish the economy with a loss of 604,000 jobs and $ 80 billion in GDP loss .
" Despite FCC assertions to the contrary , history suggests that the Commission is incapable of micromanaging a dynamic sector via regulatory fiat and that such action results in consumer welfare and economic losses , " the study asserts .
Apocalypse times three
Ars readers who dislike the dispassionate tone associated with most economics papers will find this one refreshing .
Its subheadings include the following : " Apocalypse Now ?
Assessing the Impact of Proposed Net Neutrality Rules on Investment & Jobs in the Broadband Ecosystem . "
The question , of course , is how the study 's authors came up with those half - a- million job - loss estimates .
First , the agency 's proposals could block " voluntary partnerships and transactions with upstream providers of content , applications , and services , " the document warns .
Indeed the FCC 's net neutrality plan , as released late last year , worried out loud where the freedom to cut these kind of deals could go .
" A broadband Internet access service provider that is also a pay television provider could charge providers or end users more to transmit or receive video programming over the Internet in order to protect the broadband Internet access service provider 's own pay television service , " the document speculated .
" Alternatively , such a broadband Internet access service provider could seek to protect its pay television service by degrading the performance of video programming delivered over the Internet by third parties . "
But Net Neutrality , Investment , and Jobs argues that as more video watching migrates to the Web , companies and investors will need to find " new hybrid business models to successfully manage this historic transition . "
Internet video does n't pay yet , the paper contends .
Video accounts for 73 percent of consumer Internet traffic , but just 8 percent of consumer Internet revenue .
So new revenue models will have to be found — a prospect supposedly foreclosed by the agency 's proposed rules .
Second , net neutrality could block needed Quality of Service techniques to manage user traffic , especially when it comes to handling latency - sensitive services and video .
The survey notes the ongoing AT&T / iPhone network traffic malaise , then quotes a sympathetic assessment of the problem :
Unless a long - term plan is put in place that addresses and manages the traffic at a very granular level , the cost incurred due to an explosive demand will become unsustainable by 2013 .
At that point the revenue being generated could fall below the cost of sustaining such traffic .
However , if the operators attack the problem using several different strategies , the growth can be managed and brought in line with the technology evolution such that the industry can take advantage of the falling per megabit costs .
Restricting experimentation on business models for network management " would exacerbate existing problems and allow a tiny number of users and applications to completely dominate the network , degrading service and value for other users , " the report fears .
And if various cybersecurity technologies which employ network management are also hamstrung , " then these technologies will become vastly more expensive to deploy and will therefore be less widely used . "
Negative shocks
So how does the study extrapolate half - a- million jobs from these negative prospects ?
It takes existing projections of broadband related job growth , then plugs in the " negative shock " of net neutrality rules along four percentage tiers of possible investment decline : ten percent , twenty , third , and a " severe wireless drop . "
Bottom line : the prospect of 100,000 to 200,000 lost jobs each year over the next five years , with negative ripple effects in the healthcare and energy sectors .
Why would those seemingly nice people at the FCC put the nation in such economic jeopardy ?
In the face of overwhelming industry opposition to the Commission 's Open Internet proposals , the Commission has " panicked , " the report asserts , and is now resorting to the implementation of " century - old common carrier requirements " on broadband .
" Such actions reflect only a selfish determination to consolidate regulatory power within an agency that has proven time and again to be incapable of micromanaging a dynamic sector like broadband , " the report concludes .

Opinion
The plot for Fox News North , the tag applied to Quebecor 's new Sun Media news channel , was hatched at a lunch Prime Minister Stephen Harper had with Rupert Murdoch and Roger Ailes in New York on March 30 , 2009 , according to The Canadian Press .
Australian media billionaire Murdoch owns Fox News ; Ailes , a brass - knuckle Republican strategist , is its president .
Ailes authored the infamous Willie Horton ads that destroyed Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidential election .
Described by fellow Bush aide Lee Atwater as having " two speeds -- attack and destroy , " Ailes once told a Time reporter : " The only question is whether we depict Willie Horton with a knife in his hand or without it . "
As a producer for Rush Limbaugh 's short - lived TV show , Ailes was fond of calling Bill Clinton " the hippie president " and lashing out at " liberal bigots . "
The lunch was not on any public itinerary released by the PMO and only came to light through a search of former president George Bush 's press secretary Ari Fleischer 's mandatory disclosures with the U.S. Justice Department , CP's Bruce Cheadle reported June 14 .
Also at the lunch was Harper 's communications director , Kory Teneycke , whose prior jobs were with the Mike Harris Conservatives in Ontario , the Reform Party and the Saskatchewan Party .
He left the PMO a year ago to accept a contract with Quebecor to explore a Fox News - type channel for Canada .
Teneycke currently directs the political coverage offered by Sun Media , the second largest newspaper chain in the country .
He told CP the Quebecor venture was not discussed at the New York lunch .
And all Harper 's current communications director , Dimitri Soudas , would say about the meeting was that " the prime minister meets with a wide range of people . "
The Harper - Murdoch - Ailes lunch and the putative right - wing political attack news channel is more evidence , as if Canadians need any , of the Harper Conservatives ' determination to be the northern branch plant of today 's Republican Party -- bruisingly partisan , all the time .
They do n't accept that this is why they can't budge their polling numbers above the low thirties .
Politics this raw is foreign to Canadians and rubs them the wrong way .
We like peace , order and good government , not daily shouting matches .
The Conservatives have a permanent tin ear to Canadian political structures and sensibilities .
The longer Harper is prime minister , the more he demonstrates that he either does n't understand , or is contemptuous of , parliamentary government .
He operates as though he is the U.S. president and Parliament is the separate U.S. Congress .
He works around , not with , Parliament .
He ignores , scorns or shuts it down whenever it gets in his way .
He pursues ways of making it dysfunctional , as in his 100 - page memo to MPs on how to disrupt parliamentary committees and his recent refusal to allow political staff to obey summonses to answer questions at committees .
He consults his political opponents rarely and spurns them routinely .
When he is rebuked by parliamentary officers , he disparages and ignores them .
The penultimate indication that Harper does n't understand the parliamentary system came in his comment that " losers do n't get to form coalitions . "
Several commentators had a field day pointing out that two of Harper 's fastest political friends -- current conservative Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former conservative Australian prime minister John Howard -- both took office with less support than their leftist rivals by forming coalitions with other right - of - centre parties .
Howard took power in 1998 with only 34 per cent of the vote , well behind the winning Australian Labour Party with 40 per cent , by forming a coalition with the National Party of Australia , who captured just 5.29 per cent of the vote .
Harper is n't alone in not fathoming Parliament because of his preferences for American forms .
Former Conservative strategist Tom Flanagan argues in a recent column that the Liberals and NDP could only form a coalition after the next election if they win an absolute majority of seats between the two of them .
A plurality of seats over the Conservatives would n't be enough , Flanagan claims , because they would still have to involve the Bloc Québécois in governing .
That 's not accurate .
The Bloc could vote with the two parties to bring down the Conservatives ; or it could abstain .
And , unless the Conservatives themselves were prepared to partner with the Bloc -- as Harper was in 2004 -- the Governor General could call on the Liberals and NDP alone to form a government .
After four years in office , it 's time Harper and his Conservatives accept they are n't in the U.S. , respect Canadian values and govern Canada according to Canadian institutions , forms and traditions .

A bipartisan commission of defense experts has released a plan that would reduce the US ’s defense spending by nearly $ 1 trillion over 10 years — a plan sure to gather support from progressives and libertarians , but unlikely to pass through Congress .
The commission ’s report comes at a time when public concern about the US ’s national debt has hit a fever pitch , and the claim that nearly $ 1 trillion can be saved from defense spending will certainly color future debates about what government services to cut .

The Sustainable Defense Task Force , put together at the behest of Rep. Barney Frank ( D - MA ) to “ explore options for reducing the defense budgetÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s contribution to the federal deficit without compromising the essential security of the US , ” recommends saving $ 200 billion by reducing the presence of US troops in Western Europe and the Far East , and reducing total troop strength to 1.3 million .
The report ( PDF ) also recommends eliminating “ costly and unworkable weapons systems , ” for a savings of $ 130 billion , and reducing the US ’s nuclear arsenal to 1,050 warheads , for a savings of $ 113 billion .
The commission , which includes members from conservative groups such as the Cato Institute and from liberal groups such as the Center for American Progress , also recommended “ a strategy of restraint that would emphasize the ability to bring force from the sea to defeat and deter enemies rather than putting large numbers of troops ashore in extended operations . ”
In all , the savings are expected to total $ 960 billion .
Rep .
Frank joined libertarian Texas Republican Ron Paul and a number of other legislators to release the report Friday .

Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ With our nation staring down the barrel of record deficits , the Pentagon budgetÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s explosive growth is unsustainable , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â task force member Laura Peterson , of Taxpayers for Common Sense , said in a press release .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ ThereÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s plenty of fat to cut from the military budget without compromising our safety .
In fact , military and political leaders agree that economic stability is vital to our national security .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
But despite the political appeal of lower deficits , Spencer Ackerman at the Washington Independent suggests the commission ’s proposals wo n’t become law because “ [ f ] ew communities of Washington wonks run into greater structural and institutional obstacles than advocates of reduced defense spending . ”
Writes Ackerman :
Defense companies put billions into PR campaigns for the necessity of this or that project that runs over cost .
Legislators have every career incentive to lard the defense budget with job - creating bloat for their districts .
The media treats civilian and military spending as two entirely different entities , with military spending emerging from a magical , never - ending fountain of cash .
And then thereÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s the general jingoism that equates curbed defense spending with a deficit of patriotism .
ADVERTISEMENT
Writing at FireDogLake , David Dayen also doubts the recommendations will ever be enacted , but notes that “ having this debate out in the open is important .
At least a small sliver of official Washington does nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t consider military spending magical spending that has no cost to the bottom line . ”
Including the cost of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , The US defense budget for fiscal year 2011 is $ 708 billion , up from $ 691 billion the year before .
When other defense - related costs — such as aiding domestic counter - terrorism operations and providing veterans ’ health care — are added , defense costs this year exceed $ 1 trillion .

A program to cut $ 960 billion from defense spending over 10 years would see about $ 96 billion cut from defense spending , on average , per year .

Free-spending “ Real Housewives of New Jersey ” diva Teresa Giudice and her husband , Joe , make just $ 79,000 a year and are up to their tanned necks in liens , foreclosures and unpaid bills , according to bankruptcy papers filed in Newark federal court .
The Giudices say they owe creditors $ 10,853,648.04 .
Teresa , known for her lust for designer clothes and expensive bling on the Bravo show , owes nearly $ 20,000 on credit cards for Bloomingdale ’s , Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus .
In total , the Giudices show $ 104,000 in debt on at least eight credit cards .

Guess who has another Apple scoop ?
Tinhte , the upstarts from Vietnam have first pics of the mythical iPod touch with a camera .
The " DVT - 1 " stamp on the back makes it clear that this is an early design verification test unit in the evolution of product testing .
In other words , this might not be the final design whenever Apple chooses to announce it , say , on June 7th .
A check of the device 's serial number identifies a late 2009 third generation iPod touch -- could be that this device was one of those eBay prototypes that never made it to production for whatever reason
The Foxconn manufactured device is also running the same base diagnostic utility that we 've seen before ( who could forget that " serial number " icon ) .
The Foxconn label appears to indicate a 64GB model ( " 64G " using a pair of Samsung 32 GB Flash modules presumably ) in addition to a 2 megapixel , backside illuminated sensor manufactured by Omnivision ( part OV2665 - 6s ) .

( AP ) --
A showdown looms this week over the 25 - year ban on commercial whaling :
Should it be eased , which might mean fewer whales are killed ?
Or should it remain - leaving Japan , Norway and Iceland to hunt down as many whales as they want ?
The International Whaling Commission begins a five - day meeting Monday in Morocco 's Atlantic Ocean resort of Agadir - arguably its most important gathering since 1986 , when a moratorium on commercial whaling halted the factory - style slaughter of tens of thousands of animals every year .
A compromise that would suspend the whaling ban has been drafted by the agency 's chairman , but it's an unhappy option for nations that abhor whaling .
The deal would legitimize commercial hunting in exchange for a drop in the number of whales actually killed by those claiming exemptions to the ban - Japan , Norway and Iceland .
The proposal , the agency says , would end the wildcat whaling that still kills up to 2,000 whales a year , including species on the verge of extinction .
Japan 's unrestricted whale hunt , allegedly for " scientific research , " currently sends more whale meat to sushi bars than laboratories .
Since the ban took place , about 33,600 whales have been killed , according to the Animal Welfare Institute in Washington .
The 88 - nation whaling commission also hopes to dispel what its chairman calls an " atmosphere of confrontation and mistrust " that has frozen the agency 's work for decades , and to reaffirm its relevance as a regulatory force .
The IWC " is fundamentally broken and must be fixed , " the chief U.S. negotiator , Monica Median , told reporters earlier this year .
IWC Chairman Cristian Maquieira published his proposal in April to bring the three whaling nations back under the agency 's control by allowing them to hunt commercially under closely monitored quotas .
Advocates say 5,000 whales will be saved over the 10 - year life of the deal .
Opponents question that claim , and say the proposal would legitimize hunting for profit and throw a lifeline to a dying industry that has constant confrontations with environmental groups on the world 's oceans .
" The points of view differ a lot , " Marie - Josee Jenniskens , head of the Netherlands ' delegation , told The Associated Press .
" I wish I could be more optimistic . "
She said Maquieira 's original compromise was being modified and a new draft was likely to be unveiled Monday .
Maquieira himself is not attending due to illness , and the convention will be chaired by his deputy , Anthony Liverpool of Antigua and Barbuda .
Maquieira says his proposal tried to strike " a delicate balance " that admittedly will satisfy no one .
Under it , Japan would be allowed to hunt in the Antarctic Whale Sanctuary , officially declared a no - go zone in 1994 but where Japanese whaling ships haul most of their catch now anyway .
The draft says the quotas would involve a " significant reduction " from today 's levels but leaves open the question whether whale meat and other whale products can be traded internationally .
Objections to the draft have been swift and firm .
" The Australian government cannot accept this proposal as it currently stands , " Environment Protection Minister Peter Garrett said .
Australia has already launched a complaint against Japanese whaling at the International Court of Justice in The Hague , the U.N. 's highest court .
The German parliament urged its government to reject the proposal , saying " we can only guess at how fatal the consequences will be for marine ecosystems . "
The United States also has voiced reservations , especially over the number of whales the three countries will be allowed to hunt .
Conservationists say the catch quotas must be based on scientific evaluations of whale populations rather than on recent catches .
" The quotas have more to do with political science than biological science , " said Patrick Ramage of the International Fund for Animal Welfare .
Ramage is worried that the U.S. is too anxious for a deal , partly because Washington fears Japan could veto the approved catch by Alaskan Inuit hunters , which falls under a clause allowing Aboriginal subsistence whaling .
" There has been decades of steady progress in conservation .
All of that is threatened with reversal by a politically expedient proposal that some governments are trying to rush through , " Ramage said .
Several environmental groups said they would favor a deal only if endangered species are excluded from the hunt , whaling is stopped in the Antarctic sanctuary , trade in whale products is outlawed and no country is exempt .
" If we leave Agadir with no decision , that is not a victory , because we are not doing what the whales need , " said Susan Lieberman of the Pew Environment Group .
WWF said a compromise was clearly needed to end the exemptions claimed by the three nations and bring whaling back under the commission 's control .
" But we will not support a compromise at any cost , " said WWF 's Wendy Elliott .
" The IWC is at a crossroads , and the integrity of the commission is in the balance . "

The Sun comes back to life
30/03/2010 2504 views 6 likes
After the most profound lull in solar activity for nearly a century , the Sun is finally coming back to life .
But will the solar activity return to previous levels ?
ESA ’s venerable solar watchdog SOHO is there , watching and measuring , providing unique information about our nearest star .
It was the perfect Christmas present for solar physicists .
In mid-December 2009 , the largest group of sunspots to emerge for several years manifested itself on the solar surface .
It occurred just as some solar physicists were beginning to wonder if large sunspots would ever return .
“ This last minimum was much deeper and longer than anybody predicted , ” says Bernhard Fleck , ESA ’s SOHO Project Scientist , “ We were beginning to joke that we had entered another Maunder minimum . ”
The Maunder minimum occurred between 1645 and 1715 , when sunspots , the visible markers of solar activity , were largely absent from the Sun .
The last two years have been the same , with the Sun presenting a spotless face for more than 70 % of the time .
Artist 's impression of the SOHO spacecraft Astronomers are used to seeing the Sun sweep through a cycle of activity that lasts approximately 11 years .
But until December last year , the Sun had seemed reluctant to start up again .
In mid-January , an even larger sunspot group emerged and , most recently , several big , active areas have been crossing the face of the Sun .
Yet it is premature to believe that the Sun is ramping up for another energetic cycle of activity .
The strength of the upcoming solar cycle is determined by the strength of magnetism at the poles of the Sun , and this is currently very weak .
The polar field provides the magnetic ‘ seeds ’ for the next cycle ’s sunspots by being swallowed down inside the Sun , somehow rejuvenated and then returned to the surface to appear as the dark blemishes .
So , although the Sun is coming back to life , we should not expect that much activity according to Fleck .
“ I think we are heading for something like the early 20th century when everything was much less active , ” he says .
Historical records show that , until the last few years , the solar cycle has been unusually active .
So , rather than a sudden drop in activity , this is more like a return to normality .
“ When SOHO was launched almost 15 years ago , understanding the solar cycle was not one of its scientific objectives , now it is one of the key questions , ” says Fleck .
As newer spacecraft , such as NASA ’s Solar Dynamics Observatory are launched , SOHO ’s continued observations will provide essential calibration data for the newer instruments , ensuring that the astronomers can compare the datasets accurately .
And SOHO still has one unique capability : it remains the only spacecraft in line with the Sun that can watch for ‘ coronal mass ejections ’ coming straight for Earth , which can disrupt telecommunications , GPS and power lines .

The injury woes in Carolina continue .
Not long ago , linebacker Thomas Davis tore an ACL during offseason workouts .
Now , receiver Steve Smith has broken his arm while playing flag football in a North Carolina adult league .
Adam Schefter of ESPN was the first to report it ; we have since confirmed it .
We ’re told that the break occurred in the same arm he broke late in the 2009 season .
ESPN ’s Chris Mortensen reports that Smith already has had surgery on the arm , and that he ’ll miss the beginning of camp .
It happened , we ’re told , as Smith tried to deflect a pass .
His arm struck another player , and he instantly knew he had been injured .
He also called together his flag football teammates and urged them to not say anything to anyone about the injury .
So much for that .
While Schefter characterizes the injury as having occurred at Smith ’s “ football camp , ” we ’re told that it actually happened in the championship game of an adult flag football league in which Smith and other NFL players had participated for the entire duration of the league ’s season .
Also taking part , we ’re told , were Panthers receiver Kenny Moore and former Panthers quarterback Josh McCown .
More to come on this one .
UPDATE : The Panthers have officially confirmed the injury .
Usually our breaking news has to do with pictures or videos of new devices and their specs , but today , we ’re going straight off of Verizon word .
There has been a ton of speculation surrounding the release of the Droid X and Droid 2 by Motorola and we finally have a date for the release of at least one of them from multiple sources .
Over the last couple of days , Verizon stores were told to place t- shirt orders ( like during the Droid Incredible launch ) and prepare for an early opening with full staff on July 19th for the Droid X with new merchandising taking over store windows on the 18th .
The official announcement will be made by Verizon next week .
( About time right ? )

One reason for low prices is far lower salaries .
The average salary in the I.H.L. , Mr. Ufer said , is about $ 68,000 , while in the A.H.L. it is around $ 35,000 , according to Peter Hanlon , a spokesman for the league .
Though the quality of play in both leagues is , in general , just a notch below that of the N.H.L. , there are distinct differences in their makeups .
All of the A.H.L. teams are affiliated with the N.H.L. and eight of the minor league 's teams are owned by the parent league .
Players often shuffle between the N.H.L. and the A.H.L .
This season , for example , at last count , 234 players had played in both leagues .
The average age in the A.H.L. is about 23 compared with 26 in the I.H.L .
Where practically all the players in the A.H.L. are owned by N.H.L. clubs , most of the players in the I.H.L. are in effect independent , although 5 of the I.H.L.'s 19 teams have partial affiliations with the N.H.L .
'' We 're a free - agent league , with no reserve system , '' Mr. Ufer said ; '' They 're committed to being a developmental league with young players while our teams have a mix of young and older players . ''
Not surprisingly , each league says it plays a better caliber of hockey than the other .
'' Our quality of play is not far below the level of the N.H.L. , '' said Mr. Andrews , the A.H.L. president .'' We have the best young players who are on the way up , '' he said , '' and we think our hockey is more entertaining and more skillful .
And over half of our players have already played in the N.H.L . ''
So , too , have the players in the I.H.L. , which has grown from 12 to 19 teams since 1993 .
The difference , though , is that most of the former N.H.L. players in the I.H.L. most likely will finish their careers in the minor league .
'' Our players tend to be older and more experienced and we think we have a higher - skilled level of play , '' Mr. Ufer said from the league 's offices in Bloomfield Hills , Mich .
Should Hartford get an A.H.L. team , the new team would have a natural rival close by in Springfield .
In a twist , Springfield has been a Whaler farm team , but that relationship is being disolved at the end of the current season .
Other New England cities in the league are Worcester , Mass . ; Providence , R.I. , and Portland , Me . By contrast , Hartford would be the only city from the Northeast in the I.H.L. whose clubs are mainly based in the West .
As for the Whalers : Mr. Karamanos , the club 's owner , said voters in Columbus , Ohio , will cast ballots in a referendum on May 5 to decide whether to approve an increase in a sales tax in order to build a new arena where the Whalers could play .

EXCLUSIVE
( Updated : 4:23 PM , 06/17/10 )
One of the biggest movie sites in the world , IMDb.com , is facing a hornet 's nest of controversy over its policy of publishing the ages of actors and writers who say it leads to ageism , TheWrap has learned .
The Writers Guild of America , West , is leading an effort to convince the massive database — used by virtually everyone in Hollywood and far beyond — to permit people to remove their birth dates from the site .
" The Guild has a contract with IMDb to provide credits information and does not release information on age , " Neal Sacharow , a spokesperson for the WGA , told TheWrap .
" We have raised our concerns with IMDb about its listing of ages . "
Representatives from Hollywood guilds including the Screen Actors Guild have reached out to the site to see about taking down the birth dates of people who are not movie stars like Angelina Jolie or Leonardo DiCaprio , according to an individual knowledgeable about the talks .
( A spokeswoman for SAG declined to comment . )
The guilds argue that not just writers and actors , but also below - the - line workers as they crest 40 face fewer job opportunities in a business that tends to prefer 25 year olds .
Listing their ages publicly is exacerbating the situation , they say .
But IMDb is n't eager to make the change , according to people knowledgeable about the disagreement .
Part of the issue seems to be a cultural one .
IMDb comes from internet culture , which is data - focused and oriented to revealing everything imaginable ( though not from a corporate perspective — just try to find a phone number for Google ) .
Meanwhile , veterans of the entertainment industry are not particularly tech - savvy and often fearful of the reveal - all nature of the web .
( Update : Giving credence to claims that it is notoriously difficult to amend or remove personal information on IMDb , a television producer and entertainment agent both contacted TheWrap after this article was published to relay their own difficulties convincing the database to edit profiles .
The producer said that the age listed on their profile was incorrect , but that the site had not responded to an email asking them to remove that information , as well as a personal email address .
The producer had even considered retaining a lawyer to try to pressure IMDb to take down the information
“ I could never get anybody on the phone , ” the producer told TheWrap .
“ It does n’t seem fair that some profiles do n’t have this information .
Why do I want people to see where I was born . ”
The agent said that two clients had incorrect ages listed on their profiles and had similar problems trying to get IMDb to amend their information .
In the case of one of client , who was listed as being eight years older than he actually was , not even photocopies of a birth certificate and passport were sufficient to compel the database to change the listed age .
The agent said that having a client listed as 38 when he was actually 30 likely impaired his ability to get work .
“ They ’re very fickle about what changes they do make , ” the agent told TheWrap .
“ I do n’t know were they get their information , but once its up there , God help you . ” )
Another part of the tension comes from the nature of IMDb itself .
Co-founder Col Needham believes the site has a responsibility to provide factual and comprehensive data , according to one source knowledgeable about the company ( yes , his birthday is listed ) .
In most cases , individuals or their publicists provide the biographical data for profiles , much as they would with a Facebook account , but average users also can update the information on individuals if , for example , it gets reported in a newspaper or magazine .
To be sure , many profiles do not list birth dates .
But once any information is listed , IMDb will only remove it if it is inaccurate , an IMDb spokesperson confirmed to TheWrap .
In the case of birth dates , a person would have to actually prove the listed date is inaccurate .
" IMDb is committed to being the most comprehensive source of film , TV and celebrity information , " an IMDb spokesperson told TheWrap .
" Customers of IMDb trust that when they use our website , they are receiving comprehensive and accurate biographical information .
When we are made aware of information that can be verified as inaccurate , we remove from IMDb , as nothing is more important to us than customer trust . "
Others say it is near impossible to remove or change a date on IMDb , even if it 's false .
The guilds are hoping pressure from them will convince the site — and Needham — to re-examine its rules .
IMDb has been conducting a series of industry sessions that have included conversations about the impact that listing ages has on getting work .
The site may be softening its position , but for now both the guilds and IMDb are remaining tight - lipped about their negotiations .
A spokesperson for the Screen Actors Guild declined to comment .
A spokesperson for the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employes , Moving Picture Technicians , Artists and Allied Crafts of the United States ( IATSE ) said that organization was more concerned with issues related to health care and pensions and doubted that anyone hiring a grip or production crew member would make a decision based on an IMDb profile .
The Directors Guild of America has not been involved in the talks , but a spokesperson for the guild declined to comment .
It is no surprise that the writers ' union is the most upset over potential age discrimination , people in the film and television business say .
A massive age discrimination lawsuit filed on behalf of 165 television scribes ensnared 17 major television networks and studios and seven talent agencies for nearly 10 years .
That ended in a $ 70 million settlement last January .
Paul Levine , a writer on " J.A.G. " and a producer on the Supreme Court drama " First Monday , " said that being in his fifties and sixties was a competitive disadvantage when he tried to find work in the industry .
" Not that anything ever overt was said , but not one time was I interviewed by my someone my own age .
I was always interviewed by people 20 to 30 years younger , " Levine told TheWrap .
" It could be a problem if a show runner or his or her first lieutenant has scripts piling up , and they were trying to figure out who to interview .
Looking at a credit list , if one writer is 35 and the other is 52 , they 're going for the 35 year old . "
A lot of that has to do with the audience that movies and television shows are trying to reach , namely teenage boys .
" Of course there 's ageism in Hollywood .
In what business is n't there , " Howard Suber , professor of film history at UCLA and the author of " The Power of Film , " told TheWrap .
" It 's hard for somebody who is 50 to write convincingly about 16 or 17 year olds — at least contemporary 16 or 17 year olds . "
But that 's a generation gap that wo n't be narrowed by obfuscating a writer or a director 's true age , Suber argues .
" Who are you kidding ? " Suber said .
" If you have to take a meeting in order to get hired , do n't you think those young people who are interviewing you are going to have a pretty good idea of your age no matter how you try to disguise it ? "
IMDb attracts an estimated 60 million unique visits per month .
Beef Jerky Outlet 4441 Bass Pro Drive # 500 Garland 972-203-2337
Try : cherry cheesecake popcorn
Do n't try : Buffalo Bob 's kangaroo jerky
In Garland out by the Bass Pro , there 's a beef jerky outlet creatively named Beef Jerky Outlet .
There , you 'll find a beef jerky shop clearly created by someone who jerks themselves to jerky .
I mean , this dude must love jerky like it 's candy .
The walls of this little shop are lined with barrels -- just like the kind you 've seen filled with salt water taffy and those hard candies with the strawberry wrappers -- only these are filled to the brim with jerky .
It 's a dried - meat lover 's paradise .
Like Willy Wonka 's candy land , only with beef jerky trees , beef jerky rainbows and everlasting beef jerky gobstoppers .
And for you popcorn fiends , they have barrels bursting with different flavored popcorns .
I 'm talkin ' caramel corn , cheese corn , that other weird corn that 's always leftover in the tri-flavor office party corn bucket , plus they had other Doritos -y stuff like cheesy jalapeño popcorn .
Oooh .
Wonder if they 'll come out with a Late Night All Nighter Cheeseburger flavor like Doritos has .
I just popcorn - dreamed all over myself .
And Beef Jerky
Outlet is so crazy , they 're giving the stuff away for free .
As you 're driving down Interstate 30 ( just humor me here and pretend like you 've ever driven to Garland ) , you 'll see a giant billboard for their store with " FREE SAMPLES " written in 6 - foot - tall letters .
According to the guy behind the counter in the PETA shirt ( People for the Eating of Tasty Animals ) , you can get a sample of pretty much anything in the store if you ask .
In fact , when I asked what he thought was the weirdest ( but most delicious ) thing they sold in the store , he gave me a free sample of the cherry cheesecake popcorn .
I was as skeptical as you are right now .
Honestly , though , it was pretty damned good .
The ratio of salty to sweet was just right ( way closer to chocolate pretzel than trashcan punch vomit ) and the popcorn in the middle was still crunchy .
If you 're looking for a sweet snack to battle the sodium carnival that is the jerky stick , this is your best bet .
Along with a handful of cherry cheesecake popcorn , I purchased this fine variety of jerky : ostrich , kangaroo , elk , alligator , antelope , wild boar and pheasant .
I did n't notice until I got home that they all contain beef in addition to whatever crazy meat they have as their main ingredient .
Result :
They all pretty much tasted like beef .
I liked the alligator ( tough like jerky 's supposed to be and the Cajun spices were nice ) and pheasant ( more tender , and the pheasant was n't overpowered by the beef as much in this one ) best .
The kangaroo was alright , but while I was eating it , I could n't stop thinking about cute little kangaroos hopping around and then hopping into meat grinders .
For me , that was a turnoff .
But hey , for you jerky freaks it might be just the thing that gets you goin ' .
In addition to the popcorn and the jerky , they have a wall of hot sauces , some weird peanut butters ( including powdered peanut butter .
" Just add water ! "
And then , hurk ! ) , packaged dried fruit , a cooler full of cheeses and a wall of shirts that your meat - etarian , hippie - hating father would wear with pride .
This place has dudely Christmas stocking written all over it .
For all that jerky plus the popcorn , my total only came to about $ 17 dollars .
If only I had discovered this place pre-Father 's Day .
The Basket : cherry cheesecake popcorn , ostrich jerky , kangaroo jerky , elk jerky , alligator jerky , antelope jerky , wild boar jerky and pheasant jerky .
Why Were n’t the Russian ‘ Spies ’ Charged with Espionage ?
Yesterday , federal prosecutors unsealed criminal complaints against 11 people who were allegedly part of a Russian spy ring .
According to the prosecution , the suspects lived in the United States under false names while trying to penetrate " policy - making circles " on behalf of Russia ’s SVR , the successor to the KGB specializing in foreign intelligence .
The defendants were charged with " conspiracy to act as an agent of a foreign government without notifying the U.S. attorney general , " an offense that carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison .
Why were n’t they charged with espionage , which can often bring a life sentence or even the death penalty ?
Probably because they never found out very much .
U.S. law defines espionage as transmitting or attempting to transmit " any document , writing , code book , signal book , sketch , photograph , photographic negative , blueprint , plan , map , model , note , instrument , appliance , or information relating to the national defense " to a foreign government with the intent to harm the United States or give advantage to the foreign nation .
Because federal prosecutors have not charged the " illegals , " as they were known because they had no official credentials , with espionage , they either never got their hands on anything — or it ca n’t yet be proven that they did .
With details about messages in invisible ink and buried money caches , the criminal complaint might read like a Cold War - era spy thriller , but it ’s still unclear what exactly , any of the defendants are supposed to have found out .
The closest thing to espionage in the charges is a meeting at a seminar between defendant Donald Howard Heathfield and a U.S. government official who " works on issues of strategic planning related to nuclear weapon development , " but it does n’t appear that Heathfield learned any classified information .
Although prosecutors might still file additional charges , the activities of these so - called spies do n’t appear to be on the same level as clear - cut espionage cases like those of Robert Hanssen , the FBI agent who sold classified information to the Soviet Union and Russia over more than two decades , and Aldrich Ames , the CIA case officer whose leaks to Moscow led to the deaths of at least 10 U.S. agents in the Soviet Union .
Both men are currently serving life sentences in federal prison .
Violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act ( FARA ) , which requires that agents representing the interests of a foreign power register with the Justice Department , is a far lesser offense and one that rarely merits much media attention .
Prominent FARA cases include Iraqi- American businessman Samir Vincent , who admitted to acting as an unregistered agent of Saddam Hussein ’s government during the U.N. " oil - for - food " scandal , and former President Jimmy Carter ’s brother Billy , who was forced to register as a foreign agent to avoid charges that he was paid $ 220,000 by Muammar al - Qaddafi ’s government to curry favor for Libya in Washington .
The scandal , and a resulting congressional investigation , came to be known as " Billygate . "
Thanks to Plato Cacheris , partner at the law firm of Trout Cacheris and former attorney for Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames .

THE FACTS
For people suffering from sleep apnea , specialized breathing machines are the standard treatment .
The machines use a method called continuous positive airway pressure , or CPAP , which keeps the airway open and relieves potentially dangerous pauses in breathing during the night .
But the machines are expensive , and some people complain that the mask and headgear cause uncomfortable side effects , like congestion .
One free and fairly simple alternative may be exercises that strengthen the throat .
While they are n’t as established or as well studied as breathing machines , some research suggests they may reduce the severity of sleep apnea by building up muscles around the airway , making them less likely to collapse at night .
Image Credit ... Christoph Niemann
In a study published last year in The American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine , scientists recruited a group of people with obstructive sleep apnea and split them into two groups .
One was trained to do breathing exercises daily , while the other did 30 minutes of throat exercises , including swallowing and chewing motions , placing the tip of the tongue against the front of the palate and sliding it back , and pronouncing certain vowels quickly and continuously .
THE federal government wants your personal internet data , and they do n't want to have to apply to a court to get it .
Revelations that the federal government wants Australia 's 400 - odd internet service providers ( ISPs ) to log and retain customers ' web browsing data , so law enforcement can access it during criminal cases , have sparked alarm in the industry .
Currently law enforcement needs court - approved search warrants before they can record someone 's personal data via their ISP .
The proposed regulation would mean companies would be forced to store certain information for several years just in case it was later needed .
'' Once you store that information you increase the risk of abuse , '' a source who works for an ISP said .
'' We can put our hands on our hearts and say we 're good guys and we do n't do anything wrong , but can we say that of every other player in the market ? '' the source said .
'' Compliance would be a big question . ''

If you ’ve ever watched a Syfy movie like Blood Monkey , Boa Vs. Python , or Chupacabra : Dark Seas and thought to yourself , “ Hell , I could make a movie as good as this , just as soon as I ’m sober , ” the network would like to help you put their money where your smirking mouth is .
According to The Hollywood Reporter , Syfy will launch the production website B Movie Mogul , which will allow fans to vote on as well as pitch original ideas for a film — everything from its terrible dialogue to laugh - out - loud title to ridiculous character deaths that guarantee a spot on that week ’s episode of The Soup — and help create the eventual “ script ” ( ironic quotes come from the article itself , believe it or not ) for a movie to be shot late next year .
The site debuts Friday , easing viewers into their role as just - happy - to - be - working creative talents by voting for one of three overall concepts for the eventual movie : “ a 2010 apocalypse story , a Bermuda Triangle - set creature feature , or a Roswell , N.M. - set alien movie . ”
Dreamers , get to dreaming .
We ’re being led to believe that nearly everything would be better with the cloud in control of all our data .

The Obama administration highlighted the longstanding problem of homelessness among LGBT youth this week when it announced a strategy that U.S. Housing & Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donavan called “ the most far - reaching and ambitious plan to end homelessness in our history . ”
Administration officials released the plan Tuesday during a White House event at which Donovan , two other cabinet secretaries and the head of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness pledged to find stable housing for most of the nation ’s homeless within 10 years .
Donavan , who serves as chair of the Interagency Council on Homelessness , said that many people who fall victim to homelessness face discrimination based on their sexual orientation and gender identity .
“ What I would say is so many of those at risk of homelessness are marginalized in various ways , ” he told the Blade after the event .
“ As we ’ve seen with youth , those who age out of foster care … [ and ] who are ostracized and targeted because of their gender identity or sexual orientation are one of the populations that are at increased risk for homelessness .
“ So everyone has a stake in making sure that those who are at risk of homelessness , including those targeted because of their gender identity and sexual orientation , need to be part of this effort , and they are . ”
He said that curtailing bias against homeless LGBT youth would result in broader benefits for the country .
“ It ’s also wrong for taxpayers of the nation , more broadly , because ultimately the costs of homelessness to our society and the taxpayers are far larger when folks fall into homelessness than if we prevent that homelessness in advance , ” he said .
The 67 - page document released Tuesday , “ Opening Doors : Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent & End Homelessness 2010 , ” calls for building on what it says have been highly effective strategies for addressing the homeless problem that local and state governments and private charitable groups in many parts of the country have used .
Among other things , it calls for eradicating homelessness among military veterans and the chronic homeless within five years .
It calls for eliminating homelessness among “ unaccompanied youth ” and “ individual adults ” within 10 years .
“ Youth often leave home as a result of severe family conflict which may include physical and / or sexual abuse , ” says the plan .
“ Some studies suggest that racial and ethnic minority youth as well as youth who are gay , lesbian , bisexual , transgender , and questioning represent a larger proportion when compared to the overall population . ”
The plan says that , in general , homeless youth need shelter along with transitional programs and services that emphasize “ stabilization and reunification with families when appropriate . ”
However , it notes that “ in many cases , youth have become homeless because of hostile and dangerous conditions at home and that reunification with families may not be appropriate for groups such as victims of abuse and many gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender youth . ”
Donovan said the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness , which prepared the plan , consists of 19 federal agencies , including HUD and the U.S. departments of Health & Human Services and Veterans Affairs .
Barbara Poppe , the Council ’s executive director and who is credited with coordinating the project , told the Blade that experts on LGBT youth and homelessness provided information to the Council through a special working group that focused on youth issues .
“ We believe they should have absolute access to shelter and support , ” she said of LGBT youth .
“ But more importantly , we want to set them on a path to employment and transition to adulthood .
We ’re very excited to implement the plan with a strong focus on any homelessness among youth over the next decade . ”
The Obama administration ’s plan for addressing homelessness comes four year after the National Gay & Lesbian Task Force and the National Coalition for the Homeless issued what many LGBT activists considered a groundbreaking report on homelessness among LGBT youth .
The report , based on an extensive review of research conducted by private and local governmental agencies throughout the country , said its findings suggest that between 20 percent and 40 percent of all homeless youth identity as LGBT .
Among other things , the report found that LGBT youth were often victims of violence and harassment in homeless shelter .
The report also noted that faith - based shelters sometimes created further problems for LGBT youth because of certain religious teachings on homosexuality .
“ Our country can do better , and its leadership has an obligation to ensure that all people — including LGBT youth and adults — are not left without fundamentals such as food , safety and a roof over one ’s head , ” said Task Force Executive Director Rea Carey in prepared comments on the administration ’s new homelessness plan .
“ While we are pleased to see that LGBT people are being considered in a strategy to confront homelessness , real progress will occur when such inclusive strategies are actually implemented , ” she said .
“ Homelessness is a critical issue for the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender community .
For far too long , too many of our young people have been kicked out of their homes , forced to live on the streets , for simply being who they are .
This has been a national disgrace of epidemic proportions . ”
EACH year , according to the Diocese of Arundel and Brighton :
The feast of the Body and Blood of Christ ( Corpus Christi ) , is celebrated in Arundel Cathedral with a carpet of flowers laid down the length of the centre aisle in honour of Blessed Sacrament ; the whole work is undertaken by parishioners .
Well , earlier today , The West Sussex Gazette carried a HUGE front page picture of this year ’s carpet , the theme of which is The Year of the Priest .
Given the mess the Catholic Church is in over the behaviour worldwide of its kiddie - fiddling Â priests , this theme is , to say the least , is a tad insensitive , do n’t you think ?
Anyway , the diocese explains :
In the ancient world it was the custom to strew flowers in the path of important persons as a sign of respect and reverence .
This custom was adopted by the Church to honour the Blessed Sacrament , carried in procession on the festival of Corpus Christi .
In some places in Europe this practice was extended so that whole streets were carpeted with flowers .
Even today , in some towns in Italy , a carpet of flowers is laid for the entire route of the procession , in intricate patterns and pictures depicting scenes from the gospels .
What ’s the bet no pansies are included .

Motorola Announces the New FLIPOUT with MOTOBLUR
In an announcement today , Motorola revealed the latest addition to its European Android lineup , the FLIPOUT .
The compact , square - shaped FLIPOUT has a pivot screen that swivels around to reveal a five row QWERTY keyboard .
Its slim and compact design are the most notable features about Motorola ’s latest Android phone .
In addition , it runs Android 2.1 , 2.8 inch touch screen display , 3MP camera , 512 MB onboard memory ( but it comes with a 2GB SD card ) and its memory is expandable to 32 GB via SD card .
The FLIPOUT measures out at 67.00 x 67.00 x 17.00 mm .
It even comes in a few different colors depending on your personal preference .
Or if you want the phone to match your mood , you can purchase several battery covers and switch them to the color of your choosing .
Another notable feature of the FLIPOUT is Motorola ’s native software dubbed MOTOBLUR .
Down to the core , the FLIPOUT is a social networking beast of a phone as it runs MOTOBLUR which aggregates content from social networking services such as Facebook , MySpace , Twitter , Gmail , email , and last .
fm .
From these services , MOTOBLUR delivers contacts , posts , photos , and comments all to the home screen .
It even backs up all data to a secure server in case something happens to the phone .
Even though the camera is mediocre at best , MOTOBLUR allows users to upload photos and videos to social networking websites easily .
It seems like this phone will be a hit with the teenagers in Europe , but I ca n’t imagine many businessmen carrying about this smartphone .
The FLIPOUT with MOTOBLUR will be available in Europe in Q2 of 2010 , but the price has not yet been released .
Wildfire has an app sharing device and the handset is expected to be free in the UK on monthly contracts priced at about £ 20
The battle between Apple and Google for the lion 's share of the smartphone market is due to heat up with the arrival of a new phone aimed squarely at taking the online search engine group 's Android mobile platform to the mass market .
The arrival of the HTC Wildfire , in the UK in July , will also come hard on the heels of a new version of the iPhone in San Francisco .
Leaked reports of the ' iPhone 4G ' on the internet suggest it is designed for the ' high - end ' of the smartphone market .
Certainly , Apple 's share of the mobile phone market will be eroded as more and more devices are launched that use Google 's platform .
Apple must decide whether it wants to remain a trend setting niche player - though admittedly a highly profitable one - as it has in the home computing world , or grab a greater slice of the market by producing a wider range of devices , as it has with personal digital music players .
Despite a shaky start when the first device , the G1 , went on sale more than a year after Apple 's iPhone had launched , Android has gained real traction in the last few months in its battle with Apple .
In the first quarter of the year , phones with Android outsold Apple 's iPhone in the US for the first time , according to market research by the NPD Group .
The market for phones that can send emails , access the web and download applications is still dominated by the BlackBerry , made by Canada 's Research In Motion and a brand which last year celebrated its 10th birthday .
But Android is closing the gap .
In the UK , almost one in every five smartphones sold now uses Android , according to retail experts GfK .
Google is expected to unveil the latest version of Android at a two - day developer event in California starting on Wednesday .
Previous iterations of Android have been named after pastries - such as donut , cupcake and the latest version 2.1 eclair - but it has now switched to other foodstuffs : the new 2.2 version is called ' froyo ' , or frozen yoghurt .
The rise of Android has been helped by the recent release of the HTC Desire , which has been favourably compared with the iPhone and lauded by critics as better than Google 's own - branded Nexus One device .
Android devices have been aimed at the same , expensive , segment of the smartphone market as the iPhone , but the HTC Wildfire , in contrast , is expected to be free in the UK on monthly contracts priced at about £ 20 , making it available to a much wider audience .
The Wildfire , with a 3.2 inch touchscreen , is smaller than the Nexus One and Desire , which have 3.7 inch screens , but has the same 5 megapixel camera .
Its processor is slower than the Desire and Nexus One which include Qualcomm 's Snapdragon chip .
HTC , which is currently embroiled in a bitter patent dispute with Apple , has placed its HTC Sense user interface on the Wildfire , but with some additions .
The phone aggregates all the different ways in which a person can communicate and pulls them into one place - rather like Vodafone 's 360 service .
So Wildfire users can see all their interactions - from text and email , to Facebook and Twitter updates - through that individual 's contact card in the phone 's address book .
The HTC Wildfire also allows users to recommend applications - or ' apps ' - that they have downloaded onto their device , to their friends , either by sending them a text or email with a link to the ' app ' on the Android marketplace , or by broadcasting details of the ' app ' on Twitter and Facebook .
Drew Bamford , HTC 's director of user experience , said it is just the first step in making Google 's Android marketplace , which includes many thousands of downloadable programmes , easier for people to navigate .
" This is our first foray into ' app ' sharing so it is pretty straightforward at the moment - it makes it easy to recommend apps to friends .
I think in the future you will see more sophisticated tools for tracking this kind of stuff . "
While Apple has a stranglehold over the iPhone 's ' app ' store and RIM keeps a tight rein on its equivalent for Blackberry users , Google exerts very little control over the Android Marketplace .
As a result , consumers are effectively left to navigate the store themselves , relying upon comments from other users to gauge whether a particular ' app ' is useful or not .
That may be fine for gadget fans and other early adopters , but the lack of control over the store is likely to leave many consumers confused .
The app explosion , caused by the iPhone , has caused a dramatic increase in traffic for the mobile phone networks but no corresponding increase in revenues .
As a result , many of the networks are looking at ways of getting a slice of the action and because it is an open platform , Google 's Marketplace offers them the potential for aligning themselves more closely with customers by helping them pick the best ' apps ' .
So with its app sharing widget , HTC is making a fast early grab for what could be the next battleground between handset manufacturers and mobile phone operators in the fight for the hearts and minds of consumers .

This year we teamed up with the good folks at Ninite to create an unattended installer for the 2010 Lifehacker Pack .
That 's right — run this puppy on a brand - new Windows 7 installation , walk down the street to grab a cup of coffee , and when you get back , Ninite 's bundle installer has finished automatically installing the apps we 'd recommend anyone have on their system .
Just to make sure we 're on the same page , here 's the screaming link you should follow to download the streamlined Lifehacker Pack :
Download the Lifehacker Pack 2010
We divided up the Lifehacker Pack into two sections this year — the " Essentials " and the " Extended . "
Each is just what they sound like — the Essentials is just what you need to make a modern Windows system usable , and " Extended " adds a lot of apps and functionality that not everybody needs , but some folks may find incredibly helpful .

Want to quickly and automatically install the apps we 're recommending ?
Head to our Ninite bundle , then click the link at the top to " Select All Essential Apps . "
Do n't need one or more of the apps included ?
Un - check the box next to each item you 'd remove .
You can then hit " Select All Extended Apps " in the second section , and do the same kind of cherry - picking of additions and removals .

Notepad ++: Microsoft Word , OpenOffice.org , and other office suites are good for just that — writing business documents in an office setting .
When you need to edit text , and need just a bit more than Notepad / Wordpad offer , Notepad + + is , as you might guess , much better .
There 's a good selection of text search and manipulation tools , tabbed editing of multiple documents , syntax coloring for those working with code , and scripting abilities that can add in functions written by the app's very enthusiastic user base to add functions like automatic saving .

Texter : Built by our own Adam Pash , Texter remains the only truly free text replacement utility for Windows systems .
It saves time and mental cycles by filling in long passages and tricky code when you type in a few key characters , and it is , in fact , how most of the Lifehacker editors track and write the HTML and text snippets that get reused everywhere .
It can work with text from the clipboard , insert times and dates , and make semi-personalized email responses and signatures a snap .
If you 've got a bug complaint or code to add for Texter , you can contribute through GitHub .

Belvedere : Belvedere , another Adam Pash production , emulates the automated cleaning and sorting powers of the Hazel application for Macs .
It takes care of the file actions you 'd normally do ( or forget to do ) manually — remove image files from the desktop when they 're a certain age , delete leftovers in the downloads folder after a certain point , compress and back up files matching certain conditions , and so on .
Like its television namesake , Belvedere handles your messy files and folders without a stiff upper lip and unspoken understanding of what needs doing .

SumatraPDF : What does SumatraPDF do that Adobe Reader does n't do ?
Makes reading PDF documents very , very simple , and fast .
SumatraPDF downloads PDFs and opens them , rather than try to offer a browser plug - in experience .
It opens those PDFs quickly , seems to support the majority of PDF features , including tables of contents , and offers smart navigation shortcuts for those who want to learn .

Chrome : When Lifehacker first launched in early 2005 , Internet Explorer had a near - monopoly on browser usage , and Firefox was everything it was n't — open - source , faster , extensible , and full of helpful little features — like , say , tabbed browsing .
Firefox is still a smart alternative to Internet Explorer , but these days ( as hard as it is for some of us to say it ) , the fastest , simplest , and most search - savvy browser around is Google 's own Chrome browser .
At this point , the browser has incorporated most of the features one needs from a browser , has added some nifty new stuff , like built - in browser preferences and bookmark syncing , and has an extension library that 's covering a lot of ground .
In short , for those without special , only - available - for - Firefox needs , Chrome gets the job done .
The majority of Lifehacker editors are using Chrome as their primary browser for work and personal browsing these days , and we see it as the best web tool we can recommend .
And do n't worry , Firefox lovers — you can still grab Firefox as well in the Extended download .

Thunderbird :
With so many people using web - based email services these days , we could easily leave out a desktop email client .
But Thunderbird is free , and its latest version is easy to set up as a kind of backup tool for Gmail , Yahoo , Hotmail , and most non-Exchange email services .
Why keep a desktop client connected to a webmail service ?
Because IMAP clients tend to still let you access Gmail , even when it's " down " .
And with Google 's support for offline Gears on the wane , Thunderbird 's smart download - then - work - offline feature is great for air travel and other non-connected situations .

Pidgin : Pidgin is n't as flashy as its newer , more social - media - focused counterparts like Trillian or Digsby , but in this case , simplicity is a virtue .
Set up Pidgin with your AIM , Google Talk , Yahoo Messenger , MSN , or other chat accounts .
Sync your Pidgin profile with Dropbox ( a download also included in this pack ) , and you do n't have to mess with settings anywhere or go hunting for chat logs .
Better still , stash a portable copy in Dropbox , synced to that same profile , and you 've always got a chat client ready to go on any Windows system .
( Previous coverage : 10 must - have plug-ins , Use Dropbox to sync profiles across multiple PCs )

Adobe Flash :
Yes , it causes a good number of browser crashes ( though fewer when bundled with Chrome ) .
Yes , it 's harder on laptop and mobile batteries than straight - up browsing .
And , yes , HTML5 is the future .
But at this moment , you need Flash , on occasion .
If you want a say in when and how it runs , install the FlashBlock Chrome Extension , and the original FlashBlock Firefox add - on if you 're running that , too .

Skype :
It 's one of the cheapest ways to call somebody overseas and , amazingly , it 's still free if you both use your computers .
Even better , Skype for Windows ' new screen sharing / remote control feature turns out to be a pretty great tool for troubleshooting problems from far away .
At some point , someone will ask to call you on Skype .
It does n't hurt to have it available .

uTorrent :
The best , most secure , and most full - featured BitTorrent client for Windows .
Our voting readers agree by a wide margin , and we 've found quite a few neat things to play with in uTorrent , too , like share your own files , remote control your torrents , and running it from a thumb drive .

Dropbox :
It 's only been two years since this file syncing service debuted , but it 's already hard to imagine how we lived without it .
Everybody gets 2 GB of free space to store files in the most simple interface possible — if it's in the Dropbox folder , it 's synced .
We 've discovered and linked to many clever uses of this one - folder - every - computer setup , but at its heart , Dropbox is the service that frees you from having to remember to unplug your USB drive from every computer you use it on .

Mozy : Where Dropbox is simple , Mozy is detailed — in a good way .
The web - based backup service also offers 2 GB of free space , but keeps an eye on many different folders , or types of files , across your whole computer , with versioned copies of everything .
They 're trying to entice you into signing up for their full service , costing $ 54.45 for a full year of unlimited storage , but that 's not such a bad thing — having a copy of all your stuff in a place you can't delete it , set it on fire , or spill your coffee on it is a savvy move .

ImgBurn :
When it comes to disc - burning software , " Just works " is a big recommendation , because it really stinks to deal with image files , disc types , or driver incompatibilities right before you want to hit " Burn . "
ImgBurn works with CDs , DVDs , and Blu - Ray , creates and opens all kinds of image formats , and supports every Windows OS back to 95 .

CCleaner :
You may not think you 'll ever run out of hard drive space , and maybe you wo n't .
But the extra files , leftover data , and cache files left hanging around by your apps can get very big , and make your system work harder to find the good stuff .
CCleaner finds the cruft and cleans it out , nice and simple .
( Previous coverage : Run CCleaner on a schedule , Really browse without a trace )

Revo Uninstaller : Windows is too lenient in what it allows each piece of software to do when it " uninstalls . "
Some leave files , others leave menu links and file associations .
Revo Uninstaller is like bleach when it comes to cleaning out apps .
It also has a handy startup program manager for deeper cleans of what 's dirtying up your system .

7 - Zip : Windows ( thankfully ) opens and creates ZIP files creatively .
For opening the many other kinds of archives floating around the internet , install 7 - Zip .
You 'll only see it hanging around when you open up a file , or right - click to create new files .

VLC : It plays nearly any kind of media file you can find on the internet , and with hardware acceleration now in early builds , it should be even snappier very soon .

Picasa : Picasa makes sense of the myriad folders , files , and faces that make up our often discombobulated photo collections , and does it with an interface that 's easy to understand .
It also serves as a one - stop shop for quick photo touch - ups , collage creation , web album uploading , and easy , no -pain photo emails .

Paint.NET :
When you need to crop , cut , or otherwise edit an image , Windows ' built - in Paint is n't quite enough , while a full - fledged Photoshop or GIMP installation is probably too much .
Paint.NET is just about perfect for the graphic design needs of a non-graphic - designer .

i Tunes :
We are not in love with iTunes , by any means — it 's nearly a textbook example of feature creep , and it's not a fast , easy , or particularly stable bit of Windows software .
Still , it seems like everyone has to install iTunes at some point , either to make or release purchases or manage an iPod .
There are apps that can manage iPods without iTunes , but they are not elegant .
So we include iTunes because it still handles the basic functions of a music library , and makes sense for the many , many iPod owners out there .

Microsoft Security Essentials :
As the How - To Geek put it in his headline , stop paying for Windows security — Microsoft 's security tools are good enough .
The free download integrates tightly into your Windows system , but not in the annoying icons - everywhere , constant - nagging fashion of the big commercial providers .
It also does n't drag down performance , is quickly and automatically updated , and , best of all , is just quietly working .
The Extended Pack

Firefox :
When we 're not using Chrome , we 're using Firefox .
It 's still a great browser with a lot of add - ons that can't be had anywhere else , and a good alternative to keep handy .

OpenOffice.org :
The free and open - source alternative to Microsoft 's Office suite has its problems — speed , feature bloat , and import / export problems for trickier documents .
But at its heart , it still replicates the majority of what one needs to get modern work done without a Microsoft license .

Foobar 2000 , Songbird , and Winamp : Windows Media Player works better than you 'd think , and iTunes and VLC get the job done for straight - up library organizing and music listening .
Music , though , is a very personal thing , and many of our readers love the customization , power features , and , in the case of Songbird , avoidance of Apple lock - in of these great media players .
Installing them all does n't take that much space , so why not give them a try ?

Adobe Reader :
It has regular security holes , it 's less than quiet about upgrading and suggesting other Adobe products , and other PDF tools , like the recommended SumatraPDF in Essentials , are faster and lighter .
But you will , at some point , encounter web sites and documents that were made in such a way as to require actual Adobe Reader .
Install it , then , but keep Sumatra as your default reader , and leave Adobe available as a just - in - case .
So there it is — the app Essentials we 'd imagine any fresh Windows re-install ( or virtual machine , or BootCamp , or triple - boot - on - Mac ) should have in place , and the Extended stuff for covering all the bases on a productivity machine .

Near one edge of Mars ' northern polar cap stands Udzha .
Named for a town in Siberia , Udzha , which is 45 km ( 28 mi ) across , is classified as a crater .
Yet it 's almost hidden from view as its sharp - edged , rocky rim peeks from under the polar cap 's layers .
Editor 's Note :
This article was originally presented by the Mars Odyssey 's Thermal Emission Imaging System ( THEMIS ) team at Arizona State University .
It is reproduced here with permission .
At the THEMIS site , you can zoom in on this new image .
The northern polar cap of Mars sprawls across the top of the Red Planet for roughly 1,000 kilometers ( 620 miles ) .
At thickest , the cap piles up about 2.7 km ( 9,000 feet ) high , but becomes thinner toward its serrated edges , where deep canyons and smaller troughs carve a spiraling pattern into the cap .
Near one edge of the northern polar cap stands a curious feature named Udzha .
Named for a town in Siberia , Udzha , which is 45 km ( 28 mi ) across , is classified as a crater .
Yet it 's almost hidden from view as its sharp - edged , rocky rim peeks from under the polar cap 's layers .
A newly released image of Udzha was taken at visible wavelengths during local summer .
It comes from THEMIS , the Thermal Emission Imaging System , a multi- wavelength camera on NASA 's Mars Odyssey orbiter .
We see Udzha surrounded by dark , stratified layers mostly covered with bright deposits of water ice .
The polar caps of Mars , which are large enough to be glimpsed even in backyard telescopes from Earth , form an archive of the planet 's recent climate history .
The record is written in layer after layer of dust and ice .
Each polar winter sees an accumulation of carbon - dioxide frost , which falls as light snow , condensing directly from the atmosphere as temperatures plunge to minus 130 degrees Celsius ( minus 202 Fahrenheit ) .
This produces a thin " polar cap " that reaches down to about latitude 60 degrees north .
This layer resembles the layer of snow cover that collects in Earth 's northern hemisphere every winter .
On Mars , the frost condenses around dust particles brought by the winds from all over the planet .
When the frost disappears the following summer , it leaves the dust behind , along with the residual polar cap , which is made of water ice .
As years pass , the dusty layers slowly accumulate , while major climatic events interrupt the sequence from time to time .
These events - still poorly understood by scientists - prevent the layered deposits from displaying a monotonous regularity .
Polar Pancakes
Besides its annual cycle of frost deposition , the Martian polar caps undergo cycles on longer time scales .
The planet 's spin axis changes its tilt relative its orbit over periods of a few million years .
On scales of 100,000 years or so , the axis experiences lesser tilts .
Finally , the planet 's orbit itself undergoes changes on similar time scales that alter the severity of the seasons .
Each of these longer - than - annual cycles imparts a signature on the polar materials .
It 's as if a stack of buckwheat pancakes has a few buttermilk ones inserted here and there .
In the dark troughs that flank Udzha lies a complex history of the Martian climate - if only scientists could read it clearly !
Recent work has focused on mathematical analysis of the patterns found in the exposed layers .
The goal , only partly accomplished , is to identify the broad patterns of change and match them to the calculated changes in Mars ' orbit and spin axis .
If Udzha is a rocky bowl brimful with deposits of ice and dust , its southern flank appears startlingly smooth and featureless .
This material reaches from the rim down to a broad trough at the slope 's foot , about 600 meters ( 2,000 feet ) below the rim in elevation .
What 's covering the slope ?
Where did its layers go ?
THEMIS images taken late at night show the slope is warmer than the rest of Udzha and the dark layers , with the rocky rim being warmest of all .
This is reasonable , given that the slope faces south and southwest - toward the Sun , in other words .
As the scenic vista shows , most of the landscape is extremely flat - and much of it is highly reflecting white ice .
So wherever local slopes tip to face the Sun more squarely , they grow warmer .
It 's possible the slope lacks the layering seen everywhere because it is made of debris that worked free of the layered sediments and was blown by the wind .
The slope might also include rocky material that weathered out of the rim-rock and trickled down .
Reduced to countless individual pieces , the material has slid , mingled , merged , and collapsed into a relatively homogenous mass .
It might even be dry and loose .
But a more likely bet says it 's relatively firm , held fast by water that has worked its way into the material and froze .
