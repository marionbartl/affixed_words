The bailouts are coming at such a regular basis that they ought to make them into a “ reality ” TV series .
What distinguishes “ reality ” TV from other forms of entertainment is that one , they are “ unscripted ” but highly manipulated formats , and two , they have nothing to do with reality .
Certainly the weekly bailout plans qualify .
If not exactly unscripted , they are poorly thought out and are mainly a matter of trying to manipulate markets .
And they are certainly unrealistic .
Hence , they are good candidates for being made into regular TV episodes , perhaps as “ Survivor — American Economy ” or “ Last Bank Standing . ”
Something like that .
However , if they were made into a TV serial , they would be subject to the judgment of Comic - Book Man from The Simpsons , and this latest installment would likely earn from him his oft repeated honorific , “ Worst...episode...ever ! ”
First , let us see how these new “ public - private partnerships ” are supposed to work .
The best explanation comes from Nouriel Roubini's RGE Monitor site :
Sample Investment Under the Legacy Loans Program :
Step 1 : If a bank has a pool of residential mortgages with $ 100 face value that it is seeking to divest , the bank would approach the FDIC .
Step 2 : The FDIC would determine , according to the above process , that they would be willing to leverage the pool at a 6 - to - 1 debt - to - equity ratio .
Step 3 : The pool would then be auctioned by the FDIC , with several private sector bidders submitting bids .
The highest bid from the private sector – in this example , $ 84 – would be the winner and would form a Public - Private Investment Fund to purchase the pool of mortgages .
Step 4 : Of this $ 84 purchase price , the FDIC would provide guarantees for $ 72 of financing , leaving $ 12 of equity .
Step 5 : The Treasury would then provide 50 % of the equity funding required on a side - by - side basis with the investor .
In this example , Treasury would invest approximately $ 6 , with the private investor contributing $ 6 .
Step 6 : The private investor would then manage the servicing of the asset pool and the timing of its disposition on an ongoing basis – using asset managers approved and subject to oversight by the FDIC .
Sample Investment Under the Legacy Securities Program :
Step 1 : Treasury will launch the application process for managers interested in the Legacy Securities Program .
Step 2 : A fund manager submits a proposal and is pre-qualified to raise private capital to participate in joint investment programs with Treasury .
Step 3 : The Government agrees to provide a one - for - one match for every dollar of private capital that the fund manager raises and to provide fund - level leverage for the proposed Public - Private Investment Fund .
Step 4 : The fund manager commences the sales process for the investment fund and is able to raise $ 100 of private capital for the fund .
Treasury provides $ 100 equity co-investment on a side - by - side basis with private capital and will provide a $ 100 loan to the Public - Private Investment Fund .
Treasury will also consider requests from the fund manager for an additional loan of up to $ 100 to the fund .
Step 5 : As a result , the fund manager has $ 300 ( or , in some cases , up to $ 400 ) in total capital and commences a purchase program for targeted securities .
Step 6 : The fund manager has full discretion in investment decisions , although it will predominately follow a long - term buy - and - hold strategy .
The Public - Private Investment Fund , if the fund manager so determines , would also be eligible to take advantage of the expanded Step 1 : Treasury will launch the application process for managers interested in the Legacy Securities Program .
Step 2 : A fund manager submits a proposal and is pre-qualified to raise private capital to participate in joint investment programs with Treasury .
Step 3 : The Government agrees to provide a one - for - one match for every dollar of private capital that the fund manager raises and to provide fund - level leverage for the proposed Public - Private Investment Fund .
Step 4 : The fund manager commences the sales process for the investment fund and is able to raise $ 100 of private capital for the fund .
Treasury provides $ 100 equity co-investment on a side - by - side basis with private capital and will provide a $ 100 loan to the Public - Private Investment Fund .
Treasury will also consider requests from the fund manager for an additional loan of up to $ 100 to the fund .
Step 5 : As a result , the fund manager has $ 300 ( or , in some cases , up to $ 400 ) in total capital and commences a purchase program for targeted securities .
Step 6 : The fund manager has full discretion in investment decisions , although it will predominately follow a long - term buy - and - hold strategy .
The Public - Private Investment Fund , if the fund manager so determines , would also be eligible to take advantage of the expanded TALF program for legacy securities when it is launched .
Note that in the first case , the “ investor ” puts up $ 6 dollars for every $ 84 dollars of “ assets ” being purchased , while in the second he puts in as little $ 25 .
True , these 12 - to - 1 and 4 - to - 1 leverage ratios are much lower than the 30- , 50 - , or 80 - to - 1 leverages that the banks and hedge funds are used to .
Nevertheless , the leverage is all from public money .
Supposedly , this “ shares ” the risk between the public and private sector , and allows the so - called private sector to price the toxic assets .
But for every dollar at risk from the private sector , the public has from $ 3 to $ 12 at risk .
So much for sharing .
Further , the loans are “ non-recourse . ”
That means that if the investment fails and the loan can't be repaid , the public takes the full loss , while the investor only loses the amount of money he put up initially ; he has no liability to repay the public .
This is supposed to establish a “ market price ” for the toxic waste , but it will not .
Rather , it will allow select investors to play the toxic - waste market with public money .
This will not lead to market behavior .
People play the market differently with their own money than with other people 's money .
And the program does nothing to address the underlying problem .
Either the investors will offer enough money to clear the banks ' balance sheets , which might mean that they 've paid too much , or they wo n't , which means that the banks wo n't sell .
But in either case this is a huge commitment of public funds for a problem which has a simpler and time - tested solution .
A few of the money - center banks , some insurance companies and many hedge funds made a series of bad bets .
They are insolvent .
There is a procedure for insolvency .
The banks should be go into receivership and be broken up .
The losses should be written off , and that 's that .
Nothing new or radical in that solution , it happens time and again .
So why not use it ?
Two reasons .
These are no ordinary banks .
They are huge behemoths so complex that even the managers and directors do not understand them .
This , in fact , is the complaint of the man who took over AIG .
That whole company was brought down by the activities occurring in one small division of about 400 employees , the very ones who are now getting the bonuses .
But the very size of these institutions grants them great power over the economy .
Further , their counter - parties , the people on the other side of the bets , tend to be powerful governments and institutions .
Between them , they have the power to help themselves to a few trillion of the taxpayer 's money .
You will note that there is never enough money for such luxuries as health - care or education , but they can't print it fast enough for war or bankers .
Even if the plan works , it will fail , because it does n't address the underlying problem .
And that problem is that we no longer make what we consume .
Unless we restore the real economy , the economy that makes real things and provides real services , we can not restore the banks .
Even solvent banks require productive enterprises to which they can lend money .
But we ran out of these a long time ago .
There simply is n't enough demand , even in good times , for loans from our diminishing productive sector .
Hence , the banks turned to lending it for houses people could n't afford and credit they should n't be using , but must because the wages are too low .
Making the big banks solvent again will not provide them with solvent customers .
That can only come from a restructuring of the economy that shifts us back to real production rather than financial black magic .
If we restore the economy , restoring the banks will be a trivial problem .
If we do not restore the economy , it simply will not matter how “ sound ” the banks are .
Hallett starred in more than 70 episodes of the show as demon Lorne
Andy Hallett , a singer who gained fame portraying a green - skinned demon on the cult US TV series Angel , has died of congestive heart disease aged 33 .
Hallett was taken to Cedars - Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles after having problems breathing and died there on Sunday , his agent said .
It follows a five - year battle with the heart condition .
The star appeared on more than 70 episodes of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer spinoff between 2000 and 2004 .
Born and raised in Osterville , Massachusetts , Hallett moved to LA when he was 23 and worked as a messenger at a talent agency .
He went on to become an assistant to the wife of Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator Joss Whedon - who had Hallett audition for the part of Lorne on Angel after seeing him perform karaoke .
Hallett proved himself a fan favourite on the show as the show tune loving , red - horned demon who could read a person 's aura when they sang , revealing their problems and futures .
The series , which starred Bones actor David Boreanaz as the brooding vampire Angel , ran for five seasons before it was cancelled in 2004 .
Hallett was diagnosed with his heart condition at the end of the show and had been in and out of hospitals for the past five years .
He decided to concentrate on his own music , stepping away from acting , agent Pat Brady said .
Hallett , an only child , is survived by his father Dave Hallett and mother Lori Hallett .
A private funeral service will be held for family and close friends in Cape Cod , Massachusetts , this weekend .
Large flightless birds of the southern continents – African ostriches , Australian emus and cassowaries , South American rheas and the New Zealand kiwi – do not share a common flightless ancestor as once believed .
Instead , each species individually lost its flight after diverging from ancestors that did have the ability to fly , according to new research conducted in part by University of Florida zoology professor Edward Braun .
The new research , which appears this week in the online edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , has several important implications .
First , it means some ratites , like the emus , are much more closely related to their airborne cousins , the tinamous , than they are to other ratites , Braun said .
Second , it means the ratites are products of parallel evolution – different species in significantly different environments following the exact same evolutionary course .
Braun and his fellow researchers began closely studying this group of flightless birds , known collectively as ratites , after a discovery made while working on a larger - scale effort to better understand the evolution of birds and their genomes by analyzing corresponding genetic material sampled from the tissue of many different bird species and determining how they relate to one another .

As they analyzed the genetic material , they noticed that the ratites did not form a natural group based on their genetic makeup .
Rather , they belonged to multiple related but distinct groups that contained another group of birds , the tinamous , with the ability to fly .
Previously , the ratites were used as a textbook example of vicariance , a term that describes the geographical division of a single species , resulting in two or more very similar sub - groups that can then undergo further evolutionary change and eventually become very distinct from one another .
Scientists assumed that a single flightless common ancestor of the ratites lived on the supercontinent of Gondwana , which slowly broke up into Africa , South America , Australia and New Zealand ; once divided , the ancestor species evolved slightly in each new location to produce the differences among the present - day ratites , Braun said .
But in light of this new information , he said it 's more likely that the ratites ' ancestors distributed themselves among the southern continents after the breakup of Gondwana , which began about 167 million years ago , in a much more obvious way .
They flew .
Although these new revelations teach evolutionary scientists a great deal , they also pose a great many new questions .
For example , why did these birds evolve into such similar organisms in such different environments ?
" To know for sure , we 'll have to go into the lab and really study the genetics underlying the ratites ' developmental pathway , " Braun said .
" But nobody would have asked that question without the type of data we 've collected , which raises the question in the first place . "
The scientists ' effort to analyze such a tremendous amount of genetic material collected from birds across the globe is in turn just a single part of a program called Assembling the Tree of Life , funded and organized by the National Science Foundation , which aims to assemble a body of similar research for every group of organisms on the planet , including animals , plants , fungi , algae and bacteria .
I suppose it should have been obvious , but I was still delightfully surprised when Clinton Ebadi came up with these lines on IRC this morning :
ecmascript@( guile - user ) > var callcc = this [ ' call / cc ' ] ; ecmascript@( guile - user ) > var k = false ; ecmascript@( guile - user ) >
1 + callcc ( function ( kont ) { k = kont ; return 0 ; } ) ; 1 ecmascript@( guile- user ) > k ( 2 ) ; 3
42 good times indeed !

When discussing sleep deprivation , the memos released last Thursday cite the work of Dr. James Horne in support of the claim that sleep deprivation for up to 180 hours is not torture .
( See here , pp. 35 - 40 . )
I wrote to Dr. Horne and asked him whether he would like to respond to this use of his work .
( He had given a statement to Zachary Roth at TPMMuckraker , but I thought he might like the opportunity to respond at greater length . )
What follows is his response .
***
Re : Bradbury ( US Dept of Justice ) memo of May 10th 2005 , to the Central Intelligence Agency , concerning ‘ coercive techniques ’
Comment by Professor Jim Horne on the citation of selected extracts of his book ‘ Why We Sleep ’ , in apparently justifying sleep deprivation as a ‘ safe coercive technique ’
My book ‘ Why We Sleep ’ was written without any thought of ‘ coercive techniques ’ in mind .
Nevertheless I made it very clear that pure sleep deprivation in otherwise happy healthy volunteers , as in laboratory settings without additional stresses , is not very eventful for the body , while it is much more so for our brain and behaviour .
Whereas sleep helps people withstand stress , sleep loss makes us more vulnerable to other stresses , especially as the inherent sleepiness and other adverse effects on the brain confuse the mind ’s ability to figure out how to deal with and avoid these stresses .
Thus I emphasise that my book ’s conclusions were based on ‘ pure sleep deprivation ’ without additional stresses .
Such findings were derived from otherwise undemanding and benign laboratory studies that do not typify the real world , whereas people are usually sleep deprived because of other stresses such as long and arduous working hours , family crises , etc .
Healthy people who have volunteered for sleep deprivation experiments are usually well cosseted by their experimenters , perhaps too much so , and might have been inadvertently protected from the full effects of sleep loss .
Apart from the sleep deprivation , volunteers typically lead a tranquil existence , are fed very well and , except for having periodically to undergo various harmless tests , have plenty of time for relaxation , reading and watching TV .
There have been many of these experiments with human volunteers , with the longest lasting 8 - 11 days .
Volunteers can pull out any time and there is full medical cover .
The purpose of these studies has been to explore what sleep does for the body and brain , by removing sleep and see what happens .
Under these circumstances , the ‘ body ’ copes well , whereas the brain and behaviour are obviously affected – not only by sleepiness but by more subtle changes whereby individuals can no longer think for themselves and become more like automatons .
With additional stresses as in ‘ coercive techniques ’ , the situation for the sleep deprived victim becomes deplorable , as the mind and brain under these circumstances trigger the body ’s defences to create a physiological ‘ alarm reaction ’ whereby , for example , various stress coping hormones are mobilised and prepare the body for possible trauma , even blood loss .
I emphasise that this alarm reaction is not present under ‘ pure sleep loss ’ as I have just described .
Prolonged stress with sleep deprivation will lead to a physiological exhaustion of the body ’s defence mechanisms , physical collapse , and with the potential for various ensuing illnesses .
We do n’t know at what point this latter phase would be reached with ‘ coercive techniques ’ , but to claim that 180 hours is safe in these respects , is nonsense .
Moreover , whereas physical pain may not be particularly apparent even at this stage , the mental pain would be all too evident , and arguably worse than physical pain .
Even if one was to be pragmatic and claim that this form of sleep deprivation produced ‘ desired results ’ , I would doubt whether the state of mind would be able to produce credible information , unaffected by delusion , fantasy or suggestibility .
Whilst Bradbury ’s memo acknowledges ( p36 ) that , “ We note that there are important differences between interrogation technique used by the CIA and the controlled experiments documented in the literature ” – i.e. what I wrote might not be wholly applicable to ‘ coercive techniques ’ , this key point was understated .
I had no knowledge of this memo or its contents until a few days ago , and am both saddened and appalled that my book has been used in this way .

Iraq Vets Street Theater Occupies Downtown SF jeff [ at ] paterson.net )
Sunday Nov 30th , 2008 1:59 AM by Jeff Paterson , Courage to Resist
IVAW ( Iraq Veterans Against the War ) performed " Operation First Casualty " throughout downtown San Francisco on Black Friday , interrupting shoppers ' routines with a graphic display of the action that they were missing by not being in Iraq .
Volunteer " civilians " were detained , cuffed and hooded by the Iraq vets in a graphic reenactment of the US military 's occupation of Iraq .
Several volunteers were water - boarded .
Volunteers pretended to be Iraq citizens suffering under the occupation of U.S. forces .
On Saturday July 7th , 2018 , the Toronto Star published a front page story slamming organic milk , claiming that scientific test show it to be no different from regular milk and implying that those who buy it are fools for paying more money for a nutritionally equivalent product .
From that story , by investigative reporter Michele Henry :
“ While Canada ’s organic dairy farmers do some things differently than their conventional colleagues – like sending their cows to pasture and using only chemicals that are considered natural – it ’s not reflected in the end product .
“ The milks are the same – they are identical with respect to the testing and quality standards .
There ’s no added hormones .
No antibiotics , ” says Graham Lloyd , of the Dairy Farmers of Ontario , the quasi - governmental organization that controls the organic and regular milk supply … . ”
Yesterday , on July 14th , the Star published a collection of letters to the editor responding to last week ’s story on organic milk vs regular milk .
Here are excerpts from a couple of them :
Nancy Moysiuk , from Etobicoke writes : “ Your comments that organic milk is no different than conventional milk is the same argument the agricultural industry states to deride organic produce .
Maybe the tests being used are not the right ones to detect subtle differences … ”
Mathilde Andres of Harmony Organic Dairy writes : “ Our heifers are older when they calve , our cows do not have a calf every year … and most importantly we do not feed for high milk production .
Our objective is healthy , long - living cows .
The higher price for organic milk is due to a well - deserved premium to the farmer to help with higher production costs , for example organic feed ( which means GMO - free and grown without chemical fertilizers and pesticides and is three times more expensive to buy … . ”
Symphony in the Barn 2018
Meanwhile Glencolton Farms is planning another Symphony in the Barn musical event on August 3 to 5 , 2018 .
Glencolton Farms is now selling organic meat , bread and baking on Saturday mornings along the rainbow wall , at the ( year - round ) Village Market , located in the Toronto Waldorf School at 9100 Bathurst St .
While bridge construction is underway over the summer , you can access the Market from Bathurst Glen Drive , just a little west of Bathurst .
Just a few months ago , Barack Obama and the Democrats were handed the presidency , the House and the Senate , thanks in large part to the missteps and ineptitude of the Republican Party .
No one in the GOP was free from blame — certainly not President Bush and particularly not Congressional Republicans .
As Obama easily defeated John McCain , most observers believed the Republican Party was headed for an extended stay in political purgatory .
While I did n’t like it , I felt that the party was getting what it deserved .
One would have thought the Democrats were ready to roll .
After all , the electoral preference was clear for most of last year and the November results were never really in doubt .
There were months of time for meticulous planning , and if the Obama campaign and its remarkable discipline were any indication , most expected a smooth start .
It ’s now been a month with the Democrats completely in charge , and it ’s been somewhat rocky .
If this continues , Obama and his party risk making the Republicans look capable by comparison .
Perhaps the most obvious mistakes the new administration has made have been the cabinet appointments .
It ’s unclear whether these mistakes resulted from a flawed vetting process , a misguided belief that the appointees ’ political baggage would not sink their nomination , or a combination of the two .
Nevertheless , the overall impression is one of sloppiness and disorganization .
Preceding Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner ’s troubles — due to unpaid taxes — were those of New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson .
On the same morning that Tom Daschle ’s cabinet withdrawal was announced , Nancy Killefer , Obama ’s choice for the newly created position of Chief White House Performance Officer , announced that she was also stepping aside because of , yet again , tax problems .
Rounding out the turbulent appointment process was the withdrawal of New Hampshire Republican Sen. Judd Gregg , whom Obama had appointed as his ( second ) choice for Commerce Secretary .
Less visible but more significant were the errors Obama and his administration made in the crafting of and justification for the massive economic stimulus package .
Put simply , Obama ceded far too much control of the process to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid .
As a result , the bill , which Obama told Americans on numerous occasions was vital to avert a catastrophe , is laden with just the sort of projects and earmarks for which Congress — under Democratic and Republican leadership — has earned record low approval ratings , and against which Obama campaigned .
A few examples of the “ urgent ” measures in the bill include $ 1 billion for the census , $ 300 million to buy hybrid cars for the federal government , $ 50 million for the National Endowment for the Arts , $ 30 million for salt marsh harvest mice in the San Francisco area and $ 8 billion for new high - speed railways , including one connecting Los Angeles and Las Vegas .
Not coincidentally , I suspect , the San Francisco area is represented by Pelosi , and Nevada by Reid .
Pelosi and Reid had also promised the public 48 hours to review the stimulus bill before putting it to a vote — a reflection , no doubt , of Obama ’s promise of unprecedented transparency .
Yet when all was said and done , not only did the public not have 48 hours of review , members of Congress , those who were actually voting on the measure , had only a mere 10 hours to review a bill of nearly 1100 pages .
Why the rush ?
While I ’m sure Pelosi and other Democrats would point to the urgency of our economic situation as the reason , Obama did n’t seem particularly concerned about the need for immediate action , waiting several days to sign the bill into law .
The contradiction between the words and actions of Obama , Pelosi and Reid was striking , and the entire process lacked the discipline for which Obama ’s campaign was so often praised .
Perhaps this was because Pelosi and Reid were running this show , an ominous sign .
As I watched President Obama speak in Denver ahead of signing the Stimulus Bill , I was struck by the fact that we may be witnessing the beginnings of a permanent campaign on the part of the man who just won the election .
Never have I seen any president take a bill signing ceremony “ on the road , ” yet Obama did .
Nor do I recall any president signing a bill in a campaign rally - like setting .
Both had the atmosphere of a candidate in the midst of an election and neither seems worthy of the office Obama now holds .
Additionally , I ca n’t think of one day since the inauguration that Obama has n’t graced the television with his presence , and while the president is certainly the most visible public figure in America and should be seen and heard , there must be such a thing as an Obama - overload .
This same campaign - like mentality also seemed to be in effect at the president ’s prime time news conference last week .
There were multiple times in the course of the hour - long event when Obama made a point of reminding viewers that many of the country ’s current problems were ones he had merely “ inherited . ”
While this may be true , it had the unattractive feel of someone trying to shirk the responsibilities of the presidency .
After all , this is the same guy who reportedly gloated , “ I won ” to justify dismissing concerns about the stimulus bill expressed by members of the House GOP Leadership .
Obama ca n’t have it both ways .
He did indeed win , and in choosing to seek the highest office in the land , he tacitly acknowledged that upon victory , he would assume full responsibility for everything .
Constantly reminding Americans that he did n’t start the fire wo n’t effectively avert their nervousness .
Blaming Bush was effective during the campaign , but in continuing to do so , Obama again comes across as a permanent candidate rather than a self - assured president .
Are we in for four years of the Candidate - in - Chief and a White House in constant campaign mode ?
I hope not .
President Obama is intelligent and very politically astute .
The same can be said of his advisors — many of whom helped run his remarkable campaign .
The first month , however , was not a strong one for him or his party , and the heavy involvement of Pelosi , Reid and other Democratic notables played no small part in the bumpy start .
The campaign is over now , however , and the real work has begun .
The tools for successful campaigning are different from the tools for successful governing .
Will Obama and the Democrats be able to govern as effectively as they raise campaign funds and excite voters ?
While the first month has n’t inspired confidence , there is time for improvement .
Obama must limit the influence of the Democratic leadership in Congress , and he must approach the presidency with the seriousness and gravity the office and the moment require .
If he can do this , he and his party will prosper , and more importantly , so will the country .
Slight Cut in Salt Intake Would Mean Fewer Heart Attacks , Deaths
Even a slight cut in salt intake could cut heart attacks , a study says .
Mar. 12 -- WEDNESDAY , March 11 ( HealthDay News ) --
If Americans cut just one gram of salt from their daily diet , there would be 250,000 fewer new cases of heart disease and more than 200,000 fewer deaths over a decade , a new study suggests .
And , though doctors have long known that too much salt is linked with high blood pressure and heart disease , Americans are using 50 percent more salt than they did in the 1970s -- and blood pressure rates have risen by almost the same percentage , the study authors said .
" We found that very small reductions in salt intake would have very large health benefits in the U.S. population , " said lead researcher Dr. Kirsten Bibbins - Domingo , an assistant professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of California , San Francisco .
" We found that everyone in the U.S. would benefit , but the benefits would be particularly great for African - Americans , who are more likely to have high blood pressure and whose blood pressure is more likely to be sensitive to salt , " she said .
Currently , Americans consume 9 grams to 12 grams of salt a day , with much of it coming from processed foods .
This total is far more salt than is recommended by many health organizations , which say you should only have 5 grams to 6 grams a day , Bibbins - Domingo said .
Bibbins - Domingo was to present the findings Wednesday at the American Heart Association 's Cardiovascular Disease Epidemiology and Prevention annual conference , in Palm Harbor , Fla .
For the study , the researchers used a computer simulation called the Coronary Heart Disease Policy Model to estimate the impact of reducing salt by 0 grams to 6 grams on heart disease and deaths from heart disease .
The model said that , between 2010 and 2019 , there could be more than 800,000 " life years " saved for every gram of salt removed from the diet .
If 6 grams a day were cut from people 's diets , there would be 1.4 million fewer cases of heart disease and 1.1 million fewer deaths .
Just cutting salt intake by 3 grams a day would mean 6 percent fewer new cases of heart disease , 8 percent fewer heart attacks and 3 percent fewer deaths .
These benefits would be even greater for blacks -- there would be 10 percent fewer new cases of heart disease , 13 percent fewer heart attacks and 6 percent fewer deaths , the study said .
" Reductions in salt are difficult for individuals to achieve , because most of the salt in the diet is from processed food , not from salt added to food at the table or while cooking , " Bibbins - Domingo said .
" Our results suggest that very small reductions in the salt in processed food -- reductions that would not be noticeable in the tastes of most foods -- could lead to the reductions in heart disease and deaths that we model here . "
The food industry could take steps to voluntarily reduce salt in processed foods , as has been done in the United Kingdom , Bibbins - Domingo said .
" Policy makers could also achieve these objectives through regulation .
Such steps , in addition to efforts on the part of individuals to be mindful of their salt intake , could lead to improved heart health across the U.S. "
Dr. Gregg C. Fonarow , a professor of cardiology at the University of California , Los Angeles , agreed that reducing salt in your diet could reduce your blood pressure , lowering your odds of developing heart disease .
" The findings of this study are highly dependent on a number of presumptions , some of which have not been tested in randomized clinical trials .
Nevertheless , better control of blood pressure in the U.S. would be expected to result in large reductions in clinical events , " he said .
The American Heart Association recommends that healthy adults eat less than 2.3 grams of sodium a day , Fonarow noted .

Last night on Bill O'Reilly 's
Fox show , warming up for President Obama 's speech , Karl Rove helpfully wants that he might be getting overexposed :
O'Reilly : I do n't --
I do n't know -- and he 's gonna take most of the hour , because all the networks are gonna show him now , he 's on every network -- No American Idol tonight , all you people singing and dancing , you 're not gonna get it tonight !
But I 'm just worried he 's going to lose everybody because he 's just going to be saying the same thing we 've heard a million times before .
Rove :
Well , he does need to say something new , but it needs to be something people find credible and achievable .
But you 're right , he 's getting -- there is a danger of getting overexposed here .
I wrote a column last week in the Wall Street Journal saying that he was winging it , that they were just throwing things out there without knowing exactly how they were going to resolve them , whether it was the stimulus bill where they let Congress write it , or Guantanamo , where they said we 're going to close it but we do n't know what we 're going to do , or nullifying all the authorities on enhanced interrogation techniques and then realizing they needed to have some such authorities .
So he 's gotta be careful tonight that he does not sound like he 's winging it .
He 's also got to be worried about overexposure .
I mean , in the first month , he has traveled more than any president in history .
He has been gone from Washington more days than any president in their first month in office .
And he 's been around the country , getting on the television , doing events to draw attention to himself -- there is a danger of being overexposed , particularly if it sounds like he is saying the same thing .
One can perhaps understand why the person whose job it was to handle George W. Bush would be sensitive about public exposure to the president .
After all , his experience was that the more the public saw his charge , the less they liked him .
I do n't think President Obama has that problem , though .
Now , it 's true that Obama needs to be surrounded by more , similarly effective voices who can do some of the heavy message lifting .
It 's an unfortunate fact that so far he 's having to do nearly all of it himself .
But when Karl Rove offers Democrats helpful advice like this , one can't help but utter a low mordant chortle .
After all , what 's killing Republicans in the polls right now is how effective Obama has been when he gets out in public .
He stayed out of the public eye for the better of the week the stimulus bill was getting under way , and he paid for it by letting Republicans briefly get the upper hand on the public - relations war .
He 's going to need help .
But Obama is his own best weapon right now , and he'd be foolish not to use it .
Karl 's kindly advice notwithstanding
A little more than a year before he blithely confessed to masterminding the largest Ponzi scheme in history , Bernie Madoff attended the wedding of his niece .
That Saturday evening , September 29 , 2007 , Shana Madoff , the daughter of his younger brother , Peter , his partner for almost four decades at Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities , married a former official at the Securities and Exchange Commission , an irony that Bernie could n’t quite keep to himself .
He tossed an arm around the neck of one young guest and directed the young man ’s attention across the dance floor , toward a clean - cut group sipping cocktails .
“ See them , ” Madoff said , pale - blue eyes flashing incongruously in his kindly face .
“ That ’s the enemy . ”
There were a hundred guests at the Bowery Hotel , some of whom had their life savings invested with Bernie .
Tables were set with tasteful linen and beautiful flowers .
The event commingled business and family — for the Madoffs , business was family .
Bernie Madoff liked to brag about what he ’d built over nearly 50 years , disquisitions that often began with the phrase “ We Madoffs . ”
His sons , Andy , 42 , and Mark , 44 , ran the trading floor on the nineteenth floor of the company ’s multistory offices in the Lipstick Building on Third Avenue and 53rd Street , two floors above where Madoff supposedly managed billions of dollars of other people ’s money .
Peter Madoff , 62 , was chief compliance officer and his inseparable right hand .
The bride , Shana , 38 , was a compliance lawyer .
Bernie ’s wife , Ruth , once his bookkeeper , still maintained an office there .
As the toasts began , Bernie headed to the terrace .
He is n’t a toast - maker .
He has a tic , a nervous schoolboy ’s double blink , as if cleaning a windshield , and occasionally a stammer .
Outside , the night air was crisp with the first hint of fall .
Bernie sat down and lit a cigar , his favorite , a Davidoff .
He wore a black tuxedo and one of his antique watches , a Patek Philippe or a Rolex no doubt , fastidiously matched to one of his several wedding bands .
He sat at the center of a small cluster of well - wishers , big shots themselves who were paying their respects to an unlikely Wall Street titan .
Unassuming Uncle Bernie , as people called him , was a legend .
In the seventies and eighties , he ’d helped revolutionize how stocks were traded .
Along the way , with apparent effortlessness , he ’d turned money manager , rising to become , by the evidence of detailed statements he regularly sent to his legions of investors , one of the more successful ones in the world .
On paper , he ’d built fortunes for some of the admirers who now crowded around him and for much of the guest list .
Bernie basked in the praise .
He loved that wealthy people counted on him , loved the adulation .
“ It ennobled him , ” one friend says .
At the same time , he sometimes let slip a hint of contempt for those he took care of , as if they did n’t appreciate him enough .
After all , he was the one who paid the kids ’ tuitions and the country - club dues of the fancy guests who now drank his booze — Bernie ’s labors had indirectly financed that too .
On the terrace , blue smoke drifted in the air .
Bernie , meditative for once , told a guest that he could n’t quite believe he was at a wedding at the Bowery Hotel .
His grandparents had made their lives on the Lower East Side , a stone ’s throw from where he sat with his tux and his multi- thousand - dollar watch .
He ’d lived with them for a while , and that evening , he recalled how poor and run-down their neighborhood had looked .
He gestured in the direction of the Lower East Side .
“ I fought my way out of there , ” Bernie told a guest .
“ I had to scrape and battle and work really hard . ”
There was an edge of anger in his voice — he ’d suffered so others could live easy .
A little more than a year later , at about four in the afternoon on December 11 , J. Ezra Merkin was called out of a meeting in his hedge fund ’s offices at 450 Park Avenue to look at the Wall Street Journal online , where the outlines of Bernie Madoff ’s story had been posted .
He felt like dynamite had gone off — he could n’t get his bearings .
He felt as if he could n’t hear .
Merkin ’s largest fund , Ascot , which invested the money of a large swath of the Upper East Side Jewish elite , along with that of illustrious schools and charities , had been completely invested in Madoff — some $ 1.8 billion .
Merkin ’s funds were among the largest of Madoff ’s so - called feeder funds , and the ones with the deepest roots in New York City .
( Walter Noel ’s Fairfield Greenwich Group was the largest ; Noel had invested $ 6.9 billion with Bernie . )
In letters Merkin sent to his investors , he said he had no choice but to unwind his funds .
He was shutting down not only Ascot but Gabriel and Ariel , his two other large funds , which had invested perhaps a third of their money in Madoff .
In a letter written the same day the story broke , Ezra told investors that he , too , was a victim .
“ I have also suffered major losses , ” he wrote , signing it “ very truly yours . ”
On the surface , it seemed unlikely that the fates of Bernard L. Madoff , 70 , and J. Ezra Merkin , 55 , should be linked .
Madoff was a scrappy outer - borough striver .
He still had , as one observer put it , a “ whiff of Queens ” about him .
The nuances of economic thought did n’t interest him , and when talk turned to politics , Bernie all but glazed over .
His primary interest had always been pennies and dimes and dollars , the mundanities of money .
He did n’t look like a leader of Wall Street , let alone a monster .
In a crowd , he barely registered — if you did n’t know who he was , you might not notice anything but his doughy smile .
In the world of the Upper East Side , everyone took notice of J. Ezra Merkin .
He was an intellectual showman , a marvel of erudition , quoting Hamlet or Nathan Detroit , holding forth on Jewish law or the stylistic shifts of Mark Rothko , whose paintings he collected .
He not only ran money , as Bernie did , and served his community as a leader of charities and religious groups , but he was chairman of GMAC , the finance arm of General Motors .
In a community that values intellect , piety , generosity , and the wealth that is their indispensable underpinning , Merkin was a model of success .
“ Pious , prayerful , and profound , ” said a fellow congregant .
Said a business colleague , “ He is one of the wisest men on Wall Street . ”
But Merkin , too , was a striver , though the sources of his drive were not as obvious .
Merkin is a child of privilege .
His father , Hermann Merkin , had made a fortune on Wall Street and much more .
The elder Merkin had a glowing reputation as a philanthropist and Jewish leader , co-founding the Fifth Avenue Synagogue and underwriting a galaxy of Jewish charities .
And yet , for all his good works , Hermann was a remote , withholding father .
“ Short of not living at home he could n’t have been less involved , ” says Sol Merkin , Ezra ’s younger brother .
At home , Ezra ’s parents enforced thrift .
For all the comfort of his home — there was a chauffeur , a cook , a laundress — Hermann made a point of not pampering .
Money does no good , was a kind of family motto , and Hermann and his wife acted as if even slight exposure might ruin the children .
Ezra shared a bedroom with two brothers , and all six kids sometimes hid food in case there was n’t enough to go around .
For Ezra there was special pressure .
“ Ezra , as the oldest son , got a lot in the way of expectation but not much encouragement on the other end , ” says his sister Daphne , who has written movingly about her family .
Ezra responded to his distant father by pursuing him assiduously , a competitive urge that led him into philanthropy , religion , and finance , and until Madoff revealed his fraud , Ezra appeared to outdo Hermann — most notably , in the scale of his fortune .
From his father Ezra inherited another , more problematic legacy .
The elder Merkin knew Bernie Madoff and admired his successes .
Bernie ’s unfinished edges did n’t matter to him — the toughness was the point .
“ Hermann was a tough immigrant , and he did n’t distinguish people so much by background , ” says one person who knew him .
In the early nineties , when Ezra was looking for candidates to manage the huge sums he was increasingly able to raise , his father ’s imprimatur must have helped sell him on the legendary Bernie Madoff , who , it turned out , underwrote a good deal of Ezra ’s lifestyle .
At the heights of Ezra ’s hedge - fund business , in the middle of this decade , he earned perhaps $ 35 million a year simply for funneling money to Bernie Madoff .
Bernie Madoff ’s story begins as that of the classic Jewish outsider , storming the Wall Street gates in pursuit of fortune .
He entered the financial business through “ a dirty , disgusting outback , ” as one of Bernie ’s competitors explained .
As a young man in Queens , he was a swimmer , fit and tanned .
In 1959 , he married his Far Rockaway high - school girlfriend , a fun , energetic blonde named Ruthie Alpern , who ’d been voted Josie College , a preppy before preppies were popular .
In 1960 , the year he graduated Hofstra , Bernie borrowed space from Ruthie ’s accountant father and founded Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities , funded , the story went , with $ 5,000 saved from jobs as a lifeguard and sprinkler installer .
At the time , the New York Stock Exchange dominated Wall Street trading , and it was an exclusive club , rigged for the benefit of its members .
To buy or sell a stock , you went through a specialist stationed on the floor of the exchange who made money on every trade .
It was a virtual monopoly , among the easiest money on Wall Street , and a fraternity that did n’t welcome the likes of Bernie .
So Bernard L. Madoff
Securities entered the over - the - counter market - making business , trading second - or third - tier companies shunned by the NYSE — “ unseasoned ” companies , Bernie called them .
It was rugged competition , a constant turf war among “ street - smart , scrappy , tenacious guys , ” says an early competitor .
Bernie quickly developed a reputation for efficient , meticulous execution , and did well for a niche player .
Carl Shapiro , who made a fortune in the textile business , recalls that 50 years ago , it could take weeks to unload a block of stock .
“ This kid [ Bernie ] stood in front of me and said , ‘ I can do it in three days , ’ ” Shapiro told the Palm Beach Daily News .
“ And he did . ”
Bernie , though , had in mind a larger target , the monopoly of the New York Stock Exchange .
“ Back then , it was an incredible dynamic , ” says one competitor .
“ Bernie was sort of against the rest of the world . ”
Everyone knew the specialist system ripped off investors , artificially inflating the spread between the buy and sell prices .
Madoff made it his mission to bring down the corrupt system , a mission happily aligned with his financial interests .
“ Bernie was the king of democratization , ” says Eric Weiner , a reporter who covered him in the early days .
“ He was messianic about this . ”
He pushed to automate the system , listing buyers and sellers on a computer that anyone could access .
He won that battle — technology was inevitable even then — and quickly moved on to the next .
“ We came up with the concept of developing a screen - based trading mechanism , ” Bernie explained to a conference .
“ That was the start of NASDAQ . ”
By the eighties , the Madoffs had taken huge market share and Bernie began to accumulate the trappings of the financial success he ’d long dreamed of : impeccable suits , antique watches , and , later , far - flung homes and a plane on which he had his initials painted .
Still , Bernie ’s origins were always there .
He was an outer - borough kid , and he held fast to his identity and , with it , his class resentments .
As his success grew , he liked to make fun of the types who ’d once raced past him , overeducated college kids he now hired .
Bernie recounted , “ They just spend too much time thinking … You could actually watch them …
My brother and I and my sons would look at them , saying , ‘ Well ? ’
And they would say , ‘ I ’m getting there . ’
By that time , the price would usually have moved against us . ”
The joke about Hermann Merkin was that he did n’t need a telephone at work since he did n’t heed anyone ’s advice .
A German immigrant , he ’d made dozens of millions investing in stocks , shipping , private equity .
But his ambitions were broader .
In 1958 , when Ezra was 5 , Hermann co-founded the Fifth Avenue Synagogue , a congregation that would become perhaps the richest in the country .
The synagogue , a monument to Hermann ’s accomplishments , would be under his control for years .
And he guided it forcefully — he had little patience for communal decisions — turning it into a haven for modern Orthodoxy as well as a center for his own religious education .
Hermann put a premium on education .
Yanked out of school as a teenager , he was a frustrated intellectual .
At home , a learned Jewish text was often open on his desk , next to the Wall Street Journal .
He regularly attended Talmud classes at the synagogue , until a few days before he died at 91 in 1999 .
Ezra followed his father in almost all things — most of his life , Ezra , too , has attended Talmud classes .
But Ezra ’s imitation was a form of flattery lost on Hermann .
“ He did n’t love it , ” says one person close to the family .
Hermann did n’t express pride in the children .
The exception was intellect , which Hermann not only encouraged but wanted on display .
Hermann invited Israeli prime ministers , wealthy Wall Street businessmen , and rising politicians to dinner .
The kids sat at one end of the table and listened to the adult discussion , often dominated by Hermann .
But once a week , on Shabbos , Hermann ceded the floor to his eldest son , his Torah prodigy .
Wearing a tie , Ezra commenced an exegesis of the next day ’s Torah portion .
He was professorial , playing it up .
It was one of the few things Ezra did that elicited unrestrained paternal approval .
After high school at Ramaz , the Upper East Side Orthodox day school , Ezra attended two yeshivas in Israel , then Columbia and Harvard Law , and swiftly climbed through the world his father built .
“ There was never a time when he was n’t a success , ” says an acquaintance .
He made a pit stop at top - tier law firm Milbank , Tweed , but in the early eighties , he jumped to finance , his father ’s field and the glamour sport of Wall Street at the time .
He went to work at a hedge fund run by Alan Slifka , a friend of Hermann’s .
There he met Joel Greenblatt , who founded Gotham Capital in 1985 , where Ezra later worked as an analyst , and , says Greenblatt , a good one .
From early on , though , it was clear that Ezra ’s unique talent did not involve managing money .
“ It ’s very , very difficult for Ezra to make decisions , ” says one money manager who worked with him over the years .
He worried about the big picture , fretted over allocations .
His gift was that he “ was a world - class salesman , ” says the money manager .
Ezra saw himself in the investor .
“ He recognized that many people did n’t have confidence [ to make investment decisions ] , ” says the money manager .
“ He recognized that if people had confidence in him , then he could give them confidence . ”
With investors , Ezra was a showman .
He likes a stage , and likes to show off his storehouse of knowledge .
He could talk Talmud with rabbis , or politics with a Ph.D. ; he sent articles to Ruth Madoff , which Bernie shared and reported .
“ It made me better read , ” Bernie would say .
Ezra could be impatient with slower minds — “ uninhibited ” in his disregard , says one .
But with those he considered equals , and with his clients , he was a pleaser .
“ He does not like to disappoint , ” says one friend .
And for all his erudition , he had another winning quality .
He did n’t mind poking fun at himself .
The key to success is sincerity , he ’d confide .
If you can fake it , you ’ve got everything .
A couple of business associates later complained , as one put it , “ He ’ll talk about things factually but not necessarily in any relation to facts .
For some reason , he makes things up , and not for any advantage to himself , necessarily . ”
Perhaps rounding the edges made for a more convincing presentation .
And most found him convincing .
At the UJA - Federation , where he headed the investment committee for ten years , “ he would speak conceptually of economic matters , ” says one attendee from outside the financial world .
“ The word you heard after he left the room was ‘ dazzling . ’ ”
But Ezra ’s most potent asset as a financier was his network of connections .
Among wealthy Upper East Side Jews , philanthropic , religious , social , family , and business circles overlap .
“ A shtetl , ” says one member , Merryl Tisch of the real - estate family , though not disparagingly .
Ezra was born to these circles , and after his father died , Ezra quickly filled his shoes .
In 2001 , he was elected president of the Fifth Avenue Synagogue , and in the same year he was elected to Yeshiva ’s board of trustees , where his father had served for four decades .
Ezra followed his father into charity work , too , giving tirelessly of his time .
All for three Diet Cokes a year , says one member of the UJA .
Usually , Ezra gravitated to the investment committees , a perch from which to help institutions he cared deeply about , as he saw it .
Ezra left Gotham in 1988 , partly because Greenblatt was not interested in growing the size of his fund , which wasted Ezra ’s chief talent .
He took his investors with him and started Gabriel Capital .
Ezra ’s model , common enough on Wall Street , was to raise money and funnel it to talented managers in exchange for a fee .
Later , furious investors said they ’d been led to believe that Ezra was managing their money .
But those who worked closest with him knew better .
Ezra raised the money — “ He was the golden goose , ” one put it — and then relied on talented money managers , whom he had a knack for spotting .
By 1992 , Ezra was raising money for Stephen Feinberg , a manager whose private - equity firm Cerberus later bought controlling shares in Chrysler and GMAC .
And he ’d begun investing with Bernie .
But the first of Ezra ’s finds was Victor Teicher .
Teicher , a colorful , uncontrollable character with a faulty internal censor , was not the confidence - instilling type to put in front of prospective investors .
But he had an instinctive gift for financial opportunity .
Early on , he concentrated on merger arbitrage , betting on whether one firm would take over another .
In this , he had some help .
In 1986 , he was investigated for insider trading in connection with what was known as the Yuppie Five case , in which young professionals at blue - chip firms passed along inside information about upcoming mergers .
The indictment might have put Teicher out of business , but he had been earning returns as high as 20 percent a year , and so most of his investors stayed .
Merkin too was enticed by the returns , and beginning in 1988 , the year Teicher was indicted , he started putting a substantial portion of the money he raised for Gabriel Capital with Teicher .
Ezra kept 20 percent of the profits for his troubles , and gave Teicher half .
Since Ezra was technically raising money for Gabriel and its offshore twin , Ariel , he did n’t need to cloud the waters by mentioning Teicher ’s controversial name , a lapse that New York University alleges in a lawsuit .
In 1992 , the year Teicher was sentenced to eighteen months in prison , he was running about $ 500 million , perhaps three - quarters of that from Ezra ’s investors .
Teicher spent most of 1994 in prison .
When he got out expecting to return to work , Ezra decided to separate .
The business was running well without Teicher ’s day - to - day oversight .
And , Ezra told Teicher , his lawyers thought working with a convicted felon was n’t a great idea .
Ezra threatened to yank his money .
So Teicher gave in .
In January 1995 , Ezra took over the staff , put Gabriel Capital ’s name on the door , and hired Nathan Leight , now at Terrapin Partners , to manage the money .
Teicher operated on his own until August 1998 , when Ezra called again .
It was a troubled year for the markets , and he needed help .
Teicher , then running about $ 50 million , jumped at the chance and was soon managing roughly $ 1 billion for Ezra as an independent operator .
It was a profitable arrangement for both — Teicher turned the fund around , and he might have continued except that in January 2000 , with his appeals exhausted , the SEC finally banned Teicher from running other people ’s money .
Ezra replaced Teicher .
But by then , Ezra was also showering money on another genius : Bernie Madoff .
It is impossible to know when Madoff ’s scheme began , or whether , at some point , there was an innocent explanation .
But from almost the beginning , there were clues that something was not quite right .
Bernie had started managing money by 1962 , when he was 24 years old and raising capital for his market - making business .
Bernie found a ready and able partner in Frank Avellino , an accountant who worked for Bernie ’s father - in - law .
Avellino used semi-grammatical English but compensated with boundless energy .
He recruited another accountant , Michael Bienes , who also knew a good thing when he saw it .
Soon the two were making an extraordinary ( and premonitory ) pitch : 13.5 to 20 percent returns guaranteed , or they ’d make up the difference .
In some years , the Dow collapsed by nearly 30 percent , which made Avellino and Bienes ’s promise extremely hard to keep — unless , as seems likely , Bernie was cooking the books even then .
And yet 30 years later , when the SEC effectively booted Avellino and Bienes out of the business — they were n’t registering investors , it turns out — they ’d set up accounts for 3,200 investors with Bernie .
After years of supposed gains , those accounts were worth almost half a billion dollars .
The SEC ordered $ 454 million returned to customers .
Bernie showed the SEC his books and maintained that he could return any money requested .
Fortunately for Madoff , many customers were like Cynthia Crane , a cabaret singer from the West Village , who decided not to redeem .
Bienes told Crane , who ’d inherited some family money , “ It ’s okay , you can keep the money with Bernie Madoff , ” which eased her worries .
The irony is that by then , Bernie Madoff did n’t need the money .
His legitimate and heavily regulated market - making business tossed off cash .
He executed as many as 15 percent of all the NYSE ’s trades .
“ In the eighties , Bernie was probably making as much as $ 25 million a year , ” estimates Kenny Pasternak , a longtime competitor .
“ I think the guy made hundreds of millions over his career . ”
For Merkin , hanging his Rothkos was a grand gesture of self - definition , like that of a Frick or a Carnegie .
Soon , Bernie started spending his money .
In 1994 , he bought a house now worth $ 9.4 million at a good address in Palm Beach .
By that point , the once - exclusive haven for Waspy heiresses was filled with Bernie ’s kind of people , Jewish entrepreneurs with rough edges , unimproved accents , and one generation of wealth .
“ Bernie was a regular guy , my kind of guy , nothing flashy , a mensch , ” says one investor who made his money in real estate .
Bernie joined the Palm Beach Country Club , the Jewish club , paying the $ 300,000 entry fee and assuring the officers of his solid philanthropic reputation , a club requirement .
At the club , he was n’t much of a presence .
“ He was always by himself primarily with his wife or his brother , ” says another investor .
In Palm Beach , Bernie ’s reputation as a money manager had preceded him , and his remoteness only fueled it .
“ Everybody said , ‘ You got to go with Bernie , ’ ” says one early investor .
That was the phrase of choice around the club : “ I ’m with Bernie . ”
Though no one could say with any precision how Bernie made his money , he was too ordinary , too much of a mensch , for an air of mystery to coalesce around him .
He said his profits were ordinary , too .
“ I do n’t make a lot , but I ’m consistent , ” he told one investor .
When people asked about his methods , he talked about his long experience on the Street .
“ We ’ve been at this 30 years , give us some credit … ” was the idea he put forward .
But he never pushed .
There was never a hard sell , no obvious hustling .
What you saw was what you got — or so you thought .
If investors had known where to look , they might have spotted something alarming , Bernie ’s weird side .
Bernie — whose office is in the famously ovoid Lipstick Building — could n’t bear curves .
“ He was paranoid about them , ” says one employee .
In one office , he drank out of square drinking glasses , stored his pencils in square holders , tossed his trash into square cans .
He insisted that the blinds align with window frames —
“ We used a tape measure , ” says the employee .
He liked computer screens to stand straight up and down .
Madoff , though , kept his own mess , his own monstrousness , hidden away .
His operation was relentlessly predatory , systematically looting charities , longtime friends , family , as well as investors spread around the globe .
And yet it seems unlikely that he was a sociopath in the classic sense , someone indifferent to the feelings of those around him .
In daily life , he was n’t callous or cruel .
Just the opposite .
He valued people ’s good opinion and wanted to impress .
He did n’t simply treat people as means to an end .
He was a great boss .
He took care of his employees as if they were family and , until the end , of his investors , too .
“ Everybody relied on Bernie , ” says one longtime investor .
“ He was one thing you thought you could count on .
And he enjoyed being counted on . ”
And yet , of course , to provide for someone is to have power over them , and Bernie liked that , too .
Now it was Bernie from Queens who waved his hand and granted entry to the magic kingdom where he minted money — and Bernie did n’t let in everyone .
Bernie was simultaneously compassionate and grand .
As he told one charity : “ I promised the Steinbergs I ’d take care of the American Jewish Congress , ” which was the Steinbergs ’ favorite cause and which gave Bernie $ 11 million , more than half of its endowment .
Bernie loved the Bernie Madoff he ’d become , a Wall Street legend , a protector of charities , a man who was wealthy and so much more .
Even if he could n’t be that man without stealing .
People later wondered how Bernie could ruin so many people he seemingly cared about .
But for decades he did n’t hurt anyone .
In fact , there were many that he helped .
“ I lived off Bernie for years , ” one investor says , and he was speaking for many .
In all likelihood , Bernie did n’t pocket much of the money .
He always paid out promptly , never shorted anyone .
And money was flowing out all the time , in large quantities , one continual bank run .
Hadassah , for instance , invested $ 90 million but over the years withdrew $ 130 million .
Some viewed Bernie and Ezra as two sides of the same coin .
One was down to earth , the other positively ethereal ; one was hiding in plain sight , the other ostentatiously public .
They needed each other .
“ Ezra was captivated by Madoff , ” says one person who knows him , especially , perhaps , compared to his father .
“ Bernie Madoff must have seemed like a kind , haimish sort of guy compared to my father , ” says Daphne .
Merkin did n’t exactly think of Bernie as a peer .
To him , Bernie was an auto mechanic , a blue - collar technician focused on what was under the hood .
“ I ’m only interested in where the market is heading in the next fifteen minutes , ” Bernie sometimes said .
A man like that could bear down on the details so the Ezra Merkins of the world could concentrate on finer things .
For Ezra , Madoff ’s returns were n’t eye - popping — Teicher did better — though his average of more than 12 percent a year was more than respectable .
But the real selling point was Bernie ’s consistency — barely a down month in more than a decade .
There were many for whom Madoff ’s consistency was a giant red flag .
The SEC missed it , but Teicher , the inside trader , was a skeptic .
Ezra and Teicher talked about Madoff on and off for years .
Teicher scoffed .
“ The thing seemed ridiculous , ” Teicher told Ezra .
But then , Ezra must have thought , Teicher generally did n’t like anyone ’s ideas but his own .
And so Ezra took Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities places Bernie could n’t have dreamed of going by himself .
The list of people and institutions that Ezra Merkin put with Bernie Madoff is a kind of Jewish social register .
There was Mort Zuckerman , the media and real - estate mogul , and Ira Rennert , chairman of Fifth Avenue Synagogue and owner of a 68 - acre oceanfront Hamptons estate .
Over 30 charities invested with Ezra , many of them with a Jewish affiliation .
Ramaz was in , as was Yeshiva .
Not every investor says they knew that Ezra ’s fund Ascot was fully invested with Madoff , an assertion that will be at issue in forthcoming lawsuits .
Ezra maintains that , at the very least , he let people know that he might invest with other managers .
And in some instances , he claims he was more direct .
In the case of Yeshiva , with perhaps the largest endowment of any nonprofit he managed , he did report a relationship with Bernie , though it appears not to have been the real one .
Ezra had served as chairman of Yeshiva ’s investment committee since about 1994 .
Not long after that , the committee directed $ 14.5 million of Yeshiva ’s endowment to Ascot , which Ezra passed along to Madoff , collecting his usual fee , initially one percent and later 1.5 percent , standard for all of Yeshiva ’s money managers .
Yeshiva saw no conflict of interest or , if it did , did n’t mind .
The university required nothing more than that those who served on the investment committee disclose that they were doing business with the university .
The 2003 disclosure to the board , a copy of which was obtained by New York Magazine , reported that Ezra was managing about 10 percent of Yeshiva ’s endowment through four different funds .
For his efforts , he collected over $ 2 million in fees , almost $ 1 million for Ascot alone .
That 2003 memo stated that Madoff was Ascot ’s “ executing broker , ” a term that means he was executing buy and sell orders , supposedly those dictated by Ascot .
In fact , though Merkin looked at Madoff ’s statements every month , and they were detailed and thorough , and questioned him about his accounts , he left the trading — or , as we now know , lack thereof — to Madoff .
Some now wonder about the propriety of the chairman of the investment committee ’s taking fees for simply passing along money to Bernie — especially since Bernie was elected to Yeshiva ’s board of trustees in 1996 , when Hermann served as vice - chairman .
Why not just give the money directly to Bernie and save Yeshiva the fee ?
To some , it seemed like Ezra was skimming profits , and from an institution he loved .
Whatever fudging there ’d been in the disclosures , Ezra did well for Yeshiva — in fourteen years , the fund grew 9 percent a year , even after subtracting losses for Madoff and expenses .
And he did well for himself ; certainly , he made at least $ 10 million from Yeshiva over his tenure .
Soon Ezra was making tens of millions a year from his funds .
And for Ezra , as for Bernie , money was n’t only money .
It was the ladder that boosted him into his father ’s world , an empyrean place that he now fully inhabited .
Ezra had arrived , and it was an occasion worth marking .
In 1995 , he paid $ 11 million for an apartment at New York ’s most prestigious address , 740 Park Avenue , where Jackie O. was raised and where John D. Rockefeller Jr. had lived .
Ezra shunned a driver for the subway , yet he purchased an eighteen - room duplex once owned by Ron Perelman , a member of his synagogue .
And in 2003 , he began to collect the Rothkos , amassing a dozen , some of which were fifteen feet high .
They make up the largest private collection in the world , worth an estimated $ 150 million .
“ I was surprised , ” says one friend .
“ It was a major statement . ”
His father might not have approved of the public display .
But Ezra had buried such concerns ( along with his father ) .
For Ezra , hanging the Rothkos was a grand gesture of self - definition , ostentatiously spiritual , like that of a Frick or a Carnegie .
Visitors are overwhelmed .
Room after room of giant Rothkos against dark tan walls .
Merkin made a point of saying that they were n’t investments ; he did n’t expect to do better than with a T - bill .
“ I think the Rothkos had a lot to do with getting over the guilt of his success , ” says a friend .
Madoff pointed to the SEC men .
“ There ’s the enemy , ” he said .
In the sublime structure Ezra Merkin had built for himself , money was the mother of beauty and refinement .
The actual business of making it amounted to a kind of plumbing , a slightly unseemly necessity , about which it was best not to go into details .
Men like Teicher , or Bernie Madoff , could roll up their sleeves and make it flow , and you could take your cut , without getting your fingernails dirty .
The details mattered less as long as the money kept flowing .
The fact that Ezra had a blind spot for the way his money was actually being made — and in this he was not so different from many others during the boom years , even his own clients — functioned as a kind of soft corruption , which could enable the hard corruption of Bernie Madoff .
As late as 2002 , Madoff could probably have sold Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities for as much as $ 1 billion .
Both Goldman Sachs and Charles Schwab were said to be interested in the market - making business .
But Bernie waved off his buyers .
“ I could n’t work for anybody , ” he said .
“ My whole family works here . ”
One of Bernie ’s competitors later reflected on Bernie ’s response .
“ In part , it resounded with me , ” he says .
“ In part , it made no sense .
He had a chance to write a billion - dollar ticket .
Why would n’t he sell it ? ”
Now , of course , the answer is clear .
Madoff was in much too deep to turn back .
The market - making and money - management businesses were both on the books ; they shared funds .
And after 2002 , the market - making business began to decline rapidly and was , at least according to the records , being subsidized by Bernie ’s money - management business .
Bernie could n’t possibly sell the business .
He could n’t let anyone see the books .
And yet one of the strangest aspects of Bernie Madoff ’s story is his unflinching pride in his success .
In May 2008 , Bernie celebrated his 70th birthday on a beach in Cabo San Lucas , Mexico , where he ’d traveled for a golf tournament .
Bernie ’s crew included his brother , Peter , and their wives and close friends .
One evening , they gathered at a quiet hotel , which had set up tables on the beach .
Candles provided much of the light .
One by one , the guests rose and toasted Bernie .
Ed Blumenfeld ’s was typical .
Blumenfeld , a real - estate developer and a considerable investor , said , as one guest recalls , “ Our lives have been enriched by knowing Bernie .
It ’s been a privilege to know him and have him part of our lives . ”
By then , Bernie must have sensed the end approaching .
But if he was anxious , he did n’t show it .
Bernie golfed and relaxed , basking in the sun and the praise .
On the beach , one guest recalls , Bernie crooned a Neil Diamond song , “ Sweet Caroline . ”
“ Where it began , I ca n’t begin to know . ”
On December 10 , his sons , Andy and Mark , talked to their father about bonuses , which Bernie suddenly insisted on paying early .
Bernie sputtered something about the business having made profits .
“ Now [ is ] a good time to distribute [ bonuses ] , ” he told them .
It did n’t make sense .
They pressed him .
Bernie seemed to be cracking .
“ He was n’t sure he would be able to hold it together , ” they later told the SEC .
Bernie insisted they talk at his apartment that evening .
Facing his sons , Bernie came out with it quickly , brutally .
“ [ I ’m ] finished , ” he said .
“ It ’s all just one big lie … ” Andy and Mark called the SEC , Bernie ’s enemy , as he ’d once put it .
The SEC contacted the FBI , which showed up at Bernie ’s apartment on December 11 .
Bernie came to the door in a pale - blue bathrobe and slippers .
“ We ’re here to find out if there ’s an innocent explanation , ” said one of the agents .
Bernie must have rehearsed this moment for years .
“ There ’s no innocent explanation , ” he said , sounding almost relieved .
Ezra Merkin is ruined .
“ His life as he knew it is over and not coming back , ” says brother Sol , adding , “ he does n’t deserve this . ”
Ezra is winding down his funds .
He ’s been all but exiled from many of the communities he cared about .
Andrew Cuomo , the New York State attorney general , is investigating whether Ezra misled the charities whose endowments he managed in order to enrich himself .
He resigned as chairman of GMAC at the insistence of the U.S. government , one condition for bailing out the lender with $ 5 billion .
For the moment , observant Ezra still sits on the bema every Saturday , in the spot designated for the synagogue president .
Some in the congregation are scandalized , and some will sue him , it is almost certain .
It ’s not practical to sue Madoff .
There are no assets left .
And so they will take their turns with Ezra — who , as general partner , is personally liable .
“ He will spend the rest of his life in court , ” says one attorney .
Ironically , the sage will plead ignorance for the remainder of his days .
And yet , in another way , it ’s not over .
It ’s just beginning .
Ezra Merkin is fascinated — “ extremely fascinated , ” he sometimes tells friends — to know what will happen next in his life .
About Madoff ’s victims , the ones whose funds Merkin was supposed to be safeguarding , he is matter - of - fact .
He tells friends , “ I lost a lot of people a lot of money . ”
There ’s something slightly obtuse in this .
Nearly every day brings accounts of shuttered charities , of retirements ruined , of houses suddenly put up for sale .
Should n’t he be rending himself ?
But he was tricked like everyone else , he says , and tells himself he ’s got to be resilient , show fortitude .
And so he talks to himself about what he has .
A loving wife , four devoted children — he is a much better father than Hermann .
“ I have to get through this , ” he tells people , if one can .
As for the future , he does n’t know what the outcome is going to be .
Ezra has lately been proclaiming himself free of the need for money and prestige , those things that shaped his life .
He can start anew , reinvent himself .
We ’ll be all right , he thinks .
Ezra understands as well as anyone the role his financial success played .
Money has been central to his life .
It put those breathtaking Rothkos on the wall and elevated him to society ’s loftiest ranks .
Things will change now .
He ’s begun to think along other lines .
He says he might pursue something more on the contemplative side , reading or writing .
Whatever this evolves into , “ it does n’t have to be a wealthy lifestyle for us to be happy , ” Ezra tells friends , then adds , “ I do n’t think . ”

The openSUSE community has published the roadmap for the 11.2 release and unveiled the schedule for the next several releases , all the way out to 2011 .
The distro will be shifting towards a fixed time - based eight - month release cycle .
Ubuntu and Fedora have both converged on six - month release cycles that are loosely pinned to the GNOME development schedule .
The openSUSE developers have rejected this approach and selected an eight - month cycle instead because they do n't believe that six months provides an adequate time window for building a quality distribution .
The new schedule was proposed in a message posted to the openSUSE mailing list by release manager Stephan Kulow .
In the e-mail , he lists the months when releases are expected to arrive and also provides some insight into the feature plan for 11.2 , the next major release .
" To give us something to plan around , we would like to propose a fixed release schedule .
As a six - month release schedule is not something we consider feasible to maintain high - quality standards , we are proposing a fixed eight - month schedule , " Kulow wrote .
OpenSUSE 11.2 , which is codenamed Fichte , is planned for November 2009 .
It will include GNOME 2.28 , KDE 4.3 , a Web - based management interface for the YaST configuration system , improved support for Netbook hardware , and could potentially use Ext4 as the default filesystem .
Subsequent releases will take place in July 2010 , March 2011 , and November 2011 .
Previous releases have generally been made at intervals of roughly 8 to 10 months , but a fixed cycle has never previously been enforced .
A strong commitment to a predetermined consistent release schedule makes it much easier for third - party developers and end -users to properly plan for releases .
It also diminishes the risk of never - ending Duke Nukem Forever development cycles .
The downside is that the pressure to ship on time can degrade release quality and also cause a distro to miss critical versions of important software components that are released too late for inclusion .
The key is to be able to work within a schedule but make allowances for deviations where it is necessary and warranted .
The new openSUSE release strategy appears more structured than the previous approach , but still not as uncompromising as Ubuntu 's rigid schedule commitment .
OpenSUSE 's build service offers a cutting - edge package set called Factory that delivers the latest unstable versions ; it seems likely that power users will have to use Factory to get more current software towards the end of the cycle .
Several people responded to Kulow 's schedule proposal by suggesting that it could be advantageous to have a " rolling " release package set that 's more stable than Factory — sort of the same idea as Debian 's " testing " channel .
OpenSUSE has evolved considerably over the past few years .
It has adopted a more inclusive and participatory development model and is attracting a growing community of volunteer contributors .
It has also benefited from significant technical improvements that are making it a more competitive choice for the desktop .
Although openSUSE has made a lot of progress , it also recently suffered some setbacks and lost several fulltime developers during Novell 's layoffs .
The new schedule and the 11.2 roadmap both look like strong steps to keep development on the right track .

The first person to die of swine flu was a 39 - year - old tax inspector whose job required her to make door - to - door visits , putting her in contact with at least 300 unsuspecting members of the public when the disease was at its most virulent , Mexican authorities have said .
Maria Adela Gutierrez , a census - taker in the southern tourist city of Oaxaca , was admitted to a local hospital on 8 April and died five days later .
She 'd been suffering acute respiratory problems , exacerbated by diabetes and severe diarrhoea , and is believed to have infected scores of people .
The story of her death , which occurred three weeks before the virus was officially identified , came as Mexico remained on a state of high alert , with schools , government offices and many workplaces closed .
The suspected death toll in Mexico reached 152 last night , with over 2,000 people infected .
In the US the confirmed total of cases jumped to 64 ; California , with more than a dozen infected , declared a public health emergency and the World Health Organisation said it had notification of 79 confirmed cases worldwide .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Ms Gutierrez 's demise may fuel controversy over Mexico 's handling of the outbreak , which has been criticised as chaotic and secretive .
Authorities at Oaxaca 's Hospital Civil Aurelio Valdivieso , where she was treated , did not confirm that an infectious disease had broken out there until 21 April , by which time one further patient had also died .
Doctors initially thought Gutierrez was suffering from pneumonia .
But when 16 further patients exhibited signs of severe respiratory infection , they established a quarantine area around the emergency room .
Shortly afterwards , state health authorities began to track down every person she 'd had recent contact with and conduct check - ups .
That discreet search suggested that Gutierrez may have unwittingly been a latter - day " Typhoid Mary " .
It turned up more than 300 people , including many members of the public whom she 'd interviewed as she knocked on doors in late March and early April .
Local sources told Veratect , the US disease - tracking company which sounded the alarm , that between 33 and 61 of those interviewees " exhibited symptoms " of a flu - like illness , though none have died .
Oaxaca is the historic capital of Oaxaca state , a mountainous region on Mexico 's southern Pacific coast .
Its location may be crucial to tracking the spread of swine flu , because it borders Veracruz , the state where the virus is believed to have first infected humans .
Edgar Hernandez , a boy who contracted the disease on 2 April and subsequently made a full recovery , was on Monday identified by Mexico 's health secretary Jose Angel Cordova as " patient zero " – the first officially identified victim of the disease .
He lives in the small town of La Gloria , in Veracruz province , five miles downwind of a vast pig farm identified a potential source of the outbreak .
The farm is owned by owned by Smithfield Foods , a US agribusiness corporation , whose Mexican subsidiary raises a million pigs per year .
In February , dozens of locals began falling ill from a mysterious , flu - like disease .
On 6 April , authorities in La Gloria declared an " alert , " saying 400 people had required treatment and 1,800 were exhibiting respiratory problems .
The town has a population of 3,000 .
Public health workers sealed off the town and began exterminating huge numbers of flies that had reportedly begun swarming through homes .
However , they are yet to identify this outbreak as swine flu .
News teams who have descended on the town have been urged against jumping to conclusions .
But the locals are n't convinced .
Jose Luis Martinez , a 34 - year - old resident of La Gloria , told reporters yesterday that he knew the disease which had infected his town was swine flu the minute he heard description of its symptoms : fever , coughing , joint aches , severe headache and , in some cases , vomiting and diarrhoea .
" When we saw it on the television , we said to ourselves , ' This is what we had , ' " he said .
" The symptoms they are suffering are the same that we had here . "
Factory farming is already a contentious issue in Veracruz state because thousands of farmers claim they were evicted from their land there by the Mexican government in 1992 , in an alleged move to make way for US farming companies seeking to exploit relaxed welfare standards .
If La Gloria was indeed the source of the original outbreak , it is likely to have quickly spread to major cities .
Roughly half the people with homes in the town live and work in Mexico City during the week .
Yesterday , the capital was again in a state of high alert .
Most people were wearing surgical masks in public , large gatherings of people are banned , restaurants can only serve take - out food , and bars forced to shut at 6 pm .
Those measures are almost certainly too late .
Swine flu is likely to have arrived in the city during the first fortnight of April – timing which may have been fatal , since it coincided with Semana Santa ( Holy Week ) , bringing a million people to the capital from all over the country .
' Typhoid Mary '
Mary Mallon was an Irish chef who became the first person in the US to be identified as a carrier of typhoid fever .
She is believed to have infected 53 people , three of whom died .
She denied spreading the disease and refused to cease working .
Born in 1869 , she died in quarantine in 1938 .
OTTAWA ( Reuters ) - The Arctic is warming up so quickly that the region ’s sea ice cover in summer could vanish as early as 2013 , decades earlier than some had predicted , a leading polar expert said on Thursday .
The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer ( AMSR-E ) , a high - resolution passive microwave Instrument on NASA ’s Aqua satellite shows the state of Arctic sea ice on September 10 in this image released September 16 , 2008 .
REUTERS / NASA / Goddard Space Flight Center Scientific Visualization Studio / Handout
Warwick Vincent , director of the Center for Northern Studies at Laval University in Quebec , said recent data on the ice cover “ appear to be tracking the most pessimistic of the models ” , which call for an ice free summer in 2013 .
The year “ 2013 is starting to look as though it is a lot more reasonable as a prediction .
But each year we ’ve been wrong -- each year we ’re finding that it ’s a little bit faster than expected , ” he told Reuters .
The Arctic is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the world and the sea ice cover shrank to a record low in 2007 before growing slightly in 2008 .
In 2004 a major international panel forecast the cover could vanish by 2100 .
Last December , some experts said the summer ice could go in the next 10 or 20 years .
If the ice cover disappears , it could have major consequences .
Shipping companies are already musing about short cuts through the Arctic , which also contains enormous reserves of oil and natural gas .
Vincent ’s scientific team has spent the last 10 summers on Ward Hunt Island , a remote spot some 2,500 miles northwest of Ottawa .
“ I was astounded as to how fast the changes are taking place .
The extent of open water is something that we have n’t experienced in the 10 years that I ’ve been working up there , ” he said after making a presentation in the Canadian Parliament .
“ We ’re losing , irreversibly , major features of the Canadian ice scape and that suggests that these more pessimistic models are really much closer to reality . ”
In 2008 the maximum summer temperature on Ward Hunt hit 20 degrees Celsius ( 68 degrees Fahrenheit ) compared to the usual 5 degrees .
Last summer alone the five ice shelves along Ellesmere Island in Canada ’s Far North , which are more than 4,000 years old , shrunk by 23 percent .
Vincent told Reuters last September that it was clear some of the damage would be permanent and that the warming in the Arctic was a sign of what the rest of the world could expect .
He struck a similarly gloomy note in his presentation .
“ Some of this is unstoppable .
We ’re in a train of events at the moment where there are changes taking place that we are unable to reverse , the loss of these ice shelves , for example , ” he said .
“ But what we can do is slow down this process and we have to slow down this process because we need to buy more time .
We simply do n’t have the technologies as a civilization to deal with this level of instability that is ahead of us . ”

Release date March 18 , 2009
Summary
Full list of 3518 secretly blacklisted sites as of 18th of March 2009 .
Similar to the Danish list , with which it shares 1097 domains .
The filter list feeds into the so - called CSAADF ( Child Sexual Abuse Anti Distribution Filter ) , which has been marketed as a method of combating child pornography .
The filter is an unlegislated cooperation between Telenor ( Norway 's leading internet service provider or ISP ) and Kripos ( the Norwegian police for organized crime , economical crime and other serious criminal issues ) .
Several other ISPs in Norway have begun to use the system .
The blacklist is maintained and distributed by Kripos .
The ISP implements this blacklist in its Domain Name System ( DNS ) servers .
The source states that user lookup of these blacklisted sites are recorded by the DNS server and made available to Kripos by the ISP .
This list is for " whole of site " censoring .
It does n't address more granular individual page censoring techniques , which may also be used .
The filter system can be used to censor any site .
The list is generated without judicial or public oversight and is kept secret by the ISPs using it .
Unaccountability is intrinsic to such a secret censorship system .
Many of the sites on the list have no obvious connection to child pornography .
Some have clearly changed owners while others were possibly even wrongly placed on the list in the first instance .
The list has been leaked because cases such as Thailand ( a mandatory scheme ) demonstrate that once a secret censorship system is established for pornographic content the same system can rapidly expand to cover other material , including political material , at the worst possible moment -- when government needs reform .
In December Wikileaks released the secret Internet censorship list for Thailand .
Of the sites censored in 2008 , at least 1,203 , had the internally noted reason of " lese majeste " -- failing to self - censor criticism of the Royal family .
Like Denmark , the Thai censorship system was originally promoted as a mechanism to prevent the flow of child pornography .
In January 2009 , the Thai system was used to censor Western reportage of the imprisonment of Harry Nicolaides , an Greek - Australian writer who was detained for writing a novel which contained a single paragraph deemed to be critical of an unnamed Crown Prince and so violate " lese majeste " .
sweetnote
The partly legislated Australian system , which has fines of upto $ 11,000 a day for those who link to pages on its secret blacklist has been used to censor links to pages on Wikileaks and a pro-life site .
An attempt is being made to introduce a mandatory national automatic censorship regime .
The existing system and the proposal face strong political opposition in Australia .
The unlegislated Finnish system has been used to silence the site of a Finnish censorship critic and the page on Wikileaks about the Finnish system .
Customers accessing the internet via mobile phones associated with the ISPs are also affected by this blacklist .
Research shows that while such blacklists are dangerous to " above ground " activities such as political discourse , they have little effect on the production of child pornography , and by diverting resources and attention from traditional policing actions , may be counter - productive .

Ashley Judd Sarah Palin and Wolves ( Video )
takes aim atfor pushing a program for the aerial shooting of wolves , with a graphic video for the Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund .
The group claims Palin offered a $ 150 bounty for the foreleg of each dead wolf .
Judd urges viewers to visit eyeonpalin.org , " a national campaign dedicated to exposing Alaska governor Sarah Palin 's anti-conservation agenda . "
Palin is fighting back with a statement calling the group " reprehensible and hypocritical , " saying the ad campaign distorts the facts about Alaska 's wildlife management programs .
" Alaskans depend on wildlife for food and cultural practices which ca n’t be sustained when predators are allowed to decimate moose and caribou populations .
Our predator control programs are scientific and successful at protecting vulnerable wildlife , " says Palin .
Palin urges readers to visit Alaska 's wildlife conservation website for more information on predator control in the state .

What is the effect on a human being of being subjected to the the Bush - Cheney " enhanced interrogation " program ?
We have two clear data points , and one is an American citizen .
Jose Padilla was detained on American soil and put in a US brig and tortured for years .
He was subjected to indefinite solitary detention , total sensory deprivation , sleep deprivation , and , according to his lawyers " hooding , stress positions , assaults , threats of imminent execution and the administration of ' truth serums . ' "
You want to know what a broken human being looks like after that ?
Here you go :
One of Mr. Padilla ’s lawyers , Orlando do Campo , said that Mr. Padilla was a “ completely docile ” prisoner .
“ There was not one disciplinary problem with Jose ever , not one citation , not one act of disobedience , ” said Mr. do Campo , who is a lawyer at the Miami federal public defender ’s office .
In his affidavit , Mr. Patel said , “ I was told by members of the brig staff that Mr. Padilla ’s temperament was so docile and inactive that his behavior was like that of a piece of furniture .’ ... Dr. Angela Hegarty , director of forensic psychiatry at the Creedmoor Psychiatric Center in Queens , N.Y. , who examined Mr. Padilla for a total of 22 hours in June and September , said in an affidavit filed Friday that he “ lacks the capacity to assist in his own defense . ”
“ It is my opinion that as the result of his experiences during his detention and interrogation , Mr. Padilla does not appreciate the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him , is unable to render assistance to counsel , and has impairments in reasoning as the result of a mental illness , i.e. , post - traumatic stress disorder , complicated by the neuropsychiatric effects of prolonged isolation , ” Dr. Hegarty said in an affidavit for the defense .
Here is an account of one detainee at Gitmo - not abu Ghraib , Gitmo :
Last December , documents obtained by the A.C.L.U. also cited an F.B.I. agent at Guantánamo Bay who observed that '' on a couple of occasions , I entered interview rooms to find a detainee chained hand and foot in a fetal position to the floor , with no chair , food or water .
Most times they had urinated or defecated on themselves , and had been left there for 18 to 24 hours or more . ''
In one case , he added , '' the detainee was almost unconscious on the floor , with a pile of hair next to him .
He had apparently been literally pulling his own hair out throughout the night . ''
Bush and Cheney made all this possible .

There is something sad about watching former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan lose most of the intellectual underpinnings of his life .
A few months ago he famously conceded that there was a " flaw " in the economic model with which he thinks about the world , and that he was " distressed " by that realization .
( Of course , his flaw ended up costing the economy trillions of dollars , so merely being distressed seems a bit mild . )
Now Greenspan tells us that temporarily nationalizing broke US banks might be OK .
If that does n't stop you in your tracks , it should .
The man often called the high priest of laissez - faire capitalism is saying that he can imagine briefly taking some of the most troubled US banks into state ownership because that is better than the alternative of letting the market sort it out .
That is vertigo - inducing indeed , like Lenin doing an about - face on the whole capitalism thing .
It is , quite rightly , getting a lot of attention .
After all , if Greenspan thinks there are problems with laissez - faire capitalism , and with market - based solutions to banking problems , what is he likely to say next ?
That marginal revenue does n't equal marginal cost for profit maximization ?
The economic mind boggles at the idea .
People forget all too readily , but Greenspan is a consultant to Pimco , the largest bond manager in this quadrant of the galaxy and its strategy is to chase government protection .
Marginally more seriously , it is worth asking why Greenspan is saying these things now , and whether there is any better chance he is right now than he was before ( and before ( and before ) ) .
First question first , he is saying these things now , I think , for a couple of reasons , one obvious , another less so .
The obvious reason is that saying anything else would be dumb .
We have poured centi-billions down the bilious black hole that is the US banking system , and , while a complete crack - up has been arrested , there seems little prospect that billions of dollars more wo n't be required with any more assurance of success .
After all , the fundamental problem remains :
Banks own assets that are worth next to nothing , and they are carrying those assets at prices nowhere near nothing .
If they marked those assets to their real values , the banks would have to stop pretending they are solvent .
It 's much more fun to hoard government cash and pretend that things that are worth $ 0.05 are worth $ 0.75 .
Greenspan knows that .
And he also knows nothing will change until banks are forced to reprice assets that currently trade on a cycle with the arrival of the Pleiades .
What 's more , he is finally conceding that wo n't happen if the banks are left to their own devices .
In the interim we will have what are not - so - fondly called " zombie banks " roaming the financial landscape .
Granted , it is a myth that we need banks lending so we can have more debt to get us out of debt — that bit of circularity escapes too many people — but we do need banks all the same .
Having the current crop playing mirror - world Price Is Right games with their assets while they wait out the current recession / depression is n't helpful .
But there is more to it than that .
I do n't think Greenspan is just burnishing his reputation or rethinking his intellectual underpinnings .
He is also looking to his own interests .
People forget all too readily , but Greenspan is a consultant to Pimco , the largest bond manager in this quadrant of the galaxy .
And Pimco has made it clear that its strategy is to go wherever government protection goes — the company 's Bill Gross says they want to " stay under the umbrella " of government - protected banks .
As a holder of senior bank bonds , Pimco would likely be safe in any nationalization , while most of the rest of the shareholders , both common and preferred , would be wiped out .
So , in calling for nationalization of banks , or at least saying it would be OK , in some sense Greenspan is talking the book of a very large bank bondholder .
So , should we ignore Greenspan altogether ?
Feel free , but do n't come to the wrong conclusion .
Ignore him because he presided over the creation of the current financial crisis .
Or ignore him because he is late coming to an obvious conclusion .
Or ignore him because he has a conflict of interest that people reporting his comments generally do n't disclose .
But for once , Alan Greenspan is right .
Temporarily nationalizing insolvent banks is a good idea , and we should n't dismiss it just because a discredited and conflicted former Federal Research chair is saying so .

Many gamers operate in two distinct worlds : real and online .
When we die , it 's easy to let our acquaintances in the former know about what happened to us , but updating our friends on services like Xbox Live or in MMOs is a bit more difficult for our surviving loved ones to do ; something recently demonstrated by Melissa Allen Spangenberg , who spent a great deal of time trying to let her father 's guildmates know about his sudden death .
As a result , services are starting to pop up that give gamers the ability to notify their online contacts of their demise .
According to the Associated Press , sites like Slightly Morbid , Legacy Locker , and Death Switch have sprung up so that people have a way of providing others with a notice of their death , as well as keeping track of important things like passcodes , important documents , and lists of who needs to be contacted to so one can put the deceased 's affairs in order .
While these sites rely on subscriptions , none of them were really created to generate a profit .
Instead , the ideas for the services were created when their various founders lost someone close ( or thought they did ) and wanted to spare others the difficulty of letting online contacts know what had happened .
Death Switch relies on people to log in periodically , otherwise an automatic email goes out to a pre-established list of contacts ; Slightly Morbid , in turn , also sends out an email but does n't require users to constantly log in .
Instead , the account holder gives their login information to a trusted individual who can log into the account and then trigger the email notifications .
Legacy Locker , which is set to launch next month , actually requires a copy of a person 's death certificate before it releases the information stored on its servers .
While it certainly sounds a bit morbid to plan for this kind of thing , sites like the ones mentioned above seem like a solid idea for someone who happens to have a strong online identity .
As people 's online activity and gaming habits increase , it seems like these sorts of sites will not only provide a sound investment , but more of them will probably appear .

The Obama administration Monday made public a series of long - secret Bush administration legal memos that set out an extraordinarily broad interpretation of presidential power for use in the war on terrorism .
One 2001 opinion concluded that the military could seize suspects in the U.S. like members of an invading foreign army who lacked constitutional rights .
The memos provide a detailed glimpse into the thinking of President Bush ’s Justice Department legal advisors at a time of national emergency .
They embraced the view that the president , acting alone , had the authority to override the other branches of government on a broad range of issues .

The Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel , in a memo written six weeks after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , would have allowed U.S. troops to search houses and seize suspected terrorists without a court - approved warrant .
The Pentagon never used that power , although it considered it , according to a former Bush administration lawyer .
In the immediate aftermath of the attacks , Justice Department lawyers also said the military ’s need to go after terrorists in the U.S. could override constitutional protections guaranteeing the right to free speech .
By then , the memos showed , the Bush administration was already discussing ways to wiretap U.S. conversations without warrants , and to take other steps without the traditional oversight of Congress and the courts .
Another memo said the president could unilaterally abrogate treaties with other nations .

The just - released memos also showed that five days before Bush left office , the Justice Department issued a secret but remarkable retraction of some of these same sweeping definitions of presidential authority .
In a Jan. 15 “ memorandum for the files , ” Principal Deputy Assistant Atty .
Gen. Steven G. Bradbury said many of the Office of Legal Counsel opinions issued between 2001 and 2003 no longer reflected the views of the Justice Department and “ should not be treated as authoritative for any purpose . ”
The Justice Department had secretly withdrawn some of its more controversial legal memos years earlier , Bradbury added , “ and on several occasions we have already acknowledged the doubtful nature of these propositions . ”
The memos released Monday go well beyond what was known about the Bush administration ’s assertion of presidential power .

The Oct. 23 , 2001 , memo on the use of the military in the U.S. was written by then - Deputy Assistant Atty .
Gen. John C. Yoo -- now a visiting professor at Chapman University School of Law in Orange -- and Special Counsel Robert J. Delahunty .
Yoo did not return calls seeking comment , and Bradbury declined to comment .
“ These military operations , taken as they may be on United States soil , and involving as they might American citizens , raise novel and difficult questions of constitutional law , ” they wrote .
But they said the president , as commander in chief in a time of war , had the right to authorize such extraordinary actions to protect the American public .

“ The current campaign against terrorism may require even broader exercises of federal power domestically , ” Yoo and Delahunty added .
For several years , the Bush administration and its Justice Department have come under intense criticism for writing other legal memos pertaining to the war on terrorism .
Some of those legal opinions held that the administration did not need to abide by laws requiring court approval of wiretaps , while others provided legal cover for coercive interrogation techniques that many critics considered to be torture .
Obama and his attorney general , Eric H. Holder Jr. , have vowed to release other still - secret Bush legal memos as soon as possible .

In a speech earlier in the day , Holder said he understood the need to protect Americans from terrorist attacks .
“ But we must do so in a manner that preserves , protects and defends the rights that are enshrined in our Constitution , and the rule of law itself , ” he said .
The Justice Department posted the nine newly declassified legal opinions and memos on its website Monday .
American Civil Liberties Union officials hailed the release of the documents but said the Obama administration needed to release , “ at the earliest possible date , dozens of still - secret legal memos related to interrogation , detention , rendition , surveillance and other Bush administration policies that are still being withheld . ”
Jameel Jaffer , director of the ACLU ’s National Security Project , said the Bush administration memos “ essentially argue that the president has a blank check to disregard the Constitution during wartime , not only on foreign battlefields , but also inside the United States . ”
Advertisement
The memos written by Yoo and others reflected the belief by the Bush administration that the traditional legal interpretations were inadequate for fighting terrorism .
“ In retrospect , some of those judgments may not have been the best ones to make , ” said one Defense Department official , who added : “ People want to criticize the thinking in 2001 , but we thought we were going to get attacked again . ”
The October 2001 memo “ gave rise to the Justice Department discussing with the Defense Department whether the military could be used to arrest people and detain people inside the United States , ” a former Bush administration lawyer said .
“ That was considered but rejected on at least one occasion . ”
The officials asked not to be named because the debate over using the military to detain people inside the U.S. was secret .
Advertisement
Under the proposal , the suspects would have been held by the military as “ enemy combatants . ”
The proposal was opposed by the Justice Department ’s criminal division and other government lawyers and was ultimately rejected , and the suspects were arrested under criminal statutes , the lawyer said .
The memos released Monday are “ just the tip of the iceberg ” in terms of what the Bush administration authorized , the lawyer said .
In his January memo on why the earlier opinions had been reversed , at least in part , Bradbury said the opinions departed from normal Office of Legal Counsel practice , searching for expansive answers in the response to terrorism when more limited legal reasoning might have been more appropriate .
“ In the months following 9/11 , attorneys in the Office of Legal Counsel and in the intelligence community confronted novel and complex legal questions in a time of great danger and under extraordinary time pressure , ” Bradbury wrote .

The distraction on Capitol Hill this week has to do with the jackpot bonuses that executives at AIG recently received .
The argument is over a relative drop in the bucket .
The total amount of bonuses given out was $ 165 million .
The government has put $ 170 billion into AIG so far .
Many now are demanding we get this money back .
We ought to be spending our time and effort doing something more worthwhile , like figuring out how the Federal Reserve is handling the trillions of dollars they are creating and pumping into the economy , and how that is affecting the purchasing power of dollars in your pocket .
The big mistake was appropriating the TARP funds in the first place .
A Johnny - come - lately bill of attainder wo n’t stop the spending epidemic .
This whole situation is a perfect demonstration of why doing nothing  and letting failing companies fail would have been much better than sinking valuable money and resources into them .
When a company makes a profit , it is a signal that it is taking resources and increasing their value while controlling costs .
When a company operates at a loss , it is a signal that it is decreasing the value of its resources or letting out - of - control costs outstrip any value it has created .
A company operating at a loss is therefore an engine of wealth destruction .
Bankruptcies are a net positive for the economy because more productive competitors are rewarded by opportunities to buy up remaining assets at bargain prices to strengthen their operations .
In an economy that allows this kind of growth and change , any jobs lost by bankruptcy are soon replaced by new ones as the most efficiently managed businesses gain access to more assets and expand .
Bankruptcy was the stimulus that we needed in the case of AIG .
More bankruptcies would clean out malinvested resources and enable economic growth again .
AIG , by losing money and maneuvering their operations to the brink of bankruptcy , was telling us that they were inefficient .
So what did we do ?
We forced the taxpayer to assume the losses , and now we are supposed to be shocked that it is not working out .
Had AIG gone bankrupt , it would have been impossible to hand out these bonuses .
The taxpayer would have been fleeced for $ 170 billion less last year .
Had they gone bankrupt , the world would not have come to an end , it would just continue on with one less engine of wealth destruction .
We should have learned from Japan .
The 1990 ’s is referred to as Japan ’s lost decade because of the zombie banks kept on life support by the Japanese government .
Any productivity was redirected through these engines of wealth destruction , resulting in long - term stagnation .
We should and can avoid this outcome if we come to our senses .
A recession should be a time of strengthening and regrouping for an economy .
But as long as the government insists on maintaining the status quo by propping up failed institutions , we will continue to dig a bigger hole for ourselves .

Dear Editor ,
We live on an island in the Indian Ocean .
On 26 December 2015 , around 00.42hrs , we thought we saw Maitreya ’s star .
We wanted to film it but , unfortunately , my husband ’s portable phone battery was flat .
We were able to observe the star carefully as it was moving slowly .
It was quite bright , different from the other stars .
Its colour was a brilliant yellow .
We made a search on Google in hope to find out what it could be , and found the articles about Maitreya .
We immediately understood that this was the star we ’d seen .
We were surprised .
We have a strong belief in Jesus Christ and are wondering why the star appeared to us .

( Source : YouTube ) Dear Editor ,
On 6 April 2014 at about 22.30 , watching from my balcony , I once again saw a star that seemed to be pulsating light in an abnormal way .
I had previously tried to film it with my video camera but to no avail .
On that night I had the sudden impression that I should give it another try .
I made some recordings on 10 and 11 April and also took a few snapshots .
The different colours , shapes and moves that can be seen on the video and the photos seem to indicate that it might be something special .
I had the strange impression that there was some kind of intervention between the observer and the observed .
Each time the sky was clear , that star was still visible .
Could it be a UFO or Maitreya 's ' star ' ?

Maitreya ’s ‘ star ’ letter
Dear Editor ,
On 27 November 2013 , in the evening , after Transmission Meditation , we opened the window and looked at the sky .
It was misty and the stars well hidden .
Only planet Jupiter could be seen .
All of a sudden another large star appeared next to Jupiter and was moving towards it – as if they intended to blend together .
It was very impressive to see these two giants so close together .
In Indian astrology , planet Jupiter is called Guru ( the Master ) .
A few weeks later , on 17 December at about 5 pm , I was just crossing a bridge when the planet Venus drew my attention .
The sky was cloudless and in the twilight only Venus could be seen .
I always feel a deep joy when I see Venus .
So I decided to rest for a while and watch .
After some seconds in the distance another star appeared , moving from east to west in direction of Venus .
The nearer it came the more brilliant became its light .
For a moment planet Venus and the moving star were close together , so I had the opportunity to compare the two different lights .
Then the two energies fused together ( in my consciousness ) before the star continued its way into the sunset .
A truly uplifting experience !
Was it Maitreya ’s star on both occasions ?

On 15 August 2013 , near Dieppe , I saw a bright orange star in the sky around 11.15 pm .
The star seemed very low in altitude .
At the beginning , it seemed not to be moving , but after a few minutes it began to move slowly to the left and disappeared behind trees .
It was so beautiful and I was very excited .
I ’m almost sure that it was a UFO .
Could you please tell me what this object was ?
If it was a UFO , where did it come from ?

On the night of 6 July 2013 , in the city of Camanducaia , Minas Gerais , Brazil , looking to the northwest I saw a very brilliant golden star .
First , I thought that it could be Jupiter , and then I tried to see it better using a telescope .
I did n’t see the moons of Jupiter that normally appear when you are using the telescope , and I realized that the strange object was emitting light of its own , and not reflecting the light of the sun as a planet does .
I enlarged the image several times using the telescope , and I realized that the object , although very bright , was rather small .
The next day , using the Stellarium computer program , I realized that there was no object showing in the location that I saw last night .
It was a very mysterious thing !
And also , on that same night , I saw an object passing near that strange star , in a route that I ’m sure is not an airplane route .
Could you tell me what was that golden star and the object that passed near it ?

The object moved extremely slowly and it appeared several hours earlier than other stars .
It kept pulsating in various colours at an extremely fast pace .
I am not convinced that this is either a star or a planet .
It might be that off - course but I am not convinced yet .

At some stage , on any clear night we get , I usually have a little ‘ look ’ for the ‘ star ’ .
On Wednesday night 12 August 2011 at about midnight I noticed ‘ something ’ in the sky – it was n’t Jupiter and I do n’t think it was a plane because it took about an hour from when I first saw it until it went out of sight on the horizon ( a plane would take about 5 minutes ) .
It was almost overhead when I first noticed it – it was n’t very high in the sky and moved steadily in an east to west direction .
It seemed to be flashing different colours – green , red – there was always some colour visible , but not like a plane where the lights flash on and off intermittently .
I do n’t have any photo but would like to know if I have seen the ‘ star ’ .

Spiral light over Norway – the ‘ star ’ that heralds Maitreya ’s emergence
The enormous , spiral light with its glowing centre , seen over Norway on 9 December 2009 , has excited and baffled thousands of Norwegians including astronomical experts .
What does it mean ?
On 12 December 2008 Share International Foundation announced that a large , bright ‘ star ’ - like object would soon be seen in the sky .
It is a sign heralding the imminent appearance of Maitreya , the World Teacher , on His first television interview , which will take place in the USA .
The ‘ star ’ is really one of four enormous spacecraft placed around the world .
Since December 2008 numerous sightings of the ‘ star ’ have been reported on YouTube and television news programmes .
Share International magazine has received hundreds of photographs showing the ‘ star ’ in a variety of stunning colours and shapes .
The huge spiral manifestation over Norway is an extension of the work of these spacecraft and is irrefutable evidence of their reality .
Our information is that further such manifestations are planned for the near future .

The ‘ Star ’ Sign – new Share International video , now on YouTube
Share International has produced a 10 minute film called The ‘ Star ’ Sign , which is now available on YouTube website , presenting the extraordinary phenomenon of the ‘ star ’ heralding Maitreya ’s emergence .
Since Benjamin Creme ’s first announcement in December 2008 , Share International has received hundreds of photographs of the ‘ star ’ from all over the world , and witnesses have independently posted on YouTube dozens of videos of the ‘ star ’ from different countries with much debate as to its meaning and purpose .
The new film contains vivid photographs , video footage and media reports from Brazil , Colombia , Sky News , and a clip from a Benjamin Creme lecture .
Viewers can see how the ‘ star ’ moves , changes shape and emits rays of brilliant colours .
It is , of course , according to Benjamin Creme ’s Master , not a star per se , but one of four gigantic spacecraft , positioned so that one is visible from any part of the globe , an awesome sign to the world that an extraordinary event is about to happen – the emergence of Maitreya into public view .
Take part in this extraordinary event by looking for the ‘ star ’ .
If you photograph or film it , please report it to the media or Share International magazine and help create an open media debate about its meaning and purpose .

The star that heralds Maitreya ’s emergence
“ In the very near future , people everywhere will have the opportunity to witness an extraordinary and significant sign , the like of which has been manifested only once before , at the birth of Jesus .
Then , according to Christian teaching , a star appeared in the heavens and led three wise men from the East to the birthplace of Jesus .
Soon , once again , a star - like luminary of brilliant power will be seen around the world . ”
( Benjamin Creme ’s Master , ‘ Maitreya ’s first interview ’ , SI Jan / Feb 2009 )
On 12 December 2008 Share International distributed a news release announcing that in the very near future a large , bright star would appear in the sky visible throughout the world , night and day , heralding the imminent appearance of Maitreya in His first interview on a major US television programme .
Since early January 2009 sightings of the star have been reported all over the world and hundreds of sightings have been sent to Share International .
We include a selection of the latest reports from the media , Share International readers , and sightings from YouTube .
All are genuine sightings confirmed by Benjamin Creme ’s Master to be the ‘ star ’ .
How to spot the ‘ star ’
“ It behaves in a way no other celestial object does . ” — Benjamin Creme
The ‘ star ’
• resides in our Earth ’s atmosphere
• can move , spin , pulsate and blink
• can change size and shape ( eg round , diamond , hexagonal )
• can change position in the sky
• can get closer , and recede , at speed
• is very bright and sometimes the only star visible
• can radiate bright colours , often in quick succession
• has been sighted day and night
• can respond to thought : has been known to appear and move when asked
• several witnesses have even seen all four ‘ stars ’ together
• is seen all over the world .
Note : Benjamin Creme explains that the ‘ star ’ regularly recharges its energy from the sun and is not always visible .
Also note that in cities high - rise buildings can obscure sightings of the ‘ star ’ , so keep watching .

A ‘mysterious luminary object in the summer sky ’ was recently reported on nationwide Japanese television station .

The witness Mrs Yanagisawa said that she and her husband saw from their window a ‘ mysterious luminary object ’ in the western sky above the trees .
‘ It was emitting light , shining brightly , changing colours , green , yellow , red and so on .
It was moving vertically , up and down , while spinning . ’
( Benjamin Creme ’s Master confirms the ‘ mysterious luminous object ’ was the ‘ star ’ . )
Heavenly herald
As we go to press , reports are coming in of a large , very bright “ fireball ” , a “ shining bullet ” , or a “ glowing heavenly body ” as German media described it .
The object was seen in the early evening of 13 October in clear skies above Germany , the Netherlands and Belgium .
Over the Netherlands there are reports that the object broke the sound barrier with the accompanying sonic boom .

The ‘ star ’ reported on television
RCN Colombia News , Colombia
Boca Raton , Florida , USA , 6 July 2009 .
According to one witness : “ There was a green light in the sky , but it was too close to be a star .
It was moving side - to - side and hovering , like nothing I have ever seen before … it was a green glowing diamond shaped object , about 100 feet above us , floating ” .
WPTV , a local television station , reported the story and showed a video .
( YouTube Television news channel RCN Colombia reported an incident which took place on 15 April 2009 in Pereira , capital city of the state of Risarald .
Announcing that a “ journalist films a UFO in Pereira , the spaceship flew over several buildings ” , it told how television journalist Liliana López saw a gigantic , bright light in the sky from her eighth - floor balcony at 9.20 pm .
She captured the diamond - shaped object on her video camera and reported that it emitted a multi-coloured light .
It drifted across the sky for several minutes and then mysteriously disappeared .
UFO experts are investigating the extraordinary footage .
López recalls : “ I saw a very big , resplendent light in the sky , certainly not normal at all .
It was easy to see it was not a star or a plane and taking advantage of the fact that I had a video camera with good resolution I tried to get some close - up footage .
You can see quite clearly what a strange object it is .
There is a moment when it ’s already going away – it starts turning around , around , around , around and then finally moves away – it ’s perfectly evident that it ’s a [ space ] ship ” .

Sky Television , UK
On 22 March 2009 Sky Television News interviewed thirteen - year - old Harriet Rogers who filmed what she thought was a UFO hovering above Shrewsbury , England .
On 21 February 2009 , after a call from her grandmother about a bright light in the sky , Harriet and her father went upstairs to have a look and saw a brilliant ball of light pulsing and changing colours .
Harriet explained : “ To the human eye , it just looked like a bright light but , on the video camera we could see it pulsing , then suddenly changing colours .
They decided to go out and follow the light to try to get a bit closer and they started to notice it was going down beyond the horizon .
She added : “ This is when you could see with your own eyes that it was pulsing and changing colours .
We stopped in a lay - by and rested the camcorder on a gatepost where we got the best shots .
We could see how it was getting much brighter than before . ”
Asked by a
Sky reporter if she thought it was a UFO Harriet said : “ Yes .
It ’s come back , it ’s definitely come back , literally every starry night . ”
There have been many unexplained lights in the sky reported over Shropshire recently .
The Shropshire Star newspaper reported : “ There have been up to 30 sightings of mysterious light objects logged by UFO experts in the last two months [ February and March 2009 ] with at least eight recorded in the last fortnight . ”

The Sun , UK
On 16 February 2009
The Sun newspaper included a report from Scott Shepperd of a bright light or “ craft ” spotted over Colchester , Essex .
A video of his sighting was placed on the newspaper ’s website .
Shepperd had been to the cinema with a friend before he captured the dazzling light in the sky .
He said : “ As I was about to get in the car to go home , a golden ball of light no higher than 100 ft above me caught my attention .
I said to my mate to look , he ignored me and said its probably just a plane .
I asked him to check anyway and , just as he did , it started moving over the top of us .
It was very bright orange and moved very quietly : it had no flashing light which made me question if it was a plane .
Quick as I could , I got out my mobile phone to video it but by the time I had got it out and set it up it had moved pretty far away . "

He filmed the mysterious orange glow as it tracked northwards and disappeared .
“ I could see this orange ball rising up , at a 90 - degree angle , straight up , then it just sat there , sat still for a few seconds .
To my amazement it started moving sideways .
Right away I recognized it was n’t something normal that I had ever seen before .
There was no sound at all .
All you can hear are birds chirping on the video . ” ( Source : chesterchronicle.co.uk )

Milliyet Kemer News , Turkey
On 25 April 2009 at 3.30 am a group of security guards outside a hotel in the coastal town of Kemer , Turkey , saw an unusual object hovering over the ocean and photographed it .
Security guard Erman Bulut was at the front of the hotel when he saw the hexagonal object doing impossible manoeuvres above the sea and changing shape and colour .
He recalls : “ At first I could n’t understand what I was witnessing .
I saw this large object rising from the sea .
It definitely was n’t a plane or balloon .
It was leaving a trail and it was glowing .
My hands were shaking from the excitement .
As it descended towards the sea I ran to the beach but then it began to rapidly rise eventually merging with the stars .
It was hexagonal , orange and fluorescent .
As far as I am concerned it was definitely a UFO .
One does not get the chance to see such things often and I feel lucky to have witnessed this .
When one takes into account the size of the universe and the number of stars , UFOs and aliens become a certainty . ”
Erman 's co-workers Mehemet Aydin and Sezgin Cesur also saw the object and described it .
“ It was hexagonal but at times it 's shape changed .
It descended and then rose , disappearing into the sky .
“ I did n't sleep all night from excitement ” concluded Mr Cesur .

According to All News Web , formations of UFOs have been seen above cities throughout the world in the first few months of 2009 .
In China , reports the website , a UFO was filmed by a Beijing tourist on 18 February 2009 in Kashgar in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous region along the ancient Silk Road .
“ Me and my father were walking through a park near the Science and Technology Complex returning to our hotel when I noticed a very bright and clear object in the sky that appeared too close and too bright to be a star , ” said Lee Kwan Hing .
“ I used a Panasonic High Definition camcorder to take the film .
As I zoomed in on the object I noticed that it had the form of a yo - yo and I could make out geometric patterns on the object .
Is it a UFO , a satellite or a star ? ” he asks .
“ Perhaps an All News Web reader can help Hing solve this mystery , ” suggests Michael Cohen of All News Web. ( Source : allnewsweb.com )

The ‘ star ’ seen over Los Arenales , Cordoba , Spain
Spanish television reports on the ‘ star ’
On 5 April 2009 the popular programme Cuarto Milenio ( Fourth Millennium ) on Spanish television channel Cuatro , reported on the ‘ star ’ sign .
Footage was shown of a film taken in Los Arenales , Cordoba province , by ecologist Bartolome Olivares who had been walking in the mountains when he saw a big , orange light on the horizon .
Journalist Iker Jimenez told the viewers : “ Important .
Please pay attention to this , my friends who are watchful , looking at the skies .
In the last days of March we have received many sightings , videos and photos .
What is happening ?
Let ’s look at this – a kind of orange object , circular , spherical , that comes close and moves away , that seems to pulsate . ”

Times of Malta , Malta
“ What ’s that mysterious light in the night sky ? ” asked the Times of Malta on 23 March 2009 .
“ For more than a month , a bright light in the sky has been astounding those who see it , making them wonder what it is , ” says Times reporter , Cynthia Busuttil .
“ Almost every evening , soon after sunset , the bright light appears over the Floriana church , moving to Lija and then onto Ta’ Qali .
An hour later , it just disappears into thin air … .
But what is this light ?
A star , a planet ... or an unidentified flying object ?
And does this sighting have the potential of turning Malta into the Mediterranean ’s Roswell ?
According to eyewitnesses , the light is brighter than anything else in the sky and appears to hover lower than passing planes . ”
The Astronomical Society of Malta , however , blamed atmospheric turbulence when Venus is low in the sky , which can cause it to change colour dramatically .
But noted one observant commentator : “ At first I thought that it is something about Venus or Saturn … but soon after I realised that at times the light shines even though it ’s cloudy . ”

Dear Editor ,
When I was back in Austria during the summer [ 2009 ]
I always sat on my terrace and regularly saw very bright stars .
Sometimes only one , and sometimes two at the same time , and they were moving around quite fast .
I was sure that either they were the ‘ stars ’ Share International reported or spaceships .
I was very moved by the sight and started to pray .
Please can you confirm if I saw the ‘ star ’ or spaceships or both ?
R.I. , Rankweil , Vorarlberg , Austria .
( Benjamin Creme ’s Master confirms the sightings were of two of the four ‘ stars ’ .
The ‘ star ’ is , of course , a spaceship . )
Dear Editor ,
On the night of 26 / 27 September 2009 just after midnight some of the participants of the Transmission Meditation Conference in the Netherlands were outside on the terrace at the back of the main building of Rolduc looking at a star in the sky that behaved in such a way that it could be the ‘ star ’ .
Suddenly we saw a flash of light across the sky and we all cried out : “ Wow , a shooting star ! ”
Once home I was not so sure it was a shooting star .
The flash was spectacular and of an extremely beautiful golden - yellow - reddish colour .
The star was east to northeast .
( 1 ) Was it the ‘ star ’ we were watching ?
( 2 ) Did we see a shooting star or a flash of light connected with the ‘ star ’ or a UFO ?
M.L. , The Netherlands .
( Benjamin Creme ’s Master confirms that ( 1 ) it was the ‘ star ’ , and ( 2 ) it was a shooting star . )
Dear Editor ,
Every day around 9 pm from my living room I see many planes going to and from Amsterdam - Schiphol airport .
On the evening of 26 September 2009 I also saw a very special star .
It was a beautiful orange colour and was as big as the moon or the sun and had small pointed ends from where sparks emitted .
Full of admiration I followed this impressive , magnificent star and watched it until it became smaller and disappeared to a dot .
This ‘ star ’ went from west to east .
It lasted all in all about three minutes .
It made a profound impression on me and I felt tinglings and goose bumps all over .
Was this the ‘ star ’ that heralds the emergence of Maitreya , the World Teacher ?
J.B. , De Goorn , The Netherlands .
( Benjamin Creme ’s Master confirms it was the ‘ star ’ . )
Dear Editor ,
On Tuesday 4 August 2009 the moon had a star alongside its left .
Then , two nights later , on the right - hand side .
Was this the ‘ star ’ or was this the satellite I heard had just been launched on 4 and 6 August ?
J.J. , Hemel Hempstead , Hertfordshire , UK .
( Benjamin Creme ’s Master confirms it was the ‘ star ’ . )
Dear Editor ,
I have seen beautiful stars several times but sometimes I believe they are not stars but UFOs .
One in particular caught my attention on the morning of 1 August 2009 at 5.30 am in Madison , Virginia , in the United States .
In reality there were two stars , they say one of them is Venus ( I have my doubts about it ) , the other one on the other side of the sky looked like an identical twin .
I saw another one in front of my window in January 2009 , it was different since it had many colours and there were two more on the other side of the sky .
I would like to know if I have seen Maitreya ’s ‘ star ’ .
A.A. , Groveland , Florida , United States .
( Benjamin Creme ’s Master confirms that the sighting on 1 August was the ‘ star ’ alongside a spacecraft .
The January sighting was also the ‘ star ’. )
Dear Editor ,
(1) On the night of 9 August 2009 , I saw a strange object in the sky .
It looked like a little star , but it was moving slowly , similar to the speed of an airplane .
It was strange , because the object emitted little light , but twice it began to brighten with a very strong light .
For some time here in São Paulo we have seen a very bright star in the east .
It looks like Venus , but I think this planet should not be appearing in the sky this time of the year .
Was it the ‘ star ’ ?
(2) On the night of 16 August 2009 I was observing the sky when I saw a red light going upwards in the far distance .
It had a particular brightness and for some time it moved up in the sky , and then began to go towards the east , and after that to the north .
Was this the ‘ star ’ of Maitreya or a UFO ?
(3) On that same night , I saw another strange object in the sky .
It was big and had some lights on it , similar to those of a plane ( they were red and blue ) , but the form was different from a plane , and the strangest thing was that it was moving but did n’t make any noise .
It just moved across the sky from east to north , at a low altitude .
What was it ?
( 4) Also on 16 August 2009 , late in the night , I saw another strange object in the sky .
This time , the oval object was bigger and it changed direction when it moved .
Was this another sign of the Space Brothers ?
T.S.A. , São Paulo , Brazil .
( Benjamin Creme ’s Master confirms ( 1 ) It was the ‘ star ’ .
( 2 ) It was Maitreya ’s own Lightship .
( 3 ) It was a spacecraft .
( 4 ) Yes . )
Dear Editor ,
One evening I was reading The Emergence newspaper about the ‘ star ’ and found it really interesting so I went onto the website to have a look at the photos from all over the world .
That evening between 9.30 - 10 pm , I was walking down the stairs to my car when I saw this really bright star shining .
It kept changing colours from red to green in the western sky .
It made me stop in my path and I sat on the stairs for a while thinking it was a plane but it was n’t moving .
I kept looking out the window for it for a few days but did n’t see anything .
Then a week or so later when driving home from work I saw it again but this time , northwest and left of One Tree Hill , flickering red and green , between 5 - 6.30 pm .
Another time while driving , I saw a flickering red and green star in the southwest between 5 - 7 pm .
Could you tell me whether these were the ‘ star ’ or a plane or another planet ?
J.T. , Aukland , New Zealand .
( Benjamin Creme ’s Master confirms that each time it was the ‘ star ’ )
Dear Editor ,
On 4 August 2009 , during the closing minutes of the evening programme on Radio 10 AM 710 , Buenos Aires , Argentina , someone raised the issue about a sighting of a strange light in the sky .
Several listeners called confirming that they too had seen it .
Was this light the ‘ star ’ heralding Maitreya ’s emergence ?
S. M. , Buenos Aires , Argentina .
( Benjamin Creme ’s Master confirms that the light was the ‘ star ’ )
Dear Editor ,
On Thursday 16 July 2009 at 11.30 pm
I was looking up at the sky around my house and noticed a very bright twinkly star low in the sky .
In my mind I asked the star : “ If you move a tiny bit I will be more certain that you are really that star - like luminary body ” .
To my great surprise the star started to move very quickly from the south - west to the east , from the front to the back yard of my house .
To my even greater amazement the star – looking brighter and bigger – turned back to the front at a high speed and disappeared behind the clouds .
There was no noise or jetstream as with a plane .
This event took a few minutes .
Was it a spacecraft ?
K. J. , Schoten , Belgium .

Dear Editor ,
On Sunday 30 August 2009in La Grande Motte sur Mer , south of France , between 9.30 pm and 10.30 pm we saw what looked like the ‘ star ’ above the sea to the right of the moon in a south - westerly direction .
Between 11.15 pm and 1.15 am the star was to be seen left of the moon in a south - easterly direction .
It pulsated really clearly , moved and changed colour ( all sorts of colours , in fact ) .
Was this the ‘ star ’ ?
M.V. , The Netherlands .
( Benjamin Creme ’s Master confirms it was the ‘ star ’ . )
Dear Editor ,
I have been following your website for 12 years now and I value it tremendously .
Sometimes we hear something that speaks from the heart and our souls know it is the truth .
That ’s how I feel about the coming of Maitreya and the information you put out .
So thank you !
There is a question I would like to ask .
Around 4 am on 4 July 2009 in Delaware , USA , I thought I saw the ‘ star ’ .
It was the only star up in the sky and it was extremely bright and appeared to be larger than normal .
When I looked through binoculars it appeared to be a lot of white circles and the whole thing moved on its side and then on its back and then it kept changing .
( But I did not see colours , just white circled lights . )
Was this a UFO ?

Dear Editor ,
On 24 June 2009 after Transmission Meditation I was cycling home .
It was all cloudy .
When I went over the Stone Bridge I noticed a big , bright star below the clouds , moving slowly from north to south .
It pulsated and looked like a fireball .
The whole thing lasted about five minutes .
When I arrived home I telephoned a group member living in Berlin and told him what I had seen .
Five minutes later he phoned back and told me that right after our talk he went on his balcony with his wife and son and they all noticed the same thing in the sky : a bright star , moving , and looking like a fireball .
Was it the ‘ star ’ ?

Dear Editor ,
On Saturday 20 June 2009 a friend and I left the Art Cinema in Hilversum , the Netherlands , around 11.30 pm and drove along the motorway towards Blaricum when we saw a very strange spectacle in the sky in the direction of Almere : on the left in the sky we saw a very bright star and to its right a kind of ‘ cloud ’ of at least 15 , but maybe even 20 , lights .
After we left the highway we stopped the car , but then we only saw the bright star that was moving away from us , slowly , and eventually disappeared .
We both thought it could be a UFO mothership surrounded by a number of UFOs .
We are very interested to know what we saw ?
E. B. , the Netherlands .
( Benjamin Creme ’s Master confirms that the “ bright star ” was indeed the ‘ star ’ .
The other objects were spacecraft from the planet Mars . )
Dear Editor ,
It was 28 July 2009 , at 12.19 am , that I saw a star from my home in Maastricht , the Netherlands , that made me wonder ; it was south - south - east of Maastricht .
And at 4.48 am there was another star in the east over Margraten , but this ‘ star ’ was higher up in the sky .
(1) The star at 12.19 am was spherical with a clear diameter and an enormous luminosity .
( 2 ) The star of 4.48 am looked kind of butterfly - like .
It was shaped like a triangle with indentations of light in it , that made me think of a butterfly , and the points sparkled brightly .
( 3 ) I saw also a star at 12.19 am on the west side .
It was smaller in diameter and was sparkling less brightly than the ones I described above , but was still remarkable compared to the other visible luminaries .
Did I see the ‘ star ’ ?
M. J. , the Netherlands .
( Benjamin Creme ’s Master confirms that ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) were sightings of the ‘ star ’ ; ( 3 ) was a spacecraft from Venus . )
Dear Editor ,
On 27 July 2009 , my girlfriend and I were again looking at the sky at the three stars which are always there , always shining , always first to appear at the evening sky and shining more than all the other stars – one directly above , one to the south - west , and one to the south , just above the horizon .
This last one is constantly changing colour to red , so everyone can see it .
Yesterday , my girlfriend was sitting outside , looking at the star right above and searching to see if the fourth star would appear .
This fourth star is a bit tricky , because it is always on the move .
As strange as it sounds , this is what happened : she called for me to come outside , and we sat there , looking together .
Out of nowhere , this fourth star appeared , travelling across the sky , in a northerly direction .
It did n’t travel from the opposite direction ( from the south ) , it just appeared in the centre of the sky , travelling north .
We saw the star and wondered if this was the ‘ star ’ , because it was shining the same as all the other stars .
I myself was thinking if that is all , then its nothing special .
My girlfriend was thinking : “ Get bigger , and brighter . ”
Then suddenly , the star blinked , just like a lighthouse at the sea at night .
We were stunned , we just could n’t believe it , but the star , as if hearing our thoughts , blinked again , and again , and again , five times in a row .
What is really interesting is this was n’t a one - off event .
We had seen it before .
We usually walk the dog every evening around 8 pm , and I go running every second day for an hour .
I saw this fourth star for the first time when I was running – it was travelling from west to the east , in the northern part of the sky .
The next time we saw it together , it was travelling in the same direction , but just above .
The third time my girlfriend saw it , again travelling across the sky .
On the fourth time , we went for a walk with the dog , as usual .
All the time I somehow knew that we would see it again .
We were walking for an hour and we were almost back at home , so I thought to myself , better luck next time .
But despite this , I looked again at the star shining just above , thinking to myself : “ Light up , Light up !
Light up ! ”
And then it appeared out of nowhere , in the vicinity of this star just above .
My girlfriend started shouting and then it blinked .
As I had wished .
It was there for 5 seconds and then it was gone .
Are these the four stars ?
M. Z. , Majsperk , Slovenia .
( Benjamin Creme ’s Master confirms , yes they were the four ‘ stars ’ . )

Dear Editor ,
A few nights ago I noticed an incredibly bright object hovering in the sky , not far from the moon .
It did n’t dawn on me until later that I might be witnessing the ‘ star ’ .
For the past three nights , I have seen the same object in the sky , and I have taken pictures and filmed it .
After reviewing my photos , I realize now that the object has moved a fair amount since the first time I saw it .
Interestingly , about a week ago , I heard that a friend had ‘ called the star ’ and had then seen it .
So , with my mind I politely invited the ‘ star ’ to visit .
Is it the ‘ star ’ that I ’m seeing ?

Dear Editor ,
As we left the cinema in Breda at 0.30 on Sunday morning 9 August 2009 , we walked in a north - westerly direction .
At that moment we saw a bright shining star in the far distance .
That night it was perfectly clear .
The other stars were very bright , but they were not flickering .
This pulsating star changed colours rapidly .
We saw it turning from red to green , purple , blue and white .
The rhythm of pulsation also changed .
Sometimes it pulsated , the next minute not that much and then suddenly again it flashed .
It also moved slowly away from us .
At first it was quite a big star but at around 1.10 it was nothing more than a pulsating point in the far distance .
Was this just an ordinary star flickering due to atmospheric pollution or was it the star heralding the public emergence of Maitreya the World Teacher ?

During a recent trip to Italy , at the Pedra e Cupa campsite in Budoni , Sardinia , at 5 am on Saturday 4 July a bright star was clearly seen in the western region of the sky and was the only star visible in the sky at this time .

Dear Editor ,
I live in Wemb , a German village near the Dutch border .
In the early morning hours of 7 August 2009 at about 5 am I opened a skylight in my bedroom and saw a single big , bright yellow star in an easterly direction , and wondered if it could be the ‘ star ’ .
After a while , it began to move up and down and sideways .
I was completely stunned and overwhelmed .
Inwardly I repeatedly asked the star to move again , which it did , but not immediately .
I have no camera but with my binoculars I saw a fuzzy round shape with glittering points .
There is an airport close by , but it definitively was no plane or ordinary star .
I observed the star for about an hour , then it became smaller , but was still moving .
Did I really see ‘ the star ’ or was it just my imagination ?

Dear Editor ,
On the morning of 10 July 2009 , between 3.30 and 4 am , I happened to look out of my bedroom window , and saw a huge star shining brilliantly in the dawn light .
The star must have been about six times as large as an ‘ average ’ star .
I was so amazed that I called a friend to witness the phenomenon .
Was this the ‘ star ’ or was it actually Venus ?

Dear Editor ,
On 2 May 2009 , in the small hours , I saw a shining object very high in the sky .
It was the only object shining in the sky , all the stars having disappeared .
It was white coloured and round like a ball .
At a certain point , its luminosity decreased as if to disappear and then it regained its size and brilliance .
Then clouds obscured my view , but once the clouds had dissipated , I saw the object had disappeared , but after a while , I saw it again in another place , lower in the sky , and then it disappeared again in the clouds .
Was this a UFO or the ‘ star ’ announcing the arrival of Maitreya ?

Dear Editor ,
Myself and a workmate were travelling to Mackay in Queensland , Australia , and as the sun was coming up on a long road miles from nowhere we saw what looked exactly like the ‘ star ’ in Share International so we pulled over and viewed it with a cheap telescope we had in the vehicle .
That star thing can move from one end of the sky to the other in a blink of an eye , it ’s amazing .
Also , in my mind it has no real or definite size ; it ’s all very abstract to the usual way we think of things .
It challenged me ; in fact it sent me a little nutty for a while .
It looks as if it cools off or something and it turns an earthy - red clay - type colour and the fiery - looking interior of it settles .
As the sunlight moved in , it disappeared .
It ’s crazy – absolutely mind blowing to see it as we did .

Dear Editor ,
Last week I was awakened at 4 am and needed to go out to my car to retrieve a bite of candy for a low blood sugar episode .
Over my shoulder I thought there was a really bright light , then I did not see it .
After the low blood sugar was dealt with , I walked back out to have another look and lo and behold a tremendous , beautiful , sparkling , twinkling – let ’s just call it a luminary because star does not quite fit – way too huge and colorful – up in the east , very high .
I have been up now most nights and have begun a dawn vigil with the beautiful ‘ star ’ .
I awaken most mornings at 4.30 to go and have a look and meditate with this star – it feels like family !
I often stay with it until it is high in the sky , well into the new day and still very visible !
I started seeing the ‘ star ’ back in late December 2008 and then it suddenly was gone by the spring solstice .
I sure hope this is its return ?

Q&A regarding the ' star '
Added
11 November 2009
Q. Some people who have seen the ‘ star ’ report that they seem to experience an energy emanating from it .
Does this really happen ?
A. Yes .
The ‘ star ’ ( all four of them ) does indeed radiate energy , the quality which we would usually associate with love , which is why some people say that they actually love the ‘ star ’ and hold it in awe as something sacred .
Q. I do n’t think I have seen the ‘ star ’ but would like to very much .
If someone strongly desires to see it , is it possible that it would show itself in response ?
A. Yes .
Several people have reported this phenomenon .
What we have to remember is that the ‘ star ’ is a Spaceship with people inside it and it is They who pick up the desire and respond .
Q. I saw the ‘ star ’ on 2 March 2009 , which was confirmed in Share International magazine .
( 1 ) Do sightings of the ‘ star ’ happen according to a person ’s karma , responsibility to inform or other reason ?
( 2 ) What would be the most effective way to inform people , and therefore accelerate the first interview of Maitreya and eventually the Day of Declaration ?
A. ( 1 ) No .
Anyone can see the ‘ star ’ .
( 2 ) Contact media with what you have seen and ask them to ask questions about this unusual phenomenon .
Q. A short while ago I sent an e-mail to Share International to ask if the ‘ star ’ had appeared over Glasgow yet and received an e-mail from I assume Mr Creme himself whereby he stated he would try and arrange for the ‘ star ’ to make an appearance over my area and commented ‘ jovially ’ that he had very fond memories of Glasgow since of course this is his birthplace .
I was absolutely delighted that he had returned my e-mail , it was n’t expected .
I was wondering if the ‘ star ’ has already appeared over Glasgow recently because I fear I may have missed it , as I was on holiday recently .
It ’s not that I am that desperate to see it , it ’s just that I told my children that it would be appearing soon and I would hate to disappoint them .
I wish to put no pressure on anybody , least of all those who are flying the ‘ crafts ’ .
I thank you for your patience and understanding and wish all who work for Share International well .
Keep up the good work .
A. Keep your eyes on the skies .
Q. ( 1 ) Apart from the Observatory of Malta , are there other scientific institutions aware of the presence of the ‘ star ’ ?
( 2 ) Which is the best way of accelerating the public awareness of the ‘ star ’ and its significance ?
( 3 ) Are any countries more aware of the ‘ star ’ than others ?
Many UFO groups detect large spaceships but are not aware of their meaning .
A. ( 1 ) I cannot believe that serious workers in the world ’s observatories have not seen the ‘ star ’ — they must have taken note of it , but not understanding its significance , they probably dismissed it .
Whenever someone unacquainted with astronomy contacts such a professional body they are fobbed off with remarks like , it was probably Jupiter or Venus , or some other planet in our system .
They dismiss , a priori , the possibility of finding something new , like Maitreya ’s ‘ star ’ .
Ordinary people are upstaged by this response and believe the astronomers .
This of course is true of media as well , who need some professional person in astronomy to admit the existence of the ‘ star ’ .
However , there was good footage of the ‘ star ’ on Japanese Fuji Television [ 17 July 2009 ] for 1 minute 47 seconds of the ‘ star ’ doing its ‘ tricks ’ twirling round , moving , changing colour and size .
( 2 ) a : Talk about it .
b : Photograph it if possible and send the photographs to local media and / or Share International .
( 3 ) No .
Q. I am confused about the connection between Maitreya and beings from other planets , e.g. the large spaceships that are appearing as the ‘ star ’ .
What is the connection between Maitreya and these Beings ?
Why would they be involved in His coming ?
A . We are all part of one unitary solar system .
The public may not generally know about , or believe in , the reality of life on other planets of our system but the Hierarchies of all the planets are in contact .
There is indeed a kind of Interplanetary Parliament representing all the planets .
The Space Brothers are here to help the people of Earth to overcome the difficulties which our own ignorance has brought about and to work with Maitreya , and our Spiritual Hierarchy as a whole , in the work of salvage .
It is a spiritual mission .

Q. When will Maitreya first appear on television ?
Is it related to more people seeing the ‘ star ’ and / or to the further collapse of our financial systems ?
A . It does not entail a further collapse of our systems and it is not really related to more people seeing the ‘ star ’ .
My information is that Maitreya ’s first interview is taking place very , very soon – sooner than you think possible .
But obviously , if more people saw the ‘ star ’ and reported the sightings we could start a worldwide media debate about what the ‘ stars ’ are .
People need n’t necessarily agree with what I believe them to be – gigantic spaceships : one from Mars , one from Jupiter , one from Venus and one from a planet whose name has not been given .
They are spacecraft ( not ordinary UFOs doing their ordinary work , which is extraordinary ) which do this special work vis -à - vis the ‘ star ’ .
I have been told the four ‘ stars ’ will be in place until the Day of Declaration , in the North , South , East and West , so that wherever you are in the world your area will be covered by a ‘ star ’ .
All you have to do is keep looking for them ; they do n’t appear all the time .
People imagine you just look up and suddenly see them .
It is not that simple .
They are gigantic but they do not fill the sky .
They are larger than planets and stars and they move .
Each ‘ star ’ is about the size of five football fields put together .
They do n’t appear all the time because they have to recharge their batteries .
So they move as close to the sun as possible to recharge their batteries that way .
That takes time and then they return to position and move around .
That is the thing about the ‘ star ’ – it moves around .
Sometimes , they move about if asked : when you see one you can ask it to move ; they have been known to respond to human thought .
In fact , we recently published a letter in Share International in which the writer saw the star and asked : “ If you are the star can I see another one ? ”
And almost immediately another appeared next to the first , and then another and the fourth .
They lined up next to one another .
Q. How can Maitreya emerge if the mainstream media continues to suppress reports about the ‘ star ’ ?
A . If the media were to continue indefinitely to suppress reports about the ‘ star ’ Maitreya would just come forward .
Maitreya has had these craft from our own solar system placed in position around the Earth as a sign heralding His emergence .
It replicates what happened in the Middle East when Jesus was born .
The Star of Bethlehem guiding the wise men was a spacecraft .
This is a repetition of that event .
But now there are four and they can be seen sometimes during the day and , of course , at night .
They can be seen if you are assiduous and you look often .
If you go out star - hunting take a camera with a good zoom .
We have photographs of the star which look more like spacecraft than stars .
Look at YouTube [ website ] and you will see dozens of videos or photographs of the ‘ star ’ .
Q. Are the ‘ stars ’ life forms ?
A . The ‘ stars ’ are not life forms , they are craft made on Mars , Venus , Jupiter and the other unnamed planet .
Two were made on Mars which is the spacecraft ‘ factory ’ for our solar system ; it makes about 90 per cent of all the spacecraft .
They are made by thought and are not of dense physical matter .
If you went to Mars you would see nothing , but there are more Martians on Mars than there are people on Earth .
Q. Are the ‘ star ’ visitors guided by Maitreya ?
A. No .
I am sure that this has all been well thought out between Maitreya and the Space Brothers .
I am sure
He would leave it up to them to carry out the required mission .
Q. The ‘ star ’ , which you announced in December 2008 , is not constantly visible throughout the whole world , but now and then in some places .
If the ‘ star ’ were to be visible constantly , the acceptance by the public would be much easier .
Is the appearance of the ‘ star ’ bound by certain laws ?
A. Yes .
They can only show their light for a given number of hours per day before needing to be recharged from the sun .
Q . Is there any reason to hope that the Emergence will take place anytime soon ?
At Christmas you gave many people who trusted you reason to set their hopes very high , but it all seems to have ‘ petered ’ out .
What was billed as a “ very bright star visible to everyone both day and night ” seems to have panned out to be a tiny fraction of what we were led to hope for .
That has caused some people to back away from Share International .
( 1 ) Is it possible that Maitreya ’s emergence may take place a number of years from now , or ( 2 ) that He may have changed His mind about working openly on the world stage ?
A. ( 1 ) No. ( 2 ) No .
Of course , everyone hopes to see Maitreya soon but they are so impatient , unaware as they are of the tremendous opposition that exists , cosmic and planetary , to Maitreya ’s emergence .
The question to ask oneself is , I think , what have I done to speed His emergence ?
Is it enough or am I just waiting on the sidelines for Maitreya to act ?

Q. ( 1 ) Is the new ‘ star ’ the return of the star of Bethlehem or the “ sign of the Son of Man ” as prophesized by Jesus ?
( 2 ) Are all the things that have been happening in the recent past , signs of Him appearing soon ?
( 3 ) How do you explain the Bible ’s prophecy in Matthew 24:29 - 31 , where Jesus says
He will come “ on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory ” ?
And the scripture that says : “ And the Lord , whom you seek , will suddenly come to His temple , even the Messenger of the covenant , in whom you delight .
Behold , He is coming ” , says the Lord of Hosts . ” ( Malachi 3:1 )
This is plainly talking about a real temple in Israel ( to me , at least ) .
The problem is that the Jewish people have not rebuilt the ancient temple of Solomon .
This prophecy is yet to be fulfilled .
( 4 ) How do you see this happening ?
A. ( 1 ) The ‘ star ’ is , symbolically , the sign of the Son of Man and heralds the first appearance of Maitreya , the World Teacher , on US television , interviewed not as Maitreya , but as an ordinary man .
( 2 ) Yes .
( 3 ) Maitreya descended from
His retreat in the high Himalaya on 8 July 1977 , stayed some days in Pakistan , then came from Karachi to London , UK , on 19 July 1977 , thus “ coming in the clouds ” which today all can do by aeroplane .
( 4 ) The ‘ temple ’ referred to in this symbolic text is not a building but means humanity , to which the Son of Man returns as the oldest and highest of men .
Q. Fear still sells better than hope .
This is one reason for media inhibition of the ‘ star ’ .
Fear also governs their editors .
I had an experience with a nationwide paper whose editor in chief refused to publish an advert for the ‘ star ’ .
He did n’t state any reason for declining , but I guess it had been fear of something strange , peculiar and controversial .
Most people would rather go on in old self - destructive ways and media as a whole are the last ones who would
A. I totally agree .

Q. I was at your London lecture on 23 April 2009 and you spoke very urgently about the need to get the existence of the ‘ star ’ into media outlets ( radio , television , the internet , etc ) , so that there is an open public discussion / debate about its meaning .
A. As Maitreya says : “ Nothing happens by itself .
Man must act and implement his will . ”
Maitreya desires as much public discussion as possible otherwise the function of the ‘ star ’ in heralding His approach ,
Q. I have been following the news about the ‘ star ’ .
I am very much hoping that what people are seeing is the miracle star .
But I am wondering whether any unusual sightings have been reported by people who spend their days looking at the stars through giant telescopes , etc .
Were the scientific community to observe something new I would be reassured that it is not simply Venus being mistaken for something more unusual .
Has this happened yet ?
A . The response from professional stargazers has been a deafening silence .
Why the silence ?
Are they following governmental orders to keep quiet about any unusual sightings ( like UFOs ) ?
On the other hand , reports of sightings have been flooding in from all over the world – from Norway to New Zealand and the USA to Japan .
YouTube is full of reports , many of the ‘ star ’ although the reporter usually has no idea what , in fact , he is seeing .
Some earlier reports were indeed about Venus , but since 28 March Venus has gone beyond our sight .
So now there is no confusion .
The ‘ star ’ is brighter even than Venus , changes colour frequently and moves position .
So obviously it is not a real star .
There are , in fact , four such “ star - like luminaries ” covering the world .
They are gigantic spacecraft ( each one about the size of five football grounds put together ) .
They all come from planets of our own solar system .
They are a sign , heralds of the first public appearance on American television of Maitreya , the World Teacher .
Q . Thanks for all of the great work that you have done so gracefully for so many years .
I have one question that has been gnawing at my mind for several weeks : why have you been calling the light in the sky ‘ the star ’ , while some of your regular readers know it is one or more UFOs ?
It seems that many people would quickly become very confused by your references to ‘ the star ’ , especially after they look at the photographs ( and accompanying text ) on the Share International website that clearly indicates that it appears and disappears in a wide variety of different locations , colours , and forms , and that it moves around randomly ( unlike any other star ) like a spacecraft might .
To my mind calling it a‘star ’ , makes it all too tempting for the public ( including all those who are open to UFOs ) , to dismiss the story as baloney .
So , why not cut out the pretence and call it a UFO ?
A . There is no pretence .
Knowing the nature of the ‘ star ’ , as four gigantic spaceships from several planets of our System , I had great difficulty in deciding just how to present it to the general public and media .
I decided to follow my Master ’s example .
He had called it a “ star - like luminary of brilliant power ” , and related it to the ‘ star ’ which led the ‘ three wise men ’ to the birthplace of Jesus .
Some of us know that that ‘ star ’ was a spacecraft too , but is accepted by millions as a miracle star .
It was just before Christmas so I called it a ‘ Christmas star ’ , sure that that would be more interesting and magnetic than a prediction about a UFO .
In Britain at least , people are much more sceptical of UFOs than in the USA , for example .
Of course , at each lecture I make it clear that what looks like a star is , in fact , one of four huge spacecraft .
In a lecture , one has time and opportunity to enlarge on the subject and the meaning and purpose of the phenomenon .
In a press release or advertisement one is limited by space and the need to be succinct .
The result from the public has been encouraging – eager and excited and amazed by the sheer beauty of the spectacle .
The response of the media has been almost nil , as if there was an embargo on mentioning something so important as the herald of the Christ .
However , it could be that media interest is starting now .
Thank you for your kind words .
Q. Many people in foreign countries have had the pleasure of seeing the ‘ star ’ , but I do n’t think it has been over England very much .
I live in the south - east , and I have n’t heard of anyone seeing it here in my area .
So often the skies are cloudy , but I look every day and night for it .
Is it likely to come here again ?
I have downloaded the photograph of it over Oslo , and given it out to many people in the hope of spreading the news of Maitreya .
God bless you all at Share International .
I love the magazine .
A . We have some excellent photographs sent in to Share International by people in these islands , but our cloudy skies are certainly a hindrance .
However , keep looking and , if possible , take pictures .
Thank you for your comments on Share International magazine .
Q. I have noticed that Benjamin Creme ’s lectures are running throughout 2009 .
Why would we need more lectures ?
After we all see the ‘ star ’ wo n’t Maitreya be the main speaker or is the star going to run its show for another year before the appearance of Maitreya ?
I have been an amateur astronomer for 25 years .
Stars are suns , they do n’t move in orbital cycles .
Would you care to enlighten me on a star that moves ?
Maybe it ’s another object that has a projected orbit ?
A. Lectures are given to inform new people of our information .
That means about 6 billion people who still have not heard what is happening in our world .
The ‘ star ’ has a limited period as a sign of Maitreya ’s presence and first public interview .
Stars , as you say , do not move .
Nor , I think , do they change colour constantly and disappear at high speed .
There are four “ star - like luminaries ” which are now seen by many people around the world .
They are huge spacecraft from different planets of our solar system .
Their presence among us is further proof of the reality of UFOs and intelligent and harmless life in our own solar system .
Q. ( 1 ) In what way can you recognise the ‘ star ’ sign and not get it mixed up with celestial bodies ?
( 2 ) I know it is seen in the west .
Does it move in any way ?
I ’m looking for it in my vicinity but do n’t think I have spotted it yet .
Is there a chance it would make a wee cheeky appearance over Scotland anytime in the future ?
A. ( 1 ) For a start , it is very bright , brighter than Venus , changes colour and moves . ( 2 ) I do n’t think we have had reports from Scotland but we have from Canada and New Zealand where many ex-Scots live , as you know .
I will see if I can do anything for a magnificent sighting over Glasgow , my dear old birthplace !
Q . When I was staying in a house in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais , in March 2009 , I noticed a handprint mark on my bedroom window .
Back at my home in São Paulo , I realized that there were also some fingerprints on my own bathroom mirror .
( 1 ) Were these handprints manifested by Maitreya ?
( If yes , it ’s becoming a frequent phenomenon in my house ! )
( 2 ) Is this a sign that Maitreya ’s appearance is near ?
( 3 ) On 14 April , at 21.30 , I was coming home in São Paulo , when I saw a strange star that was changing colours very quickly , and then disappeared .
( 3 ) Was it the ‘ star ’ and did anyone else realize it was there ?
( 4 ) Also , on 6 April 2009 , outside my home , I noticed an object in the distant sky outside my home .
It was emitting a light at times and I remembered that some people who had seen the ‘ star ’ had asked it to become brighter .
I decided to do the same : when I did it really became brighter even when the object was behind the clouds , and was brighter only at the times that I asked .
It was a great moment and was like a confirmation .
Was it the star ?
A. ( 1 ) Yes , it is a Sign of His Presence .
They are appearing in many parts of the world .
( 2 ) YES , very near .
( 3 ) Yes , the ‘ star ’ and many others saw it .
( 4 ) It was the ‘ star ’ .
Q. I saw the photograph of the ‘ star ’ on your website , taken from New Zealand .
If something unusual is spotted in our skies , it is normally all over radio talkback programmes and the media , immediately .
Not a squeak so far !
If this ‘ star ’ has been seen from so many countries , it amazes me that astronomers have n’t been speaking out and discussing it , by now !
The fact that they are not , seems illogical .
I have been searching in vain for comment from the local astronomy community .
The deafening silence does not inspire confidence !
I hope with all my heart that there is such a ‘ star ’ but for now I ’m finding it hard to accept !
A. I agree .
It is quite extraordinary , this media and professional silence .
The ‘ star ’ is seen all over the world , sometimes even in broad daylight , yet the media and astronomers alike refuse to speak about it .
It begins to look as though they are following instructions from somewhere .
Q. I have been reading about the ‘ star ’ sign on your website .
I asked my uncle about the new star but he was unable to find anything more about it , even though he has some fairly advanced telescopes and photography equipment .
He cannot find the star in the sky ( he lives in Toronto , Canada ) .
Is there any way you can release some astronomical information on this ‘ star ’ so we can get a better look at it ?
I know you already have some photographs on your website though they do not seem to contain enough context to determine where the ‘ star ’ is .
A. Look for a star - like brilliant light which changes colour , moves and sometimes just disappears .
It is not a real astronomical ‘ star ’ but a spaceship .
Q. I saw what I thought was the ‘ star ’ about 8.45 pm on 14 April 2009 when coming out of a Transmission Meditation session in Ladbroke Grove , London .
It was in the western sky quite low down , very bright like Venus has been recently .
I travelled by underground to my home , which took about an hour , and could still see it .
Was it the ‘ star ’ ?
A . It was indeed the ‘ star ’ .
' Star ' sightings from around the globe
Added 11.9.2009
Dear Editor ,
While I was on vacation at the beach in Pawleys Island , South Carolina , I felt inspired to go outside and check the night sky .
It was 27 May 2009 around 9.45 pm EST [ Eastern Standard Time ] , a beautiful clear night , and the stars were too numerous to count .
As I walked toward the ocean , I asked the Space Brothers if they were in the vicinity to please make visible the ‘ star ’ heralding Maitreya ’s first interview on television .
Within seconds of making my request , two stars of brilliant yellow / orange appeared like spotlights in the eastern sky directly in front of me .
The stars , one larger than the other , were not perfectly round , and brilliant rays of light extended from each star in all directions .
They were visible for about 30 - 60 seconds .
When they disappeared , I called my wife Ann to come outside .
When she arrived , the stars reappeared with the same brilliance .
After they disappeared once again , she called to her sisters to come outside .
This time I looked to the southern sky , and the stars appeared again side - by - side but higher up .
We watched the luminaries with joy and excitement .
After the stars disappeared , we waited with great anticipation .
The stars appeared again in the eastern sky for about 30 seconds .
This time when they disappeared , we witnessed the most spectacular display of smaller white blinking stars for perhaps 10 minutes .
It seemed as if there were a hundred blinking stars all around the constellation Orion .
After the amazing display of blinking lights , one of the original yellow / orange stars appeared again in the eastern sky , then a second one , and a third , and finally a fourth , all side by side .
Brilliant rays of golden light extended from each star and appeared for another 30 - 60 seconds .
The four stars then disappeared .
Were these stars heralding Maitreya ’s first interview ?

Dear Editor ,
I awoke as if it was the morning ( in very good shape ) at 3 am on Monday 30 March 2009 .
I felt drawn to the kitchen window and looked out at the sky .
It was splendid !
I saw a star which looked like a coloured sun , dancing .
I felt merry and happy .
I went to lie down but I could n’t sleep again , although I usually sleep very well .
Was that the ‘ star ’ ?

Dear Editor ,
I often look at the stars over my village of Santiago de Mora .
Some weeks ago , there was a very bright star in the north , not normally there .
My friends also saw it over Valladolid , Murcia , Valencia and Alicante and confirmed to me they also saw it move .
Another night , at 10.30 pm , talking with a neighbour , we saw passing above us a very bright light , at an altitude of about 300 meters , from west to east .
It became sharper as it was above us and focused on us with a very potent light beam , not flickering .
It moved very differently from a plane and there was no noise coming from it .
I have seen it for five nights , almost at the same time , always passing in the same direction , but at different altitudes .
Could you comment on these please ?
B. G. R. , Santiago de Mora , Spain .
( Benjamin Creme ’s Master confirms that the “ bright star ” was indeed the ‘ star ’ .
The passing light was a spacecraft . )

Don Duncan , California statewide director of the national medical - marijuana advocacy group Americans for Safe Access ( ASA ) , came to San Diego February 10 to tell local members that the outlook for medical marijuana is good .
He pointed to a policy statement from a spokesperson for President Obama that said the federal government will stop using its police power to interfere with state medical marijuana laws .
But that was cold comfort to many of the people in the room , especially those targeted by a flurry of raids in San Diego in the first week of February .
S.D. Cracks Down on Medical Pot While Feds , State Loosen UpCalifornia Director of Americans for Safe Access Speaks to Local Groupby MARK GABRISH CONLANCopyright © 2009 by Mark Gabrish Conlan for Zenger ’s Newsmagazine •
All rights reservedPHOTOS , top to bottom : Don Duncan , Dion Markgraaf , Rudy Reyes , DonnaThe situation for medical marijuana users is loosening up just about everywhere in the country — or at least in the 13 states that have laws allowing it — except in San Diego County and elsewhere in southern California .
That was the message Don Duncan , California director of the nationwide organization Americans for Safe Access ( ASA ) , brought to the local ASA chapter in San Diego February 10 .
For years medical marijuana users have been bedeviled by federal raids ever since the U.S. Supreme Court ’s rulings in 2001 and 2005 that state medical pot laws did n’t protect patients , caregivers and growers from federal anti-drug law enforcement — but , said Duncan , the Obama administration has sent signals that these raids may soon end .
“ When the DEA [ federal Drug Enforcement Administration ] raided a Lake Tahoe dispensary on January 22 and several others in Los Angeles last week , we started to get concerned , ” Duncan said .
“ There was a tremendous grass - roots outcry that you did n’t see in the media .
So many people called the White House switchboard that they [ officials in the Obama administration ] came to us and asked us what we wanted .
The White House wanted to do something , so Wednesday night , February 5 , the administration spoke out about medical cannabis [ marijuana ] .
” The statement came from Obama spokesperson Nick Shapiro and was given to the conservative Washington Times newspaper .
“ The President believes that federal resources should not be used to circumvent state laws , ” Shapiro said , adding that “ as [ Obama ] continues to appoint senior leadership to fill out the ranks of the federal government ” — including a new head of the DEA — “ he expects them to review their policies with that in mind . ”
Duncan also said he hopes Obama ’s repeated statements that “ he ’ll let science decide the issues , ” though usually thought to refer to global warming and stem - cell research , means he ’ll take a more progressive view and support the federal Institute of Medicine ’s recommendation that sick people be allowed access to medical marijuana immediately .
Meanwhile , San Diego County ’s local efforts to circumvent California ’s medical marijuana law continues apace , San Diego ASA chair Dion Markgraaf and others at the meeting reported .
Among the overflow crowd were individuals who themselves had been raided in the first week of February for reasons which remained a mystery — no press releases had been issued and no media had covered the incidents — until the San Diego Union - Tribune Web site published a dispatch about the incidents and Steve Walker , deputy communications director for San Diego County District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis , issued a release about them on February 10 .
According to these sources , the raids on medical marijuana users were part of “ Operation Endless Summer , ” a sting operation begun last fall “ as a response to concerns over increased drug trafficking in military housing . ”
Walker ’s press release said that “ the operation focused on drug dealers and violent criminals operating in a Fleet Concentration Area ” — i.e. , Navy housing — “ and negatively affecting the quality of life of families living in military housing .
” Walker ’s release explained that the operation was a collaboration between the U.S. Navy Criminal Investigative Service ( NCIS ) , the federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives ( ATF ) , the San Diego County District Attorney ’s office and the San Diego Police Department .
The release stated that , “ As part of the operation , law enforcement seized $ 19,000 in cash ; two pounds of crystal methamphetamine ; a half - pound of powder cocaine ; one gram of heroin ; more than 75 Oxycontin pills ; 100 Ecstasy pills ; more than 400 marijuana plants ; six pounds of marijuana ; and seven guns .
”
“ There were lots of raids last week , and they started on Tuesday [ February 3 ] with people in this room , ” said Markgraaf .
“ I thought , ‘ More raids , more terror .
Should I tell people to hide their children ? ’
I started calling people on my list , and the people on that list got busted .
Most of the people were linked to a girl named Jessica .
She helped contribute to people going to a house on Pico Street , a Navy house , where people made [ medical marijuana ] buys with doctors ’ letters . ”
Markgraaf compared the operation to a similar sting a year or two ago that targeted students at San Diego State University ( SDSU ) and cost some about - to - graduate students their degrees , and predicted that , as with the SDSU raid , this will achieve little or nothing in prosecuting people for truly dangerous drugs .
“ What happened here was that the Mayor of San Diego ’s liaison said delivery services would be left alone , so they ’re raiding us , ” said Donna , a caregiver who was one of the 33 people arrested in the San Diego raids .
( The media coverage said that “ Operation Endless Summer ” targeted 52 people , which left a lot of the ASA meeting attendees worried that they ’re on the list of 19 people who still have n’t been apprehended . )
In a letter she wrote to San Diego Union - Tribune reporter Jeff MacDonald , Donna described the hell she went through on the morning of February 5 .
“ I looked out my window and saw about 10 men dressed in black riot gear and helmets running towards my home , carrying a large metal pipe for smashing doors and all armed with semi-automatic assault rifles , ” Donna wrote .
“ I stepped out onto my porch to avoid the possibility of having my licensed assistance dog , Buster , shot by the San Diego Police Department .
As these men and women pointed their semi-automatic rifles at me and ordered my hands into the air , my bathrobe fell open and there I was , naked for all the world to see .
My days of trauma had just begun .
I was handcuffed , my house destroyed , and I was taken to jail .
” Donna ’s letter characterized the raids as “ home invasion robberies ” carried out under cover of law .
“ Medical marijuana patients and the general population as a whole should be outraged at the hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars that were just wasted for a bunch of police to infiltrate a group of sick , injured and dying people — to befriend them — to feign sickness and to manipulate and trick us into helping them obtain medicine , ” she wrote .
“ Was this ordered by the same Mayor who appears nightly on television talking about how broke this city is ?
” “ The problem in San Diego is not the feds , it ’s the state , ” said attorney Gerald Singleton , whose client , John Ottombrino , has also been targeted by local law enforcement .
Singleton said that when he tried Ottombrino ’s case , the local judge , Ted Weathers , “ would not let us present the medical necessity defense .
The position of the local D.A. and law enforcement is they do n’t like the law and wo n’t enforce it .
” Duncan made the grimly ironic point that the recent flurry of law enforcement attacks on medical marijuana users , caregivers and distributors in southern California is a paradoxical reflection of the movement ’s overall success .
Not only has Obama ’s spokesperson come out against the raids and promised that Obama ’s appointees on drug policy wo n’t pursue federal attacks on state medical - marijuana laws — “ the most important statement [ of support ] we have ever had from a U.S. President , ” Duncan said — but 16 Congressmembers have signed a statement urging the DEA to expand opportunities for scientists to research the medical benefits for marijuana .
“ If we were n’t winning nationwide , you would n’t be having these raids , ” Duncan said .
“ They know a new day is dawning .
The clock is ticking .
It ’s almost over .
The California Supreme Court is ready to make a decision on San Diego County v. San Diego NORML [ National Association for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ] ” — a suit the San Diego County Board of Supervisors ( later joined by San Bernardino and Merced Counties ) filed to have Proposition 215 declared illegal on the ground that the federal government pre-empts all drug laws — “ but we already know what the ruling is going to be because we already won a similar case at the state appeals court involving Garden Grove , and both the California and U.S. Supreme Courts refused to hear that case .
The reason they ’re stalling , fighting , busting people and wasting resources is because they know the tide is turning .
” Rudy Reyes , a local medical marijuana patient — he started using it to relieve his pain after being badly burned in the 2003 Cedar wildfire — and activist , described a meeting he had with DEA agents in Oakland in early February .
Noting that just the fact that he was invited to speak to DEA agents about medical marijuana is a victory , Reyes said , “ They were upset at Obama ’s policy because they ’re worried about the loss of money .
” The reason is yet another of the dirty little secrets of U.S. drug law : asset forfeiture , which allows federal , state and local law enforcement to seize the property of alleged drug dealers , put it in the treasuries of their own agencies , and refuse to give it back even if the person they seized it from is ultimately found not guilty .
According to Reyes , law enforcement agencies have seen the asset forfeiture laws as a giant piggy bank for them , and they ’re worried about losing it .
“ We ’re easy money for them , ” he said .
“ They ’re going to go after head shops and demand they pull oil burners .
” Reyes also spoke to the County Board of Supervisors during the public - comment portion of their February 10 meeting .
Reyes said that the Obama administration ’s statement that they wo n’t use federal anti-drug resources to target state medical - marijuana laws “ destroys [ the basis for ] their lawsuit ” seeking to invalidate Proposition 215 .
When Reyes addressed the Board of Supervisors , he recalled , “ I asked them to review their policies and set up a task force ” to implement the state law .
” Then he made another stop — to San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders ’ office — to ask him for a meeting about the ID card issue .
“ Sanders said he wo n’t have a meeting with us because he ’s more concerned about the city ’s financial issues , ” Reyes said .
“ We just got told by the Mayor that we ’re not that important . ”
Fortunately , newly elected City Councilmember Marti Emerald , a former TV journalist for Channel 10 , has approached him for information on the issue and he ’s hoping she ’ll take the leadership role former Councilmember Toni Atkins took on medical marijuana earlier in the decade .
Reyes also said he has a meeting scheduled with County Sheriff Bill Kolender February 17 .
The meeting ended with a discussion of what to do in case of further raids against medical marijuana patients .
“ The most important thing we should learn is to have a better communications system , ” Markgraaf said .
“ Even the little I did helped .
Number two , we should be prepared .
You should know about bail , and not think about it for the first time when you get raided .
Number three , people do n’t know each other ’s phone numbers any more because of cell phones [ whose numbers often change when people lose a phone or switch to a different plan ] .
You have to have not only yourselves but your family members ready to call .
We need to support these cases , both communally and civilly , and we need to use these cases to make change .

well , that did n’t take long …
The conspiracy web is already gripped with panic and paranoia about a nonexistent swine flu vaccine .
Conspiracy blogs are igniting with a warning from a Dr. Patricia A. Doyle about a swine flu vaccine that was tried during an influenza outbreak in 1976 , telling readers not to take any vaccine that claims to prevent swine flu .
The panicked article also goes into a variety of anti-vaccination cliches about how our bodies are “ probably weakened by the dead virus fragments ” and “ various toxins , ” as well as speculation that influenza vaccines could actually provide genetic components for even more sinister and potent diseases when the current strain of swine flu combines with genetic remnants of the vaccine .
Let ’s start from the beginning .
First of all , there was a pandemic scare in 1976 regarding a A / H1N1 strain for which most people would have no protection even after extensive immunization because it ’s very different from the seasonal strains used for routine vaccinations .
The pandemic never materialized but a potential vaccine was actually made .
And herein lies the tiny kernel of truth in this story .
There was an incident at Fort Dix and a number of cases deemed to be related to adverse reactions to a haphazard immunization effort .
However , as noted by the CDC , there is no real , working vaccine for the prevention of swine flu and the government is still not sure it should order one to be made since it would take a long time to manufacture it and make sure that it works and works properly .
So in short , there ’s no vaccine to be afraid of .
It does n’t exist .
Secondly , the viruses used in flu shots are dead and inactive .
Randomly combining parts of genetic code from dead influenza viruses that create a new strain and start triggering all sorts of diseases seem a tad unlikely .
The adverse reactions mentioned above were cases 1,098 of Guillian - Barre syndrome which are thought to be the result of a potential bacterial contamination of egg cultures used for vaccine manufacture .
Experts still do n’t know for sure but the estimated risk of contracting GBS was 1 in 100,000 or 0.001 % or so .
Perhaps the most interesting part of Doyle ’s warning is the speed with which it spread and how so few of the sites which reposted it asked why a doctor in business administration is giving medical advice .
Then again , this is the nature of a conspiracy theory in general .
If you have a good , scary story , you ’re probably going to get a free pass from the majority of your audience …
Really , how come ?
If it ’s still working , the device can be given to someone in need .
Or , if the item utilizes current technology , the working parts can be resold and installed into other devices .
But if it ’s just gathering dust in your closet , the materials are not being put to productive use .

Where should people take their old electronics ?
It depends on where you live .
Some towns and cities sponsor drop - off centers or periodic collection events .
You can find information about where to go at our Web site , electronicsrecycling.org .
Other sites include MyGreenElectronics.org , which is sponsored by the Consumer Electronics Association and allows searches by ZIP code , and Earth911.com , a public - private partnership that lets you search by type of electronic and address .
What if there are no recycling centers nearby ?
Several big chain stores , including Best Buy and Staples , allow you to drop off most small electronics for recycling .
Manufacturers are starting to offer recycling , too .
Apple , Dell , Samsung , Sony and others now offer free recycling either through mail - in programs or at drop - off sites specified on their Web sites .
Are all these services free ?
Most are .
But certain components , like cathode ray tubes , are difficult and costly to recycle , so you should expect to pay anywhere from $ 5 to $ 20 to recycle an old TV or monitor .
Also , you may have to do some hunting to find a place that will take them .
A good place to start is a Web site like Earth911.com .
What ’s preventing people from simply throwing an old television in the trash , where it ends up in a landfill ?
Back in the 60's , archive space at the BBC was hard to come by , forcing the broadcaster to delete some of its own material .
Now , a TV show that fell victim to this regime has been resurrected , with the BBC using a pirate recording of the show 's audio to bring it back to life .
In these Internet and file - sharing times , it seems unthinkable that we could ever be in the position of any media becoming ‘ rare ’ again .
No matter where material appears , it always seems to end up on the Internet and , once there , it is copied time and time again to every corner of the globe .
Losing a movie , song or TV show forever should be a thing of the past – but it has n’t always been that way .
With today ’s compression and hard drive technology , we can store hundreds of movies in a very small space indeed , but before the mainstream uptake of digital technology , storing video or music was a very expensive and resource - hungry task .
Recent news from the BBC gives us a taster of how difficult things had become for them in the 1960 ’s , with the public broadcaster finding itself squeezed by lack of funds and lack of storage space , and even having to resort to erasing TV shows it had previously made .
One such TV show that suffered was Dad ’s Army , a sitcom about the Home Guard in World War 2 .
The series ran for a huge 80 episodes on TV and made further appearances on radio , film and stage .
The show pulled in 18 million viewers an episode during the 1970 ’s and still appears on TV today .
Last night a very special episode aired on the BBC .
Room at the Bottom , an episode presumed lost by the BBC when it was erased to save space and money over thirty years ago , appeared on TV last night .
The original show was in black and white ( the color version was erased , along with the audio ) but experts recreated the color version from the black and white source .
But what about the lost audio ?
Ed Doolan MBE is a presenter on BBC Radio WM , but back in 1969 before he worked for the BBC , he was a very naughty boy .
Using a reel - to - reel tape recorder , Doolan recorded many shows , including the audio from the ‘ lost ’ episode when it first aired , and has kept the recording ever since .
Today , far from hauling him over the coals , the BBC has used Doolan ’s illicit copy to help bring the show back to life .
Last night , millions of Dad ’s Army fans enjoyed the ‘ lost ’ episode of their beloved show and you can bet that not a single one would be calling for Doolan to be sued .
In the end , the ‘ good ’ in his piracy leads to enjoyment for millions , and that can never be a bad thing .
It ’s only when we lose something that we truly appreciate its full value and , thanks to file - sharing and the Internet , we are now in the enviable position of never having to apply the words ‘ rare ’ or ‘ lost ’ to any media ever again .
And even though companies want to make media less accessible with their DRM , in the longer term , no - one will thank them for locking away history .
Climate change is already causing disruption to marine ecosystems , according to a series of talks given at this years ' American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting .
Oceans are both warming and acidifying , and the effects are different from those traditionally faced by the conservation community , which is having to learn how to use new tools and adapt itself to this brave new world .
Prof .
Dee Boersma of the University of Washington kicked things off with data from her group 's work with the penguins of Punta Tombo , Argentina .
Prof. Boersma sees the penguins as sentinels that are already telling us about severe changes underway .
The egg - laying season has been shifting later and later , at the rate of about 3 days every decade .
When this is coupled with the greater contrast between El Ni�o and La Ni�a years , the cost of living for penguins in Punta Tombo is going up .
GPS data from tagged birds reveals that they have to travel up to 40 km farther in 2008 than 2002 — a long way for a small bird .
One of the results has been a northward migration , with penguins starting new colonies further up the Atlantic coast .
This lined up quite well with the following talks , both of which presented modeling data on how climate change will most likely affect marine ecosystems .
Dr. William Cheung of the University of East Anglia discussed research that used climate model predictions and data of species abundance to project the changes in distribution of over 1,000 commercially important fish and invertebrate species .
Cheung 's work points to a migration towards higher latitudes and deeper water as species seek out more hospitable habitats .
Practically , this means local extinctions in traditional fishing areas ( already being witnessed in the Bering Sea ) , and species invasion into others .
Countries are going to lose fish stocks to their neighbors , something we 're already seeing with jumbo squid and salmon .
Cheung predicts that Norway , Greenland , and Alaska are going to be the biggest winners , with China , the mainland US , Indonesia , and Chile losing the most .
The final talk of the session was by Prof.
Patrick Halpin , from Duke , on the predicted effects of climate change on marine protected areas ( MPA ) .
Prof .
Halpin 's take - home message was that the effects will not be uniform ; not every MPA is as tolerant as the next , and they wo n't all receive the same " dose . "
According to Halpin , modeling the effects of climate change on MPAs is not nearly as simple as for land masses or the open oceans .
MPAs tend to be near shore , which complicates the models ( based on how much of a grid is land or water ) , but the data show a linear trend towards warming , and the mean increase is greater than that seen for the open oceans .
The damage being done to reef ecosystems is pretty well known , with warm water reefs being at greater risk ; projections show that by the end of the current century , around 90 percent will be subject to heating greater than 2�C .
Another risk highlighted by Prof .
Halpin is that the connections among reefs might break down , wreaking havoc on connected but geographically dispersed ecosystems .
Prof .
Halpin also spoke about upwelling systems , such as those off the coast of California that bring nutrient - rich water up from the depths .
The models are more suspect here , but they predict an end to upwelling by 2100 , which would have massive repercussions should it happen .
Halpin ended by suggesting that it 's time to move away from MPAs and towards ocean zoning , a practice that is more effective both for minimizing the damage to sensitive ecosystems and also for allowing productive human use of the seas , be that fishing or industrial .
Overall , the session painted a pretty bleak picture for the oceans over the next hundred years , but as we found out in a different session that we 'll cover shortly , it 's not doom and gloom everywhere .

What they 're saying is that for anyone that uses between 80 and 300 gig , the new monthly wholesale cost is going to be $ 45.00 .
They have this opinion that the bandwidth Rocky can buy from Peer1 at $ 0.10 per gig is somehow worth $ 1.125 when you stick " BELL " on it .

( f) Uncorrelated Usage Charge :
In cases where the Company 's records can not correlate a domain name to a valid billing telephone number for a given session , the Company will , on a monthly basis , issue a bulk bill to the service provider for that usage .
A rate of $ 1.875 per gigabytes ( GB ) or portion thereof applies .
This charge will be in addition to all other applicable rates and charges
The only way they can possibility track that is with DPI .

HUZZAH !!!
HUZZAH !!!
HUZZAH !!!
Mark to Market By David Henderson
Economist Jeff Hummel sent out the following to a large e-mail list .
I ’m reprinting the whole thing here and appending my comments .
Jeff ’s e-mail :
Mark - to - market accounting has received a lot of criticism during the
current financial crisis .
But a recent email from Less Antman , a CPA and
financial planner , offers the best explanation I ’ve seen of why
government - mandated capital requirements are the real source of the
problem .
Economists now realize that reserve requirements , designed to
make banks more LIQUID , have the unintended reverse impact during a panic ,
tying up cash that banks need to pay out in order to stem the panic .
As a
result , reserve requirements are fast disappearing as a tool of bank
regulation .
Similarly , capital requirements , designed to make banks more
SOLVENT , also have the reverse impact during a crisis .
What follows is
Less ’s analysis :
“ Any discussion of mark - to - market accounting must differentiate between
the beneficial effects of honestly reporting assets at what they are
actually worth and the destructive impact of inflexible regulations that
utilize the principle .
Current discussions have blurred the distinction .
“ (1 ) The Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) determined that
securities held by a company which it intends to sell when funds are
needed for another purpose ought to be reported at fair market value
rather than historical cost .
This seems eminently sensible to me .
“ (2 ) The FASB allowed an exception for debt securities which would
eventually mature at a fixed price , and which the company had the positive
intent and ability to hold to maturity .
Mark - to - market accounting is
specifically not required when the company elects to classify the security
as one to be held to maturity .
“ (3 ) In spite of ignorant comments to the contrary , ‘ market ’ does n’t mean
that the last trading price of a security must always be used , nor that a
security whose market has virtually disappeared due to unusual
circumstances must be valued at zero or near zero .
The FASB EXPLICITLY
permits the use of alternative market measures in such circumstances , such
as the complicated derivative pricing model known as Black - Scholes .
For
instance , Berkshire Hathaway ( Warren Buffett ’s company ) has $ 8.1 billion
( at cost ) of derivatives on its books , all carried under mark - to - market
accounting , but none of them currently priced based on the non-existent
market for those derivatives .
“ I am fully supportive of the use of mark - to - market accounting on balance
sheets .
It is clearly the most honest way to report derivatives .
So what ’s
the problem with mark - to - market accounting ?
I see the following
government - created problems associated with them :
“ (1 ) Mark - to - market was adopted by regulators as the basis for determining
minimum capital requirements .
Creating an inflexible regulation based on
an inherently volatile measure was always an accident waiting to happen .
“ (2 ) While foresighted bank executives might have chosen to maintain
capital in excess of regulatory requirements so that a decline in value
would n’t trigger a crisis , it would have made no business sense to do so ,
since it would have reduced their lending income and ability to pay
competitive rates on deposits or offer other benefits to attract
customers .
In a free market , they would have been able to do so , since
they would have gained a reputation advantage from their greater safety ,
but with FDIC insurance protecting all deposits , customers do n’t shop
based on safety , as they assume they are protected by the government from
the loss of their deposits .
Thus , only the rates and benefits offered by a
bank matter to a customer , not the reliability of the bank , thanks to the
FDIC . ”
( JRH interjecting : I might add that Less ’s point here is well supported by
the historical record .
Prior to government deposit insurance , U.S. banks
voluntarily maintained capital - asset ratios in the neighborhood of 10 to
20 percent , way above current mandated levels . )
“ (3 ) With banks thus always seeking to keep only the minimum required
capital , the problem was further exacerbated by the Basel capital
requirement formula , which requires less than half the capital if kept in
the form of AAA securities compared to high quality individual mortgages
( as I discuss in my article on Credit Default Swaps , forthcoming in the
April 2009 issue of THE FREEMAN ) .
This caused an explosive increase in the
worldwide demand for AAA securities as a result of the needs of regulatory
arbitrage .
“ (4 ) With capital of virtually every international bank invested as
heavily as possible in AAA securities critical to the financial
competitiveness of the bank , the problem was further exacerbated by the
ratings cartel created by the SEC in 1975 , which effectively mandated that
companies obtain a rating from Moody ’s , S&P , or Fitch , who were thus
effectively insulated from the destructive effects of reputational damage
by a system that made it impossible for them to be put out of business by
more accurate upstart rating services .
This also prevented better methods
of risk measurement ( such as Credit Default Swaps ) from replacing ratings .
“ (5 ) Fannie and Freddie fed the supply by creating AAA securities in
gigantic sums , initially from the securitization of high - quality
mortgages , then from lower - quality mortgages that had components
artificially improved in quality from the creation of ‘ tranches , ’ and
finally from lower tranches artificially improved in quality as a result
of Credit Default Swap protection from AAA - rated companies such as AIG
( also discussed in my CDS article ) .
AAA ratings that were , in many cases ,
undeserved .
“ (6 ) It is also possible , although I have n’t thought this through , that
the mortgage lending boom itself was stimulated by the need for AAA
securities to satisfy regulatory arbitrage needs worldwide , and once it
was clear that low - quality mortgages could be turned into AAA securities ,
the lowering of lending standards was inevitable , even absent the CRA and
FHA mandates .
“ So , thanks to various government interventions , banks operated with the
minimum capital required by the mark - to - market application of the law ,
consisting almost entirely of artificially created AAA securities
benefiting from artificially high market pricing resulting from sloppy
ratings .
And then reality bit , and an honest revaluation of these
securities based on mark - to - market accounting , linked to inflexible
government regulations , brought down the banking industry .
And that is the
extent to which I believe mark - to - market accounting can be blamed for this
crisis . ”
David ’s addition :
Jeff ’s comment above reminded me of George Kaufman ’s article .
“ Deposit Insurance , ” in the first edition of The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics .
Note the following statement in the article :

Amsterdam , The Netherlands , March 10 , 2009 – A simple balance test may predict cognitive decline in Alzheimer 's Disease , according to a study published in the March 2009 issue of the Journal of Alzheimer 's Disease .
This study was carried out in 16 university hospital departments of neurology , geriatrics or psychiatry in ten cities with 686 outpatients suffering from AD .
This population is representative of the AD population seen by clinicians in daily practice .
Patients were evaluated by a geriatrician every six months for up to two years , and their degree of cognitive impairment was measured using the Mini Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) .
At the same time , a " one-leg balance " ( OLB ) test was given , where a participant was asked to stand on one leg for as long as possible .
The OLB test was reported as abnormal when the participant was unable to stand on one leg for 5 seconds or more .
Participants with an abnormal OLB at baseline or / and during the follow - up showed significantly more cognitive decline at 12 , 18 and 24 months than the participants with a OLB test normal at baseline and normal during the follow - up .
The worst condition ( having an abnormal OLB at baseline and during the follow - up= no improvement ) was associated with a mean adjusted cognitive decline of 9.2 points .
The best condition ( having a normal OLB at baseline and during the follow - up = no worsening ) was associated with a mean adjusted cognitive decline of 3.8 points .
Senior Investigator Yves Rolland , Inserm and the University of Toulouse , France , states , " Our results suggested that an abnormal OLB is a marker of more advanced dementia ( worst baseline characteristic ) and an independent predictor of cognitive decline in AD .
Our results reinforce in an AD population , the growing evidence suggesting a link between physical performances and cognitive decline .
If these results are confirmed by other data , the OLB test could be adopted in clinical practice to identify AD patients at high risk of rapid cognitive decline . "

The worst economic slowdown in three - quarters of a century has wiped £ 40,000 from the wealth of every adult in the United Kingdom , a national total of almost £ 2 trillion ; that is £ 2,000bn , or £ 2,000,000,000,000 .
The research into the destructive effects of the recession by the accountant PricewaterhouseCoopers for The Independent shows that the fall in the value of property and shares owned by British households between July 2007 and February 2009 has reached the equivalent of 18 months - worth of national output – a colossal destruction that will take many years to recover from and threatens the retirement plans of millions of Britons .
The total value of shares and homes owned by British households has fallen from £ 6.8 trn in 2007 to £ 4.9 trn now – a decline of £ 1.9trn , or 28 per cent , the PwC figures show .

During the credit crunch , houses have lost 20 per cent of their value ( or £ 800 bn ) and equities 40 per cent ( or £ 1.1trn ) .
Thus , each adult Briton has lost on average £ 17,000 from the property slump and a further £ 23,000 in the value of shares , held either directly or indirectly though pension plans .
The losses are likely to rise , and there could be a further fall of about 15 to 20 per cent in property values .
John Hawksworth , head of economics at PwC , said : " The knock - on effect of this level of wealth destruction will result in significantly more belt - tightening and reduced spending by households over the next year .
The situation could be exacerbated by expected further falls in house prices over the period . "
Economists fear that the fall in the value of houses , pension funds and shares will further depress the economy , damaging confidence , reducing spending and prompting more sell - offs in stock markets and by homeowners , risking a vicious cycle of decline and deflation .
The authorities are concerned that the sort of deflation that took hold of the economy in the Great Depression in the 1930s – where prices and output continually fell – could happen again unless the vicious cycle is broken .
This week , the Bank of England will inject a further £ 2bn into the economy , part of its £ 75 bn programme of " quantitative easing " , more commonly called printing money .
The PwC analysis suggests that the loss of wealth felt by households and individuals is contributing to the slump in spending in the shops , by about £ 45bn , or 5 per cent of total spending , relative to what might otherwise have been the case .
Traditionally " equity release " from homes and the knowledge that the value of a household 's assets are rising strongly , as was seen in the property boom , fuels optimism and consumer spending .
But that is being thrown sharply into reverse .
PwC say that the UK's GDP will be 3 per cent lower purely as a result of the credit crunch 's destruction of wealth .
Mr Hawksworth added : " The estimated loss of wealth of £ 1.9 trn would equate to about £ 40,000 on average per adult [ aged 18 + ] in the UK , although clearly , these losses will vary considerably across the population . "
As recently as last September , the total losses had been limited to £ 600bn , a serious situation , but moderate compared to the haemorrhaging of wealth since , as stock markets around the world have crashed and banks have been nationalised .
As in previous recessions , the losses and pain from this recession will be unevenly spread .
For those fortunate to hold on to their jobs the loss in wealth may be temporary ( although lasting years ) and notional if they do not have to sell their homes or cash in investments .
But for others , those who lose their jobs and have their homes repossessed and see them disposed of at firesale prices , the recession will mean a 100 per cent loss of personal wealth .
On Wednesday , official figures will show that unemployment has climbed above the two million mark , with a peak of more than three million expected by this time next year .
Fallujah , April 24 , 2009
The brief film is deeply disturbing , even in a country famed for its al - Qaeda beheading videos and sniper snuff movies .
The young woman , evidently drugged , vomiting and occasionally calling for her mother , tries weakly to stop the grinning man in a white T - shirt and boxer shorts from pulling off her underwear .
She fails .
The man , instructing the cameraman to shoot the scene with his mobile phone from various angles , rapes her .
That is not the only shocking aspect of the film , according to Jassim al - Bidawi , former Mayor of Fallujah and now a human rights activist .
He has identified the rapist as an Iraqi police officer , and says that the cameraman is one , too .
They are thought to have drugged the woman as she visited her husband in a detention centre in Ramadi .
Since the rapist 's uncle is a senior policeman in the city the attacker is all but untouchable , Mr al - Bidawi says .
In the desperate rush to drag Iraq back from civil war , sweeping powers were granted to its new security forces .
Human rights workers , MPs and American officials now believe that they are all too often a law unto themselves : admired when they defeat terrorists but also feared for their widespread abuse of power .
In this vast and largely unaccountable security apparatus , with almost a million people in uniform , corruption is rife .
One of the most common ploys is to arrest innocent people and then charge hundreds or even thousands of dollars for them to be released .
Abu Aliya , 35 , was arrested with 15 other men in a Baghdad park last September .
They were having a picnic after a day of manual labour when a unit of Iraqi soldiers handcuffed and beat them , demanding to know whether they recognised any of the people on a list of suspected Shia militiamen .
The men said that they did not .
They were locked up and whipped with electrical cables to force them to confess to being militiamen .
After three months a soldier told them that they needed a lawyer .
Fearing that they would never get out , they each paid $ 3,000 - a huge sum to day labourers earning about $ 10 a day - and were sent to court .
The judge asked why they had been detained when there was no evidence , then dismissed the case .
" The Iraqi security forces are out of control , " Abu Aliya said .
" If you quarrel with a simple soldier , even one out of uniform , he will arrest you and your family .
This is happening everywhere , all the time . "
Muhammad , in his early twenties , was arrested in a raid on his west Baghdad neighbourhood in 2007 .
He says that he spent 18 months in jail , where men were dragged off every night for questioning , returning to overcrowded cells in the morning battered and semi-conscious .
Muhammad lost several teeth during the beatings meted out to him and was hung by his arms until he consented to put a thumbprint on a document that he could not read because he was blindfolded .
His family paid $ 800 and he was released , even though he had apparently confessed to a crime .
Sawsan al - Barrack , an official at the Ministry of Human Rights , said : " There are many cases of abuse of power coming to us , especially of police officers in temporary detention centres .
There are many women complaining they are raped or beaten . "
In many cases rape is seen as a stain on family honour and the victim is killed .
Mr al - Bidawi said that was believed to have been the fate of the young woman filmed by the Ramadi police officer .
According to tribal sources in Ramadi , the rapist in the film , who apparently recorded his crime to make his victim keep her mouth shut , was detained briefly before being mysteriously freed .
He is believed to have fled to Syria .
Amel al - Qaadi , a member of the Iraqi Parliament 's Integrity Committee , said that she had met a young male student who had been detained and had confessed to membership of a terrorist cell because his jailers threatened to rape him .
" There were many others who told me they were actually raped at the headquarters of various security force units , " she said .
Ms al - Qaadi warned that random arrests were exacerbating the surge in violence .
" Most current attacks on the armed forces are the results of earlier arrests by the security forces .
Eventually they become terrorists because we forced them into it , " she said .
Azhar al - Samarrai , a Sunni MP from the Committee for Displaced Persons , said that , facing defeat at the hands of militias and terrorist groups , the US and Iraqi authorities hastily recruited " substandard people , with no education or moral values " into the security forces .
Often the officers were former militiamen or insurgents .
She said that the Government had been trying to weed out corrupt elements but was wary of destabilising security .

What is the appropriate role of government ?
Traditionally , the division between conservatives and liberals has been over the role and size of the welfare state : liberals think that the government should play a large role in sanding off the market economy ’s rough edges , conservatives believe that time and chance happen to us all , and that ’s that .
But both sides , I thought , agreed that the government should provide public goods — goods that are nonrival ( they benefit everyone ) and nonexcludable ( there ’s no way to restrict the benefits to people who pay . )
The classic examples are things like lighthouses and national defense , but there are many others .
For example , knowing when a volcano is likely to erupt can save many lives ; but there ’s no private incentive to spend money on monitoring , since even people who did n’t contribute to maintaining the monitoring system can still benefit from the warning .
So that ’s the sort of activity that should be undertaken by government .
So what did Bobby Jindal choose to ridicule in this response to Obama last night ?
Volcano monitoring , of course .
And leaving aside the chutzpah of casting the failure of his own party ’s governance as proof that government can’t work , does he really think that the response to natural disasters like Katrina is best undertaken by uncoordinated private action ?
Hey , why bother having an army ?
Let ’s just rely on self - defense by armed citizens .
The intellectual incoherence is stunning .
Basically , the political philosophy of the GOP right now seems to consist of snickering at stuff that they think sounds funny .
The party of ideas has become the party of Beavis and Butthead .
( New York ) – China should open Tibetan areas to independent monitors and journalists as a means of diffusing ethnic tensions and preventing violence on the eve of a string of politically sensitive anniversaries , Human Rights Watch said today .
One year after the largest Tibetan protests for more than two decades , the presence of such observers would serve as an incentive for good behavior for crowds , which have sometimes turned violent , and security forces , which have used disproportionate force and arbitrary detention as tools of ordinary policing .
February 25 marks the traditional Tibetan New Year , or Losar ; March 10 is the 50th anniversary of the 1959 Lhasa uprising and the Dalai Lama ’s escape to India ; and March 28 marks the new central government - imposed “ Serfs Emancipation Day . ”
“ Resorting to locking down Tibet is n’t merely a statement about the security situation there , it ’s also an admission of failure by the government to effectively address key grievances , ” said Sophie Richardson , Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch .
“ Relying exclusively on repressive policies will only lead to increased polarization and resentment , while further jeopardizing genuine stability across Tibet . ”
In recent weeks , the Chinese government significantly increased the number of security forces across Tibet .
Beijing tightened already highly limited access for international media , sealed off monasteries , and imposed sweeping restrictions on movement with the extensive use of arbitrary detention as a tool of enforcement and intimidation .
Foreign media have been effectively barred from freely reporting in Tibetan areas ( with the exception of several government - organized and controlled tours ) since protests by monks and violence in the Tibetan capital Lhasa in March 2008 .
In April 2008 , the Chinese government turned down a request from the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit Tibet on grounds that it was “ inconvenient . ”
A separate appeal issued jointly by six UN special rapporteurs was similarly declined .
In Lhasa , the authorities have strictly implemented new measures issued in mid-January , which require the registration of temporary residents in the city .
This process gives the police full discretionary power , and has resulted in arbitrary expulsion of non-permanent residents .
In addition , the Lhasa authorities have increased police operations aimed at identifying and detaining people who are suspected of either hindering the anti-separatism campaign or becoming potential protesters .
These include former political prisoners and their families , minor offenders and temporary visitors .
To process the large number of administrative arrests resulting from these heightened security measures , the authorities appear to have resorted to large - scale administrative detention outside of police stations and formal detention facilities .
One such facility , according to several reports from local residents received by Human Rights Watch , is a former military work unit on the outskirts of Lhasa currently housing hundreds of temporary detainees and several armed police forces units .
Situated in Caigongtang Xiang ( Tibetan : Tshal Gungthang ) , immediately east of Lhasa city , this large facility is reported to be holding people who are to be sent back to neighboring counties , prefectures , or the provinces of their household registration .
One source said that people were being taken daily by the police to the train station or being told by the police that they will be held until after March for security reasons .
Satellite pictures examined by Human Rights Watch matched the description given by one eyewitness of large , walled facilities with several watchtowers overlooking rows of multi-storey buildings organized around a yard .
No other independent confirmation could be immediately obtained given the current restrictions on movement in Tibet .
Human Rights
Watch said that major obstacles to resolving tensions in Tibetan areas were the Chinese authorities ’ overreliance on coercive measures and failure to uphold basic human rights standards – such as distinguishing between peaceful dissent protected under freedom of expression and assembly , and violent protest .
Violent protest is not protected speech under human rights law , and the Chinese government has a duty to maintain public order and prevent harm to individuals .
This duty , however , has to be carried out with due respect for fundamental human rights , including the principle of using the minimum force necessary in countering violent protests .
Human Rights
Watch urged the Chinese government to respect the right to freedom of expression and information , and to facilitate access for media and human rights monitors who seek to enter areas where there are reasonable grounds to believe that violations of human rights or humanitarian law are being , or have been , committed .
Provisions of China ’s criminal code that criminalize peaceful dissent and expression , such as “ inciting separatism , ” contravene international human rights law .
“ The Chinese government ’s concept of what constitutes a national security threat needs to be drastically narrowed and brought in line with international standards , ” said Richardson .
“ Ideologically driven ‘ anti- separatism campaigns ’ lead to serious violations of human rights and further polarize ethnic communities . ”

Masked thieves broke into The Gun Exchange in the 2900 block of Almaden Expressway early Thursday morning and made off with more than 100 guns , including two rifles , San Jose police said .
The break - in occurred at about 4:40 a.m .
Police said the door had been pried open with some type of tool , which set off the alarm .
Officer Jermaine Thomas said it appears that at least three men were involved .
After reviewing video surveillance , investigators say the men appear to be between 5 feet 9 inches and 6 feet tall .
They drove off in a car , but police could not determine what kind it was .
Except for the two rifles , all of the stolen weapons were handguns , police said .
No ammunition was stolen .
The shop , a fixture in San Jose for at least two decades , is home to rows and rows of neatly stacked rifles and stuffed deer heads .
It ’s a popular place for members of the military , law enforcement officers and hunters , who are offered special discounts .
This shop is no stranger to burglaries .
It ’s been hit several times over the years , though on a much smaller scale .
In 2006 , someone walked in and took a gun off a counter during lunchtime .
The gun was later found at a church and a suspect was arrested .
In 1991 , a suspect drove a stolen four - wheel - drive truck into The Gun Exchange , scooped up a dozen handguns and then escaped into another vehicle .
Owner Mike Fournier told the Mercury News at the time that the truck left a 12 - foot - wide hole in the front of the store .
Mercury News Staff Writer Scott Duke Harris contributed to this report .

In this letter , Rolland describes what he calls the " Oceanic " feeling - that is , a feeling of eternity , a deep and innate connection with all things , a " oneness " with the world .
Rolland , a " man of faith , " sees this " Oceanic " feeling as being the primal source of all religion , but itself independent of any particular religion .
Freud , an atheist and avowed " man of science " disagrees .
While he admits that many people may experience this " Oceanic " feeling , he locates its source not in some mystical feeling of connection , but in an infantile helplessness experienced when confronted with a hostile world and the subsequent longing for the protection and guidance of the father .
For Freud , this " Oceanic " feeling is " sustained by fear of the superior power of Fate . "

called Molasar .
Molasar is trapped in a castle keep in the Transylvanian alps - but it is oddly built " backwards " , as if , not to keep invaders out .
Molasar turns out to be a powerful ancient sorcerer from the " First Age " of humans and has been trapped there for centuries .
Molasar is awakened , or loosened , by Nazi soldiers looting some magical silver cross - like seals that are embedded in the stone walls , which keep him trapped inside .
But he can't completely escape yet without some help , and can only run around the keep as a black smoky mist (! ) killing Nazi soldiers .
The SS comes in to investigate , finds some ancient language written in blood on a wall , and calls in a linguistics professor " Cuza " to help figure it out .
Molasar manipulates Professor Cuza - by restoring his crippled legs - into being his agent to facilitate his escape .
Molasar has an adversary from ancient times , Glaeken , whose job is to keep Molasar in this eternal ( ? ) prison .

There is a reward of mortality involved , which may or may not end up being in Lost .
Incidentally , " The Keep " is the first novel in a series , and in book 4 , " Reborn " , Molasar returns with the use of a loophole , reincarnating himself by entering the body of a clone fetus in a US super - soldier fetal experimental program .

Then in book 6 , " Nightworld " , the results of him escaping are the release of all sort of flesh - eating demon - like monsters on the Earth , and ever - lengthening nighttime .

Glaeken has to recruit a candidate / hero / champion for battle against Molasar .

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

( 212 ) 549-2666 or media@aclu.org
WASHINGTON – The National Security Agency ( NSA ) has been intercepting Americans ’ emails and phone calls in recent months to an extent that exceeded even the overbroad limits permitted under the controversial spying legislation passed last summer .
According to the New York Times , the NSA ’s “ overcollection ” of American ’ communications has been “ significant and systemic . ”
The FISA Amendments Act of 2008 ( FAA ) was passed last July despite opposition from the American Civil Liberties Union and other privacy advocates .
It effectively legalized the secret warrantless surveillance program President Bush approved in late 2001 , but it also gave the government new spying powers , including the power to conduct dragnet surveillance of Americans ' international communications .
The ACLU filed a federal lawsuit immediately after Congress passed the law challenging its constitutionality .
The lawsuit is still pending .
“ Congress was repeatedly warned that this type of abuse would be the obvious outcome of passing the FISA Amendments Act , ” said Caroline Fredrickson , Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office .
“ Congressional leadership promised after this law ’s passage that it would be reexamined along with the Patriot Act .
It ’s time to fulfill that promise and restore the checks and balances of our surveillance system .
Warrantless surveillance has no place in an America we can be proud of .
These revelations make it clear that Congress must now make a commitment to rein in government surveillance . ”
The ACLU is urging Congress to form a select committee to investigate whether laws were broken in the Bush administration ’s efforts to fight terrorism .
A select committee with subpoena power would be able to review past and present national security laws and activities , restore the rule of law and help adopt fair standards for the future .
Ideally , reform legislation adopted as a consequence of the Select Committee investigation - not unlike the reforms that resulted from the Church Committee - would help ensure that future administrations follow the law and respect individual rights , regardless of the party in power .
“ These revelations are as alarming as they are predictable , ” said Jameel Jaffer , Director of the ACLU National Security Project .
“ The FAA set virtually no limits on the government ’s eavesdropping authority , but it appears that the NSA has disregarded even what minimal limits existed .
The new law should have ensured that the government ’s surveillance powers would be subject to meaningful judicial oversight .
Instead the new law allowed the NSA to operate without the safeguards that the Constitution requires .
The Bush administration argued that the law was necessary to protect national security , but in fact the law implicates all kinds of communications that have nothing to do with terrorism or criminal activity of any kind .
The law was ill - advised , and today ’s report only underscores that the law should be struck down as unconstitutional . ”
The ACLU ’s lawsuit argues that the FAA violates Americans ' rights to free speech and privacy under the First and Fourth Amendments to the Constitution .
The law permits the government to conduct intrusive surveillance without ever telling a court who it intends to spy on , what phone lines and email addresses it intends to monitor , where its surveillance targets are located , why it 's conducting the surveillance or whether it suspects any party to the communication of wrongdoing .
Plaintiffs in the ACLU ’s case include journalists , attorneys and human rights organizations who count on confidentiality to perform their jobs .
They include :
The Nation and its contributing journalists Naomi Klein and Chris Hedges Amnesty International USA , Global Rights , Global Fund for Women , Human Rights Watch , PEN American Center , Service Employees International Union , Washington Office on Latin America , and the International Criminal Defence Attorneys Association Defense attorneys Dan Arshack , David Nevin , Scott McKay and Sylvia Royce

Litzman is one of eight ultra-Orthodox members of the government team
Israeli Health Minister Yakov Litzman has been updating a nervous public on the swine flu epidemic - and he started by renaming it for religious reasons .
" We will call it Mexican flu .
We wo n't call it swine flu , " said Mr Litzman , who belongs to the ultra-religious United Torah Judaism party .
Pigs are considered unclean under Jewish dietary laws .
Muslims also do not eat pork for similar reasons .
Israel has yet to confirm a case of the flu which has claimed 100 lives .
Mr Litzman said there was no indication the virus had reached Israel , but precautionary measures and monitoring were required because of the heavy air traffic between Israel and the US , which has a number of confirmed cases .
Religiously sensitive
Yakov Litzman serves as deputy health minister in the recently - formed government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who took the position of health minister himself .
Mr Litzman is one of eight ultra-Orthodox Jewish ministers and deputy ministers in Mr Netanyahu 's administration .
Correspondents in Israel say scientists are concerned the new religiously sensitive name could could be seen as stigmatising Mexico .
The North American country has had the most cases of swine flu , but it is not necessarily where the disease first emerged .
Swine flu is a respiratory disease caused by a type of influenza which usually infects pigs .
Until now it has not normally infected humans , but the latest form clearly does , and can be spread from person to person - probably through coughing and sneezing .
There is no evidence that it can be transmitted through eating meat from infected pigs .
The world is rife with ‘ stuff ’ , and the simple fact is we ’re producing new homes , vehicles , gadgets , gizmos and other designs faster than we can get rid of the old ones .
Tires , airplanes , bicycles and cell phones do n’t just magically disappear once they outlive their usefulness .
Sometimes they ’re gathered together and turn into recycled urban trash art , photographed as trash or stripped down and recycled , and sometimes they ’re just left to sit and rot for decades on end .
Much like abandoned buildings and cities , these places can haunt the collective memory .
Here ’s a look at the afterlife of everyday objects , piled into staggering mounds that resemble nothing more than cemeteries for stuff .
[ Also See : 24 Ghost Cities & Abandoned Towns | Image Gallery ]
Abandoned Airplanes
When U.S. military airplanes need to be repaired or are just too old to fly , many of them end up in the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center , or AMARC , in Tucson , Arizona .
Some of these planes are restored to operational status while others are broken down for parts .
Seen from above , the planes make beautiful patterns in blue and white against the earthy brown backdrop .
Sea -Unworthy Ships
The ‘ Ship Cemetery ’ of Nouadhibou Bay in Mauritania contains more than 300 wrecked ships that languish , rusting and falling apart , throughout the harbor .
Mauritanian harbor officers reportedly took money in exchange for allowing ship owners to abandon their property .
Nouadhibou is one of the world ’s poorest cities , and people actually live in many of the ships that line the beaches .
Toasted Tires
Tires are one of the most ubiquitous waste materials on earth .
In the USA alone , about 300 million tires are scrapped or dumped every year .
They tend to be dumped in mountainous piles that collect water and serve as mosquito breeding grounds .
Some of them are recycled – through a burning process that creates huge amounts of toxic air pollution , oil and heavy metals – and others just waste away in landfills .
Crashed Cell Phones
Electronic waste , or e-waste , is the fastest growing part of our municipal waste stream .
We have a rather un -earth - friendly habit of replacing electronics like cell phones , computers and televisions before we really need to , sending millions of these chemical - laden items to landfills and so - called ‘ recycling centers ’ where they really end up getting dumped in countries like China .
Cell phones have a rather abysmal recycling rate , with only about 1 % ending up at recycling facilities like this one where they are processed to recover metals that are then used to make more electronics .
Of the remaining 99 % of discarded cell phones , some are reused or refurbished , but most end up in landfills .
Kaput Computers
The average life span for computers in developed countries is just two years , and for peripherals like keyboards and mice , it ’s even shorter .
Computer e-waste is a huge problem , and many old computer parts sit gathering dust in storage facilities for years or are exported to Africa and Asia where they leak chemicals that contaminate the water and soil .
There are a few sophisticated computer recycling operations , like the one run by HP , that melt these items down in a smelter or recover parts for use in new products .
Worn - Out Wires
Wires are among the e-waste that has turned dumping grounds like Guiyu , China into carcinogen - packed death pits .
Phone cords , speaker wire and network cables are just a few of the items that sit in massive tangled piles .
Children , attracted to the bright colors , are often found playing with them .
Outdated Televisions & Monitors
Consumers are being warned to beware free electronic waste collection events that call themselves “ environmentally responsible ” .
While you might think your old TV is going to be disassembled and recycled into new electronics , more often than not , the electronics gathered at these events are simply exported and dumped .
It ’s especially important to ensure that televisions do n’t end up in landfills or dumping grounds , because they contain lead and mercury .
A list of responsible television and computer monitor recyclers can be found at www.e-Stewards.org.
Busted Bicycles
When people get tired of their old bicycles , they often ca n’t be bothered with finding a responsible way to dispose of them .
So , they end up abandoned in big bicycle graveyards like these ones in Albuquerque , New Mexico and Inokashira Park in Tokyo , Japan .
Sell it , donate it or find some creative new use for its parts instead .
Rusted Tanks
On the outskirts of Kabul , Afghanistan there ’s a massive collection of abandoned Soviet battle vehicles left behind after the failure of a massive eastern bloc military occupation of the country in the 1970 ’s and 1980’s .
The Soviets left in a hurry and could n’t be bothered to find a way to get broken - down tanks back home , so now they sit , partially stripped and covered in graffiti .
Afghanistan has few recycling facilities , so this cemetery of tanks will likely remain where it is for many more years as a reminder of the Russian invasion .
Radioactive Vehicles
So , what did they do with all the helicopters , tanks , cars , trucks and construction equipment that was contaminated after being used in the cleanup of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster ?
Nothing , as it turns out .
They ’re all sitting in a field surrounded by razor wire about 15 miles from the accident site .
They were only meant to sit for a few months until they were safe to use again , but the wind blew more contamination onto them .
Now , you ’re supposed to wear a decontamination suit to even get near them .

Saving Money for College Using 529 College Savings Plan
If you are like most parents , providing best opportunities for your children is undoubtedly foremost on your mind .
Your saving for children plan should include saving for college .
There are many options available today in the United States .
In this article , we will take a look at 529 college savings plan .
As we will find , a 529 college plan not only offers a great way to save college funds for your child ’s education , but it also makes for a great estate planning vehicle .
If you are expecting birth of a new child , first of all , Congratulations !
You are in for a possibly large increase in your monthly expenses .
You can get a jump start on college savings by cutting new child expenses to free up monies to save .
Tuition costs continue to rise
College education is expensive and becoming more so .
Average college tuition in United States has been rising by an average of 6 % per year , whereas the long term inflation rate averages around 3 % .
Tuition at some of the best private colleges are rising even faster .
If your child has 16 more years before she enters college ( which means you have started planning reasonably early compared to the average population ) , at a 6 % rate of tuition inflation , the 4 year college program that costs $ 30,000 per year today will cost $ 333,393 over the four year program .
This , along with the fact that an average American family has a little more than 2 kids on average , and it is not difficult to see a good college education quickly becoming unaffordable for many families .
Partly in response to the rising tuition cost , many non traditional schools such as south university are coming up as an option offering flexible schedules and allowing students to work full time to afford the cost .
But these should be a fallback option at best .
Many college savings options available today suffer from one or more drawbacks .
If you plan to save for college in a taxable account , than income taxes on dividends and capital gains will reduce your ultimate return on investment .
If you decide to move your taxable savings to your kids names to reduce taxes , than you will need to worry about lack of control over how these savings are managed at some point in the future and may cause a few other Estate Planning headaches .
Other tax advantaged savings options for Education may limit your contributions resulting in under savings .
You will also need to worry about how these savings will impact your children ’s eligibility for financial aid if you would like to consider that as an option .
A section 529 College Plan overcomes many of these constraints and can provide best of all the worlds .
How does a 529 Plan work ?
Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code created these types of savings plan in 1996 .
Currently all states offer some form of 529 college plan .
These plans work similar to a 401 K plan in that every plan has a range of investment options that one can choose to invest in .
In most plans , these options are in form of a mutual fund or a vehicle similar to a mutual fund .
At this time it is important to make a distinction between a 529 College Plan and a 529 Prepaid Plan .
A 529 Prepaid Plan can be offered by a state or an educational institution and limits the benefits to a selected group of colleges and universities .
Essentially , in these plans , you are prepaying the future tuition in current dollars .
529 Prepaid Plans therefore are not as flexible .
They offer lot of choices
You are not forced to invest in your own state ’s 529 College Plan .
You can pick and choose any other state ’s 529 plan based on your investment criteria , fees , options , etc .
Additionally , a large number of colleges and universities across the US and even some internationally are eligible institutions where 529 plan benefits can be applied .
529 College Plan generally do not have restrictions forcing the beneficiary to use an in - state institution .
Tax Benefits
Gains on investments in a 529 College Plan are sheltered from all taxation as long as the proceeds are used for tuition and other allowed educational expenses at an eligible institution .
Additionally , some states encourage their own residents to participate in the state offered 529 College Plan by offering tax incentives like tax deductions on part of the contributions to the plan .
529 Plan offers high contribution limits
Most 529 College Plan do not have a contribution limit per se , although they limit further contributions when the assets reach a certain size ( typically in the neighborhood of $ 200 K per account , limits vary by plan ) .
It therefore makes sense to contribute to these plans more aggressively in the initial years and reach the asset size limit as quickly as possible .
This will allow the account to grow with a higher base for a longer time .
This becomes very important when you realize that as the time to college comes near , you are very likely to change your asset allocation in the plan towards more conservative investments and therefore maximum asset growth is likely to occur in the initial few years of the account .
There are however certain other limits to contributions that you need to be aware of .
Contributions to a 529 College Plan are treated as a gift from you to your child ( the beneficiary on the account ) .
Therefore they may come under the purview of Gift Taxes .
To avoid paying gift tax on the contributions , you should plan to keep the annual contribution per beneficiary to be below the gift tax exemption amount , which is currently at $ 13,000 for 2009 .
You and your spouse can there fore contribute upto 2x $ 13,000 or $ 26,000 annually to each child ’s 529 College Savings Account without having to worry about gift tax .
529 Plan assets have small impact on Financial Aid eligibility
A 529 College Plan held by a parent for the benefit of the child is considered a parental asset and will be assessed at a maximum rate of 5.64 % in determining a student ’s expected family contribution .
Additionally , any tax free distribution of the plan to pay for education costs for the beneficiary in the current tuition year will not reduce next year ’s financial aid eligibility as it is not considered as part of the base - year income .
There are no income limits
Unlike Education IRAs where your eligibility to contribute gets phased out based on your income , 529 College Plans do not have any such income limits .
Therefore , these plans are available to everyone .
A 529 College Plan should be a critical component of your estate plan
One of the great attractions of 529 College Plans is its use in Estate Planning .
Contributions to the plan are considered as gifts and therefore are no longer part of your estate .
You also have the option of accelerating the transfer of assets out of your estate by contributing next 5 years worth of contributions in a single year .
Which means , you can potentially transfer $ 13,000 x 5 = $ 65,000 out of your estate to your child ’s 529 College Plan this year if you so choose without having to worry about gift taxes .
Your spouse can do the same as well for a total of $ 130,000 per child .
However , if you choose to utilize the 5 year prepayment option to the plan , you will not be able to make any additional contributions to the plan for the next 5 years .
But still , the ability to transfer significant amount of assets out of your estate is a very attractive feature .
You still retain control
If you are the owner of the account for the benefit of your child , even though the account assets are no longer part of your assets , you retain the full control of the assets .
Your child never gets control of the assets at any age .
You also have the flexibility to change the beneficiary of the account if you so choose , even to yourself or your grand children .
This flexibility is useful in case your child does not end up using all the assets for his / her education , or even decides to drop out of college .
The only caveat is that the distributions are only tax free if used for eligible education expenses .
For more information on 529 plans and to evaluate different plans and choose the one you want to participate in , please visit the excellent Saving for College website .
This website features many different types of calculators as well as community message boards and is a very useful resource for anyone trying to choose a 529 College Plan for their child .
Are you contributing to a 529 plan or trying to decide on one ?
Which state plan did you choose and why ?

There Was a Class War .
The Rich Won .
What happens if there ’s a class war and only one side bothers to show up and fight it ?
That ’s what happened over the last thirty years .
There was a class war , and the rich won .
Period .
It ’s over , they kicked our knees out from under us , put on their steel - toed boots and spent the last thirty years telling us that they were going to trickle on us and we ’re going to like it and beg for more .
Seems like hyperbole ?
It ’s just the numbers .
The top left shows the manufacturing wage earner ’s hourly wages .
Not “ family income ” which includes both of you going to work , but hourly wages .
The only reason it ’s goods producing is they go back longer , but other charts show the same pattern .
So , if you ’re an ordinary slob , you have n’t had a raise in over 30 years .
In fact , your real wage peaked over 30 years ago and it ’s never recovered .
This would be ok if the US had n’t been getting richer , getting more productive , ever since then , but I ’m sure you wo n’t be surprised to hear that productivity has kept going up .
Yet somehow wages did n’t .
Damon Silvers , whom we can thank for the wages and productivity chart , thinks it has a lot to do with a hostile anti-union environment and with the simultaneous decline of progressive taxation .
I ’d say he ’s got a big part of the picture though not all of it .
The key part that he has right is simply that deliberate government policy meant an end to wage increases .
Those deliberate government policies benefited the rich greatly , and the people in Washington and New York who made most of the decisions were very close to the people who benefited the most .
The main problem was that real consumption of stuff that requires energy , specifically oil , could not be allowed to increase faster than the combination of oil supply increases and efficiency increases .
( We now produce twice the real GDP / barrel of oil we did in the 70s . )
If consumption did overtake supply , not only would you get real widespread inflation , but you ’d risk losing control over the price of oil .
We saw in 2008 what happens when you lose control over the price of oil .
The second big problem was that the oilarchies who were getting a lot of money with the new , higher price of oil , were not consumer societies and the money they were gaining was not being spread around .
Rather it was pooling in the hands of a few nobles , chiefs and robbers , and those folks needed something to spend that money on .
Despite what you might expect , trashing hotel rooms , doing blow and buying hookers can only use up a small amount of money , at least when you ’re really really stinking rich .
In short , rich oilarchs were sitting on a pile of money and they wanted to buy things with it .
Western things .
Western …companies .
There were two obvious ways for the West to deal with that .
You could put on some form of ownership controls , whether formal or informal , or you could make your rich rich enough to compete with the oilarch rich by inflating the value of the paper assets that they were competing over .
Europe mostly chose to just say : “ No , you ca n ’t buy that . ”
American elites were smarter though ; they realized that this was a chance to become stinking rich .
If our rich people were rich enough , they could bid up the price of companies and assets so the oilarchs could n’t snap them up .
So they made themselves rich .
They reduced taxation on themselves in a number of ways , they broke union power , they got rid of old New Deal laws that had stopped speculation from getting too bubblicious and they went on a bubble spree — shoving money into various different asset classes , driving them into the stratosphere , taking the profits and then letting the taxpayer eat the loss .
They took as much public infrastructure private as they could and they did so for cents on the dollar .
They imported manufactured goods from the East to keep goods inflation down and they exported jobs to low - cost domiciles to keep wage push inflation down .
They also ran , in most periods , very tight dollar policies , so that there were fewer dollars around than the rest of the world needed .
Needing dollars badly , people had to sell to the US cheap .
And since everyone from outside the US wanted in on whatever the bubble of the day was , they kept giving the US real stuff ( oil , goods ) for pieces of paper .
Those pieces of paper represented something real , at the end of the day : they represented the future .
But the future always seems a long way off until suddenly it ’s today .
It was a death bet .
And back in the late 70’s and late 80 ’s it was a good bet .
Heck , it was even a good bet for many over the last ten years .
If you expect to be dead before the bill arrives , who cares how big the bill is ?
Tim Russert just won that bet .
Reagan won that bet .
Jesse Helms won that bet .
It was a good bet for a lot of powerful men ( and a few powerful women ) in their late forties or older .
But some people lose death bets , and most people reading this today will lose this bet .
You had your chance to die , now you ’re going to get to live and pay .
I suppose it ’s better than the alternative , but I do n’t imagine you ’re going to enjoy it much .
So look at the last chart and remember : there was a class war .
Most Americans never even showed up for it .
And the rich won .
Now they ’re going to try and keep and expand their gains .
As Naomi Klein has pointed out at great length , when things go wrong , it ’s very easy to sell people snake oil , to take advantage of their fear and their despair .
Roosevelt told the American people not to fear .
That there was nothing to fear but fear .
Elsewhere other leaders whipped their people into fear , and after fear , into fear - driven aggression and hatred .
Even in lesser crises leaders will appear who offer to solve the problem without telling you how .
In the eighties Americans turned from Jimmy Carter , with his negativity and his call to solve fundamental problems in fundamental ways to Reagan , promising “ morning in America ” .
And let ’s be honest : Reagan sort of fixed the problems .
His fix , in one form or another , lasted almost twenty years , till kid Bush broke it .
Sure it was n’t a permanent fix , and sure it was fixed on the back of the middle and working classes and the cost was not having things like healthcare , the offshoring of huge numbers of jobs and so on .
But gas prices went down .
Interest rates went down .
Inflation was tamed .
Suburbs sprouted like weeds .
Reagan delivered .
And the rich won their class war .
Reagan was working with a strong America .
A fundamentally healthy America .
He could afford to run the place down , because it was still in good repair , the baby Boomers were still young , and so on .
The cost of Reagan ’s “ fix ” has been that ordinary people have n’t had a raise for over 30 years .
The next such “ fix ” wo n’t leave wages even , it will , in real terms , halve them .

Nothing has changed , except that the next class war is on , and the rich are winning this one , too .
A team of Dutch researchers under the leadership of Vici - winner Merel Kindt has successfully reduced the fear response .
They weakened fear memories in human volunteers by administering the beta - blocker propranolol .
Interestingly , the fear response does not return over the course of time .
Top journal Nature Neuroscience published the findings on 15 February 2009 .
Until recently , it was assumed that the fear memory could not be deleted .
However , Klindt 's team has demonstrated that changes can indeed be effected in the emotional memory of human beings .
Storing changes
Before fear memories are stored in the long - term memory , there is a temporary labile phase .
During this phase , protein synthesis takes place that ' records ' the memories .
The traditional idea was that the memory is established after this phase and can , therefore , no longer be altered .
However , this protein synthesis also occurs when memories are retrieved from the memory and so there is once again a labile phase at that moment .
The researchers managed to successfully intervene in this phase .
During their experiments the researchers showed images of two different spiders to the human volunteers .
One of the spider images was accompanied by a pain stimulus and the other was not .
Eventually the human volunteers exhibited a startle response ( fear ) upon seeing the first spider without the pain stimulus being administered .
The anxiety for this spider had therefore been acquired .
One day later the fear memory was reactivated , as a result of which the protein synthesis occurred again .
Just before the reactivation , the human volunteers were administered the beta - blocker propranolol .
On the third day it was found that the volunteers who had been administered propranolol no longer exhibited a fear response on seeing the spider , unlike the control group who had been administered a placebo .
The group that had received propranolol but whose memory was not reactivated still exhibited a strong startle response .
The fear response was measured using two electrodes under the eye that measured the eye - blinking reflex .
The response measured is one directly initiated by the amygdala , the emotional centre of the brain .
Searching in deleted items
Cognitive behavioural therapy is currently the prevailing and most effective method for treating anxiety disorders .
During such a treatment the patient is exposed to the fear - eliciting stimulus without the feared consequence occurring .
This method frequently only achieves short - term results and the fears often return over the course of time .
Interestingly , after the treatment with propranolol and memory reactivation , fear memories can no longer be recalled by means of a much - used method in which the individual pain stimuli are readministered .
This indicates that the anxiety memory is either completely erased or could no longer be found in the memory .
It should be noted , however , that the human volunteers could remember the association between the spider and the pain stimulus but that this no longer elicited any emotional response .
In the next phase of the research , Kindt and her colleagues shall investigate the long - term effects of administering propranolol .
Treatment of anxiety disorders
The researchers expect that the results from this study can contribute to a new procedure for the treatment of patients with anxiety disorders .
The method intervenes in the memory in a completely different way to conventional treatments .
Whereas the traditional cognitive behavioural therapies frequently focus on the creation of new memories , this method focuses on the weakening of the existing emotional memory .
In 2007 , Merel Kindt received a Vici grant from NWO for her innovative research .
This study was carried out by Merel Kindt , Marieke Soeter and Bram Vervliet at the Universiteit van Amsterdam .

Corruption and capitalist Russia
By Vladimir Volkov
1 April 2009
The beginning of March 2009 marked one year since the election of Dmitry Medvedev as president of Russia .
Although he announced from the outset that the fight against corruption would be one of his main priorities , his first year in office has shown that these words — as in the years of presidents Yeltsin and Putin — were nothing more than propaganda .
Medvedev occupies the highest post in a state in which corruption is neither a secondary feature nor an aberration , but rather its essence .
From top to bottom , corruption in post -Soviet Russia permeates the bureaucratic apparatus , the security structures and big business .
Like a virus in the blood of a diseased organism , it is present in all commercial and government relations .
For the " system " it is everything — its foundation and true ideology , which can be summarized with the banal formulas : " Everything is for sale " and " Get rich . "
At a session of the Council to Combat Corruption that occurred in October 2008 , Medvedev was forced to admit , " Corruption in our nation has not simply become wide - scale .
It has become a common , everyday phenomenon which characterizes the very life of our society .
We are not simply talking about commonplace bribery .
We are talking about a severe illness which is corroding the economy and corrupting all society . "
Here are several examples from the Russian mass media , typical of stories that can be found on virtually any given day :
* On March 11 , Vladimir Pak , head of the Nevelsky Region in the Sakhalin area , was accused of exceeding his powers and was temporarily suspended from his post by court order .
He is charged with embezzling 56 million rubles ( $ 1.5 million ) from resources allocated for reconstruction following an earthquake that occurred in August 2007 .
Using funds budgeted for building new housing for victims of the quake , Pak signed several long - term contracts with commercial firms for information and consultative services , which , according to the investigation , was a means of illegally obtaining the funds .
* In early March in Moscow , two officers of the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs ( MVD ) were detained under suspicion of taking bribes exceeding $ 100,000 .
While investigating a case concerning the embezzlement of government resources by heads of the Spartak sports complex , the two officers promised suspects that they would not hold them criminally responsible in exchange for a payoff .
* On March 16 the trial began at the Moscow City Court of a senior official of the MVD , Lt. Colonel Dmitry Luzgin , who is charged with extorting $ 1 million from the bosses of the construction company Russian Real Estate House .
Having launched an investigation of the firm 's work , he offered not to bring criminal charges against them ( for which he claimed he had gathered sufficient material ) in exchange for the designated sum of money .
* Last summer a case proceeded behind closed doors in Moscow against four men , including a former member of the president 's administration ( a colonel by rank ) , who were charged with selling " cushy jobs " in the state apparatus .
In particular they wanted to make one of their clients the head of customs at the port city of Novorossiisk , and another the governor of one of the regions .
Seventeen of the deals were crowned with success — the interested parties obtained high posts in regional ministries and other state bodies .
What is the scale of Russian corruption ?
According to data from the head of the MVD , Rashid Nurgaliev — and one must assume that the figures are significantly understated — each year the Russian economy loses from $ 20 billion to $ 40 billion due to corruption .
According to other estimates made , for instance , in 2006 by the first deputy of the Russian general prosecutor , Alexander Buksman , the overall yearly market for corruption in Russia is on the order of $ 240 billion .
This figure is comparable to the state budget .
It can not be said that there is no fight against corruption .
There seem to be many exposés and criminal convictions .
But they do not , as a rule , touch major figures in a real way .
In these matters , much like with the mythical Hydra , when one head is cut off , two take its place .
According to Yuri Chaika , the general prosecutor of Russia , in an interview given to the Russian Gazette on February 25 , last year " after verification by the prosecutor , 3,400 criminal corruption cases were opened .
Among the accused were bureaucrats of various levels ; there were about 200 from municipal bodies .
There were also deputies of leaders on the Federation level . "
Chaika noted that " in some places the fight against corruption is only simulated , and the bureaucrats who should be prosecuted for bribery are rarely actually indicted . "
That is , one form of corruption both engenders and nourishes another .
The general prosecutor also stated that the very character of Russian law creates a mass of loopholes for the carrying out of corruption schemes .
" In one year we have uncovered more than 200,000 violations of legislation concerning the fight against corruption in the areas of state and municipal service , " he said .
" In the various localities there are more than 10,000 local regulations which open the door to possible corrupt practices .
We uncovered more than 40,000 crimes against the state , the interests of state service , and service in local administrative bodies . "
How are the authorities trying to restrict the spread of the disease of corruption ?
In an interview on Russian television 's First Channel , which was broadcast March 15 , Medvedev gave one example of a " definite step forward " during his first year as president .
He noted that " we nevertheless for the first time in the modern period of the history of our nation have created a new regulatory basis for the struggle against corruption . "
What did he have in mind ?
Merely the fact that amendments were passed requiring civil servants to declare income .
The amendments require not only the civil servants to declare income , but their closest relatives as well .
It is obvious , however , that this is nothing more than a palliative , serving a more or less decorative function .
Medvedev then added , " Now begins the most complicated part — the task of carrying out these laws . "
The post -Soviet period saw a sharp growth in the ranks of the bureaucracy , and , starting with Putin 's coming to power ten years ago , a significant increase in this bureaucracy as the most important layer within the new ruling elite .
The number of state officials in Russia is at least one - and - a - half times larger than in the entire Soviet Union on the eve of its collapse .
In 2006 alone the number of government employees increased by 7.9 percent and reached almost 1.6 million people .
The portion of the total gross domestic product spent on state officials and the security organizations has doubled over the last five years .
The authorities and the state apparatus have merged in the most intimate way with private business .
The leading officials of the government and the ministries join the advisory councils of the largest Russian companies and receive millions of dollars in legal compensation for their services .
Representatives of private business enter politics , becoming bureaucrats and deputies .
According to columnist Valery Vizhutovich , writing in the August 1 , 2008 , edition of the Russian Gazette , 26 percent of senators in the upper chamber of the Russian parliament came from business in 2002 .
Now it is 32 percent .
As for the composition of regional legislative bodies , if one considers , for example , the Lipetskaya and Astrakhanskaya oblasts ( provinces ) , one finds that businessmen make up more than half of the deputies .
In Chuvashiya their share among legislators reaches 60 percent .
" Business is very concerned with its further development , " writes Vizhutovich , " and sees no more effective means than personally entering into power . "
The so - called " state corporations , " of which since 2003 a minimum of seven have been established , are stark examples of the fusion of politics and business .
Among them are the Vneshekonombank ( Bank for Development and Foreign Economic Affairs ) , Olimpstroy ( Olympic construction ) , Rosnanotekh and Fond Sodeystviya Reformirovaniyu ZhKKh ( utilities ) , Rostekhnologii , and Rostatom .
The state hands over property and financial means to state corporations free of charge , after which it loses all rights over the transferred property .
Inasmuch as these companies were founded on the basis of special laws , the government also loses normal mechanisms for regulating their activities .
State corporations are not under the regulatory eye of the tax authorities and cannot be subjected to bankruptcy procedures .
Individuals appointed by the government head these organizations .
What is this but legalized corruption raised to the level of government policy ?
Today 's liberal opposition criticizes the authorities for their lack of control and their corruption .
However , the arguments of the leaders of this opposition — like publicist Andrei Piontkovskii , Boris Nemtsov ( former vice - premier under the late Yeltsin ) , former Duma deputy Vladimir Rizhkov , world chess champion Gary Kasparov , and Andrei Illarionov ( former economic adviser to Putin ) — are false and hypocritical .
They assert that the all - powerful bureaucracy is a particular characteristic of the post - Yeltsin period , whereas in the 1990s democracy and freedom reigned in Russia .
They declare total privatization to be the most important means for eradicating corruption .
It is important to remember that precisely this argument , according to which it was possible to conquer the old Soviet bureaucracy with radical privatization , lay at the base of all the policies of Yeltsin and his milieu when they created in Russia a new pro-capitalist regime out of the wreckage of the USSR .
Beginning in 1991 all essential socio-economic measures — the liberalization of prices in 1991 , voucher privatization , the securities auctions of the mid 1990s , etc. — were implemented without any public discussion and without approval by parliament .
The latter was bombarded by tanks in 1993 and henceforth lost even the pretense of independence .
The most important measures of the 1990s , based on the personal directives of President Yeltsin , effectively created a layer of super - rich oligarchs , in whose hands were placed , free of charge , the most profitable and strategically important sectors of the former Soviet economy .
In the beginning of the 1990s one of the " superintendents of perestroika " and former mayor of Moscow , professor Gavriil Popov , expounded the necessity of legalizing corruption , justifying this by saying that the bureaucrat had to receive " worthy " compensation .
Current liberal oppositionist Mikhail Kasyanov , former prime minister from 2000 to 2004 ( during Putin 's first presidential term ) , received the nickname in the press " Misha two percent " for his insistence on receiving a kickback for all the laws that he signed .
The post -Soviet regime was thoroughly corrupt from the very beginning .
The more it moved in the direction of capitalist reforms , the more corrupt it became .
Not long ago , Georgy Poltavchenko , a powerful representative of the president of Russia in the Central Federal district , stated that " it is necessary to oppose the transformation of power into a commodity that can be sold . "
However , it is precisely this " transformation " of power into a commodity that forms the essence of the socio-political structure of modern Russia .
The current Russian ruling elite is the inheritor of the privileged Soviet bureaucracy .
In the 1920s and 1930s the Stalinist bureaucracy usurped political power from the Soviet working class .
Ultimately it joined with Western capitalists to do away with the working class ' basic socio-economic conquests , which were the product of the October 1917 revolution .
In the process of its transformation from a parasitic caste to an owning class , it adopted the most odious and predatory methods of enrichment from the capitalist West .
Analyzing the nature of the Stalinist regime in his time , Leon Trotsky emphasized that the official privileges of the bureaucracy , having no basis in either the principles of socialism or the laws of the country , were nothing short of theft .
" Besides this legalized thievery , there is illegal elite thievery , to which Stalin is forced to close his eyes because thieves are his best support ... the Bonapartist apparatus of the state is an organ for the defense of bureaucratic thieves and plunderers of the people 's wealth . "
( " The Bonapartist Philosophy of the State , " Bulletin of the Opposition , 1939 , № 77 - 78 , p. 13 , emphasis added ) .
He noted that misappropriation and theft , the fundamental sources of the incomes of the bureaucracy , do not constitute a system of exploitation in the scientific sense of the word .
But inasmuch as they fundamentally contradict the interests and needs of the broad masses , they necessitate a regime of uncontrolled tyranny .
" In order to safeguard the systematic pilfering of the bureaucracy , its apparatus is forced to turn to systematic acts of robbery .
All this together creates a system of Bonapartist gangsterism . "
( " The Bonapartist Philosophy of the State , " Bulletin of the Opposition , 1939 , № 77- 78 , p. 13 ) .
Continuing this analysis in the post - Soviet period , the historian Vadim Rogovin noted in his seven - volume study Was There an Alternative ?
that " corruption and the mass misappropriation of social property was transformed into an essential factor in the rot of the post - Stalinist regime . "
( Mirovaya revoliutsiya i mirovaya voyna , Мoskva. , 1998 , p. 28 ) .
Rogovin insisted that the restoration of capitalism in the republics , which was founded on the ruins of the USSR , confirmed Trotsky 's prognosis that " the contradiction between forms of property and norms of distribution cannot grow without end .
Either bourgeois norms will prevail in one or another form , expanding to the means of production as well , or the opposite [ will happen ] — norms of distribution will have to come into correspondence with socialist property . "
( Trotsky , L.D. Predannaya revoliutsiya , Мoskva. , 1991 , p. 202-203 ) .
Rogovin wrote : " In practice , the first variant of this prognosis was realized from the end of the 1980s to the beginning of the 1990s .
Corrupt and shadow elements of the ‘ old ' social structure became that layer from which was recruited the class of the new bourgeoisie .
A growth in the income of this class is happening simultaneously with new blows against the social interests and living standards of the vast mass of the population . "
( V. Rogovin , Mirovaya revoliutsiya i mirovaya voyna , Мoskva , 1998 , p. 28 ) .
Corruption in modern Russian is not an administrative , or even a criminal problem , it is a political one .

You really have to wonder what is going on over at Republican headquarters as today , the GOP released their alternative to President Obama ’s budget , which contained lots of charts and graphs , but no actual numbers or budget , so the Republicans managed to put out the world ’s first postmodern budget .
It is a budget that transcends the need for numbers .
Here is the video of House Republican leaders unveiling their plan :
The budget document contains such brilliant observations as , The President calls for “ A New Era of Responsibility , ” as the title of his budget states .
But a closer look at the Democrat budget reveals something far different — it spends too much , taxes too much , and borrows too much , and Instead of returning to double digit levels of inflation and the failed economic policies of the 1970s , Republicans support maintaining the cost of living after witnessing the booms and busts triggered by loose monetary policy . ”
Advertisements
Of course no GOP document would be complete without talking about tax cuts , ” Instead of raising taxes on all Americans in the midst of a recession , Republicans seek to reduce the tax burden on working families and small businesses in order to create jobs and unlock private capital . ”
I would love to know who the genius was that thought putting out a budget without numbers was a great idea .
This document is n’t a budget .
It is a statement of the same Republican principles that were in place during the Bush administration .
Instead of defending their charts and graphs , Republicans should be embarrassed to put their names on this thing .
If they wanted to release a budget , then it might have been a better idea to wait until the numbers were ready .
As Obama Press Secretary Robert Gibbs put it , “ I think the ‘ Party of No ’ has become the party of no new ideas .
We just hope that next time it will contain actual numbers so somebody can evaluate what it means .
” I do n’t know if House Republicans were going for some sort of post - modern budget here , but all that they have managed to do is turn themselves into a bigger joke .
The millennium bug may have been a dud , but the daylight savings glitch has struck - yet again .
Telstra denies it was responsible for an electronic hiccup that caused havoc yesterday across the country when mobile phones , BlackBerries and other personal digital assistants changed their internal clocks a week early , leaving countless people an hour late .
Have you been affected by the glitch ?

Simple <> stupid

After the chuckles die down , I want to note that the permise behind Simple English Wikipedia -- and indeed , behind efforts at large to create any sort of " basic language " text -- is not to produce dumbed - down text , but to produce easier - to - understand text .
It 's perhaps arguable that something like
In a case like what xkcd references , complex subjects can still be described with " simple " English if you also introduce a limited , precise , and consistent subject - specific vocabulary .
Even for , you know , particle physics . :-)
Anyway , what 's wanted here is a dive into the research about using simplified English , etc .
Which I am not in a position to do at the moment .
But
When in doubt , simplify : Worried you 're not using the right words ?
Use simpler words .
Worried that your sentence is n't clear ?
Make a simpler sentence .
Worried that people wo n't see your point ?
Make your point simpler .
Nearly every writing problem you have can be solved by making things simpler .
This should be obvious , but people do n't like hearing it because there 's the assumption that simple = stupid .
But it 's not true ; indeed , I find from personal experience that the stupidest writers are the ones whose writing is positively baroque in form .
This topic deserves some substantial attention , but I did want at least not to let this pass unnoted .
The brilliant xkcd takes a poke at something called Simple English Wikipedia

It 's perhaps arguable that something like Basic English cannot be used to express everything , but it 's certainly clear that it can be substituted for more complex ( and especially , for more idiomatic ) English a great deal of the time .

But here 's a thought ( noted here before ) from John Scalzi : [ categories ] writing | link
Almost everyone outside the " political and media elite " knows this .
Amidst " deflation is upon us " warnings from this elite , UK CPI inflation went up last month – to 3.2 pc. CPI understates true inflation .
But even CPI is above the Bank of England 's target – and has been for 17 months .
Rick Astley , famed for his hit single ' Never Gonna Give You Up ' , is about to go on tour after quitting the music industry over 20 years ago .
He has been talking to E24's Tasmin Lucia Khan about headlining the Here and Now tour and the ' Rick Rolling ' phenomenon .
The scorching weather has played havoc with the Australian Open , which is in its final stages at the Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne .
Serena Williams 's women 's singles quarter - final with Svetlana Kuznetsova was halted for 45 minutes as organisers enacted their " extreme heat policy " and closed the arena 's roof .
Doubles matches on the smallest of the main stadiums were also moved to a covered court .
Oregon Proposes a 1900 % Beer Tax Increase
Now that the smoking nazis have had their way with the smokers they are moving on to the next sin that needs to be taxed into oblivion , alcohol .
In reality these people do not want to tax anything into oblivion , there would be no taxes to be paid if that were the end result .
They just want to keep raising the taxes as high as they feel people can be pushed into paying .
Oregon is now proposing a 1900 % , that is not a typo , 1900 % tax increase on beer .
Four Portland legislators joined a Springfield senator to introduce Oregon House Bill 2461 , which would impose a $ 49.61 tax on each barrel of beer produced by Oregon brewers
Naturally , as is the same with cigarettes , they are arguing that it is for the consumers own good .
Because alcohol can be addicting they claim that the money will be used to combat alcoholism , but that is just the excuse .
This is the same argument used for raising the taxes on cigarettes .
The truth is that if the government really gave a damn about ending a person ’s nicotine or alcohol addiction they would n’t raise taxes on these products ; they would outlaw them .
The truth is also that the government knows that it can get away with taxing these products because these people are addicts .
they are taking advantage of a person ’s addiction to raise more revenue for the state .
How sick and perverted is that ?
It is criminal .

Persistent Sexual Arousal Disorder is a rare condition that keeps those inflicted with the disorder in a constant state of arousal .
According to some of these women , these urges come every couple seconds and last for hours on end .
— Making simple lifestyle and diet changes can save your life
Although medical science is developing rapidly and bio-scientists are diagnosing almost every foreign disease and getting them cured , cancer is still incurable .
It is fatal , but what we can do is just avoid this ailment by making few changes in our lifestyle .
Checkout , which are the best ways to reduce substantial risks of cancer :
1. Avoid smoking
smoking is one of the most perilous habits , which can lead you to different sorts of cancer including lung cancer , throat cancer and many other more .
If you are serious about your health and diminishing cancer risks , stop smoking as soon as possible .
It is even said that smoking one cigarette can decrease your lifetime by one minute .
So imagine how many minutes have already been cut down from your life after you have smoked several packs a week .
So the next time you see someone smoking just tell that person , “ Hey , stop using cancer sticks ! ”
2. Moderate Sunbathing
Nevertheless , vitamin D is important to reduce cancerous risks and sunlight lets us enjoy a good dose of this vitamin .
However , too much of sun exposure is also hazardous , as it leads to severe skin burns that can cause cancer .
Because tanning has become one of the favorite pastimes of socialized individuals , the occurrence of skin cancer has become more and more predominant nowadays .
When exposing yourself outdoors during broad daylight , it is best that you use lotions with the recommended degree of SPF or sun protection factor so as to prevent harmful rays from penetrating deep into your skin .

Although it is well established by theory that alcohol can be necessary to carry out some of the body ’s daily processes , still only a small amount of it is recommended .
Do n’t binge , just drink moderately .
4. Distances from Microwave
Home appliances have brought too much comfort for us but these are perilous as well .
Standing in front of microwave once in a while is not too dangerous , but your addiction to this can damage your DNA and increase cancer risks .

Laziness can bring hazards of colon cancer and breast cancer .

Does your work job deal with chemicals , field works or woodcrafts ?
If yes then you must take proper precautions by wearing proactive masks and gloves .
If your workplace is enclosed , you can checkout for proper ventilation .
People who work as a laundry person , painter and carpenter should take advanced measures to diminish the risk , as their jobs are considered at greater risk for cancer .

Purchasing your groceries through Sainsburys Coupons not only safeguards your health but also saves on your monthly grocery bill .
But one must avoid eating artificial food colors as they work otherwise .
11 . Stop eating overcooked meats and high - temperature cooked meats
Charred meats are cancer backers .

12 . Pesticide residues should be avoided
Washing , peeling and removing the outermost parts of leafy vegetables reduces exposure to pesticides .
It is always better to buy organic foods , as these are produced without using pesticides .
Corn and strawberries , which are organically grown , contains significantly higher levels of antioxidants ; these antioxidants are supposed to be more active cancer fighters than antioxidants that are available in conventionally grown foods [ cancer fighting foods ] .
This fact is supported by a study published in the ‘ Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry .
’Use of antioxidant supplements can also augment the daily intake .
Holland & Barrett promotions provide discount vouchers for purchase of vitamin supplements .

Your doctors and dentists ask for x-rays on every check - up , next time you inform them that you do not want to go for x-rays unless they are a must .
Instead of going for unnecessary x-rays , you can show the copy of your most recent x-ray report to your medical advisors .
15 . Eat fish but choose wisely
Fish consumption is good for your health ; due to the adequate presence of omega - 3 fatty acids , they are supposed to be the best diet for a healthy heart , perfect eye - sight and shiny hairs .
They also work nicely in decreasing hazards of cancer but the most important thing to do is making a wise selection of eatable fish .
Before buying fish you should make sure that the fish you are going to buy is not a polluted water fish .
Polluted water fishes generally accumulate dangerous chemicals inside them .
Doctors also suggest for a limited intake of fatty fish such as carp , catfish , bash , shark , etc .
16 . Lesser intake of salt
To follow a healthy diet plan , you should not ingest more than 6 grams of salt .
Numerous medical studies clarify that an increased intake of salt doubles the risk of stomach cancer .
17 . Say ‘ No ’ to junk food
Nevertheless , junk foods are tastier and easily available but nowadays it has become the biggest supporter of cancer .
Stuffed with loads of fat , these eatables increase the level of cholesterol in your body and invite obesity , which is believed to be the mother of cancer .
By following all of these guidelines , you are doing yourself a favor to lessen your risk and exposure from harmful elements that can lead to cancer .
This disease is life threatening , but you can employ lots of measures to prevent it from even happening .
A stairlift might help you stay independent after you went through cancer .

Aged four months , Kirsty Collier lay dying on the operating table with a serious heart defect .
Her surgeon had tried his best to correct the problem but thought the organ was so badly damaged that there was no hope .
As a last - ditch attempt to save Kirsty 's life , he decided to cut away a third of her heart , enlarged because of her condition , in case that restarted it .
And against all the odds , it once again began to beat .
For Professor Stephen Westaby , that , in itself , was a miracle .
But ten years on , Kirsty 's heart has proved even more of a surprise .
For it has healed itself in a way experts never thought possible , and is now the normal size and shape for a girl of her age – without a single telltale scar from the original surgery .
Kirsty was born with a rare heart condition , which is frequently fatal within the first three months of life .
The defect meant that her left coronary artery , which carries blood to the heart muscle , was connected to the pulmonary artery instead of the aorta .
As a result , the organ was starved of oxygen and became enlarged .
Kirsty had numerous heart attacks as a baby and her prospects seemed bleak .
As her condition became critical , Professor Westaby was called upon to carry out corrective surgery at the John Radcliffe Hospital , Oxford .
But Kirsty was linked up to a heart lung bypass machine for the surgery – and when the surgical team attempted to get the heart to take over once again , they found it was so badly damaged that it was unable to pump blood again .
' We felt there was no hope at all , ' Professor Westaby told Sky News .
A message was even sent to Kirsty 's parents to warn them ' it was not going well ' .
' She was essentially dead and was only resurrected by what I regarded at the time as a completely bizarre operation , ' added Professor Westaby .
However , the surgeon had a hunch that reducing the size of Kirsty 's heart would ease the pressure on the muscle , allowing it to contract properly .
And using scissors , he removed a large section of the muscle wall , stitched it back together , and hoped for the best .
' I have to confess I never thought it would work .
It was an awful lot smaller . '
But the baby 's heart began beating again .
Today , Kirsty , of Cirencester , Gloucestershire , is a sporty tenyear - old who plays rugby at school .
' Her recovery is miraculous , ' said Professor Westaby .
Her mother , Becky , 38 , said : ' She 's such a sporty girl .
It 's hard to imagine she was ill sometimes . '
Recalling her first sight of Kirsty after the operation , she added : ' There she was , my tiny baby , with tubes everywhere .
They said she 'd take a step forward and a step back .
But I could tell by looking at her that she would keep going .
It 's amazing what she has overcome .
' She 's such a brave little girl but and has never let her condition affect her life at all .
I think that has been behind her recovery – she does n't think about it . '
Kirsty 's father Wayne , a computer - software salesman , said : ' It was a dark day when she went in the operating theatre .
It 's unbelievable .
She has a normal life like any other girl . '
Professor Westaby said the results of a recent MRI scan of Kirsty 's heart were ' fascinating ' because of the extent the heart has healed itself .
' An adult heart would n't do that . '
As for Kirsty , she has refused to let her early problems shape her life .
' I do n't want to be different to anyone else just because I 've had a heart operation , ' she said .

Public Enemy – one of the most influential rap groups in music history – took an opportunity at the Coachella 2009 festival to warn their audience about “ The Obama Deception , ” in reference to Alex Jones ’ recently released underground blockbuster documentary .
The L.A. Times reports that Public Enemy member Professor Griff , who himself appears in the film , “ made repeated references to the “ Obama deception , ” during the concert in California at which Paul McCartney , Morrissey , the Cure and Leonard Cohen also performed .
Public Enemy ’s 2005 album was entitled “ New Whirl Order ” and included tracks such as “ 66.6 Strikes Again , ” “ What A Fool Believes , ” and “ Revolution ” .
The band were at their peak in the late 80’s .
Their 1988 album It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back peaked at # 42 on the Billboard 200 , and at # 1 on the Billboard R&B / Hip hop Album charts and is routinely ranked in the top 50 albums of all time , being regarded as one of the most influential and groundbreaking records in history .
Public Enemy , along with N.W.A. , were two of the seminal acts in the organic explosion of hip - hop during the latter 1980 ’s , when the grassroots of the genre was all about black people becoming informed , empowered and strong and breaking free from stereotypical associations with poverty and drugs .
As soon as hip - hop became a vehicle for political and personal awakening , it was seized and devoured by corporate America and MTV , before being gradually deformed into what we see on television today – where black icons rap not about fighting the man or standing up to the system , but about how much money and sex they have while girls with giant buttocks wiggle around behind them .
We continually hear about huge music stars using their gargantuan public platforms to educate the public about the new world order at concerts and gigs .
At the internationally renowned Reading festival In August 2006 , Muse front man Matt Bellamy donned a T - shirt emblazoned with the words “ Terrorstorm , ” wearing it for the band ’s headline performance which was watched collectively by tens of millions of people worldwide .

The gunman was named by local officials as Michael McLendon , 28 , who had recently left his job at a local sausage factory .
The bloodshed began when McLendon shot his mother in the house where the two of them lived in Kinston , near Samson .
He then placed his mother on a couch and set the house on fire McLendon also shot four dogs at the house , officials said .
Shock
The suspect then headed to a house in Samson where he shot and killed three relatives as well as the wife and daughter of Josh Myers , a local sheriff 's deputy .
Deputy Myers 's other daughter was injured in the incident and was set to undergo treatment in a local hospital for a wound to the leg caused by a bullet or shrapnel .
" I cried so much yesterday , I do n't have a tear left in me , " Mr Myers said .
" I feel like I should be able to walk in the house and my wife would be there , my baby girl climbing on me . "
After leaving his relatives ' home , the gunman moved to a neighbouring home , where he shot dead a 74 - year - old woman - also a relative , according to officials .
" He cleaned his family out , " said Coffee County Coroner Robert Preachers .
Police are being assisted in their investigation by the FBI
The gunman then drove around Samson , killing two people at a Samson convenience store , and another man driving a pick - up truck .
" He just cruised his automobile through Samson and was spraying the people with semi-automatic weapons [ fire ] at random , " Reverend Mike Shirah , of Geneva 's Maple Baptist Church , told the BBC .
Samson Mayor Clay King said the town had opened a crisis centre at a local church .
" I 've lived here 44 years and never , never dreamed of this happening , " Mr King told AP .
From Samson , the gunman drove 19 km ( 12 miles ) east to Geneva .
At one point , officers rammed his car and gunfire was exchanged .

In quotes : Alabama shooting ' Community in sorrow ' Geneva police chief Frankie Lindsay says he was saved by his bullet - proof vest when the man shot at his patrol with an automatic weapon .
" About 11 rounds hit my vehicle , " he told the BBC .
" Some of the shrapnel from the bullets did enter my shoulder . "
The suspect fired a total of 30 rounds during the exchange with police , officials say .
One of the officers involved in the shootout was Deputy Myers , who at the time was unaware that his wife and daughter had already been killed by the gunman .
The gunman then went inside a metal products plant where he is believed to have once worked , and shot himself .
There is no indication yet of a motive for the killings .
The FBI has sent an agent to assist the local sheriff 's office .
Samson has a population of about 2,000 people .
Geneva 's population is about 4,400 .
The towns are in a quiet rural area and local people are shocked that the incident has happened there .

Advertisement A retired ice - cream seller who is celebrating living in the same house for a century has been reflecting on his long life .
Alfonso De Marco , 107 , moved to Eastbourne from his native Italy in 1909 when he was seven years old .
His father opened an ice - cream parlour in the Sussex town in 1885 and Mr De Marco worked for the family from the age of 14 until he retired in 1975 .
Mr De Marco 's daughter said he loved the area and refused to move .
Wine drinker Mr De Marco , who has eight grandchildren and 14 great - grandchildren , said he intended to stay in the house .
" I like it here , it 's my house , I own it and no - one can chuck me out , " he said .
He 's only just recently given up smoking
Kevin Roberts
One of Mr De Marco 's carers
He added : " I like Eastbourne very much because I 've been here all the time , see . "
One of Mr De Marco 's daughters , Anita Dipilla , said , although her father was now almost housebound and had few interests apart from seeing his family , he refused to move .
" He loves the view from his window , so he 's always just looking out and seeing the world go by , " she said .
Another of his daughters , Pierina Caira , commented on her father 's good humour .
" Wherever he goes , they adore him because he 's never any trouble and I 've never known him to complain about anything , " she said .
Kevin Roberts , one of Mr De Marco 's carers , said : " He likes to have a laugh : he 's only just recently given up smoking - he used to smoke cigars quite regularly - and I think he still has the odd glass of wine when the family is around . "
" It seems to do him well , does n't it ? " he added .

Django Settings Tip - Setting Relative Paths
Django settings files are pretty interesting .
Rather than being written in some sort of purely declarative markup they just use Python .
This brings both lots of power as well as the ability to do things in the settings file that you probably should n’t do .
One area where I find this capability particularly useful is when specifying file system paths .
Lots of the settings concern where Django can find templates , images , or stylesheets for instance .
The examples given in the default settings file are all of the form / this / directory / structure / .
If you plan on only working on your own , and never running your applications anywhere except your local machine this is probably fine .
The moment you want to deploy your application , or want to collaborate with others this becomes a problem .
You either have to agree upon a fixed directory structure between all developers ( annoying ) or have distinct settings files for each machine , which probably means them being outside source control ( also annoying ) .
A better approach is to have those paths dynamically ascertained at runtime .
It makes the application much more portable , making local development and production use easier .
Using the standard library os module we can do just that .
pre. import os import django
calculated paths for django and the site used as starting points for various other paths DJANGO_ROOT = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(django.file ) ) SITE_ROOT = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath( file ) )
Here we set a couple of useful constants , one is the path to the site folder and the other the path to where django is stored on this machine .
settings .py contains a number of places where these constants are useful .
For instance the MEDIA_ROOT settings which specifies the file system location for assets like images or stylesheets .
The default settings file even comes with an instruction and example showing a non portable path .
pre. # Absolute path to the directory that holds media .
Example : “ /home/media/media.lawrence.com / ” MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join( SITE_ROOT , ‘assets ’)
Other examples include setting the path for a SQLite database :
pre. DATABASE_ENGINE = ‘ sqlite3 ’ DATABASE_NAME = os.path.join( SITE_ROOT , ‘db’ ) + ‘/development.db ’
Or specifying directories in which we can place templates .
pre. TEMPLATE_DIRS = ( os.path.join( SITE_ROOT , ‘ templates ’ ) )
I actually think this should probably make it ’s way into the default settings file .
I might very well be missing something but I ca n’t see when it ’s not much better to do things this way .
Scandal - Ridden Blackwater CEO
Steps Down Erik
Prince departs the company he founded as it tries to improve its image .
March 2 , 2009  --
The CEO and founder of the scandal - ridden security firm once known as Blackwater USA resigned Monday morning as part of the company 's attempt to rebrand itself after being fired earlier this year by the State Department from its job protecting diplomats in Iraq .
The firm officially changed its name last month from Blackwater to Xe .
Erik Prince , a former Navy SEAL and the son of a wealthy Republican campaign donor , founded Blackwater in 1997 .
He said today that he will now focus on a private equity venture unrelated to the company .
Prince 's departure caps the list of executives who have recently left the company , including the Vice Chairman , Chief Operating Officer , President , and Executive Vice President , as the company attempts to move past the scandals of the last few years .
Blackwater , now Xe , has been the target of at least four grand jury investigations and accusations of tax fraud , improper use of force , arms trafficking and overbilling .
The firm has denied any wrongdoing .
The firm is best known for its automatic weapon - brandishing diplomatic protection force in Iraq .
Officials there recently refused to license Blackwater to operate in Iraq citing lingering outrage over the September 2007 shooting deaths of 17 civilians by Blackwater guards .
Five former Blackwater guards have pleaded not guilty to federal charges that include 14 counts of manslaughter and 20 counts of attempted manslaughter .
No charges were brought against the corporation .
Xe 's New Management
Xe has created an independent panel of outside experts to advise the company since last fall to help build new company compliance structures .
Joseph Yorio , a former Army special forces officer , will now serve as Xe 's President .
Danielle Esposito will be the new Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President .
" I am confident that Joe and Danielle can guide this team to new heights , while I will have the opportunity to take on some new challenges that I have not yet had the opportunity to tackle , " said Prince .

Limbaugh is talk host king , not leader of GOP
NOVI , MI - MAY 3 : Radio talk show host and conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh speaks at " An Evenining With Rush Limbaugh " event May 3 , 2007 in Novi , Michigan .

President Obama has made his first tactical error of his young presidency :
He called out conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh .
It happened the other day while Obama was visiting with congressional Republicans in an effort to get them to support his economic stimulus package .
Said Obama to the lawmakers : " You ca n't just listen to Rush Limbaugh and get things done . "
On his Monday program , Limbaugh shot back that the president was " obviously more frightened of me than he is of ( Senate Minority Leader ) Mitch McConnell .
He 's more frightened of me than he is of , say , ( House Minority Leader ) John Boehner , which does n't say much about our party . "
It was n't that Obama 's mention was mean or personal , analysts said .
But in citing Limbaugh as influential , the president of the United States elevated a talk show host to his level - the leader of the free world .
And in a leadership vacuum like the one that conservatives find themselves in after last November 's devastating electoral losses , loud voices - like Limbaugh 's with his 13 million weekly listeners - echo even louder .
On Wednesday , Rep. Phil Gingrey , R - Ga. , apologized to Limbaugh on his program for telling Politico.com the day before that " it 's easy if you 're Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh or even sometimes Newt Gingrich to stand back and throw bricks , " referring to their criticizing Republicans for not challenging the stimulus package .
Taking credit
Surely on today 's program , Limbaugh will take credit for not a single Republican House member supporting the stimulus package that passed Wednesday .
On his show Wednesday , Limbaugh called it the " porkulus " package , for all the pork - barrel projects he saw in it .
But while an Oval Office shout - out may temporarily elevate a man who refers to himself as El Rushbo , it does n't make Limbaugh the de facto leader of the Republican Party or the conservative movement .
He is , analysts say , a " conveyer belt " of information , influencer of the wider talk radio universe and an outside - the - Beltway party whip who reins in wayward Republicans - as in those veering toward political moderation .
" Whenever a national party is in search of its identity , its mojo , figures like Rush will fill the vacuum , " said Mike Franc , a vice president for government relations at the conservative Heritage Foundation .
" But in this situation , he does n't fill the idea .
He 's more of an idea aggregator . "
New party chair
The real rebuilding of the conservative brand begins Friday when the Republican Party chooses who will be its new party chair .
In the absence of a GOP president , House speaker or Senate majority leader , that person will become the face of Republicanism on cable and network chat shows , the party 's chief fundraiser and one of conservatism 's leaders at a time in which the movement is desperately searching for some leadership .
That quest will continue next month , when hard - core conservatives gather at their annual Conservative Political Action Conference , a coming - to - Mecca type of conference featuring the party 's up - and - comers , such as Rep. Paul Ryan , R - Wis. , House Minority Whip Eric Cantor , R - Va. , and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin .
But while the official search goes forward , there is little question that the subtle backhand from Obama gave Limbaugh manna from heaven in talk radio terms .
" Oh , it does n't get any better than that , " said Melanie Morgan , a conservative activist and commentator who used to be part of a highly rated talk show on San Francisco 's KSFO - AM .
" To have the president of the United States mention you by name , wow . "
Champagne time
" The Champagne is flowing in Rush Limbaugh 's house , " said Michael Harrison , publisher of Talkers magazine , which chronicles the estimated 3,000 talk radio personalities .
Its estimate of Limbaugh 's audience at 13 million weekly listeners is based on a combination of Arbitron ratings and its own metrics .
" Obama gave Limbaugh the most fabulous gift you can give a talk radio host . "
Obama 's comment came not long after Limbaugh told his listeners that he hopes Obama fails .
" We are being told we have to hope he succeeds , that we have to grab our ankles ... because his father was black , because he 's the first black president , we 've got to accept this . "
And as for Obama , " He 's probably made the first blunder since he took office , " Harrison said .
" He 's the president of the United States , and anytime you tell people not to listen to someone , you 're elevating that person to your level . "
" Rush Limbaugh is nothing more than an influential talk radio host .
He does n't represent anyone but himself , " Harrison said .
In 2002 , Talkers named Limbaugh its " Greatest Radio Talk Show Host of All Time . "
Big audience , salary
While liberals have compiled 20 years worth of Limbaugh 's misinformation and truth - bending rants , he brings home big audiences at a time when media is fragmenting into smaller ones .
Last year , he signed a contract extension to continue doing his nationally - syndicated program through 2016 for a reported $ 400 million .
Limbaugh led the national talk radio revolution in the late 1980s and early 1990s and became a force in rallying support for former Rep.
Gingrich , R - Ga. , to lead a Republican takeover of the House in 1994 .
That year , the conservative standard - bearer magazine National Review anointed him on its cover " The Leader of the Opposition . "
That said , Limbaugh " is not a leader in the party , " said David Keane , chairman of the American Conservative Union , the nation 's largest and oldest grassroots conservative lobbying organization and the host of CPAC .
" He ca n't fulfill that role because that 's not where he works . "
" He 's very influential on issues because he becomes sort of a conveyer belt of information to all of these people out there .
Everyone else in the talk radio world sort of spins off him , the Sean Hannity 's and such of the world , " Keane said .
In Congress , Franc of the Heritage Foundation said , many lawmakers pine for Limbaugh 's ability to translate complicated policy into simple language and place it in a conservative framework .
" There is a lot of Rush - envy there , " said Franc , a former staffer for former House Majority Leader Dick Armey , a leader of the mid-1990s Republican revolution .
As for Democrats , " They wish that I would just vanishhhhhhh , " Limbaugh said on his Wednesday show , stretching out the last syllable as he often does in his corner of the theater of the mind .
But not every conservative is a fan .
Last October , shortly after announcing his support for Obama for president , conservative commentator Christopher Buckley took umbrage at Limbaugh replacing his father , the late William F. Buckley , as a conservative icon .
" Rush , I knew William F. Buckley Jr. William F. Buckley Jr. was a father of mine , " Christopher Buckley wrote .
" Rush , you 're no William F. Buckley Jr. "
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Three regional banks were closed Friday , bringing the total number of failed banks this month to six , as the financial crisis continues to take a toll on small banks nationwide .
Suburban Federal Savings Bank in Crofton , Md. , was closed by the Office of Thrift Supervision .
The FDIC said the failed bank 's seven offices will reopen on Saturday as branches of Tappahannock , Va. - based Bank of Essex .
The FDIC said it entered a " loss - share " agreement with Bank of Essex , whereby the purchasing bank will share some of the losses associated with certain of the failed bank 's " asset pools . "
The arrangement is intended to maximize returns on the assets by keeping them in the private sector , according to the FDIC .
In Florida , the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency shuttered the four locations of Ocala National Bank and entered into a purchase agreement with CenterState Bank in Winter Haven , Fla .
Ocala National Bank had total assets of $ 223.5 million and total deposits of $ 205.2 million , while Suburban Federal had total assets of approximately $ 360 million and total deposits of $ 302 million .
Taken together , the two failures will cost the FDIC an estimated $ 225 million .
Separately , the FDIC said it was unable to find another financial institution to take over the banking operations of Salt Lake City - based MagnetBank , which regulators also closed on Friday .
As a result , it expects to mail checks to retail depositors for their insured funds Monday morning .
MagnetBank , which is estimated to have no uninsured deposits , had total assets of $ 292.9 million and total deposits of $ 282.8 million as of last month , according to the FDIC .
It was the first bank to fail in Utah since 2004 .
The FDIC said it conducted " an extensive marketing process " to seek a buyer for MagnetBank 's assets , but it found no takers .
David Barr , an FDIC spokesman , said MagnetBank had only one branch and did not have the " franchise value " or the " core assets " that would have made it attractive to other banks .
So far this year , bank failures are averaging more than one per week .
Last year , 25 banks were closed nationwide , which was the highest annual total since 1993 , when 42 banks went under .
Economists expect the number of failed banks to continue rising this year as the financial crisis plays out and the economic outlook remains dark .
As The Company 's iVotronic Touch - Screen Voting Machines Continue to Fail Across Her State , Betty Ireland Recognizes Recently - Resigned Exec Gary Greenhalgh for ' Pioneering Use of Technology in Election Process '
Brad Friedman Byon
10/27/2008 , 7:43 pm PT
We wish we were kidding , but it seems that last Thursday , as ES&S iVotronic touch - screen machines were failing across West Virginia ( now reported in at least 6 different counties there ) , Secretary of State Betty Ireland was presenting an " award of merit " to ES&S vice - president Gary Greenhalgh ...
As Kim Zetter reports today at Wired 's " Threat Level " blog :
The Gazette 's coverage tells us that Ireland , when giving Greenhalgh the award , recognized him as " a pioneer in the use of technology in the election process . "
It was the ES&S iVotronic which " pioneered " the loss of some 18,000 votes in the Democratic - stronghold of Sarasota County , FL in 2006 .
The completely disappeared votes led to loss of Democrat Christine Jennings to her Republican opponent Vern Buchanan in the U.S.
House race in Florida 's 13th district by 369 votes .
The Gazette also goes on to remind us of just one of the many studies , Ohio's " EVEREST " analysis , which found the ES&S iVotronic touch - screens can be " compromised and modified without detection , conceivably occurring before , during or after an election , " presenting " serious risks to election integrity . "
That independent analysis led OH SoS Jennifer Brunner to recommend decertification of the ES&S iVotronic system .
Apparently it led WV SoS Ireland to keep using them across the entire state and give the recently - resigned ES&S vice - president an award .
Links to our recent stories on ES&S vote - flips and other failures follows , along with our recommended list of steps to take should you find your vote flipping on one of these wholly unverifiable voting machines ...
Recent ES&S iVotronic Failures as covered by The BRAD BLOG :
And since the DNC and Obama campaign refuse to take any steps to assure your vote may actually be counted accurately on one of these machines ...
What to do if it happens to you :
Call poll supervisors to observe the problem .
Fill out a problem report .
Refuse to vote on that machine .
Request that the machine be taken out of service .
Get a serial number of the machine if possible ( may be difficult in many cases ) .
Tell other voters in line which machine it was and that they should NOT vote on that machine !
Report it to county / town election office .
Report it to the Secretary of State .
Call local reporters and tell them the story .
Call voter problem hotlines ( eg. 866-MYVOTE1 and 866-OUR - VOTE ) and report it .
866-OUR -VOTE ) and report it .
Contact bloggers and Election Integrity websites .
Raise holy hell .
And again , people , please bring a video camera / cell phone camera when you go to vote so you can document these problems on video tape , and then upload them to VideoTheVote.org and YouTube !
( Thanks to VelvetRevolution.us and TrueVote.us for help in compiling these recommendations ! )

TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iran said on Thursday it would attend a U.N. conference on Afghanistan proposed by Tehran ’s old foe Washington and urged a regional solution to the “ crisis . ”
Foreign Ministry spokesman Hassan Qashqavi said Iran had yet to decide who to send to next Tuesday ’s international meeting in The Hague , which will be attended by U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and delegates from more than 80 countries .
U.S. State Department spokesman Gordon Duguid welcomed news of the participation of Iran , following President Barack Obama ’s offer of a “ new beginning ” in relations with the Islamic Republic .
But he said Clinton had no plans for a ‘ substasntive ’ meeting with Iranian officials at the forum .
“ This conference is about reaching a regional consensus about Afghanistan .
It is not a conference about U.S. - Iranian relations , ” he said .
Clinton said earlier this month Iran would be invited to the meeting on Afghanistan , which battles a growing Islamist Taliban insurgency , in a U.S. overture which recognizes the Shi’ite Muslim power ’s influence in its troubled neighbor .
Iran and the United States have not had diplomatic ties for three decades and are now at odds over Tehran ’s nuclear work .
But analysts say they share an interest in ensuring a stable Afghanistan , where violence is at its highest level since the 2001 U.S. - led invasion .
“ Iran will participate , ” Qashqavi said .
“ The level of participation is not clear . ”
Clinton is expected to provide details of a review of U.S. strategy toward Afghanistan and Pakistan , which is set to be released before the conference in the Dutch city .
TALIBAN
Iran says the United States is failing in Afghanistan but that Tehran is ready to help its eastern neighbor .
Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki was quoted as saying a regional solution was needed .
Obama last month ordered the deployment of 17,000 extra U.S. troops to the country .
Iran has often called for U.S. forces to leave the region , saying they are making the situation worse .

But both Tehran and Washington oppose the hardline Sunni Taliban and al Qaeda , back Afghan President Hamid Karzai and want stability , reconstruction and an end to drug trafficking .
“ We believe that a regional solution should be found for the Afghanistan crisis , ” the semi-official Fars News Agency quoted Mottaki as saying during a visit to Brazil .
“ Iran ’s goal in the region is to help peace , stability and calm which is necessary for the region ’s progress , ” he said .
Qashqavi said Iran would also attend a separate meeting on Afghanistan in Moscow this week .
In a major shift from the policies of his predecessor George W. Bush , who sought to isolate Tehran over nuclear work the West suspects is aimed at making bombs , Obama has offered to extend a hand of peace to Iran if “ it unclenches its fist . ”
Last week , in a televised address released to Middle East broadcasters , Obama made his warmest offer yet of a fresh start in relations with Iran .
Iran ’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Saturday he had so far seen no change in U.S. behavior but Tehran would respond to any real policy shift by Washington .
Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful power purposes .
In other areas , the United States accuses Iran of sponsoring terrorism in the Middle East and of backing and arming Shi’ite militias in Iraq , charges Iran dismisses .
But they also share an interest in Iraq ’s stability and territorial integrity .
Mutillidae : A Deliberately Vulnerable Set Of PHP Scripts That Implement The OWASP Top 10
Mutillidae : A Deliberately Vulnerable Set Of PHP Scripts That Implement The OWASP Top 10
Newer version of this page moved to :
http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=mutillidae/mutillidae-deliberately-vulnerable-php-owasp-top-10
As I figure most people reading this know , I make infosec video tutorials for my site Irongeek.com .
I wanted to start covering more web application pen-testing tools and concepts in some of these videos .
Of course , I needed a vulnerable web app or two to use for these demos .
I dig WebGoat , but sometimes it's a little hard to figure out exactly what they want you to do to exploit a given web application .
Also , WebGoat may be a little too complex to use when introducing a web programming newbie to web application security ( it 's easy to get lost in the code , especially J2EE ) .
In an attempt to have something to use as a demo in my videos and in class , I started the Mutillidae project .
What I 'm attempting to do with Mutillidae is implement the OWASP Top 10 in PHP , and do it in such a way that it is easy to demonstrate common attacks to others .
Feel free to use it in your own classes or videos , but if you do I 'd love to hear about it .
Many web app hobbyists and professionals used PHP , and it 's pretty easy to pick up the basics of the language .
The Mutillidae webpage is a set of relatively simple PHP scripts meant to illustrate the core concepts of the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities list .
For the sake of teaching core concepts , I plan to implement all of the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities in multiple ways ( but I could always use some help , especially in writing the hints sections ) .
Mutillidae implements the OWASP Top 10 in PHP .
Feel free to use it in your own classes or videos , but if you do I 'd love to hear about it .
Goals
1 . Make the code and examples simple to understand so as to get the point across of how a given vulnerability works .
2 .
Be geared in such a way that it 's easy to update with new modules and hints .
3 . Easy to install and run .
Just download XAMPP Lite for Windows or Linux , put the scripts in the htdocs directory , and click the " Setup / reset the DB " link in the main menu .
Instructions
Go to the OWASP Top 10 page to read about a vulnerability , then choose it from the list on the left to try it out .
Mutillidae currently has two modes : secure and insecure ( default ) .
In insecure mode , the project works like Mutillidae 1.0 .
Pages are vulnerable to at least the topic they fall under in the menu .
Most pages are vulnerable to much more .
In secure mode , Mutillidae attempts to protect the pages with server side scripts .
Also , hints are disabled in secure mode .
In the interest of makign as many challenges as possible , this can be defeated .
In Mutillidae 2.0 , the code has been commented to allow the user to see how the defense works .
To get the most out of the project , avoid reading the source code until after learning how to exploit it .
But if you get stuck , the comments should help .
Learning how the attack works should help to understand the defense .
Installation
Extract the files somewhere in the htdocs folder of of XAMPP ( for example htdocs / mutillidae ) , or run it from your Linux box after installing Apache / PHP / MySQL .
By default , Mutillidae trys to connect to MySQL on the localhost with the username " root " and a blank password .
To change this , edit " config.inc " with the correct information for your environment .
Do NOT run this code on a production network .
Either run it on a private network , or restrict your web server software to only use the local loopback address .
By default Mutillidae only allows access from localhost ( 127 .*.*.*) .
Edit the .htaccess file to change this behavior ( not recommended on a public network ) .
If for some reason .htaccess is not parsed you can restrict the IP by finding the " Listen " line in the http.conf file and changing it to read : Listen 127.0.0.1:80
Get rid of PHP " strict " errors .
They are not compatible with the OWASP ESAPI classes in use in Mutillidae 2.0 .
The error modifies headers disrupting functionality so this is not simply an annoyance issue .
To do this , go to the PHP.INI file ( default location C:\xampp\php\php.ini ) and change the line that reads " error_reporting = E_ALL | E_STRICT " to " error_reporting = E_ALL & ~ E_NOTICE & ~E_DEPRECIATED " .
Once PHP 6.0 arrives in XAMPP , E_ALL will include E_STRICT so the line to change will probably read " error_reporting = E_ALL " .
In any case , change the error_reporting line to " error_reporting = E_ALL & ~ E_NOTICE & ~ E_DEPRECIATED " .
Notes
Created by Irongeek.com , but at this point Jeremy Druin most likely has more code in it than I do .
If you would like to learn about other deliberately vulnerable web applications , check out Deliberately Insecure Web Applications For Learning Web App Security .
If you would like to help in writing the hints sections , please email .
Your name and a link to your site will be added to the credits page .
Among the fun things that Mutillidae implements from the OWASP top 10 are :
OWASP Top 10 2010
A1 - Injection ( SQL and Command )
A2 - Cross Site Scripting ( XSS )
A3 - Broken Authentication and Session Management
A4 - Insecure Direct Object References
A5 - Cross Site Request Forgery ( CSRF )
A6 - Security Misconfiguration
A7 - Insecure Cryptographic Storage
A8 - Failure to Restrict URL Access
A9 - Insufficient Transport Layer Protection

Change Log for Mutillidae 2.0.9 : Added new menu items under SQLi for SQLi Insert Injection
Added new menu item for documentation
Moved constants into constants .
php file
Patched tabbing in home.htm
Added additional instructions on supressing PHP errors with XamppLite .
Thanks to Miguel Wherner for the tip .
06/15/2011 : Jeremy Druin
Change Log for Mutillidae 2.0.8 : Added more comments to the code to explain how defenses work
Added support for the < u > < /u > tag to the blog .
In secure mode Mutillidae will allow this tag but still safely encode output and stop XSS .
Added JavaScript filtering to prevent single quotes from being entered in blog entries .
This give practice bypassing JavaScript " security " and helps the user understand JavaScript cannot provide security .
Added lots of JS filtering to login. php .
Nearly all characters are filtered .
Users are encouraged to understand that JavaScript and filtering are useless for security .
Added autofocus to login.php and add - to - blog.
php
Added more " allowed dangerous HTML tags " to the blog .
Until now only the bold HTML tag was supported .
Also the output was not HTML5 compliant .
For example , if the user entered a bold tag , then a bold tag was output however the bold tag is depreciated .
Styles must be used .
So Mutillidae allows the user to input a bold tag but will correctly encode this as a sytle upon output .
The italic tag is now supported as a dangerous input which is safely output without fear of Cross Site Scripting .
These defenses only operate in secure mode of course .
In insecure mode , the site allows any input and simply outputs whatever is input without any encoding .
Changed menu for OWASP A1 - Injection to differentiate between SQL , HTML , and Command Injection .
This should make it more clear which pages exhibit vulnerabilities with the specific injecton sub - types .
Also added new link for Blind SQL Injection .
Changed menu for OWASP A2 - Cross Site Scripting to differentiate between XSS coming in via user supplied fields ( GET / POST ) and values within HTTP Request Headers .
Added tutorials feature .
Added SQL Injection Totorial
Added Cross Site Scripting tutorial
Added Command Injection tutorial
Added new feature .
Hints can now be at different levels .
Each time the user clicks
Hints , the level increases by 1 until rolling over .
Removed the installation instructions from the home page .
A new page for instructions is created and linked from the menu .
Augmented the installation instructions to include running from Samurai , creating a custom ISO , installing to XAMPP , and running in virutal machines .
Reformatted install instructions and main home page to be compliant with HTML 5
05/22/2011 : Jeremy Druin
Change Log for Mutillidae 2.0.7 : Added a new page rene - magritte. php to explore click - jacking .
In secure mode , Mutillidae will send the X - FRAME - OPTIONS : DENY header .
In modern browsers , this will cause the browser to throw an error rather than allow the page rene - magritte . php to be framed .
Added a resources link to the main menu .
Links are to information or tools that can help with testing Mutillidae .
Added new class LogHandler to take over logging .
Previously logging statements has to be copied to each spot that logging was needed .
With the new class , logging requires only one line of code and the logger automatically logs based on the current security level .
If in insecure mode , no attempt to stop XSS or SQLi is made .
With the new class , many less lines of code are needed and many more places log .
With more places logging , there is a much better chance of finding a log exploit and taking advantage ( insecure mode ) .
Logging added to pages : add - to - your - blog , dns- lookup , text - file - viewer , source - viewer . php , register .php , redirectandlog.php , and user - info.
php
Added more default users to initial setup to give more targets .
05/10/2011 : Jeremy Druin
Change Log for Mutillidae 2.0.6 : Added a new security vulnerability and counteracting secure code .
The " business requirements " for the add - new - blog - entry page now require users to be able to enter a bold tag in their blog .
In secure mode , Mutillidae allows this functionality while still protecting the users from mallicous injection input .
A new secret page has been added .
There are lots of test scripts that the developers used to hack Mutillidae inside .
It will be very hard to guess the name of the file but there are plenty of vulns that will allow users to locate and open the file .
04/24/2011 : Jeremy Druin
Change Log for Mutillidae 2.0.6 : Added a new security vulnerability and counteracting secure code .
Cookies are unprotected in insecure mode , but in secure mode , the cookies will have the HTTPOnly attribute applied to them .
In reality this vulnerability was always in Mutillidae since ignoring the issue opens the vulnerability ( the ability for scripts to access the cookie values ) .
The change is acknowleging this issue and adding the defense .
Once we get an SSL certificate installed , the next logical step will be to add the " Secure " attribute to cookies in secure mode , but to not add this attribute in insecure mode .
Added the X - FRAME - OPTIONS : DENY click - jacking defense in secure mode .
In insecure mode , the site does nothing and ignores the issue entirely .
This defense only works in newer browsers and javascript framebusters are needed to help older browsers .
Added insecure comments vulnerability and defense .
Some developers use HTML or JavaScript comments instead of using the frameworks comments ( ASP.
NET , Java , PHP , Etc. )
Rearranged instructions on home page to emphasize the PHP.ini configuration changes that are needed to get rid of errors .
Rewrote opendb.inc to have error trapping and custom error handling .
If there is an error , there will be some diagnistic information available .
04/14/2011 : Jeremy Druin
Change Log for Mutillidae 2.0.5 Beta : browser - info.php - Patched a bug which disabled entire page if the whois server is not reachable .
Now only that one line will be disabled .
Also replaced Windows style file path slashes with Unix style .
Either slash will work in Windows but Linux only accepts the Unix style path else throws an error .
04/13/2011 : Jeremy Druin
Change Log for Mutillidae 2.0.4 Beta : user-info.php - Added XSS defenses to the output so that users cannot poison their username , password or signature to cause XSS .
This only works in secure code .
register.php - Added XSS defenses to the output so that users cannot poison their username to cause XSS .
This only works in secure code .
header .php - Added link to this changelog .
Changed style of upper header to allow more space for logged in user text .
In very small screens , the text was overlapping .
Also , the size of the mascot image was reduced to give the user more screen space .
change-log.php - Added new XSS vulnerability for users to try .
04/12/2011 :
2.0.3.1 :
Small change to fix source - viewer .
php .
03/30/2011 : Jeremy Druin
Change Log for Mutillidae 2.0.3 Beta : index.php - Added PHP version detection and altered forms caching defenses and server header information defenses to use header_remove ( ) only if the version of PHP is at 5.3 or above .
Made version string variable that contains whatever version string is for Mutillidae plus " nice " output .
Samurai is going through a PHP version change to 5.3 right now and XAMPP just went through the same change .
This code is meant to bridge users caught between versions .
header.php - Made version output simpler .
header .
php only outputs the header string .
footer .php - Added PHP version to footer output in insecure mode .
In secure mode , server version is not shown .
03/25/2011 : Jeremy Druin
Change Log for Mutillidae 2.0.2 Beta :
Whole site Made local relative links without leading dot
Installed on Samurai 0.95 for testing .
Found that Samurai doesnt like the leading dot in local file paths .
Those were removed from the index .
php page .
Made version a variable in index.php to make updating version string easier
Added new forms caching information leakage vulnerability
Added new vulnerability for X - Powered - By and discussed removing the Server HTTP header in comments
03/24/2011 : Jeremy Druin
Change Log for Mutillidae 2.0.1 Beta :
Whole site Replaced root relative links with local relative links to allow more freedom in root folder name
Added email address for Jeremy
Added change log to site
Added Toggle
Hints into core menu but link disappears in secure mode
Added new failure to restrict URL access vuln
03/23/2011 : Jeremy Druin , a professional developer ( unlike me ) added sooooooo many new features to the project .
To quote him :
Change Log for Mutillidae 2.0 Beta :
Whole site Site implements the OWASP ESAPI API for PHP including showing how to instantiate classes and call methods for output encoding .
Site now allows user to switch between secure and insecure mode to allow the user to employ an attack then try the same attack against more secure code
All code for both modes of operation are available for inspection and include large amounts of explanation comments for both the insecure and secure sections .
Code is commented in such a way to help developers understand the security concepts as opposed to only seeing the PHP implementation
Added custom error handling to site which reacts differently depending on security mode
Site has larger hint sections with more hints included
Added menuing system for easier navigation
Added toolbar at top of each page for critical functions ( hints , security mode , home page , etc . )
Converted styles to CSS

06/16/2010 : I changed it so that now , by default , Mutillidae only allows access from localhost ( 127 .*.*.*) , assuming the .htaccess file I 've written is honored .
Thanks for the suggestion Kevin .
I 've also made the install instructions somewhat better .
04/29/2010 : Updated to version 1.4 to make Mutillidae compliant with the 2010 version of the OWASP Top 10 .
Also added some modules , and fixed a bug I must have introduced at some point that keeps the user from inserting a single quote into their blog .
09/03/2009 : I found out that my little teaching app stopped working with new versions of XAMPP .
It seems I have to use <? php to start my PHP tags , using just <? no longer worked .
I 've updated Mutillidae to 1.3 and made it work again .
04/29/2009 : Added link to first Mutillidae video .
03/18/2009 : Added the activity log section so I could show off stored user agent XSS , added information on cookie stealing with XSS to the tips section , added catch .
php to show how to grab data after an XSS and did a few other minor little tweaks .
Also , I changed some of the text around to include the " Ate up with suck " slogan .
03/18/2009 : Thanks to Seth Misenar and the Pauldotcom guys for giving me the new tagline for this project : " Ate up with suck " .
03/02/2009 : Changed the comment system into a blog , and straighten up some code .
03/01/2009 : First posted to the public .
Tests by consumer advocate Choice have proven what everyone always suspected : spending hundreds of dollars on high - end home theatre cables is a waste of money .
Panel tests by the non-profit company found that , although retailers try to push customers into buying high - margin cables for their digital TVs and DVD players costing upwards of $ 300 , no - frills options costing $ 40 - $ 60 are just as good .
It comes after this website reported that Australians were being duped into spending hundreds of dollars on so - called " high - performance " HDMI cables when buying new home entertainment equipment .
We have every reason to be pleased with ourselves .
Bucking all recent precedent , we seem to have put a self - possessed , intelligent man in the White House who , if he manages to avoid being bronzed before his first hundred days are up , may actually succeed in correcting the course of empire .
The bubble is rushing back to plumb ; excitement is in the air .
It would be churlish to quibble .
Still , let 's .
Although the guard at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue has indisputably changed , although the new boss is not the same as the old boss , I 'm less certain about us .
I 'd like to believe that we 're a different people now ; that we 're more educated , more skeptical , more tough - minded than we were when we gave the outgoing gang of criminals enough votes to steal the presidential election , twice , but it 's hard work ; actual human beings keep getting in the way .
My neighbor , a high school teacher living about an hour outside New York City , wants to torture a terrorist .
He 's worried because he believes that Osama — excuse me , Obama — cares more about terrorists than he does about us .
He 's never heard of the Spanish Inquisition .
Another neighbor — an actual plumber , actually named Joe — wants Mark Haddon 's The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night - Time tossed out of the high school library .
Joe came by recently .
Did I want my kids learning how to curse and kill dogs and commit adultery ?
he asked .
I said that my kids already knew how to curse , and that I had n't realized that killing dogs and committing adultery were things you had to learn .
He showed me the book .
He and his wife had gone through it with a blue highlighter and highlighted the words " crap , " " shit , " and " damn " every time they appeared , on every page .
They 'd written to Laura Bush about it , and received a supportive letter in return , signed by the first lady .
" You 're a teacher , " he said .
" Do n't tell me you support this kind of filth . "
I asked him if he 'd read it .
Well , no , he said , but he knew what it was about .
He did n't really go in for reading , himself , he said .
I like a party as much as the next man , and I still have moments when I realize that the bastards are really , truly out and think that maybe , this time , it really is morning in America , but a voice from outside the ether cone keeps whispering that we have n't changed at all , that we 're as dangerous to ourselves as we 've ever been , and that the relative closeness of the popular vote in this last election ( given the almost embarrassing superiority of the winning ticket and the parade of catastrophes visited on the nation by the outgoing party ) proves it .
Go ahead and bask , this voice says , but that mumble you hear above the drums and the partymakers is real , and it 's coming our way .
What we need to talk about , what someone needs to talk about , particularly now , is our ever - deepening ignorance ( of politics , of foreign languages , of history , of science , of current affairs , of pretty much everything ) and not just our ignorance but our complacency in the face of it , our growing fondness for it .
A generation ago the proof of our foolishness , held up to our faces , might still have elicited some redeeming twinge of shame — no longer .
Today , across vast swaths of the republic , it amuses and comforts us .
We 're deeply loyal to it .
Ignorance gives us a sense of community ; it confers citizenship ; our representatives either share it or bow down to it or risk our wrath .
Seen from a sufficient distance ( a decade abroad , for example ) , or viewed through a protective filter , like film , or alcohol , there can be something almost endearing about it .
It can appear quaint , part of our foolish - but authentic , naive - yet - sincere , roughhewn spirit .
Up close and personal , unromanticized and unfiltered , it 's another thing entirely .
In the flesh , barking from the electronic pulpit or braying back from the audience , our ignorance can be sobering .
We do n't know .
Or much care .
Or care to know .
What do we care about ?
We care about auto racing and Jessica .
We care about food , oh yes , please , very much .
And money .
( Did you catch the last episode of I Love Money ? )
We care about Jesus , though we 're a bit vague on his teachings .
And America .
We care about America .
And the flag .
And the troops , though we 're untroubled by the fact that the Bush Administration lied us into the conflict , then spent years figuring out that armor in war might be a good idea .
Did I mention money ?
Here 's the mirror — look and wince .
One out of every four of us believes we 've been reincarnated ; 44 percent of us believe in ghosts ; 71 percent , in angels .
Forty percent of us believe God created all things in their present form sometime during the last 10,000 years .
Nearly the same number — not coincidentally , perhaps — are functionally illiterate .
Twenty percent think the sun might revolve around the earth .
When one of us writes a book explaining that our offspring are bored and disruptive in class because they have an indigo " vibrational aura " that means they are a gifted race sent to this planet to change our consciousness with the help of guides from a higher world , half a million of us rush to the bookstores to lay our money down .
Wherever it may have resided before , the brain in America has migrated to the region of the belt — not below it , which might at least be diverting , but only as far as the gut — where it has come to a stop .
The gut tells us things .
It tells us what 's right and what 's wrong , who to hate and what to believe and who to vote for .
Increasingly , it 's where American politics is done .
All we have to do is listen to it and the answer appears in the little window of the eight ball : " Do n't trust him .
Do n't know .
Undecided .
Just because , that 's why . "
We know because we feel , as if truth were a matter of personal taste , or something to be divined in the human heart , like love .
I was raised to be ashamed of my ignorance , and to try to do something about it if at all possible .
I carry that burden to this day , and have successfully passed it on to my children .
I do n't believe I have the right to an opinion about something I know nothing about — constitutional law , for example , or sailing — a notion that puts me sadly out of step with a growing majority of my countrymen , many of whom may be unable to tell you anything at all about Islam , say , or socialism , or climate change , except that they hate it , are against it , do n't believe in it .
Worse still ( or more amusing , depending on the day ) are those who can tell you , and then offer up a stew of New Age blather , right - wing rant , and bloggers ' speculation that 's so divorced from actual , demonstrable fact , that 's so not true , as the kids would say , that the mind goes numb with wonder .
" Way I see it is , " a man in the Tulsa Motel 6 swimming pool told me last summer , " if English was good enough for Jesus Christ , it 's good enough for us . "
Quite possibly , this belief in our own opinion , regardless of the facts , may be what separates us from the nations of the world , what makes us unique in God 's eyes .
The average German or Czech , though possibly no less ignorant than his American counterpart , will probably consider the possibility that someone who has spent his life studying something may have an opinion worth considering .
Not the American .
Although perfectly willing to recognize expertise in basketball , for example , or refrigerator repair , when it comes to the realm of ideas , all folks ( and their opinions ) are suddenly equal .
Thus evolution is a damned lie , global warming a liberal hoax , and Republicans care about people like you .
But there 's more .
Not only do we believe that opinion ( our own ) trumps expertise ; we then go further and demand that expertise assume the position — demand , that is , that those with actual knowledge supplicate themselves to the Believers , who do n't need to know .
The logic here , if that 's the term , seems to rest on the a priori conviction that belief and knowledge are separate and unequal .
Belief is higher , nobler ; it comes from the heart ; it feels like truth .
There 's a kind of Biblical grandeur to it , and as God 's chosen , we have an inherent right to it .
Knowledge , on the other hand , is impersonal , easily manipulated , inherently suspect .
Like the facts it 's based on , it 's slippery , insubstantial — not solid like the things you believe .
The corollary to the axiom that belief beats knowledge , of course , is that ordinary folks should n't value the latter too highly , and should be suspicious of those who do .
Which may explain our inherent discomfort with argument .
We may not know much , but at least we know what we believe .
Tricky elitists , on the other hand , are always going on .
Confusing things .
We do n't trust them .
So what if Sarah Palin could n't answer Charlie Gibson 's sneaky question about the Bush Doctrine ?
We did n't know what it was either .
How did we come to this pass ?
We could blame the American education system , I suppose , which has been retooled over the past two generations to churn out workers ( badly ) , not skeptical , informed citizens .
Or we could look to the great wasteland of television , whose homogenizing force and narcotizing effect has quite neatly corresponded to the rising tide of ignorance .
Or we could spend some time analyzing the fungus of associations that has grown around the word " elitist , " which can now be applied to a teacher driving a thirteen - year - old Toyota but not to a multimillionaire CEO like Dick Cheney .
Or , finally , we might look to the influence of the anti-elitist elites who , burdened by the weight of their Ph.D.s , will argue that the words " educated " and " ignorant " are just signifiers of class employed by the oligarchy to keep the underprivileged in their place , and then proceed to tell you how well Bobby is doing at Princeton .
But I 'm less interested in the ingredients of this meal than in who 's going to have to eat it , and when , and at what cost .
There 's no particular reason to believe , after all , that things will improve ; that our ignorance and gullibility will miraculously abate , that the militant right and the entrenched left , both so given to caricature , will simultaneously emerge from their bunkers eager to embrace complexity , that our disdain for facts and our aversion to argument will reverse themselves .
Precisely the opposite is likely .
In fact , if we take the wider view , and compare today 's political climate ( the arrogance with which our leaders now conduct their extralegal adventures , the crudity of the propaganda used to manipulate us , our increasing willingness to cheer the lie and spit on the truth , just so long as the lie is ours ) to that of even a generation ago , then extend the curve a decade or two into the future , it 's easier to imagine a Balkanized nation split into rival camps cheered and sustained by their own propaganda than the republic of reason and truth so many of us want to believe in .
Traditions die hard , after all .
Anti-intellectualism in America is a very old hat — a stovepipe , at least , maybe even a coonskin .
We wear it well ; we 're unlikely to give it up just like that .
Consider , for example , what happens to men or women ( today as ever ) the minute they declare themselves candidates for office , how their language their syntax , their level of diction , the field from which their analogies are drawn — takes a nosedive into the common pool .
Notice how quickly the contractions creep in and the sleeves roll up .
The comparison to high school seems appropriate ; the pressure to adapt is considerable , and it's all in one direction — down .
In American politics , as in the cafeteria , the crowd sets the tone .
It does n't know much , and if you want in , you 'd better not either .
Should you want out , of course , all you have to do is inadvertently let on — for example , by using the word " inadvertently " — that you 're a reasonably educated human being , and the deed is done .
Communicate intelligently in America and you 're immediately suspect .
As one voter from Alaska expressed it last fall , speaking of Obama , " He just seems snotty , and he looks weaselly . "
This is n't race talking ; it 's education .
There 's something sneaky about a man like Obama ( or even John Kerry , who , though no Disraeli , could construct a sentence in English with a beginning , a middle , and an end ) , because he seems intelligent .
It makes people uneasy .
Who knows what he might be thinking ?
But does n't this past election , then , sound the all clear ?
Does n't the fact that Obama did n't have to lower himself to win suggest that the ignorant are outnumbered ?
Ca n't we simply ignore the third of white evangelicals who believe the world will end in their lifetimes , or the millennialists who know that Obama 's the Antichrist because the winning lottery number in Illinois was 666 ?
For starters , consider how easily things might have gone the other way had the political and economic climate not combined into a perfect political storm for the Republican Party ; had the Dow been a thousand points higher in September , or gas a dollar cheaper .
Truth is , we got lucky ; the bullet grazed our skull .
Next , consider the numbers .
Of the approximately 130 million Americans who voted this past November , very nearly half , seemingly stuck in political puberty , were untroubled by the possibility of Sarah Palin and the first dude inheriting the White House .
At the same time , those of us on the winning side might want to do a cross - check before landing .
How many of us — not just in the general election but in the primaries , when there was still a choice — voted for Obama because he was the It thing this season , because he was so likable , because he had that wonderful voice , because he was black , because he made us feel as if Atticus Finch had come home ?
If nothing else , the fact that so many have convinced themselves that one man , thus far almost entirely untested , will slay the culture of corruption with one hand while pulling us out of the greatest mess we 've known in a century with the other suggests that a certain kind of " clap your hands if you believe " naiveté crosses the aisle at will .
But the electorate , whatever its issues , is not the real problem .
The real problem , the unacknowledged pit underlying American democracy , is the 38 percent of the population who did n't move , did n't vote .
Think of it : a country the size of Germany — 83 million people — within our own borders .
Many of its citizens , after decades of watching the status quo perpetuate itself , are presumably too fed up to bother , a stance we can sympathize with and still condemn for its petulance and immaturity , its unwillingness to acknowledge the fact that in every election there is a better and a worse choice .
Millions of others , however , are adults who do n't know what the Bill of Rights is , who have never heard of Lenin , who think Africa is a nation , who have never read a book .
I 've talked to enough of them to know that many are decent people , and that decency is not enough .
Witches are put to the stake by decent people .
Ignorance trumps decency any day of the week .
Praise me for a citizen or warm up the pillory , it comes down to the unpleasant fact that a significant number of our fellow citizens are now as greedy and gullible as a boxful of puppies ; they 'll believe anything ; they 'll attack the empty glove ; they 'll follow that plastic bone right off the cliff .
Nothing about this election has changed that fact .
If they 're ever activated — if the wrong individual gets to them , in other words , before the educational system does — we may live to experience a tyranny of the majority Tocqueville never imagined .
Europe 's beekeeping industry could be wiped out in less than a decade as bees fall victim to disease , insecticides and intensive farming , international beekeeping body Apimondia said today .
Last year , about 30 per cent of Europe 's 13.6 million hives died , according to Apimondia figures .
Losses reached 50 per cent in Slovenia and as high as 80 per cent in southwest Germany .
With 35 per cent of European food crops relying on bees to pollinate them , it poses a big threat for farmers , said Gilles Ratia , president of Apimondia .
" With this level of mortality , European beekeepers can only survive another eight to 10 years , ” Mr Ratia said .
Mystery has surrounded the recent decline of bee numbers , but most keepers blame modern farming methods and the powerful new pesticides used on crops like sunflower , maize and rapeseed .
Two main factors were responsible for weakening bee colonies : insecticides and the parasitic mite Varroa , says Apimondia 's scientific coordinator Gerard Arnold .
Once weakened , the hives are then decimated by viruses and other diseases .
Evidence of farming 's impact comes from the fact French honey output has suffered in intensive sunflower farming areas but has remained steady in mountains and chestnut forests , said Henri Clement , president of the French beekeeping union .
Beekeepers are perplexed about why so little attention is given to an industry that supplies 58 per cent of Europe 's appetite of 340,000 tonnes of honey a year .
Earlier this year , the European Union voted to phase out the most toxic pesticides after years of wrangling , but many bee - keepers feel ignored by politicians .
The honey industry 's concerns are drowned out by the interests of the giant corporations that produce the pesticides , said Apimondia .
" Politicians are more susceptible to the big lobbying of the chemical industry , " Mr Ratia said .
" We beekeepers can talk and talk , but we do n't receive much consideration . "

As a frantic search and debate continues over the best alternative energy source , Scientist at Rutgers University establishes reasons , confirmation and viability of algaculture as the best alternative energy choice .
Biology departments at universities and schools worldwide , which have been researching into the benefits of the algae energy source , have all come to the same conclusion : algae renewable energy may the answer to satisfying a large part of our future energy needs in a way that does not harm the environment and is cost - effective at the same time .
A wide variety of experiments have already been conducted which have lead to this conclusion , as well as the fact that algae energy source can replace oil - based fuels .
It just needs more time to be properly developed and perfected , after which the algae renewable energy source may well become widely used .
Algae bacteria are probably one of the best possible sources of energy , so algaculture , as it is called , is one of our best options in the future .
Many algae strains contain over 50 percent oil , which can easily be converted to biodiesel fuel .
The algae energy source offers various advantages that other sources of renewable energy do n’t have .
For example , soybeans and corn are frequently used in biofuel production , but there are many problems with this .
Developing countries are fiercely against it , because food crops are not being used for eating , and they are taking up fertile land , which is becoming scarce around the world .
As for algae renewable energy , these bacteria can be grown almost anywhere , and they do not need to take up fertile land .
They can be grown on salt or sewage water , and even in polluted wastewater , which will actually leave that water cleaner than it was .
If algae is grown on fresh water , it will not pollute it , but help clean it by absorbing certain elements that could lead to possible problems with PH balance .
Algae renewable energy is very efficient and can be produced with little effort and cost .
Another benefit of algae as an energy source is that it captures carbon dioxide , which is one of the harmful greenhouse gases .
All it needs is water ( which does not have to be suitable for farm use or drinking ) and sunlight to grow .
Algae has a high yield per acre , it only takes hours to reproduce , it is biodegradable , it does not contain sulfur , and it is not toxic .
In addition , this extremely versatile source of energy can also be used as a basic food stuff that is highly nutritious , such as a form of vegetable oil , cooking oil , and salad dressing .
When it comes to transportation energy and energy for industrial and technological needs , this renewable energy source can be converted into a number of different biofuels , such as biodiesel , biogasoline , bioethanol , biobutanol , biomethanol , and various other kinds of biofuels .
So , all this points to that fact that algae bacteria really could turn into the energy source of the future .

The motivation behind the " Glass Tank " is simple : create a vessel with a seemingly endless supply of alcohol .
The only problem is that this particular design may not be the best way to achieve this goal .
Advertisement
Apparently , air pressure and water pressure insure that a consistent amount of fluid from the tank runs into the glass as the user drinks .
I can see how that might work , but it does n't take a genius to realize that a glass vessel like this one would probably snap at the stem like a twig when tilted only slightly ( a serious challenge for the tipsy drunk ) .
My suggestion is to drink straight out of the bottle or , if you are a more civilized alcoholic , buy one of those giant glasses that can hold an entire bottle of wine .
Not surprisingly , the Glass Tank is only a concept .

Batavia , Ill . —Scientists of the CDF experiment at the Department of Energy ’s Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory announced yesterday ( March 17 ) that they have found evidence of an unexpected particle whose curious characteristics may reveal new ways that quarks can combine to form matter .
The CDF physicists have called the particle Y( 4140 ) , reflecting its measured mass of 4140 megaelectron volts .
Physicists did not predict its existence because Y( 4140 ) appears to flout nature ’s known rules for fitting quarks and antiquarks together .
“ It must be trying to tell us something , ” said CDF cospokesperson Jacobo Konigsberg of the University of Florida .
“ So far , we ’re not sure what that is , but rest assured we ’ll keep on listening . ”
Matter as we know it comprises building blocks called quarks .
Quarks fit together in various well - established ways to build other particles : mesons , made of a quark - antiquark pair , and baryons , made of three quarks .
So far , it ’s not clear exactly what Y( 4140 ) is made of .
The Y( 4140 ) particle decays into a pair of other particles , the J / psi and the phi , suggesting to physicists that it might be a composition of charm and anticharm quarks .
However , the characteristics of this decay do not fit the conventional expectations for such a make - up .
Other possible interpretations beyond a simple quark - antiquark structure are hybrid particles that also contain gluons , or even four - quark combinations .
The CDF scientists observed Y( 4140 ) particles in the decay of a much more commonly produced particle containing a bottom quark , the B + meson .
Sifting through trillions of proton - antiproton collisions from Fermilab ’s Tevatron , CDF scientists identified a small sampling of B+ mesons that decayed in an unexpected pattern .
Further analysis showed that the B+ mesons were decaying into Y( 4140 ) .
The Y( 4140 ) particle is the newest member of a family of particles of similar unusual characteristics observed in the last several years by experimenters at Fermilab ’s Tevatron as well as at KEK laboratory in Japan and at DOE ’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in California .
“ We congratulate CDF on the first evidence for a new unexpected Y state that decays to J / psi and phi , ” said Japanese physicist Masanori Yamauchi , a cospokesperson of KEK ’s Belle experiment .
“ This state may be related to the Y( 3940 ) state discovered by Belle and might be another example of an exotic hadron containing charm quarks .
We will try to confirm this state in our own Belle data . ”
Theoretical physicists are trying to decode the true nature of these exotic combinations of quarks that fall outside our current understanding of mesons and baryons .
Meanwhile experimentalists happily continue to search for more such particles .
“ We ’re building upon our knowledge piece by piece , ” said CDF cospokesperson Rob Roser of Fermilab , “ and with enough pieces , we ’ll understand how this puzzle fits together . ”
The Y( 4140 ) observation is the subject of an article submitted by CDF to Physical Review Letters this week .
Besides announcing Y( 4140 ) , the CDF experiment collaboration is presenting more than 40 new results at the Moriond Conference on Quantum Chromodynamics in Europe this week , including the discovery of electroweak top - quark production and a new limit on the Higgs boson , in concert with experimenters from Fermilab ’s DZero collaboration .
Both experiments are actively pursuing a very broad program of physics , including ever - more - precise measurements of the top and bottom quarks , W and Z bosons and searches for additional new particles and forces .
“ Thanks to the remarkable performance of the Tevatron , we expect to greatly increase our data sample in the next couple of years , said Konigsberg .
“ We ’ll study better what we ’ve found and hopefully make more discoveries .
It ’s a very exciting time here at Fermilab . ”

OK , those are strong words for a headline , and I 'll explain , but first , let me beg you to forward this email to every New York State resident you know .
If you are a NYS resident , please URGENTLY phone your State Senator ( instructions below ) in support of the plan -- known as the Ravitch plan - - to bail out our transit system .
Bloggers , please feel free link to or post this text for your readers .
Everyone else who is internet - savvy , please Digg , Stumble or Twitter about it .
New York needs your help !
Across the country , citizens are surging into our mass transit systems in the highest numbers in 50 years .
This is great news for the planet since a subway ride , on average , causes less than a third of the greenhouse gas emissions of a car ride .
It 's also great news for the people since it means we can stop spending the average 15 percent of our incomes on running our cars ; our city children can stop getting asthma from our exhaust fumes .
The problem is that , in the midst of this surge in ridership , economic conditions mean many of our nation 's transit systems are having to cut service and raise fares , forcing the recent converts back to their cars again .
Here in New York , though , the Ravitch plan to avoid service cuts and minimize fare hikes actually has a chance .
If you are New York State resident , your support is crucial .
Please URGENTLY call your State Senator ( see instructions at the bottom of this post ) .
Sheldon Silver , Speaker of the New York State Assembly , the lower house , says he has enough votes to pass the measure that would fund the transit system by levying a small tax on commuters and instituting a $ 2 toll on bridges that currently allow cars to pass free into Manhattan .
The measure is also supported by Governor Paterson .
In other words , recession or not , we in New York City might keep our transit system intact just when we need it most .
Except for five problems .
The names of those five problems are Democratic Senators Ruben Diaz , Ruth Hassell - Thompson and Pedro Espada of the Bronx and Carl Kruger and Kevin Parker of Brooklyn .
They are threatening to rupture the small Democratic majority in the State 's upper house by voting with the Republicans -- who care less about helping their transit - dependent citizens than painting a tax - and - spend picture of the Democrats .
Now , I know it may look like I am giving knee - jerk support to the Democrats here , but if you remember , I blasted the Democrats for not supporting the toll - based congestion - pricing scheme in New York City last year .
My motive is not partisan ; it is environmental and supportive of a high quality of life .
I support a robust , good , pleasant , transit system for Americans .
It 's good for the planet and good for the people .
But here in New York , Diaz , Espada , Hassell - Thompson , Charger and Parker have turned against the people .
Their argument is that the burden will fall unfairly on their outer - borough constituents who drive to Manhattan .
But they are being duplicitous .
According to the Daily News , inhabitants of their districts overwhelmingly use transit rather than cars by a factor of ten to one .
And those transit riders will all face service cuts if the Ravitch plan does not pass .
So what 's the real reason for their opposition ?
Holding the people hostage for political gain .
It 's rumored that the rebels want something from the Democratic party leadership that they 're not getting -- so they 're causing as much trouble as they can till they get it .
What that " it " is , exactly , is something that only they and the party leadership know .
But they need not prevail , especially in these times when the good of the people should be coming before petty , careerist politics .
A vote on this issue could come as early as this week .
We New York State residents must URGENTLY let all our Senators know that we support the Ravitch transit plan .
All you have to do is call the central Senate switchboard at ( 518 ) 455-2800 , say that you 'd like your senator 's office , and give your zip code .
Once you 're connected , just say that you 'd like your senator to strongly support the Ravitch transit plan .
PS Don't forget to email this post to as many New York State residents as you can .

By the way , I 'd love for folks to leave comments here at the blog ( NoImpactMan.com ) saying how their phone calls with their senators went .
After my column last week on Afghanistan was published I got an exasperated e-mail from my old friend Dave Redick , who has a fair amount of potentially pro-freedom activity underway , complaining that he had Googled the piece for the words " oil " and " pipeline " and found nary a mention .
Because of that lack , he figured I had missed the real reason we Americanos want to be involved in Afghanistan and was wasting my time and peoples ’ attention discussing phony issues like the Taliban , al - Qaeda , supply problems , negotiations , and Afghan governance , the sort of things those really pulling the strings want us rubes to discuss while we ignore the real issues .
So I thought the subject deserved more attention .
I must admit that I worry less about oil ( and natural gas ) than some people as a cause of war , but it would be foolish to deny that it plays a role in a world that runs ( for the most part and for a good time to come , even  or perhaps especially  if the government subsidizes various kinds of " green " energy sources ) on fossil fuels .
And there is certainly a strong oil and natural gas issue that has been connected to Afghanistan for a long time , not because the country has especially notable resources ( it does n’t ) , but because of its geographic location .
It ’s just that I think about the relationship between war and oil a little differently than a lot of people do .
For that very reason , however , further discussion might not be out of line , because thinking sensibly about natural resources , it seems to me , provides yet another solid reason to avoid unnecessary foreign wars , a category that includes most of our most recent wars and those we are contemplating today .
The relationship between fossil fuels and Afghanistan has been written about extensively , just not that much by me .
Afghanistan , a landlocked country , has essentially negligible petrochemical resources , but there are vast oil and natural gas fields in Central Asia to the north , notably in Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan , and Azerbaijan .
Getting those fuels to American , Western European , and even Asian markets requires vast pipelines .
The Russians have some infrastructure in place that gets natural gas in particular to Western Europe via pipelines in Ukraine  through which Russia occasionally holds Europe hostage , just to remind us that it can and to keep Ukraine , Georgia , et al. from getting too frisky .
That situation alone is enough for various people to think about alternate pipeline routes from the Caspian basin , but all have potential problems .
You could run one through Iran , but Iran has n’t exactly been buddy - buddy with the United States and some European countries lately .
A more northerly route to the West , across the Black Sea and possibly terminating in Turkey , is in development , but it involves 12 different countries , not all of which are models of stability .
That leaves Afghanistan as a likely possibility .
In 1996 the Central Asian Gas Pipeline Inc. was formed as a consortium led by Unocal and Saudi Arabia to build a 900 - mile , $ 2 billion pipeline to transport natural gas from Turkmenistan across Afghanistan to Pakistan ’s natural gas grid , connecting in Quetta .
Unocal had also considered a 1,000 - mile , million - barrel - per - day oil pipeline to transit Afghanistan and end at a Pakistani Arabian Sea port .
Unocal and the consortium actually negotiated with the Taliban , which ruled Afghanistan in the late 1990s , over routes , concessionary payments , and the like .
But the oil people were concerned about ongoing civil conflict in Afghanistan .
Even if 9/11 had not happened , it is doubtful whether the pipeline would ever have been built .
I know I ’m simplifying , but I hope I ’m not exaggerating or caricaturing too much when I suggest that the usual " it ’s all about oil " argument goes something like this .
To get that pipeline built , it was / is necessary to invade , quash the unfriendly / uncooperative elements , and install a puppet government willing to do the bidding of the international oil consortium and facilitate building the pipeline and protecting it from saboteurs and other unpleasant types .
To which I can only say , both with regard to the Afghan pipeline and the oil industry in general in Iraq , eight years on : " How ’s that working out ? "
David Kilcullen , an Australian counterinsurgency guru who is said to have briefed both Barack Obama and John McCain during the campaign last year and is considered one of the strategists behind the " surge " in Iraq , has recently published a book , The Accidental Guerrilla , that explains some of the reasons the U.S. " should avoid such interventions wherever possible , simply because the costs are so high and the benefits so doubtful . "
Among the many problems is that U.S. intervention provokes a backlash that leads many who would never have considered doing so otherwise to become " accidental guerrillas . "
The process begins with " infection " as al - Qaeda establishes a presence , followed by " contagion , " followed by U.S. intervention , which leads to rejection of the occupiers by local populations that prior to intervention had been neutral or even favorably inclined toward the U.S .
Thus U.S. intervention , far from creating stability in which a puppet government can placidly do Unocal ’s bidding , is more likely to increase instability and spark more violent insurgent activity .
So if the oil companies are rational , the last thing they would want would be aggressive U.S. intervention into oil - sensitive regions .
One should never underestimate the capacity of people to undertake irrational projects that reduce rather than increase their chances of success , so there may be some oil industry people who still think that heavy U.S. military and foreign - aid intervention into and management of resource - rich regions is just the ticket .
It may be that Dick Cheney thought he was doing his buddies in the oil industry a favor with the invasion of Iraq , but such thinking is shortsighted and ultimately incorrect .
David Henderson , who teaches economics at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey ( and of course writes for Antiwar.com ) has done the most extensive research and writing that points to the idea that U.S. military intervention into oil - producing regions is not only not necessary , it is counterproductive in terms of acquiring " cheap oil . "
When you factor in even some of the costs of military deployment , not just in terms of peoples ’ lives but taxpayer dollars , the oil is not cheap at all .
And it ’s utterly unnecessary .
Oil - rich regions may have unpleasant regimes  indeed there are factors in a single - resource economy that make it likely  but at the end of the day they have more reason to sell the oil than customers have to buy it from them ( considering that no one country has a monopoly on petroleum , even with OPEC ) .
So the best strategy for acquiring ( relatively ) cheap oil is commercial negotiation rather than military intervention , which not only raises the effective price but spreads anti-Americanism and makes the world a more dangerous place for Americans traveling or doing business abroad .
Now I would n’t mind at all if pipelines were built across Afghanistan .
I do n’t think either pipelines or the oil industry itself are inherently evil , and I believe economically viable " green " energy is at least decades away .
Without U.S. intervention and attempted dominance , there might be enough civil unrest and disquiet to make pipelines transiting the country such a risky proposition that they would not get done , though spreading bribes around among the tribes whose territory would be affected might well ease the way .
Even if some oil executives might think otherwise , however , using U.S. military force to try to stabilize Afghanistan enough to allow pipelines to be built and protected is a fool ’s errand .
It might be an effective antiwar propaganda trope to argue that no U.S. military personnel should be put in harm ’s way to benefit arrogant multinational oil companies , which is certainly true .
If the oil companies think such intervention will clear the way for them , however , I think they are profoundly mistaken .
The issues I discussed last week and in previous columns also militate against U.S. escalation in Afghanistan .
So whether one ’s concern is facilitating transportation and distribution of oil or natural gas or keeping al - Qaeda isolated and unable to carry out attacks  and even whether either or both of those issues are phony ones the behind - the - scenes war whoopers want us poor rubes to focus on  escalating U.S. military intervention in south Asia is a bad idea , and reducing it would be far more constructive .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A key Democrat who reportedly was overheard on a National Security Agency wiretap discussing a deal with a suspected Israeli agent has called the wiretap an " abuse of power . "
Rep. Jane Harman called on the Obama administration to release transcripts of the alleged conversations .
Rep. Jane Harman , D - California , called on the Obama administration to release transcripts of the alleged conversations to her , saying she would make them public .
" I never had any idea that my government was wiretapping me at all , " Harman said on CNN's " The Situation Room . "
" Three anonymous sources have told various media that this happened .
And they are quoting snippets of allegedly taped conversations .
So I do n't know what these snippets mean .
I do n't know whether these intercepts were legal .
And that 's why I asked [ Attorney General ] Eric Holder to put it all out there in public . "
Harman denied any wrongdoing and said she was outraged by news the National Security Agency had intercepted one of her conversations in 2005 or 2006 .
" Many members of Congress talk to advocacy groups , " she said .
" My phone is ringing off the hook from worried members who think it could have happened to them .
I think this is an abuse of power . "
Allegations that Harman had made an inappropriate deal with a lobbyist for the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee , or AIPAC , first surfaced several years ago , but they were given fresh currency Sunday night when the Congressional Quarterly published new details on its Web site .
Sources told CNN this week the National Security Agency intercepted a conversation that Harman was participating in , but said Harman was not the intended target of the wiretap .
The wiretap was lawful , the sources said .
CQ.com reported Harman was overheard on a National Security Agency wiretap telling a suspected Israeli agent she would lobby the Justice Department to reduce espionage - related charges against two AIPAC officials .
In exchange for Harman 's help , CQ.com reported , the suspected Israeli agent pledged to help lobby then - House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to appoint Harman chair of the Intelligence Committee after the 2006 elections .
According to one unnamed official cited by CQ.com , Harman hung up after saying , " This conversation does n't exist . "
On CNN , Harman said that alleged " conversation does n't exist . "
Pelosi has denied any lobbying for Harman took place .
Harman did not get the committee chairmanship , and the trial of the AIPAC officials is to begin within weeks .
Harman denied that she attempted to enlist the aid of the pro-Israeli group .
" I do n't need to persuade members of the American - Israeli Political Action Committee that I am a friend of theirs , " she told CNN .
" Why would I do some kind of deal ?
And anyway , let 's have the transcripts out .
Let 's see what I said and to whom . "
CQ.com also reported that after the intercept , the FBI tried to open an investigation of Harman , but then - Attorney General Alberto Gonzales pulled the plug because he wanted Harman 's help defending the controversial domestic warrantless wiretapping program , which she supported .
Gonzales had no comment .
Harman told CNN the allegations that she behaved improperly were " old " and stale " and had been leaked before and discredited .
" I , frankly , think my name is clear , " she said .
" My conscience is certainly clear .
And I think the question is about ... did our government abuse the rights of American citizens , including members of Congress , with legal or illegal wiretappings about things that were not appropriate and then selective leaking of the product of those wiretaps . "
The Department of Justice did not respond to questions Monday about the allegations in the CQ.com article .
On Tuesday , a Justice spokesman said the department is reviewing her letter and will have no further comment at this time .
On Tuesday , after The New York Times also published a front - page article about the wiretaps , similarly quoting unnamed sources , Harman wrote to Holder .
Watch Harman 's interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer »
" I am outraged to learn from reports leaked to the media over the last several days that the FBI or NSA secretly wiretapped my conversations in 2005 or 2006 while I was ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee , " she wrote .
" This abuse of power is outrageous and I call on your department to release all transcripts and other investigative material involving me in an unredacted form .
It is my intention to make this material available to the public , " she wrote .
Harman defended her conversations with advocacy groups , calling them " entirely appropriate , " but said she never contacted anyone to seek favorable treatment regarding national security cases .
According to the Congressional Quarterly article , the suspected Israeli agent was seeking Harman 's help in persuading the Justice Department not to prosecute two AIPAC officials -- Steve Rosen and Keith Weissman -- on espionage charges for allegedly giving classified Pentagon documents to Israeli officials .
Rosen and Weissman are scheduled to stand trial in June .
The Harman wiretap story is taking place as prosecutors in that case continue an unrelated discussion regarding whether to proceed with the case and , if so , how to do it .
An adverse Circuit Court ruling in February prompted the review by prosecutors , who are concerned about the amount of classified information they would be required to share .
All About Jane Harman • Alberto Gonzales • National Security Agency • Espionage and Intelligence
Columbia University is still dealing with the controversy surrounding a protest that happened last fall , when College Republicans invited representatives of the Minutemen to speak on illegal immigration .
Instead of engaging in discussion , a mob of students physically drove away an anti-open - borders speaker .
In other words , the cliché holds true : Students who deviate from the politically correct norm do n't fare well in many New York area colleges .
In 1996 , I learned this the hard way .
I had attended a Christian college in Tennessee , David Lipscomb University .
Lipscomb imposed curfews ; mandatory courses on the texts of the early Church and a dress code that drew a line just above the knee .
Bible classes and dress codes .
If a student missed chapel , the dean of students took away scholarships and suspended privileges , which meant , effectively , that you were grounded to your dormitory .
The theology demanded that women not lead prayer , or even speak in chapel , let alone become ministers or preachers .
Since I was a firm believer in economic equality for women , I wanted to be at a university where I could explore such subjects with an open mind .
When my boyfriend proposed , I said that I would marry him  and that I hoped we would move somewhere quite different from Nashville .
We were soon on our way to New York  and , we thought , a new , broader , intellectual life .
But my new college , New York University , was n't exactly open - minded .
My classmates were the first critics .
They saw me as an exotic species : a Southerner who had yet to enjoy the benefits of women 's liberation .
Their suspicions were directed toward my husband :
Does he make you wash dishes ?
Yes .
Did you take his last name ?
Yes .
Over the course of several weeks and months , they explained that I had been victimized by the patriarchy , that I was a heterosexist , and probably a little racist to boot .
Mostly , though , they represented that I was imprisoned in a birdcage of missed opportunities .
I might not realize this , but this was because I had never known freedom .
Nearly all these advisers were females , mostly from the New York area , but there was one male .
I thought things might get better , but they got worse .
Everything about me was unacceptable .
My Christianity was offensive because of its assertion that God is male .
My highlighted hair was just another indication of my subservience to men .
I thought we could bond over the " economic gap , " but then I realized this supposed economic disparity between the genders did n't take into account men's frequency of higher paying , more dangerous jobs like construction and roofing .
Nor did arguments attacking the wage gap take into account the length of time in the workplace , experience , or age .
Everyone was so upset about many women staying home with children which necessarily produces income disparity .
I planned to stay home with my future kids .
I was a philosophy major and made the perhaps questionable decision to sign up for a class in my major called " The Philosophy of Sex . "
There life was especially hard .
It was hard for me to conjure the righteous indignation required to pass muster .
One particularly disturbing day , my professor said , " All of you who are victims of rape or attempted rape raise your hands . "
As more than half the class raised their hands , I began to think weird thoughts .
I wondered if my college required a solid SAT score and emergency room records for admission .
It took me weeks to realize their definition of rape was not exactly Webster's .
We began to study Andrea Dworkin who said , " Romance is rape embellished with meaningful looks . "
And Catherine MacKinnon who said , " Politically , I call it rape whenever a woman has sex and feels violated . "
And Marilyn French , who famously said , " All men are rapists and that 's all they are . "
You can imagine my disillusionment to learn Mister Rogers of " Mister Rogers ' Neighborhood , " and Mahatma Gandhi were predators .
None of this was ever challenged by my classmates , who grew impatient at my perpetual confusion .
Once , when I said I was against abortion , several students wept before storming out of the class .
The rest accused me of being a " cafeteria - style " feminist , a traitor to my gender .
In other words , my college was not the place to " explore feminism , " but was rather a " feminism bootcamp " and unbelievers were not tolerated .
What I kept wondering was : who were these people ?
Only in college can a woman with a Gramercy apartment , private education , and a large Bloomingdale 's account be described as a member of an oppressed class .
My fellow classmates and I had more freedom , more opportunities , and more equality than any other women who 've lived on this planet .
And I grew tired of being told otherwise , tired of the unwillingness of the professors and students to engage in true debate about the tenets of their belief systems .
I found myself practicing my religion more seriously than before .
Eventually , I wrote a book about the whole thing .
I 'm hoping that NYU is better these days .
But colleges generally are not .
Every week I read stories like mine of another university .
The Columbia case is just the latest example of this secular fundamentalism and intolerance .
There is still hostility to true free speech .
To put it bluntly , the highly touted diversity of these colleges is superficial .
Some students wear dreadlocks , some have red hair , and some are Chinese , but students are " encouraged " to think identically .
The only surprising aspect of all this is that there are some students who do not know it yet .
It is the ultimate hunter 's prize .
From the timid deer to the rampant tiger : the whiter the animal , the bigger the bounty on its head .
As deer stalkers take to the British countryside this week for the British roebuck shooting season , one young deer will be a more vulnerable position than its peers .
An extraordinarily rare , white deer has had a four - figure bounty put on its head as hunters clamour to be the first to kill the animal .
The white roe , nicknamed Pearl by animal rights protesters , was initially spotted in December in Dumfries , in the Scottish lowlands .
It is one of about a dozen found since the Second World War , according to experts .
The animal is usually brown coated and one of the most common species in the UK , with an estimated 800,000 living up and down the British Isles .
Initially it was thought the deer was suffering from albinism , but experts now believe a rare genetic mutation resulting in a condition called leucism has changed the deer 's pigmentation .

Now hunters are keen to stalk the animal and be the first to kill it .
One German stalker has reputedly offered more than £ 5,400 for the deer .
" Selling the opportunity to shoot this deer is a very good money earner , " said Charlie Jacoby , editor of Sporting Rifle magazine , which is to publish a diary chronicling the animal 's life , and death .
" American and German hunters like deer and once this deer has its antlers , it will be even more attractive to them for stalking . "
But Kevin Stuart , who owns the stalking rights to the 3,000 acres of land , this weekend vowed to protect the animal .
Mr Stuart last saw the creature about 10 days ago , but is reluctant to get close to it as it may alert people to its whereabouts .
" As long as the deer stays within the confines of the estate it will be fine .
But it is a wild animal and will go wherever it wants to go .
At the moment it is a yearling and does n't even have antlers .
It is a beautiful animal and we are worried about poachers and people coming to shoot it . "
The Scottish MSP Elaine Murray has put forward a motion in Parliament to have the animal protected .
" We are also looking to whether protection could apply to an animal which is genetically rare from a species itself that is n't particularly rare , " she said .
The white deer is just one example of many white or albino animals that have attracted the attention of hunters , illegal animal traders and the plain curious .
An albino corn snake can fetch about $ 500 ( £ 350 ) .
Albino alligators are also prized possessions .
Last year , seven rare albino alligators were stolen from a zoo in Brazil .
They were said to be worth $ 10,000 each .
White tigers have been hunted to such a degree that they are effectively extinct in the wild .
Inbreeding in captivity has led to an abundance in zoos .
Assuming they could get at them , hunters are reportedly willing to pay as much as $ 60,000 for a chance to shoot one of the animals , 10 times the bounty for a normal tiger .
Alistair Currie , senior researcher at the animal charity Peta , said : " It is an incredibly Victorian attitude that if something is unusual your response is to kill it .
You would hope that if people take the view that if something is unusual , they would want to preserve it and that it should be valued . "

Over the last week , the corporate media has subjected us to an incessant propaganda salvo directed against the Oxycotton - addled talk radio host Rush Limbaugh .
Obviously , Limbaugh is an easy target , especially for Democrats brainwashed by the false left - right paradigm .
However , the point of the orchestrated attack against Limbaugh is not the alleged unfairness of “ conservative ” talk radio or even Limbaugh ’s rhetoric critical of Barack Obama , but rather it is a coordinated attack designed to set the stage for the “ regulation ” of free speech .
House Conference Chairman Mike Pence , who is a former radio broadcaster , believes the Durbin amendment is a Trojan horse designed to restore the Fairness Doctrine .
“ Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) told CNSNews.com on Thursday that she supports an amendment to a Senate bill that would force the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) to ‘ take actions to encourage and promote diversity in communication media ownership and to ensure that broadcast station licenses are used in the public interest . ' ”
On Thursday , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told CNSNews she supports an amendment to a Senate bill that would force the Federal Communications Commission to “ take actions to encourage and promote diversity in communication media ownership and to ensure that broadcast station licenses are used in the public interest . ”
House Conference Chairman Mike Pence , who is a former radio broadcaster , told CNSNews the amendment is a Trojan horse designed to restore the Fairness Doctrine , an FCC regulation dumped in 1987 that forced broadcasters to grant equal time to opposing points of view .
“ Its clear to me that Democrats , having failed in their frontal assault on talk radio in America through the Fairness Doctrine , are now shifting strategy to a form of regulation that is essentially the Fairness Doctrine by stealth , ” said Pence .
The Senate amendment was attached to a bill granting Washington , D.C. , a vote in the House of Representatives by Senate Assistant Majority Leader Dick Durbin .
It was passed last Thursday in a vote along party lines .
“ I support Mr. Durbin in most things , ” averred Pelosi .
“ Diversity in media ownership is very , very , important . ”
In response to the attachment of the “ Durbin amendment , ” Sen . Jim DeMint inserted an amendment banning the Fairness Doctrine to the same bill .
It passed by a vote of 87 - 11 and will go to the House .
Minority Leader John Boehner said he believes Republicans may be able to raise the votes to stop it .
[ efoods ]
Not surprisingly , the so - called Durbin amendment is nearly identical to a policy position put out by Obama ’s White House , which reads : “ Encourage Diversity in Media Ownership : Encourage diversity in the ownership of broadcast media , promote the development of new media outlets for expression of diverse viewpoints , and clarify the public interest obligations of broadcasters who occupy the nation ’s spectrum . ”
Obama ’s policy position reflects that of his transition leader John Podesta .
Podesta ’s Center for American Progress , described as a “ liberal think - tank , ” released a policy paper in 2007 entitled The Structural Imbalance of Political Talk Radio .
“ Thanks in part to funding from benefactors such as billionaire George Soros , the Center for American Progress has become in just five years an intellectual wellspring for Democratic policy proposals , including many that are shaping the agenda of the new Obama administration , ” writes Edwin Chen for Bloomberg .
Apparently , Obama and his adopted “ progressive ” policy proposals are at odds with the First Amendment .
Of course , Rush Limbaugh ’s EIB , Clear Channel , and Fox News will either pay to play or will hire a handful of token “ progressives ” in order to get around the new Fairness Doctrine , that is if it becomes law and the Supreme Court allows it to stand .
If the bill becomes law and stands , it will be the small guys forced out of business , not the large communications and entertainment corporations .
But then it is the small guys posing a real threat to the establishment , not Sean Hannity , Rush Limbaugh , or Michael “ Savage ” Weiner , who represent the fake opposition .

A law protecting all of our citizens against senseless hate violence is long overdue .
Two years ago , radical right - wing groups and George W. Bush 's veto threat blocked the Matthew Shepard Act , which would outlaw hate crimes based on both sexual orientation and gender identity .
But now the bill is back .
The house is set to vote on the bill TODAY , please contact your representatives now , and urge your friends and family to follow suit .
First came the employees , shortchanged two months ’ pay and laid off by the supermarket called God ’s Blessing .
They rifled through their shuttered workplace , helping themselves to crates full of groceries .
As word spread through the small town , the store ’s jilted creditors joined in .
They dismantled the light fixtures , ripped out wiring and absconded with the cash registers , even as television cameras rolled .
Within hours the parking lot was jammed with ordinary shoppers .
They left car engines running and brought their children to help pick the shelves clean .
Finally even the shelves were hauled away , leaving latecomers to scrounge the floor for leftover fruit .
The two - day spree shocked and puzzled Israelis , who assume that the rule of law prevails in their society .
Yet this and other recent cases of looting have coincided with news that the economy , flattened late last year after half a decade of enviable growth , had slid into recession .
Advertisement
The outbreaks are isolated and few , but labor activists and social commentators warn that many Israelis are becoming desperate .
“ What we ’re seeing are small stories about collapsing businesses and layoffs that threaten their livelihoods , ” said Dafna Cohen , a spokeswoman for the Histadrut , Israel ’s trade union federation .
“ These small stories are the beginning of a big fire . ”
For months , the spreading hardship has been obscured as Israel ’s political discourse focused on regional security threats and the fight with Hamas in the Gaza Strip .
But aides to Prime Minister - designate Benjamin Netanyahu say the economy will top his agenda after he takes office in the coming weeks .
The economy is expected to shrink 1.5 % this year , according to the Bank of Israel , compared with growth rates of 4 % or more in the previous five years .
The global downturn is taking its toll ; the bank forecasts an 11 % decline in Israeli exports , which account for half the value of everything the country produces .

But as the crisis moves from one workplace to another , Israelis are blaming other Israelis : the tycoons who gambled in overseas real estate and lost , bringing down Israel ’s financial markets ; the bankers who tightened credit ; the entrepreneurs who faltered under impossible debt burdens and started bouncing checks .
The anarchy at the supermarket is one of three well - publicized cases of looting that erupted after beleaguered owners or managers defaulted on debts to suppliers , stopped paying workers and went into hiding .
Victims intent on payback have taken matters into their own hands .
Nearly 200 workers locked themselves inside the Chicken of the Valley processing plant in Ramat Yishai last week after the principal owner vanished , having failed to pay their February wages .

To cut their losses , they raided the freezer and sold about 100 chickens to motorists in the streets of Haifa , a nearby city .
Holding up protest signs along with red plastic packages of frozen fowl , they turned the looting into a televised rally against the remaining shareholders ’ threat to close the plant .
“ It ’s a symbolic act , ” said Moti Saar , the plant ’s union representative , who has joined a round - the - clock encampment of protesters inside the workplace .
Selling pilfered chickens “ wo n’t cover our lost wages , ” he added , “ but it says something : ‘ People want to work . ’ ”
Like the supermarket , the chicken plant is in the Galilee , a northern region with higher unemployment and lower public investment than Tel Aviv and other wealthier areas in the center of Israel .
Many in the Galilee feel neglected and angry that policy discussions are mainly about bailing out tycoons who lost other people ’s money .
Advertisement
“ There is n’t much talk about saving people who do an honest day ’s work , earn the minimum wage and do n’t have much bargaining power , ” said Barbara Swirsky , executive director of the Adva Center , a think tank specializing in economic and social issues .
Tel Aviv has its own tale of pain and retribution .
The Pine Garden banquet hall and its artificial lawn once hosted the weddings , bar mitzvahs and corporate dinners of the city ’s elite .
The business collapsed in January as wealthy Israelis began to feel the recession and thinned out winter social calendars .
The owner fled the country , reportedly leaving debts of nearly $ 20 million to banks , suppliers and families that had plunked down advances as high as $ 30,000 for their celebrations .
Advertisement
A few days later , angry suppliers and clients converged on the hall in the Tel Aviv Fairgrounds , police said , and carried away ovens , dishwashers , tables , chairs , light fixtures and other equipment .
A reporter for the newspaper Haaretz was interviewing a heartbroken bride - to - be when her father , cheated out of the deposit on her wedding , emerged from the hall with a plastic crate full of square porcelain dishes .
“ Hey , these are good for sushi , ” the young woman said .
Israelis are conflicted by the looting .
While sympathetic with almost any victim of the recession , they ’re embarrassed by the looters -- but not so outraged as to want them punished or disgraced .

“ What we saw in these pictures is the breakdown of the barrier of shame . . . when people do this in the middle of town in broad daylight , ” said Channel 10 news anchor Ilan Goren as he narrated footage of the free - for - all at God ’s Blessing supermarket .
The faces of the looters had been blurred by editors so as not to cause them “ humiliation or degradation , ” a Channel 10 spokeswoman said .
The big - box store served Hatzor Haglilit , a Galilee town of 10,000 people .
It catered to low - income ultra-Orthodox families by selling at razor - thin profit margins and , with many products , at a loss .
The losses led to bounced checks and eventually bankruptcy .
When the manager disappeared early this month , his deputies closed the store and told employees to take goods from the shelves equal in value to their unpaid wages .
The gesture backfired : Employees grabbed more than their due , and the commotion drew in creditors , other residents and even poor Bedouins from a nearby town .
Advertisement
Orthodox Jews left in charge of the store asked the police not to intervene .
“ That would contradict their faith , ” said Moni Azura , an attorney representing the town ’s ultra-Orthodox community .
“ They believe the people of Israel are in distress . ”
Mayor Shimon Suissa complained in an interview that the looting was “ blown out of proportion . ”
But he acknowledged that anxiety had come to a boil , stoked by financial troubles of a canning factory that is the town ’s biggest employer .
“ Had the supermarket manager come forth and explained the situation , perhaps some settlements would have been negotiated and the whole incident avoided , ” the mayor said .
“ Instead , he chose to go underground , which caused even more panic .
“ A lot of pressures converged and erupted in that one incident , which I condemn .
But it does not reflect the character of our community . ”

Batsheva Sobelman of The Times ’ Jerusalem Bureau contributed to this report .
The economic stimulus package signed into law by President Obama includes tax credits for solar and high efficiency hot water heaters .
The law revived and expanded tax credits for energy - efficient home improvements that expired in 2007 , like hot water heaters .
Â
Home improvements must be made to primary residences beginning in 2009 to qualify .
If you plan to install a new solar hot water heater for your home , you will be eligible for a tax credit of up to 30 % of the cost with no caps on the total amount .
Â
Previous legislation set caps between $ 2000 and $ 4000 dollars for solar water heaters , geothermal heat pumps and wind energy projects .
Â
Both labor and material costs qualify for the tax credit through 2016 , but the solar hot water heater must be used for you home ( not your swimming pool or hot tub ) .
Photo by thingermejig
High efficiency hot water heaters , such as tankless varieties , are also eligible for tax credits under the stimulus package , but there is a cap .
Â
Up to a $ 1500 tax credit is available for gas or electric water heaters that have at least a .82 Energy Factor ( EF ) rating or 90 percent thermal efficiency .
Â
The amount of the tax credit is dependent upon other energy efficient home improvements you are claiming on your taxes .
The difference between solar and high efficient hot water heater tax credits ( cap vs. no cap ) shows the priority of the Obama administration to help Americans use renewable energy .
Â All Energy Star solar hot water heaters qualify for the tax credit .
We ’ll be installing a solar hot water heater this summer for our home to work in tandem with our tankless heater .

Since the proliferation of the Internet , instant messaging ( IMing from here on in ) has become a very popular means of communicating on the Web .
Even with the rapid growth of Twitter , many people still communicate using IM .
Now , there is no shortage of IM protocols out there ; these include ICQ , AIM , GTalk , Yahoo , and Facebook , to name a few .
IM aggregators aim to solve the mess of having all these programs open at once .
Here is where it gets complicated .
Depending on whether you 're on the web , Windows , Mac , or a mobile device , there are a number of aggregators from which to choose .
To help you figure things out , here are five great instant messenger aggregators for multiple platforms .
Have another aggregator you 'd add to this list ?
Tell us about it in the comments .
1. Windows
When it comes to IMing in Windows , the possibilities are endless .
With all the available options , there is one program that just offers more than the rest : Digsby .
Digsby offers users a wide variety of protocols that include AIM , MSN , Yahoo , GTalk , Jabber , and Facebook chat .
However , the innovative genius of Digsby does not stop there .
Digsby recently included Twitter , LinkedIn , Facebook , and MySpace feeds in the client as well .
As if that was n't enough to make it the ultimate application , you can get your multiple email accounts , including Hotmail , Gmail , Yahoo Mail , AOL / AIM Mail , IMAP , and POP in there too .
This all may sound a little overwhelming and complicated , but it 's not ; Digsby could not be more user - friendly .
You have an icon in your taskbar for whatever network / IM / email account you configure , and you receive popup notifications for that account according to a predefined user preference .
It 's as simple as that .
Benefits :
The popup notifications are a snapshot of your email , tweet , or IM , and you can respond from within the popup , as opposed to opening the entire application window .
Additionally , there are IM aliases , tabbed IMing , the ability to send SMS messages directly from the IM window , and much more .
So , what are the downsides ?
Well , I can only think of one ; no Mac version .
The service is planning a Mac version , but there is no ETA on its release .
A good alternative to Digsby is : Pidgin , which supports AIM , Bonjour , Gadu - Gadu , GTalk , Groupwise , ICQ , IRC , MSN , MySpaceIM , QQ , SILC , SIMPLE , Sametime , XMPP , Yahoo , Zephy .
Pidgin also has a Linux version .
2. Mac
Adium does a good job of giving you all your buddy lists in a nice and simple interface .
The networks it supports include AIM , MSN , Yahoo , GTalk , ICQ , Jabber , MobileMe , Bonjour , MySpace IM , Facebook chat , Lotus Sametime , Novell Groupwise , QQ , and Gadu - Gadu .
So , unless you are on some really small and unheard of network , Adium pretty much has you covered .
Aspects that could use tweaking : Adium could be a lot more user - friendly .
There are endless preferences in the Adium menu and you can fully customize its look , yet somehow , the most basic options , like viewing all your contacts in separate lists by protocol , are difficult to find .
All in all , unless you are a details junkie like me , Adium will serve you loyally .
A good alternative to Adium is : iChat , the built - in Mac OS client , which supports .
Mac , AIM , Jabber , and GTalk .
3. Web
When it comes to IM on the Web , the concept is to be able to communicate with your various lists without the need to do any downloading .
This is a great choice for those who are unable to download an aggregator at their workplace .
When it comes to Web - based IM , Meebo is a simple , straightforward , and useful tool .
The site offers you the ability to sign into your AIM , MSN , GTalk , ICQ , Yahoo , Facebook Chat , MySpace , Jabber , and Flixter accounts , without the need to download any software .
You can log into each of these individually , or sign up for Meebo and log in to all automatically .
Benefits :
It is a fairly simple design , that I am pretty sure anyone , no matter how computer illiterate , could use comfortably .
A good alternative to Meebo is : radiusIM , which supports AIM , MSN , Yahoo , and GTalk .
4. Mobile
With all the highly advanced mobile devices being announced daily , there are still many users who have relatively older cell phones .
There is no reason these users should n't have the capability to IM from their devices .
Trutap is a powerful IM client that supports even the old J2ME phone infrastructure and enables users with older phones to access their IM accounts .
It 's a feature - packed , simple to use , pleasant on the eyes IM client for your phone .
It supports multiple IM protocols , social networks , and blogging networks , such as Yahoo , MSN , GTalk , Facebook chat , Flickr , ICQ , Photobucket , Rediff Bol , Friendster , and Blogger .
Benefits : Trutap has a great design .
Each list is separated with the ability to collapse or expand it .
Then you have the ability to move to another tab , which has all your open conversations in a very simple to use window .
All the standard IM options are available to you on your phone .
You can add or remove a contact , edit a contact 's details , as well as set your status .
All in all , another product that proves to me that less is often more .
A good alternative to Trutap is : Ebuddy , which supports MSN , Yahoo ! , AIM , Gtalk , ICQ and Facebook .
Ebuddy also has a web - based IM aggregator similar to Meebo and radiusIM .
5. iPhone
There are so many IM apps available for the iPhone , although there is one that really stands out from the rest , in my mind .
Nimbuzz is an industry leading IM and VOIP app for mobile in general , and iPhone specifically .
Nimbuzz offers a very wide variety of networks .
The iPhone Nimbuzz client supports Skype , Yahoo !
IM , AIM , GTalk , MSN , ICQ , Jabber , Facebook , MySpace , StudiVZ , Gadu Gadu , and Hyves .
It has a very simplistic interface that is pure fun to use .
Nimbuzz also offers a wide landscape keyboard for the iPhone , making the IMing experience so much more enjoyable .
Benefits :
The interface has 5 tabs : Contacts , Chats , Communities , Messages , and Settings .
Could it be any more straightforward ?
Another thing that 's great about Nimbuzz is their will to stay above their competition .
They are always improving their software , which is why they have accomplished so much as a company .
Nimbuzz recently signed a deal with Toshiba to have their software preinstalled on all of Toshiba 's new TG01 devices , which is the company 's flagship handset .
A good alternative to Nimbuzz is : Fring , which supports Skype , MSN , Facebook , Gmail , GTalk , ICQ , SIP , Last.fm , Twitter , Yahoo , and AIM .
What 's your IM aggregator of choice ?
It does not matter if you are a " Mac or PC , " iPhone user or Symbian fan , you should have no problem combining your various IM networks into one user - friendly and feature - rich IM aggregator .
Tell us about your IM aggregator of choice and why it 's your favorite .

A New Place for Solar Energy : Highway Right of Way
December 29th , 2008 by William Ellard
Editor ’s Note :
This is a guest post from William Ellard , an economist specializing in energy and renewable energy markets .
He is currently working with national solar energy firms to bring distributed solar power to municipalities in the American Southwest .
During a recent work meeting with the Western Renewable Energy Zones Initiative , it became clear that the recent push for renewable energy in the western US has major wildlife and environmental implications .
As an alternative energy economist , my contribution in the meeting was to present some of the new solar energy technologies and explain how distributed solar could be deployed without disturbing wildlife ecosystems .
The main issues for public land managers and wildlife stakeholders are the new roads and infrastructure placed on previously undisturbed public lands .
The western US has huge potential for renewables such as solar , wind , and geothermal . , but the rush to build these renewable power systems on public lands could adversely effect wildlife corridors and ecosystems .
These issues have me thinking more about the economic and environmental benefits of the distributed nature of solar technology .
Wind and geothermal power only work in particular areas of the US — in most cases far away from the end electric user .
Also , wind and geothermal resources are mainly on public lands .
Solar , on the other hand , can work anywhere .
Some solar application work best in high , hot , light areas like the desert Southwest , whereas other solar applications work best in cooler , diffused light areas of the country .
I ’ve started to think about all the land masses in the US that are already disturbed or used , and could be levered as solar energy resources .
Commercial Rooftops
New solar firms like Solyndra produce thin film solar technology especially for commercial rooftops .
If we installed solar systems on these rooftops we could supply the US with 150 gigawatts of electricity .
Solyndra has entered into a contract with ENERGY STAR® - certified cool roof systems from Carlisle Construction Materials .
This combination of the reflective roofing membrane with Solyndra ’s solar systems increases the output of the Solyndra PV system up to 20 % .
The above estimate of 25 % of the US electric grid is based on the approximate efficiency ratio of 15 % for Solyndra ’s PV system .
These solar thin film technologies are still in the early stages of development , so over time we should see significant improvements in efficiency and cost .
Solar thin film firms can already produce solar energy at grid parity .
These cost breakthroughs in solar have been achieved by focusing on the cost side , not the efficiency side .
New thin film solar technologies are less than half as efficient as silicon based solar cells , but can cost 80 - 90 % less to produce .
My article on solar economics describes in more detail the different solar technologies and the economic considerations .
So with commercial rooftops , the US could replace more than 25 % of the grid .
What about other brownfield land solar development ?
While driving many hours across the desert southwest on interstate I - 15 , it hit me .
Highway right of way solar – ROW solar
On both sides of I - 15 all one can see is scrub , weeds , debris , and power lines .
Highway departments must keep their right of way clear of invasive weeds such as Russian thistle ( tumbleweed ) , cheat grass , etc .
Mowing or pesticide spaying operations are the most common methods .
Instead of spending all those tax payer dollars trying to control photosynthesis , why do n’t we use photosynthesis to create electricity along these highways ?
By designing the proper alignment of solar systems along highways , land managers could also funnel wildlife away from dangerous highway crossings and into safe wildlife corridors .
In the desert Southwest , miles of small fences are built along highways to protect the desert tortoise from getting killed by cars .
Larger structural solar systems could also protect larger animals such as cattle , deer , and antelope .
These larger animals also cause many serious accidents and human deaths on our highways .
How much acreage are we talking about ?
The first estimate to consider is the amount of land that highway departments currently manage .
This is a small subset of all right of way highway acreage .
Road Ecology : Science and Solutions written by Richard T. Forman in 2002 is a good source of information on managed right of way land along our nations highways .
Forman ’s book states that California manages 230,000 acres of right of way on 15,000 miles of highway — about 15 acres per mile of highway .
In the US we have about 4 million miles of roads , or 60 million acres of right of way to manage .
On many sections of highways in the western US , the highway right of way is contiguous to federal land like the BLM ( Bureau of Land Management ) .
By using a small amount of this BLM land , we could easily double the amount of land available for highway solar energy .
Depending on the particular solar technology , one needs 2 - 4 acres of land to place a 1 megawatt solar power system .
So a conservative estimate for US highway solar would be 20 million megawatts of total capacity .
In 2006 the existing US capacity for electricity was about 1 million megawatts .
For example , in just the disturbed land along our nation highways , we could have almost 20 times more capacity then currently installed .
Here are some energy figures from 2007 :
The U.S. electric power industry ’s total installed generating capacity was 1,089,807 megawatts ( MW ) as of December 31 , 2007 .
Total U.S. electricity generation was 4,159,514 gigawatt - hours ( GWh ) .
The capacity of different power plants will produce different amounts of total electric generation .
A coal or natural gas fired plant can run almost all the time .
A solar power plant may only average 8 hours a day of energy generation .
So the real effective electric generation for the 20 million megawatts of highway solar capacity would be about 7 million megawatts of full generation capacity .
This is 7 times the electricity we currently consume in the US .
In summary , right of way highway solar could be a solution to our nation ’s energy needs and could also reduce costs to manage these right of ways .
Another benefit would be to help wildlife managers create wildlife corridors for both human and wildlife safety .
Let ’s preserve our undisturbed public lands by implementing solar technologies on these existing managed lands .

Did you ever stop to think how silly and also how dangerous it is to live our lives with absolutely no monitoring of our body ’s medical status ?
Years from now people will look back and find it unbelievable that heart attacks , strokes , hormone imbalances , sugar levels , and hundreds of other bodily vital signs and malfunctions were not being continuously anticipated and monitored by medical implants .
We can call this concept body 2.0 , or the networked body , and we need it now !
The trio of biomedicine , technology , and wireless communication are in the midst of a merger that will easily bring continuous , 24×7 monitoring of several crucial bodily functions in the years ahead .
Unfortunately , as is often the case with medical products , the needed innovations are either already developed or will be soon , but some of the best commercial products wo n’t make it to the market until years of testing have proven their safety .
In the future your doctor might call you before you have a heart attack , responding to an alarm sent out by monitoring systems in your body that have detected the precursors to a heart attack hours or days ahead of time .
With body 2.0 , medicine dosages could be tailored precisely to your body chemistry and metabolism .
Real - time monitoring of chemical concentrations in your blood could allow for increasing or decreasing dosages accordingly .
The huge amounts of data that would be accumulated from hundreds of thousands of continuously monitored people would be nothing short of a revolution for medical research and analysis .
This data could be harvested to understand the minute by minute changes in body chemistry that occur in response to medication , stress , infection , and so on .
As an example , the daily fluctuations in hormone levels of hundreds of thousands of individuals could be tracked and charted 24/ 7 to determine a baseline from which abnormalities and patterns could be extracted .
The possibilities are enormous .
Given the advantages , we must wonder why body monitoring is not already more successful and widespread .
The answer is that most of the interesting body monitoring we desire requires direct access to the blood stream and other bodily fluids , and this is not an easy problem to overcome .
A straightforward technique is to prick the skin periodically to extract and analyze blood , yet this only works for periodic monitoring .
It does not provide continuous access to bodily fluids .
Sensors implanted permanently into the blood stream are what is needed , but the difficulty is that moisture , enzymes , and the immune system quickly wreak havoc on mechanical devices and destroy them .
Implants also pose several opportunities for life threatening infection to take hold , and this must be addressed .
The video below opens our eyes to the possibilities :
Although the road to continuous body monitoring poses challenges , these challenges are certainly within our means to overcome , and exciting progress is being made all over the world .
The medical monitoring , device , and implant space is absolutely enormous , so there is no way we can do justice to the myriad of companies and research projects that are out there .
Nevertheless , here are a few of the companies and products that we are aware of :
Proteus Biomedical :
One of the biggest names in the industry is a company we have reported on before , Proteus Biomedical …
Proteus has designed a platform for body monitoring , called Raisin , which measures when and if a patient takes their medication , and also measures how various bodily vital signs , such as heart rate , respond to the medication .
From the Proteus website :
Proteus ingestible event markers ( IEMs ) are tiny , digestible sensors …
Once activated , the IEM sends an ultra low - power , private , digital signal through the body to a microelectronic receiver that is either a small bandage style skin patch or a tiny device insert under the skin .
The receiver date - and time - stamps , decodes , and records information such as the type of drug , the dose , and the place of manufacture , as well as measures and reports physiologic measures such as heart rate , activity , and respiratory rate .
All of the data collected by the Proteus system can be sent wirelessly to the doctor for remote monitoring .
The system is currently in clinical development .
Cardionet :
Next we have , Cardionet , creator of a system that monitors every heartbeat , non-invasively , during the patient ’s normal daily activities , for up to 21 days , and detects , records , and transmits event data automatically to the prescribing physician via wireless phone .
Patients wear three leads attached to a lightweight sensor worn on a neck strap or belt clip that continuously transmit two channels of ECG data to the monitor .
The monitor analyzes the patient ’s ECG in real time , heartbeat by heartbeat .
The Cardionet system has been extremely successful , as evidenced by the recent IPO of the company .
Bodymedia :
Next we have Bodymedia , maker of an arm band , called Sensewear , that enables automated monitoring of calories burned , dietary intake , duration of physical activity and sleep .
A USB port allows the patient to periodically upload data from the armband to a website loaded with charts , graphs , and other data that allows both patient and physician to make informed decisions .
Toumaz :
Finally , we have Toumaz , maker of a wearable body monitor similar to Sensewear , but apparently even more sophisticated and capable .
The Toumaz system , called Sensium , provides ultra low power monitoring of ECG , temperature , blood glucose and oxygen levels .
It can also interface to 3 axis accelerometers , pressure sensors and includes a temperature sensor on chip .
Toumaz offers a product called the Sensium Life Pebble , which streams the data using a wireless datalink over a short range ( ~ 5 m ) to a Sensium USB adapter or data logger .
The Life Pebble is designed for use in a wide range of professional sports monitoring , lifestyle and healthcare applications .
Of course , there are several technologies that we have missed in this small sampling .

Seven pirates opened fire on a German naval ship in the Gulf of Aden but were chased down and captured by an international anti-piracy task force , the US Navy and European officials said on Monday .
In the attack on the German ship , pirates apparently mistook the FGS Spessart vessel for a commercial ship when they opened fire on it on Sunday afternoon , a US Navy spokesman said .

The German sailors returned fire and pursued the skiff while also calling in for support .
Several naval ships — including a Greek and a Dutch frigate , a Spanish warship and the USS Boxer — sped to the area while a Spanish marine aircraft and two US Marine Cobra helicopters joined the pursuit .
Five hours later , Greek sailors reached the pirate skiff , boarded it and seized the seven suspects and their weapons , including assault rifles and rocket - propelled grenades , the Greek navy said .
The suspects were disarmed and transferred for questioning to the German frigate Rheinland - Pfalz .
They were later released .
From natochannel.tv
Germany 's Ministry spokesman Christian Dienst said no one was injured in the attack , the first on a German naval ship in this area .
Christensen said that while the casualty - free operation " showcased the incredible international naval capabilities " it also " highlighted the complexity of counter - piracy operations . "
Apart from the Gulf of Aden , where the international anti-piracy efforts have been increasingly successful , pirates have also stepped up attacks further south off the eastern Somali coast .
The two areas combined equal more than 1.1 million square miles , or roughly four times the size of Texas , said Christensen .
" We can't be everywhere at once , " he said , adding that merchant mariners must often serve as the first line of defense against pirates .
The 20th century is well behind us , but we have not yet learned to live in the 21st , or at least to think in a way that fits it .
That should not be as difficult as it seems , because the basic idea that dominated economics and politics in the last century has patently disappeared down the plughole of history .
This was the way of thinking about modern industrial economies , or for that matter any economies , in terms of two mutually exclusive opposites : capitalism or socialism .
We have lived through two practical attempts to realise these in their pure form : the centrally state - planned economies of the Soviet type and the totally unrestricted and uncontrolled free - market capitalist economy .
The first broke down in the 1980s , and the European communist political systems with it .
The second is breaking down before our eyes in the greatest crisis of global capitalism since the 1930s .
In some ways it is a greater crisis than in the 1930s , because the globalisation of the economy was not then as far advanced as it is today , and the crisis did not affect the planned economy of the Soviet Union .
We do n't yet know how grave and lasting the consequences of the present world crisis will be , but they certainly mark the end of the sort of free - market capitalism that captured the world and its governments in the years since Margaret Thatcher and President Reagan .
Impotence therefore faces both those who believe in what amounts to a pure , stateless , market capitalism , a sort of international bourgeois anarchism , and those who believe in a planned socialism uncontaminated by private profit - seeking .
Both are bankrupt .
The future , like the present and the past , belongs to mixed economies in which public and private are braided together in one way or another .
But how ?
That is the problem for everybody today , but especially for people on the left .
Nobody seriously thinks of returning to the socialist systems of the Soviet type - not only because of their political faults , but also because of the increasing sluggishness and inefficiency of their economies - though this should not lead us to underestimate their impressive social and educational achievements .
On the other hand , until the global free market imploded last year , even the social - democratic or other moderate left parties in the rich countries of northern capitalism and Australasia had committed themselves more and more to the success of free - market capitalism .
Indeed , between the fall of the USSR and now I can think of no such party or leader denouncing capitalism as unacceptable .
None were more committed to it than New Labour .
In their economic policies both Tony Blair and ( until October 2008 ) Gordon Brown could be described without real exaggeration as Thatcher in trousers .
The same is true of the Democratic party in the US .
The basic Labour idea since the 1950s was that socialism was unnecessary , because a capitalist system could be relied on to flourish and to generate more wealth than any other .
All socialists had to do was to ensure its equitable distribution .
But since the 1970s the accelerating surge of globalisation made it more and more difficult and fatally undermined the traditional basis of the Labour party 's , and indeed any social - democratic party 's , support and policies .
Many in the 1980s agreed that if the ship of Labour was not to founder , which was a real possibility at the time , it would have to be refitted .
But it was not refitted .
Under the impact of what it saw as the Thatcherite economic revival , New Labour since 1997 swallowed the ideology , or rather the theology , of global free - market fundamentalism whole .
Britain deregulated its markets , sold its industries to the highest bidder , stopped making things to export ( unlike Germany , France and Switzerland ) and put its money on becoming the global centre of financial services and therefore a paradise for zillionaire money - launderers .
That is why the impact of the world crisis on the pound and the British economy today is likely to be more catastrophic than on any other major western economy - and full recovery may well be harder .
You may say that 's all over now .
We 're free to return to the mixed economy .
The old toolbox of Labour is available again - everything up to nationalisation - so let 's just go and use the tools once again , which Labour should never have put away .
But that suggests we know what to do with them .
We do n't .
For one thing , we do n't know how to overcome the present crisis .
None of the world 's governments , central banks or international financial institutions know : they are all like a blind man trying to get out of a maze by tapping the walls with different kinds of sticks in the hope of finding the way out .
For another , we underestimate how addicted governments and decision - makers still are to the free - market snorts that have made them feel so good for decades .
Have we really got away from the assumption that private profit - making enterprise is always a better , because more efficient , way of doing things ?
That business organisation and accountancy should be the model even for public service , education and research ?
That the growing chasm between the super - rich and the rest does n't matter that much , so long as everybody else ( except the minority of the poor ) is getting a bit better off ?
That what a country needs is under all circumstances maximum economic growth and commercial competitiveness ?
I do n't think so .
But a progressive policy needs more than just a bigger break with the economic and moral assumptions of the past 30 years .
It needs a return to the conviction that economic growth and the affluence it brings is a means and not an end .
The end is what it does to the lives , life - chances and hopes of people .
Look at London .
Of course it matters to all of us that London 's economy flourishes .
But the test of the enormous wealth generated in patches of the capital is not that it contributed 20% - 30 % to Britain 's GDP but how it affects the lives of the millions who live and work there .
What kind of lives are available to them ?
Can they afford to live there ?
If they can't , it is not compensation that London is also a paradise for the ultra-rich .
Can they get decently paid jobs or jobs at all ?
If they can't , do n't brag about all those Michelin - starred restaurants and their self - dramatising chefs .
Or schooling for children ?
Inadequate schools are not offset by the fact that London universities could field a football team of Nobel prize winners .
The test of a progressive policy is not private but public , not just rising income and consumption for individuals , but widening the opportunities and what Amartya Sen calls the " capabilities " of all through collective action .
But that means , it must mean , public non-profit initiative , even if only in redistributing private accumulation .
Public decisions aimed at collective social improvement from which all human lives should gain .
That is the basis of progressive policy - not maximising economic growth and personal incomes .
Nowhere will this be more important than in tackling the greatest problem facing us this century , the environmental crisis .
Whatever ideological logo we choose for it , it will mean a major shift away from the free market and towards public action , a bigger shift than the British government has yet envisaged .
And , given the acuteness of the economic crisis , probably a fairly rapid shift .
Time is not on our side .
• Eric Hobsbawm 's most recent publication is On Empire : America , War , and Global Supremacy
In an anonymous - looking business park just outside Reading town centre is a room where row upon row of specially trained computer analysts sit staring at a bank of screens .
Several monitors display urgent - looking warnings .
One shows a picture of a globe , spinning angrily .
Another has close - ups of regions of the world highlighted as criminal " hotspots " .
These , my companions tell me , are areas vulnerable to attack from nefarious online activity .
As the names of companies coming under bombardment from web criminals scrolls down a third screen nearby , the overall feeling is disconcerting – it seems that no one is safe from this shifting , faceless enemy .
You could be forgiven for thinking this is the set of a hacker film like Sneakers .
In fact , it is the UK operation , or nerve centre , of Symantec – one of the world 's largest anti-virus companies , the owner of the Norton AntiVirus program , and the turn - to defence for global super - corporations trying to nip computer threats in the bud .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
At the moment , the likes of Symantec have their hands full .
The online community has seen an explosion in activity over the past 12 months as the quantity of " malware " ( essentially , software designed to damage people 's computers ) has multiplied by a factor of five .
The reason , Symantec says , is the proliferation of organisations creating such software .
These criminal clans hire programmers to create lucrative mechanisms for stealing credit - card information , and even sponsor computer science students through college .
" A group of specialised [ experts ] can create a larger number of new threats than a single malicious code author can , bringing about economies of scale and therefore an increased return on investment , " said a recent Symantec report .
Some modern malware can create download updates to make it change form and become harder to fight .
It can also exploit the likes of Twitter and Facebook to lure people into giving out their bank details .
Symantec 's security chief , Jim Hart , gives me a tour of the HQ .
It is his team 's job to respond to threats that might be facing Symantec 's corporate clients .
When detected , this army of some 30 minions issue patches and then inform their clients ' internal IT departments of any security breaches .
" We are looking at criminal activity 24/7 , " Hart says .
" What we do is health control .
If we see one of the networks we are monitoring hook up to an IP address , this means there is data being transferred .
And if that IP address is on our blacklist , we know that there is some kind of bad activity going on .
This could be the theft of information or bank details .
Then , for us , it 's like a game of whack - a- mole .
We see the infected machines and then we clean them – we hit the infections over the head . "
Later , in a separate room , I meet one of Symantec 's senior computer scientists , Guy Bunker , who has the Matrix - like moniker of " chief architect " .
He says that , while Symantec may be able to tell which servers or IP addresses are collecting such information , the location of these computers may not help track down those who are ultimately responsible .
" One of the main problems in trying to chase those behind viruses is that it tends not to be the people in the country that is doing the attacking , " Bunker explains .
" The villains might be using Chinese servers , but it could be someone in America pulling the strings .
It is like giving someone a remote control and access over your machine , which they can then use to do their evil bidding . "
He says malware has evolved to become smarter .
To begin with , criminals – anyone trying to create spam , say , or to " phish " ( to obtain bank - account information ) , could program a virus or malware from base code ( the " building blocks " programmers use to create software ) .
Now , people can send out a million versions of a virus .
Each of these is subtly different from the last .
Like human antibodies , which our bodies use to attack biological pathogens , many examples of virus detection software rely on recognising certain lines of code .
If this code is constantly morphing , it becomes difficult to detect .
Some viruses can even download updates .
In the " old days " people just did it to cause trouble – now , they are trying to do it to get money .
" The problem about tracking down the people behind these things is that they move around so quickly .
Many of the servers used have a lifespan of only 10 days , " Bunker says .
" Some countries are better than others at shutting them down .
The countries that host them tend to be the ones with looser internet security , or those that have just installed broadband and have not got fully operational security infrastructures up and running . "
Peru has been fingered as a country at risk .
One of the main reasons for this is that the country 's broadband use has exploded over the past two years , and there is a lag between the installation of broadband and the use of online security programs .
A similar issue was seen recently in Russia and China , which still have some of the highest incidences of online crime in the world .
Bunker explains how this " underground economy " of criminals has grown in size .
" When I was on my first computer in the 1980s I spent hours typing in games from magazines , " he says .
" It 's now the same with the growth of malware .
Large teams of people are involved . "
Someone who writes a successful piece of malware can earn as much as £ 170,000 on the black market , he says .
Some may be sold for tens of thousands , but might yield cash totalling millions of pounds if those who buy the malware succeed in draining people 's bank accounts .
Twitter is also a medium of attack .
In this , anyone can sign up as a " follower " , meaning that they can access people 's details and indulge in identity theft .
They also feature " tiny URLs " – essentially , shortened web - links that conceal addresses .
" If you have a tiny URL you can't tell what it is – it could be a bit of malware , but you trust it and go ' I 'll click on that , ' but it could cause trouble . "
Another escalating threat is online terrorism .
How we deal with this needs an overhaul , says the think - tank Chatham House .
" If society cannot respond in a similarly interconnected way , then the sum of security diminishes overall , " says a cyberterrorism report to be published by the organisation next month .
This demonstrates how the web underlies the ideology of terrorism .
" Extremists are attracted to a system that offers virtual anonymity , " the report says .
" They might also be attracted to a system that is relatively cost - free , and where the investments necessary to develop and maintain the global communications infrastructure have already been made – ironically by their enemies . "
The solution ?
A self - governing network that is policed from within , apparently – something elastic enough to see off the challenges of the next 12 months , which will be as testing as anything seen in the previous year .
Intruder alert :
The latest computer viruses
Koobface worm
Worms are self - replicating viruses that can spread through computer networks without any user intervention .
One of the latest major threats is the Koobface worm , which targets MySpace and Facebook users ( it 's a thinly veiled anagram of the latter ) .
It will post solicitous messages to the friends of an " infected " person , only to direct them to third - party sites where they will be prompted to download Adobe Flash player .
If they download the file , they in turn will be infected with the worm .
Conficker worm
The most high - profile recent attack came from the Conficker worm , which infected about 15 million Microsoft server systems .
Particularly vulnerable were unpatched Windows networks .
Some 3,000 British institutions , including Royal Navy warships and submarines , and the Sheffield hospital network , were affected .
Microsoft is offering a $ 250,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the worm 's creator .
Trojan horses
By far the most common virus threats are called Trojan horses .
Named after the mythic gift to Troy , these programs can be downloaded unwittingly in the guise of a computer game , for example .
Once on the host machine , they can allow unauthorised access or even remote use to a hacker .
One of the latest incarnations , Trojan .
Pidief .E , works simply by fooling the user into opening an infected PDF file .
MyTob
In November 2008 , three London hospitals , including Barts , had to shut down their computer systems for 24 hours when they were struck by the MyTob worm .
Ambulances were diverted from Barts for hours , and many administrative , laboratory and imaging tasks had to revert to manual operation .
It took more than a week to eliminate the infection .
Devkit
Valentine 's
Day provides hackers with an opportunity to infiltrate using so - called " social engineering " tactics .
In this case , two cute puppies hold a heart in their mouths , while the blurb exhorts the user to download a " Valentine 's Devkit " for wooing their beloved .
The Devkit is actually a piece of malware .
Alex Rousso
At last , Nick Clegg is emerging as a serious - minded leader of substance .
The Lib Dem conference in Harrogate at the weekend could have been so different .
Six months ago , after a messy and scrappy conference that left many of us in despair , shadow education minister Stephen Williams was confidently informing the THES that the party would be abandoning its policy to scrap tuition fees .
The implication of this interview was that we were set for a bloody big row – arguably the biggest one we have had since the messy formation of the party between 1989 and 1991 .
I 'm not the only one who was seriously questioning whether I had the energy for it all .
Yet so much has changed over the past six months .
The collapse of the banking system and the realisation that we were headed for economic collapse has rendered the divisive and thoroughly inconclusive tax debate we had in Bournemouth a curious echo of a different political era .
The party 's response to the government 's VAT cut masterminded by Steve Webb put the focus back on traditional Lib Dem territory by proposing a massive investment in infrastructure designed to cut fuel poverty , cut carbon emissions and create jobs .
And then in January , the party 's policy committee voted overwhelmingly to extend our anti-fees policy to part - time students .
Nick Clegg 's early weakness for attention - grabbing gimmicks has been superceded by a new seriousness of purpose by a leader finally finding his voice .
He has been rewarded by a small but perceptible shift in the polls .
The talk a few months ago was of a Tory landslide and a Lib Dem wipeout , yet it has become increasingly apparent that Clegg may find himself holding the balance of power after the next general election .
That is both a massive opportunity for the party and a massive risk .
Fevered speculation about who the party is likely to deal with rarely works in our favour , yet equally if we are n't in politics to change things then what is the point ?
Sunday 's leader 's speech was deliberately low key .
Starting by paying tribute to the soldiers killed in Northern Ireland the night before , Clegg 's speech was notably free of jokes ( even if he did allow himself a few self - deprecating one - liners ) and focused almost exclusively on the economy .
But this speech was far from being all doom and gloom .
Citing the examples of the Beveridge Report and Sir Christopher Wren 's visionary drive after the Great Fire of London , the emphasis was on using this crisis as an opportunity to build a better society instead of simply wanting to go back to what we had before .
This may sound like motherhood and apple pie , but this message of hope contrasts wildly with the Labour government 's panic - driven response to the crisis ( all bail - outs and fiscal stimuli ) and the Tory decision to hide under a table and leave the market to sort it all out .
One theme that Clegg has been actively developing over the past few months is to point out how our boom and bust economic system is integrated with our boom and bust political system .
If you want an end to the former , you need to sort out the latter .
Yet this is an issue that neither Labour nor the Tories are prepared to pay more than lip service to .
As such , what he presented on Sunday was the beginnings of a meaningful party narrative .
If he is allowed to develop this further , and can fight off the troglodytes in the party who would want to see him abandon any pretence of analytical thought in favour of yet another vacuous 10 - point - plan ( Charles Kennedy 's big mistake in 2005 ) , then things could get very exciting for the party indeed .
There is still more work to be done .
I still think we need to do more about social justice and child poverty ; improving education and tax cuts on people with low incomes is certainly necessary but not sufficient .
But if Nick Clegg can maintain this new sense of purpose , then the party has every reason to be optimistic about the future .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Gold prices rose to a record high above $ 1,007 an ounce Friday as stocks continued to fall and investors flocked to the metal to preserve capital .
Gold for February delivery rose $ 25.70 to settle at $ 1001.80 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
April gold , which has surpassed the February contract in trading volume , rose to a high of $ 1,007.70 at one point during the session .
The last time gold traded at such high levels was in March 2008 amid volatile financial markets and inflation concerns .
It rose to an all - time trading high of $ 1,014.60 an ounce on March 17 and settled at a record $ 1,003.20 an ounce on March 18 .
Still , gold remains well below its inflation - adjusted highs touched during a spike nearly 30 years ago .
Gold rose to $ 825.50 on Jan. 21 , 1980 , which is $ 2,186.50 in today 's dollars , according to the Minneapolis Fed Calculator .
Many investors view gold as a safe haven because precious metals tend to hold value during times of economic duress .
As a result , gold often rallies when stock prices retreat .
" With the Dow down to a six - year low and concerns about financial and economic stability worldwide , $ 1,000 seems to be the new resistance level , " said Carlos Sanchez , precious metals analyst at CPM Group in New York .
Sanchez said gold could push higher toward the close of trading , and that it could continue rising over the next few weeks , " given what 's going on with stocks . "
Stocks continued to slide Friday morning , one day after the Dow Jones industrial average fell to its lowest level in six years , as shares of financial institutions led the market lower .
The blue - chip average ended Thursday 's session at the lowest point since Oct. 9 , 2002 , the low of the last bear market , and it was down another 2.8 % with about three hours left in Friday 's session .
Stocks have been falling over the last few weeks , and gold has been rising , as investors expressed doubts about the government 's ability to lift the economy out of one of the longest recessions on record .
The jittery tone on Wall Street comes despite a number of new government initiatives announced this week .
President Obama unveiled a $ 75 billion foreclosure prevention plan Wednesday designed to aid 9 million distressed homeowners and jolt the housing market out of its stupor .
That came after Obama signed a $ 787 billion economic stimulus plan into law Tuesday .
Meanwhile , cash - strapped automakers General Motors ( GM , Fortune 500 ) and Chrysler LLC .
asked for another $ 21.6 billion Tuesday in addition to the $ 17.4 billion in government assistance they have already received to stay afloat .
Adding to the bleak tone , Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner outlined a bank bailout plan last week that was considered to be short on detail .
Members of the Government are to have their ministerial salaries frozen this year and those of them who are MPs will also forego the £ 1,500 rise in their parliamentary pay to which they are entitled , Downing Street said today .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
It was announced today that MPs will receive a pay rise of 2.33 per cent from April 1 , bringing their salary - before allowances - up from £ 63,291 to £ 64,766 .
But Downing Street moved quickly to say that ministers will not benefit from the rise , which comes at a time when the Government 's preferred CPI index of inflation stands at zero .
Gordon Brown 's spokesman told reporters : " The Prime Minister does feel that at this time when many families and businesses are facing difficult times economically , it is important that Government ministers take a lead .
" That is why , in consultation with his Cabinet colleagues , this has been announced today . "
The spokesman said that all Cabinet ministers who were consulted on the freeze agreed to it on behalf of themselves and their departmental colleagues .
David Cameron will reject increases to his salary as Leader of the Opposition and as an MP for 2009 - 10 , a spokeswoman said today .
The Tories would also impose a pay freeze for ministers in 2010 - 11 if they were in Government .
It is not yet known how much money ministers have given up , as their ministerial pay rise is linked to the figure for senior civil servants , which has not yet been released .
New rules introduced last year linked MPs ' pay rises to those of a range of public sector workers .
MPs also gave up the right to vote on their own increase , and the figure put forward by the Senior Salaries Review Body ( SSRB ) will automatically take effect .
The SSRB calculated the 2.33 per cent by taking an average from a basket of 15 different groups of public sector workers , ranging from judges and senior military officers to teachers , NHS workers and local council employees .
The Westminster salary rise comes at a time when many private sector workers are facing pay freezes or even reductions in the face of the economic recession .

While inflation on the CPI index , which includes mortgages , fell to zero last month , the alternative Retail Prices Index ( RPI ) jumped to 3.2 per cent .
MPs ' basic pay is topped up by expenses and allowances worth up to around £ 180,000 a year to pay for their offices , staff and travel and the cost of spending time away from home while working at Westminster .
An inquiry has been ordered into MPs ' pay and expenses following a series of controversies , including allegations relating to claims for second home allowances from Home Secretary Jacqui Smith and Employment Minister Tony McNulty .
Enlarge By Joel Salcido for USA TODAY Watts Wacker , a futurist and management consultant , sent an e-mail to a handful of his best clients in which he volunteered to work for free .
Out : a day 's work for a day 's pay .
In : a day 's work — for free .
In the midst of this job - eating , business - depleting recession , some entrepreneurs — particularly owners of small businesses — are taking a step few could have seen even one year ago : working for free for their best clients .
Some are doing it to stay in the good graces of key clients .
Others are doing it to keep their names and faces in the public eye — to market themselves or their businesses .
Some are just trying to keep their employees busy .
And a few are doling out free labor , in part , to help folks that need a lift .
While only a fraction of the nation 's 27 million businesses are taking such unconventional actions , the wave is crossing industries .
This is not about bartering .
Nor is it about charitable or pro-bono work .
This is free work , plain and simple , for clients that matter most .
" There 's a whole bunch of this stuff going on out there , " says Todd McCracken , president of the National Small Business Administration ( NSBA ) .
One information technology vendor recently gave his organization five free computers worth more than $ 6,000 to retain its business for the long term .
" This is absolutely amazing , " says David Van Fleet , management professor at Arizona State University .
" It 's all about keeping personal relationships with clients .
But you have to be very , very cautious , because when things pick up — and you start charging — you 've got to open negotiations all over again . "
While there 's no term now for these efforts , Robert Ford , management professor at University of Central Florida , is happy to coin one : pragmatic idealism .
" If your clients weather the storm , they 'll remember that you were willing to give them a hand when they needed it most . "
Of course , nobody wants to work for free .
But better some free work — with the possibility of some goodwill , good karma or maybe even future payback — than doing nothing .
Watts Wacker is a 56 - year - old futurist and management consultant who refers to himself as a professional wizard .
Wacker saw the future and blinked .
His business has been hammered by the recession .
He 's owned FirstMatter , a consulting firm in Westport , Conn. , for 11 years .
His average annual revenue had been $ 800,000 ; this year , he fears , he wo n't break $ 200,000 .
And that 's got to cover him and two employees .
Wacker says he may go 18 months without paying himself a full salary .
Yet he 's got two kids in college .
" Even when you plan really well , it 's pretty hard to plan for a 200 - year storm , " Wacker says .
Alternative to moping Instead of moping , Wacker got a novel idea from listening closely to President Obama 's inaugural address urging Americans to act with hope and virtue in troubled times .
He e-mailed a letter to a handful of his best clients .
He told them the nation 's business model had to change during this downturn , and he volunteered to go first .
He told clients that if they had some work — but no dough to pay for it — he'd do it for free .
Earl Broussard responded first .
The Austin - based president of landscape architectural firm TBG Partners met Wacker seven years ago at an Urban Land Institute convention in Las Vegas where Wacker was a keynote speaker earning up to $ 30,000 a pop .
They struck up a friendship , and soon a business relationship .
For his company 's 20th anniversary , Broussard hired Wacker to speak to employees and help plot the firm 's future .
After receiving Wacker 's work - for - free offer , Broussard , a local board executive for the non-profit Urban Land Institute in Austin , asked Wacker to speak to the group for free .
Wacker will do that next month , with only his travel expenses paid .
That 's not the end of the story .
It 's just the beginning .
Broussard 's business , which posted $ 15 million in sales last year , is struggling , too .
He 's slashed his workforce by 30 % .
He 's trimmed staff salaries by 10 % .
And he 's chopped his own salary in half .
He 's also stopped getting $ 40 haircuts and goes to a $ 12 shop .
Broussard says he does n't feel indebted to Wacker for the freebie .
But he felt it his duty to take Wacker 's free work concept to the next level .
In February , Broussard sent a letter to his three best clients .
He offered to consult , project costs and even do full drawings and graphics for future developments — for free .
In return , the letter asked his clients simply to assist someone else who needs help .
He was so eager to get the letter into his clients ' hands , that Broussard , 60 , sent it out without first running it by his partners .
" I'm from Louisiana , " explains Broussard .
" When I grew up , it was common for folks to catch lots of fish , then share their catch with the whole neighborhood . "
Unlikely business model
In an economically beaten - down nation where business - as - usual simply is n't working , this may be an unlikely business model that helps keep our economic boat from sinking :
Share the catch .
It did n't take long before he heard back from W. Douglas Goff .
Goff is director of land development for Johnson Development , a big Texas land developer .
He 's known Broussard for 20 years and has often turned to him to help design projects from several hundred to several thousand acres .
But Johnson Development is seeing tough times , too .
Revenue will be off at least 20 % this year , says Goff .
It 's also had to let go of about 20 % of its employees .
But the company has to plan for the future .
It has to have plans ready so it can react the moment things turn around .
Thus , it took Broussard up on his offer .
On his own nickel , Broussard drew up plans for a potential themed residential community with a major hotel and up to 1,000 homes at the edge of the Colorado River .
He 's worked on the drawings , on and off , for a couple months .
He figures he 's put about $ 40,000 worth of his time into the effort for free .
Never mind that Johnson Development does n't own the land yet .
And that the whole thing is pie - in - the - sky for now .
" They think it will happen if the economy turns around , " says Broussard , and this way , the developer has physical drawings to show to hotels and potential investors .
For Goff , taking Broussard up on his offer was a no - brainer .
With no revenue coming in from the potential project , every cost has to be measured closely .
Meanwhile , he says , " Earl knows if the project comes to fruition , he will in all probability be involved with it . "
And Goff also took Broussard up on his request to help another struggling business for free .
A builder new to the Houston market had just filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection .
Goff 's company could have ended its contract with the builder .
Instead , it dug into its pocket to help the builder market itself locally .
Johnson Development hosted a reception for real estate agents to meet the builder 's principals .
" I could have easily gotten another builder in there to do what they 're doing , " says Goff .
" But these guys just needed an opportunity to prove themselves . "
Others have taken Wacker up on his offer , too .
He recently hosted a free Webinar for the Outdoor Advertising Association of America — which paid him upwards of $ 60,000 just two years ago to moderate and help organize its annual convention .
" He 's not expecting quid pro quo , " says Stephen Freitas , marketing chief of the group .
" But it 's a chance for him to market the Watts Wacker brand . "
Also for no fee , Wacker hosted a focus group for a new board game that toymaker Hasbro is developing .
The fee normally would have run about $ 25,000 , Wacker estimates .
" I told them I 'm having more fun working for them when I 'm not getting paid . "
Too bad , Wacker adds , fun does n't pay the bills .
Being proactive
With purse strings tight at the NSBA , McCracken , the small - business advocacy group 's president , was floored last month when its information technology consultant looked him in the eye and said , " I know times are tough .
I 'm gonna give you new computers . "
Five of them .
IT consultant Emmanuel Nzai says his decision was simple .
His company , Linkagepoint , is just 4 years old and the NSBA was its first client .
It 's certainly worth lending five computers worth $ 6,000 to a customer that spends about $ 3,000 a month for its IT services .
He 's made the same offer to two other clients .
" Times are rough for everyone , " say Nzai .
" It only makes sense for us to be proactive and show that we want to help . "
Back in Austin , Broussard is trying to keep his landscape - design business above water .
He remembers the pain he felt at age 14 — and , again , at 19 — when his father 's contracting business went through bankruptcies .
The family lost the house and cars .
Creditors hounded them .
" I went to Harvard so that would n't happen to me , " he says .
Yet it 's staring him in the face again .
" The only way we get out of this is to band together and hold hands and hope we 're not going off a cliff . "

SCOTLAND has been lined up to be the last place that a legendary masterpiece is shown outside of its home country .
The Hunterian Art Gallery in Glasgow is getting ready to host a loan exhibition of Edvard Munch ’s lithographs – including a black and white print of his most famous work The Scream .
And it will be the last time the print of the famous artwork will be see outside of Norway as the Hunterian is the last gallery to get it on loan .
Masterpieces
The honour comes with the first major exhibition of Munch ’s print work in the UK with many of his masterpieces appearing in print form .
The Scream is by far the artist ’s most famous work and hit the headlines in 2004 when armed thieves from the Munch Museum in Norway stole a painted version of it .
Munch made various versions of his most famous work in different mediums – there are two paintings , two pastels and one lithograph print in existence .
Madonna
It is the print that will be seen in Scotland for the last time this June .
As well as the iconic print , the exhibition will also contain a number of Munch ’s other works in their print form .
Included is a print of the controversial Madonna – portraying the Virgin Mother in the act of intercourse .
The painting of this was stolen alongside The Scream from the Munch Museum in 2004 .
In total there will be forty of the Expressionist ’s print and the show has been designed to illustrate the development and important themes of his art .
Although Munch is most famous for his paintings , prints were an important aspect of his art as they provided a good publicity opportunity .
Berlin 1894
He used a variety of methods including lithograph , woodcut and etching to create the works .
The Norwegian artist began making prints in Berlin in 1894 as a last resort for publicising his paintings .
And it was his prints that provided an income for the artist and gained him influential friends in the art world .
Tweaks and changes
Although there are many different versions of each work , every one is slightly different – reflecting the constant tweaks and changes Munch made to his work .
Other prints on display will be the striking ‘ Self - portrait ’ lithograph and the atmospheric woodcut ‘ Melancholy ’ .
The exhibition Edvard Munch : Prints is on from 12 June – 5 September 2009 at the Hunterian Art Gallery in Glasgow and admission is free .

* Government to buy 8.7 pct stake or 20 mln shares
* Hypo says govt fund SoFFin to pay 60 mln euros for shares
* Full govt control required for recapitalisation
* Pretax loss 5.375 bln euro , sees at least 2 yrs of loss
( Adds CEO comments , details , background )
By John O’Donnell and Maria Sheahan
FRANKFURT , March 28 ( Reuters ) - The German government has agreed to take an initial 8.7 percent stake in stricken Hypo Real Estate HRXG.DE as a prelude to acquiring full control , the bank said on Saturday .
The move comes as Hypo said it lost 5.375 billion euros ( $ 7.21 billion ) before tax in 2008 and said it expected to remain in the red for at least two more years .
It said it needed state backing to meet the German bank regulator ’s capital requirements .
Hypo has already been propped up with more than 100 billion euros in guarantees , mostly from the state .
Hypo , Germany ’s highest - profile casualty of the financial market crisis , was rescued by a government keen to protect Germany ’s covered bond market , one of the biggest in the world .
The German government is rushing through an emergency law that would allow it to expropriate Hypo shareholders and take full control of the Munich - based bank .
In an initial step , the government ’s bank rescue fund SoFFin would buy 20 million new shares issued by Hypo in a 60 million euro capital increase .
SoFFin intends to take full control , a prerequisite to recapitalisation , Hypo said on Saturday .
“ We welcome this step , ” Chief Executive Axel Wieandt said in a statement , adding the management board and supervisory board unanimously approved the measure .
The issue price of 3 euros per share , the legal minimum level , is more than double the market value of existing Hypo shares , which ended Friday ’s trading session at 1.14 euros .
A finance ministry spokesman declined further comment on the Hypo move .
NATIONALISATION
Germany is following in the footsteps of Britain which has already nationalised a number of its banks , including Royal Bank of Scotland RBS.L as the global financial crisis wreaks havoc in the sector .
The German government is also preparing to take a 25 percent stake in the country 's second - biggest lender , Commerzbank CBKG.DE , as part of an 18 billion euro rescue deal .
Other German banks , including HSH Nordbank [ HSH.UL ] and WestLB [ WDLG.UL ] , have also needed rescuing .
Expropriating the bank ’s shareholders has stoked controversy because such a step is linked in the minds of many Germans to crackdowns on private business by the Nazis and the government in communist East Germany .
[ ID:nLG677034 ]
The company ’s 2008 pretax loss exceeded analyst expectations , which saw on an average loss of 4.83 billion euros , according to a Reuters poll .
Net losses were 5.461 billion euros .

A new bill would give the President emergency authority to halt web traffic and access private data .
Should President Obama have the power to shut down domestic Internet traffic during a state of emergency ?
Senators John Rockefeller ( D - W. Va. ) and Olympia Snowe ( R - Maine ) think so .
On Wednesday they introduced a bill to establish the Office of the National Cybersecurity Advisor — an arm of the executive branch that would have vast power to monitor and control Internet traffic to protect against threats to critical cyber infrastructure .
That broad power is rattling some civil libertarians .
The Cybersecurity Act of 2009 ( PDF ) gives the president the ability to “ declare a cybersecurity emergency ” and shut down or limit Internet traffic in any “ critical ” information network “ in the interest of national security . ”
The bill does not define a critical information network or a cybersecurity emergency .
That definition would be left to the president .

Jindal praises race - profiling lawman
In his response to Barack Obama tonight , Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal spoke glowingly of the late Jefferson Parish Sheriff Harry Lee .
It was a curious , even provocative choice : Lee , a colorful 300 - lb .
Chinese - American lawman was repeatedly accused of racially profiling blacks in the predominantly white parish he dominated prior to his death in Oct. 2007 .
Jindal :
During Katrina , I visited Sheriff Harry Lee , a Democrat and a good friend of mine .
When I walked into his makeshift office I 'd never seen him so angry .
He was yelling into the phone : ' Well , I 'm the Sheriff and if you do n't like it you can come and arrest me ! '
I asked him : ' Sheriff , what 's got you so mad ? '
He told me that he had put out a call for volunteers to come with their boats to rescue people who were trapped on their rooftops by the floodwaters .
The boats were all lined up ready to go - when some bureaucrat showed up and told them they could n't go out on the water unless they had proof of insurance and registration .
I told him , ' Sheriff , that 's ridiculous . '
And before I knew it , he was yelling into the phone : ' Congressman Jindal is here , and he says you can come and arrest him too ! '
Harry just told the boaters to ignore the bureaucrats and start rescuing people .
In the wake of Katrina , Lee grabbed national headlines by suggesting his deputies could randomly stop blacks to combat a rise in drug crimes caused by the displacement of low - income New Orleans residents .
He later abandoned the idea -- but never apologized .
In an earlier incident , Lee sparked a firestorm by ordering his force to arbitrarily stop “ young blacks in rinky - dink cars ” driving in white neighborhoods , according to The Associated Press .
He backed off that plan , calling it a mistake after the NAACP called on him to resign .
Shortly before his death , Lee stoked controversy again , telling a TV reporter : " We know the crime is in the black community .
Why should I waste time in the white community ? "

Believe it or not ... One oil field accounts for 6.25 % of the world 's daily global production — about 5 million barrels a day .
And unfortunately for the world , few people know the lies , scandals , and realities surrounding Ghawar , the world 's largest oil field .
Real Estate So Hot , Even Donald Trump Can't Touch it
Nearly 125 miles east of Riyadh , in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia , exists the most expensive and exclusive real estate on the planet .
How pricy is land here ?
All exaggerations aside ... Priceless .
Yet this 1.3 million acre stretch of real estate contains no Hollywood - style , gazillion dollar mansions ... There are no private beaches or hoity - toity , aristocratic shopping ... There are no elite golf courses or exclusive vacation resorts .
No ... There 's almost nothing at all .
Just a big , dead , empty desert .
Yet this virtually - uninhabited stretch of desert has made literal tycoons out of once nomadic tribesmen in just over 50 years .
How was that possible ?
Actually , it was quite easy .
You see , lying deep beneath this scorching , desolate landscape sits the largest and most important oil field in the world : The Ghawar Oil Field .
Saudi Arabia has over 300 recognized oil reservoirs .
But 90 % of the country 's oil production comes from only five fields discovered between 1940 and 1965 .
They are :
Abqaiq Field ( official reserve estimate : 12 billon barrels )
Safaniya - Khafji Field ( official reserve estimate : 30 billon barrels )
Berri Field ( official reserve estimate : 12 billon barrels )
Manifa Field ( official reserve estimate : 11 billon barrels )
And the granddaddy of them all : Ghawar Field ( official reserve estimate : 70 billon barrels )
Ghawar is so large that its production accounts for about 60 % of all Saudi Arabian oil .
So there 's no wonder why among the many prolific oil fields in the Middle East , the giant Ghawar field stands out as the region 's crown jewel .
The massive field was discovered in 1948 .
Production at Ghawar began two years later and reached a peak of 5.7 million barrels per day in 1981 .
This is the highest sustained oil production rate ever achieved by any single oil field in history .
" Ghawar is the greatest oil - bearing structure the world has ever known .
Its superlative qualities cannot be overstated .
It is unlikely that any new oilfield will ever rival the bounteous production Ghawar has delivered to Saudi Arabia and the international petroleum markets "
- Matthew Simmons , Twilight in the Desert
During the mid and late ‘ 80s , Ghawar 's production rate fell as it was restricted for market reasons .
But by 1996 , with the development of two other areas in the southern area of the field , production went back up above 5 million per day .
Since its discovery Ghawar has produced more than 55,000 million barrels of the black goopy stuff .
And there 's still more oil to be found deep under the earth .
However , no one is sure exactly how much more crude the Ghawar oil field still contains .
Like we talked about in last week 's article , The Great Oil Reserve Swindle , there 's a lot of evidence that suggests official oil reserve numbers , put out by the Saudi Arabian government , have been fudged on purpose .
So , it 's quite likely that there 's not as much oil at Ghawar as the Saudis say .
In fact , there 's probably a lot less .
And for the oil starved economies of the world ... that 's bad .
But it gets worse ...
Water , Water Everywhere
In Saudi Arabia , seawater is injected into oil fields to increase pressure and thereby stimulate production .
Now , normally only 30 % of the oil in a reservoir can be extracted .
But water injection increases that percentage — known as the recovery factor — and maintains the production rate of a reservoir over a longer period of time .
However , over time , the volume of water that is lifted along with the oil increases , thus the volume of oil declines proportionally until eventually what flows out of the reservoir is almost pure water , and the field is no longer worth operating .
Now here 's the bad news ...
Saudi Aramco , the national oil company of Saudi Arabia and Ghawar 's operator , is currently injecting a staggering 7 million barrels of sea water per day back into Ghawar in order to prop up pressure .
And at the Offshore Technology Conference a few months ago , experts were claiming that Ghawar was producing about 55 % water .
That means that more than half the fluid brought up the well is water !
" Ghawar will not run dry overnight , but the beginning of the end of its oil is in sight . "
- Paul Roberts , The End of Oil
For now Ghawar is still far too productive to abandon .
But because of increasing problems with managing the water Ghawar is becoming very costly to maintain .
And one day in the very near future it will become uneconomical to extract Ghawar 's oil and the field will be discarded .

Only 821 Days Left
The " official " reserve estimate at Ghawar is about 70 billion barrels — about 12 % of the world 's total .
But like we talked about last week , who 's to say how much oil is really still there .
But the heck with it .
Let 's give the Saudis the benefit of the doubt .
And let 's assume that there really is 70 billion barrels of crude in the ground at Ghawar .
Shoot ... let 's even assume they 'll be able to get every last drop of crude out of the ground .
So we have 70 billion barrels of oil , right ?
So what !
According to the Energy Information Administration , the world consumed 85.29 million barrels of crude per day in the first quarter of 2006 .
That hypothetical 70 billion barrels at Ghawar would only last the world 821 days !
You read that right —
The largest oil field in the world only has enough oil to last the world just over two years .
And that figure has n't even taken into account the ever increasing worldwide demand .
Granted , Ghawar is n't the only oil producing field around .
Still , Ghawar is the undisputed heavyweight king of kings when it comes to oil fields .
And like they say , if the head dies , the body is soon to follow .
Prognosis : Terminal
Today , the giant field produces about 5 million barrels per day — about 6.25 % of the world 's total oil production .
This field is only one of four able to produce over a million barrels per day .
( Cantarell in Mexico , produces nearly 2 million barrels per day , Burgan in Kuwait produces 1.7 million barrels per day and Da Qing in China which produces 1 million barrels per day . )
Ghawar is , therefore , extremely important to the world 's economy and well being .
And unfortunately for the world , few know the actual state of Ghawar .
Fact is ... Ghawar 's production rate is in decline .
In April 2006 , a Saudi Aramco spokesman admitted that its mature fields are now declining at a rate of 8 % per year , implying that Ghawar may have peaked .
You read that right ... It 's likely that Ghawar has peaked !
And if Ghawar has peaked , Saudi Arabia has peaked .
And if Saudi Arabia has peaked , the world has peaked !
In fact , three of the four fields that I mentioned a second ago are in confirmed decline !
This means several hundred thousand barrels of daily oil production will have to be added every year just to make up for the diminished output .
And you and I both know that that 's not likely to happen
" The big risk in Saudi Arabia is that Ghawar 's rate of decline increases to an alarming point .
That will set bells ringing all over the oil world because Ghawar underpins Saudi output and Saudi undergirds worldwide production . "
- Ali Morteza Samsam Bakhtiari , a senior official with the National Iranian Oil Company .
Saudi Aramco has reportedly estimated that total production capacity from all its fields in 2011 will be 10.15 million barrels a day .
That 's about the same as its current capacity .
But to meet expected world demand , the United States Department of Energy 's research arm says Saudi Arabia will need to produce 13.6 million barrels a day by 2010 and 19.5 million barrels a day by 2020 .
Saudi Arabia has been the world 's leading oil exporter for over three decades .
Today , the country produces about 8 million barrels a day — roughly one - tenth of the world 's needs .
If Saudi production falls short , the consequences would be significant .
And Ghawar 's decline is the first sign of this decline .
" In the past , the world has counted on Saudi Arabia .
Now I do n't see how long it can be maintained "
- Anonymous Senior Oil Executive with Saudi Aramco
While the world has other large producers like Russia and Iraq , these countries do not have the massive reserves or excess oil capacity to export found in Saudi Arabia .
Therefore they will not be able to make up for a short supply .
And the new oil fields found elsewhere around the globe are tiny when compared to Ghawar and therefore will not be able to deliver enough oil to make up the difference .
As a result , supplies will tighten and oil prices will increase further .
The global economy will soon begin to feel the squeeze .
Previous spikes in oil prices have helped cause recessions .
But this time I 'm afraid that the affects are going to be much worse .
Until next time ,

博士号取得者のみを大学教員とする方針についての見方
- 発声練習という記事を読んで。
うーむ。率直に言って、上のような意見に対して「こういう考え方もあるのかと驚き」などという感想が返ってくることの方が驚きです。
大学に限らず多くの組織について言えることですが、優れた人材は組織の柱であり宝です。特に大学教員の仕事というのは、研究にせよ教育にせよ、換えの効く人材をシステムに当てはめさえすれば期待通りの成果が得られるというものではなく、成果のかなりの部分が教員個々人の資質に依存しているように私には見えます。換言すると、大学というのは宿命的に「換えの効かないオンリーワンな人材」の集まりであるわけです（し、そうあるべきと私は思います）。
（勿論、大学の構成員は大学教員だけでなく、事務職員の方々の頑張りがあってこそ大学は上手く回るわけですが、それはまた別の話。）
そんな大学という組織が自らの価値を高めようとしたら、まずは優れた人材を確保するのが重要です。そして、上述のように大学における優れた人材というのは基本的に「オンリーワン」ですから、その人を逃すと次はないかもしれないわけで、目を着けた人材がいたら万難を排してでも獲得に動くべき・・・かどうかは程度問題として状況に依ると思いますが、少なくとも人材獲得の障害となる事柄は極力排除しておくのが望ましいでしょう。
そのような観点からすると、 「 博士の学位を持っている 」
「週２日以上大学に出勤できる」という制約条件は邪魔なだけです。「うちの学科ではカリキュラム上、週２日以上教壇に立ってもらわなければ困る」など個別の事情というのも考えられますが、それを初めから全体のルールとして定めてしまうのはあまりに弾力性に欠ける運用だと思います。
大学も今や厳しい状況に置かれていて、少しでも自らの価値を高めるため努力しなければならないというのに、その武器である人材を調達する手段を自ら狭めてしまうというのは、何の目的があってそんなことをするのか私にはどうにも理解できません。
元々上記の制約条件があったというのならば、条件を撤廃するのも一苦労だから仕方なくそのルールの下で動くという状況も現実的に起こり得るでしょうが、今回は敢えて元々存在しなかった制約を自らに課そうというのですから。
とはいえ、私もまだまだ若造ですから、私には思いもよらない尤もな理由があって、「この条件によって優れた人材を獲得できなくなるかもしれない」というリスクを考慮した上でそれでもなおそのリスクを受け入れる、という判断がなされる場合もあるのかもしれません。
しかしその場合、冒頭に引用されたような考え方があるのは承知の上での判断なわけですから、「こういう考え方もあるのかと驚き」という反応にはならないと思うのです。
あと、
博士号の価値というお話ですが、「大学の教員になれる」などというのはそれこそ「内向き」の価値でしかないでしょう。
これだけ博士号取得者の就職難が叫ばれていて、どう考えたって大学内部（アカデミックポスト）だけでは面倒みきれないんですから、今後は大学の外部に対しても博士号の価値を示し、価値を高めていくことが必要だと思います。（勿論、アカデミックポストに就いて素晴らしい仕事をする人材も引き続き必要ですが。）
今までよりも、企業など大学外部で活躍できる人材を博士号取得者として多く世に送り出し、その人達が活躍することによって大学外部における「博士」というブランドの価値が高まっていくのだと思います。
そのような優れた「博士」を育てるためであれば、「内向き」な博士号の価値なんて少しぐらい下がったっていいじゃないですか。下がった分は大学外部からの評価で取り戻せばいいんですよ。
なお、私は今現在は大学以外の場所で研究者をやっている身ですが、それでも心情としては大学の方々に近いところにいると思っております。

Interestingly , despite its widespread commercial popularity , it was not particularly highly regarded by Japanese critics at the time of its release ( the early 1950s is now regarded as a sort of Golden Age of Japanese cinema ) .

Alternate Versions
The film 's original Japanese release version runs 207 minutes , plus intermission , which includes 4 minutes of entr'acte music against a blank screen .
This is the version that has been generally shown worldwide since the 1980s , though sometimes it is shown without the intermission and entr'acte , resulting in a listed running time of 203 minutes .
The initial U.S.A. release was re-titled ' The Magnificent Seven ' and released November , 1956 , with English subtitles , and ran 158 minutes .
Some European releases were even further shortened to 141 minutes .
Landmark Films re-released the film in the U.S. in December 1982 , the first time outside Japan the film saw a major release with its running time intact ( although the intermission and entr ' acte were removed ) .
Later U.S.A. releases by Avco-Embassy Pictures , Janus Films , and Films Incorporated , and by BFI in the UK , are also the full original version of the film .

MEXICO CITY  Carlos Slim
Helú was clearly annoyed .
He had invited dozens of foreign correspondents to lunch one day last fall and , after many questions about business trends , one journalist pressed him on how it felt to be worth so much in a country in which many people struggle to get by .
Mr. Slim cut off the questioner and defended his stewardship of a vast business empire .
His curt tone made clear that he did not favor that line of questioning .
Mr. Slim , Mexico ’s richest man and now a major shareholder in and lender to The New York Times , has a complex relationship with the news media .
He invests money in an array of television and newspaper companies and says he sees a bright future for those media companies that adapt .
But when the news media focus their spotlight on him , he sometimes gives the impression that he wants to be left alone to make more money in peace .
The Industrial Haskell Group ( IHG ) have asked us to get cracking on a number of tasks :
Make dynamic / shared libraries work better
Make it possible to build GHC without using GMP
FFI checker / lint tool
Improving hsc2hs / c2hs +
Cabal to make it easier to write C wrappers to C functions
We 'll talk in more detail about each one as we tackle them .
Shared libraries
We 've started on the shared libraries task .
This is quite a big area .
Lots of people have put a lot of hard work into it already but there 's a fair bit left to do before we have GHC releases using them by default .
A little history
Wolfgang
Thaller did a lot of the original work on generating position independent code ( PIC ) in the native codegen .
Clemens Fruhwirth pushed things further along as part of a SoC project .
He got shared libs working on Linux and started to address some of the packaging and management issues .
GHC version 6.10 actually released with the shared libs code as an experimental feature .
Why do we care about shared libs ?
There are several reasons we care .
The greatest advantage is that it enables us to make plugins for other programs .
There are loads of examples of this , think of plugins for things like vim , gimp , postgres , apache .
On Windows if you want to make a COM or .NET component then it usually has to be as a shared library ( a .dll file ) .
There has been most demand for this feature from Windows users over the years and for some time it has been possible to generate .dlls using GHC ( though it was broken in version 6.10.1 ) .
It 's not been an easy feature to use however , and what 's more the current results are not exactly great .
While you can currently take a bunch of Haskell modules that export a C API and make a .dll , the .dll file you get is huge .
It statically links in the runtime system and all the other Haskell packages .
So if you want to use more than one dll plugin then each one has it's own copy of the GHC runtime system and all the libraries !
Obviously this is not ideal .
Having all these copies of the runtime system and base libs takes more memory , more disk space and slows things down .
What everyone really wants is to be able to build the runtime system and each Haskell package as a separate .dll file .
Then each plugin should be small and would share the runtime system and other dependencies that they have in common .
A somewhat superficial reason is that it makes your " Hello World " program much smaller because it does n't have to include a complete copy of the runtime system and half of the base library .
It 's true that in most circumstances disk space is cheap , but if you 've got some corporate shared storage that 's replicated and meticulously backed - up and if each of your 100 " small " Haskell plugins is actually 10 MB big , then the disk space does not look quite so cheap .
Using shared libraries also makes things a bit easier for Haskell applications that want to do dynamic code loading .
For example GHCi itself currently has to load two copies of the base package , the one that is statically linked with and another copy that it loads dynamically .
With shared libraries it would just end up with another reference to the same copy of the single shared base library .
Shared libs also completely eliminates the need for the " split objs " hack that GHC uses to reduce the size of statically linked programs .
This should make our link times a bit quicker .
What we 'll be doing
We 're planning to get things to the stage where a GHC user can make a working plugin on Linux x86 , Linux x86 - 64 and Windows .
As recently as a few days ago people have managed to get GHC HEAD working with shared libraries on Linux x86 - 64 .
Since then however we 've had the new GHC build system land in the HEAD branch .
So the first thing I 've been working on is porting the shared library support to the new build system .
So far so good .
I 'll report when I 've got the build to go all the way through .
It was a groundbreaking superhero comic , but not something you could ever turn into a movie .
Everyone said so .
Then Zack Snyder came along . *

Some of the most important scenes in the seminal comic book Watchmen take place in the secret basement headquarters of a washed - up ex-superhero called Nite Owl .
It 's a damp , vaulted space packed with avian - themed costumes and machine tools , a boys ' - own - adventure clubhouse .
At its center is the Owlship — a UFO - looking aircraft with two round windows that look like big shiny eyes .
And here , on a Vancouver soundstage , Nite Owl 's legendary lair has been brought to real life .
The Owlship is the size of an Escalade , and I 'm standing inside .
I 'll admit it : I 'm surprised .
I expected a set that was all facades , no guts .
Instead , I 'm fiddling with the flame - thrower button on the control panel , admiring the built - in coffeemaker , and checking out a picture of " vintage " superheroes taped onto the bulkhead .
It 's a comic book come to life , and it 's perfect .
And Zack Snyder knows it .
The director has been working away on his long - awaited big - screen adaptation of Watchmen for several months , and now , on a winter afternoon with just a few more days left of principal photography , he revels in the results .
" That 's not cool ?
That 's cool , " he says , beaming at the Owlship like a teenager with his first car .
" I might not have done anything else cool on the movie , but this is cool . "

Snyder then points out two massive chain guns mounted in the floor .
" When they fire , these parts here , " he says , indicating two little trapdoors , " open up to catch the shells .
Krak - krak - krak - krak ! "
Wait a minute .
Not to go all Comic Book Guy here , but ... chain guns ?
The Owlship does n't have chain guns .
Or rather :
When legendary comics writer Alan Moore and artist Dave Gibbons created Watchmen in 1986 , the Owlship did n't have chain guns .
Which means Snyder 's version , while inarguably cool , is also very risky .
Adapting a cult comic into a Hollywood blockbuster is fraught with danger , especially when it 's the only superhero comic book ever to win a Hugo Award or land on Time 's list of the top 100 novels .
Even slight changes to Watchmen , changes that will enhance its appeal to the masses , seem certain to alienate the very people who loved it in the first place .
That 's no knock on Snyder .
Geeks trust him .
Before Watchmen , the 42 - year - old filmed the runaway hit 300 in just 61 days , with a $ 60 million budget , a giant greenscreen , and a knack for hyperkinetic action scenes .
His keen treatment of Frank Miller 's sepia - tinged , ultraviolent graphic novel about the ancient Battle of Thermopylae won over the nerd fan base and did big numbers at the box office , solidifying the newbie director 's reputation as a guy who could make a splashy , mainstream hit while remaining true to the source material .
So you 'd think Watchmen would be a snap : shoot , rinse , repeat , right ?
Wrong .
To its many devotees , Watchmen is untouchable , unimprovable , sacrosanct .
" The literati were less hard on the Coen brothers for changes they made to No Country for Old Men than the geeks will be on me for changes I make to Watchmen , " Snyder says .
" There are no more fierce fans than geekdom . "
In other words , when the movie hits theaters March 6 , even a couple of cannons tucked into the Owlship will be noted and potentially deemed unwelcome .
A friend lent me the Watchmen comic in college , a couple of issues at a time , each in its own Mylar slipcover backed with acid - free cardboard .
I was already a fan of Alan Moore , and this was his magnum opus .
After a lifelong diet of stories about garishly clad people with powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men , reading Watchmen changed the way I thought about comics .
It was like a bar mitzvah — all my childhood stories acquired new significance and texture .
It has been 20 years , and I 've never read comics the same way since .
None of us have .

For the uninitiated , here 's a primer :
It 's the mid-1980s , and superheroes are real but have been outlawed since 1977 .
One of the last costumed adventurers , Rorschach , investigates the murder of another , the Comedian .
The killing turns out to be part of an elaborate conspiracy that spans more than 50 years of alternate history originally told over 12 issues .
Visual themes — primarily a doomsday clock face ticking closer and closer to midnight — recur in unlikely places ( a blood - spattered happy face , a radar screen , the surface of Mars ) .
The characters are all perfect archetypes of superheroes , icons that resonate with longtime comic book readers , and the story refracts the conventions and history of the entire genre .
Also , it 's really , really dark .
Dogs eat children , a pregnant woman gets shot , and good guys get creamed .
As source material for a big Hollywood blockbuster , Watchmen is non-obvious .
Even Moore warned filmmakers against trying to adapt it .
( Previous attempts to make movies out of his work , such as V for Vendetta and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen , have been commercial and critical failures . )
" With a movie , you are being dragged through the scenario at a relentless 24 frames per second .
With a comic book you can dart your eyes back to a previous panel , or you can flip back a couple of pages , " says Moore , who along with artist Dave Gibbons packed Watchmen 's panels with visual puns , puzzles , and a ferocious command of fiction .
" Even the best director could not possibly get that amount of information into a few frames of a movie . "
Much of what makes Watchmen so powerful is that the material is so perfectly matched with the comic book form .

Author , More Information Than You Require
" The movie can be good as long as it appreciates that it has no reason to exist .
And yet I think Watchmen deserves an homage , and I 'm hopeful because Zack Snyder is making it . "
To further complicate matters , Watchmen also features a universe of far - flung locales — from New York City to Saigon to Norad to Mars .
The sprawling narrative is dense with references , backstories , and flashbacks .
( There 's even a comic within the comic — about pirates . )
And one of the main characters , the omnipotent Dr. Manhattan , is bald , naked , and bright blue .
( His quantum - mechanical powers let him see all of time and space as frozen instants that he can inhabit in any order .
You know — the way you read a comic book . )
No wonder , then , that the basic task of adaptation was troubled from the start .
" You can make a movie with the plot of Watchmen , but it wo n't be Watchmen , " says comics critic Douglas Wolk .
" You can kind of imitate it , in the same way you can kind of imitate the way Frank Miller drew the comic book 300 .
But Watchmen wants to be a comic . "
Hollywood begs to differ .
After a decade of tentpole superhero movies , studios now take it for granted that comic books can deliver at the box office .
Even The Dark Knight , a largely kid- proof , two - and - a - half - hour noir epic , grossed half a billion dollars in the US .
But The Dark Knight is n't Watchmen .
" Batman is this character , and you can pull elements from one story or another , " Gibbons says .
" Watchmen is self - contained . "
In theory , there ought to be a way to adapt Watchmen , but as a work , it just feels finished .
Many of us whose neural maps were redrawn when we first read the comic can be excused for thinking that any attempt to make it into a movie would be doomed .
Doomed !
And indeed , Watchmen has spent 20 years in Hollywood development hell .
Legions of A - list filmmakers have failed to make it work .
Let 's start with Sam Hamm , who cowrote the script for Tim Burton 's Batman .
He took a crack in the late ' 80s and rendered the plot unrecognizable .
Around the same time , Brazil director Terry Gilliam considered the project ; Moore told him not to do it .
Producer Joel Silver , who had made a lot of rock - 'em , sock - 'em 1980s action pics and later the Matrix trilogy , also toyed with the idea , even envisioning a blue - tinted Arnold Schwarzenegger as Dr. Manhattan .
In 1994 , producer Lawrence Gordon broke ties with 20th Century Fox and took the rights to Watchmen with him ( or so he thought ; more on that later ) .
The project stalled until 2000 , when screenwriter David Hayter — fresh from penning the first X - Men movie — pitched his own adaptation , hoping to make it his directorial debut .
" Then began a five - year process of each successive studio we went to taking the deal , because they knew it was valuable , and then trying to change the movie , " he recalls .
Paramount finally came on board , and Hayter stepped aside as director .
Darren Aronofsky was attached , then passed to make The Fountain .
In 2004 , fresh off the success of The Bourne Supremacy , Paul Greengrass signed up and spent six months and $ 7 million in development before Paramount execs decided they did n't understand the script and killed the project again .
The godlike Dr. Manhattan is just one of the dynamic characters Zack Snyder brought to the big screen .

In early 2006 , Warner Bros. approached Snyder , who had just wrapped 300 after directing a well - received remake of George Romero 's zombie classic Dawn of the Dead .
Snyder loved Watchmen , but his first impulse was to say no .
Then he had a frightening thought :
If he did n't make it and someone else did and messed it up , it would be his fault .
He said yes .
Snyder , a onetime director of commercials , is something of a geek - jock hybrid .
He 's an avid videogamer and occasional anime fan , but he also threw himself into an intensive weight - training regimen on the Watchmen set .
He can conduct entire conversations in lines from Star Wars while name - dropping sports icons .
( " May the Favre be with you " got laughs from the crew . )
Snyder turned out to be the right guy for the job .
Hayter 's original draft had moved the story to the present day ; Snyder 's allegiance to the source material led him and writer Alex Tse to shift it back to the Cold War 1980s , making it a period piece and likely adding $ 20 million to the eventual $ 130 million budget .
Snyder 's deftness with the virtual environments of 300 let him turn a Vancouver back lot into a plausible world of skyscrapers and long sight lines , with greenscreens and CGI building out the rest of Watchmen 's wide world .

" It 's a comic book about pop culture as viewed through a comic book , so I did n't see the point of making a movie .
But I saw the trailer , and it looked phenomenal . "
As for the look of Dr. Manhattan , Snyder 's f/x designers came up with something completely new .
Snyder and his production team knew the blue , shape - shifting Dr. Manhattan would have to be CG — but how to achieve the neutron - enhanced glow ?
Snyder had actor Billy Crudup perform the part wearing a suit of LEDs to cast light while reference cameras captured the movements of his face for later transfer to the virtual character .
But the glow from his suit was n't enough : Nearly every scene featuring Dr. Manhattan had to be enhanced with an LED - covered pillar and a reflective sphere to get the light effects just right .
The final result is a digital amalgamation of all three .
To handle the way Moore and Gibbons loaded every frame with information , Snyder used Easter eggs — hidden surprises for alert viewers that the camera will pass by fleetingly .
( Do n't miss the mission - specific Nite Owl costumes in the hero 's secret basement and the super - dense , 6 - minute opening credits sequence that retells the alternate history of the US . )
" We tried to layer far more deeply than film would usually allow you to , " production designer Alex McDowell says .
" Zack was always saying , drill down as far as you can . "
That 's one way you adapt the unadaptable :
You find the details that the geeks are going to look for , squirrel them away in the movie 's cubbyholes , and then let the fans know they 're there .
( The pirate story , for instance , is slated to be an animated short on the Watchmen DVD . )
All that reverence seems to have given
Snyder the nerve to make one massive alteration to the original plot :
He changed the ending .
In the comic book , a Godzilla - sized , genetically engineered squidlike creature makes an absurd yet devastating appearance .
Not anymore .
" We do n't have the monster , " Snyder says .
" We still end the film in a really gruesome way . "
But for geeks , changing the ending of Watchmen goes way beyond a director 's creative license .
It 's bordering on blasphemy .
It 's a humid day in July , and all Snyder wants to do is collapse in his hotel room .
But between him and it are four lanes of traffic , two trolley tracks , a railroad , and 60,000 attendees of the 39th San Diego Comic - Con .
A significant percentage of them are wearing cakey Heath Ledger Joker makeup or heavy Mandalorian battle armor .
Snyder is sporting his own standard uniform : white polo shirt and comfy sweatpants ( today they 're blue ) .
He has spent the last few hours signing autographs and giving tours of the Owlship , shipped here on a barge five months after filming wrapped in Vancouver .
And now he 's in the thick of it .
Fan after fan approaches , asking for handshakes and hugs with an awe typically reserved for the likes of Steven Spielberg and James Cameron .

The nerd world has been clamoring for an extended glimpse of the still - unfinished movie , and Snyder is here to show them three minutes then introduce his cast .
Movie studios have long used Comic - Con to turn committed fans into evangelists while generating mainstream media buzz ; this is where Snyder has to show that he can bring the geeks on board .
The next day , nearly 7,000 people pack into a massive auditorium at the Convention Center for Snyder 's noontime presentation .
It 's a full house except for several roped - off rows in front — spots reserved for the Warner Bros.
brass flying down to gauge the response of their target demo .
Snyder has already screened a rough cut for the execs , and while their reaction was favorable , they had one major concern :
At more than three hours , the movie is way too long .
But what to cut ?
Early on , as Snyder tells it , the studio told him he should lose two scenes : the Comedian 's funeral , which establishes tone and introduces key characters , and Dr. Manhattan 's reverie on Mars , where he narrates his origin story and muses on the nature of time .
Snyder pushed back , hard .
" I said , ' Here 's the problem :
If you take those things out , I 'm really not interested in making the movie . ' "
He got his way , and the scenes are still in .
But he 's going to have to cut something , and it 's going to hurt .

" I 'll go see it if it does n't feel like a betrayal of what Alan Moore wants .
But it 's like making a stage play of Citizen Kane .
I guess it could be OK , but why ?
The medium is the message . "
At last the execs arrive and the lights dim .
The huge screens at the front of the room ( and a bunch of auxiliary screens mounted throughout the house ) display the footage , a stylish , goose - bumpy montage without dialog , set to the melancholy tones of Philip Glass : Rorschach 's ever - changing black - and - white mask shifts restlessly as he finds the secret stash of weapons that belonged to the dead Comedian .
Hapless atomic physicist Jon Osterman gets blown up during an experiment and is reborn as Dr. Manhattan .

I begin to see how Gibbons ' rigid panels could be turned into 24 frames a second at a 2.40 - to - 1 aspect ratio .
But without dialog , it 's impossible to tell whether Snyder has nailed it — or just captured the pretty pictures .
The Comic - Con attendees are n't worried about such niceties at the moment .
They 're just elated to see Watchmen come to life on the screen .
When the clip ends and the lights come up , they peg the applause - o- meter deep into the red .
Snyder 's previous movies got him into the club ; now he 's the president .
Five months later , Snyder is finishing postproduction , his responsibilities now largely confined to color correction .
His film 's legal troubles , however , drag on .
Remember those rights that producer Lawrence Gordon took with him in 1994 ?
Fox argued it was never rightfully compensated for its stake in the project .
The studio sued Warner Bros. shortly before Snyder wrapped shooting , and for several months both sides traded court filings .
A judge seemed to be leaning in Fox 's direction ; fans worried the movie 's release date would be delayed .
( The case was settled in mid-January : Warner Bros . forked over as much as $ 10 million in cash , according to reports , as well as a potentially lucrative chunk of box - office receipts . )
Meanwhile , Snyder has whittled down the movie to two and a half hours .
Watching his film over and over in the editing bay , he finally accepted the truth :
There was never going to be a three - hour theatrical version of Watchmen .
Snyder would have to capture the book 's tone , essence , and ideas but judiciously cut the story line .
This picture had to be Zack Snyder 's Watchmen instead of Alan Moore's .
" Look , I have a fan - fetishistic relationship with it , too , but you have to get space from that , " Snyder says .
" You get a movie that has some of the experiences of the graphic novel but does n't attempt to replace it .
It is a separate artistic experience from the book . "
Which is for the best , really .
The movie is in the can ; Snyder is already working on his next two projects :
He 's directing a cartoon based on a young - adult series of fantasy novels called Guardians of Ga'Hoole , as well as Sucker Punch , a low - budget psychological thriller .
" I wanted to make an action movie that 's just , like , crazy and sexy and dark and just cool , " he says .
" I do n't want any rules , and I do n't want any pedigree .
I just want to go crazy and shoot some shots that make me remember why movies are badass . "
Because you know what 's not badass ?
Meeting the demands of a studio , a mass audience , and cultish fans .
Even if Watchmen is well received , the burden of playing the dutiful director adapting the work of his heroes — Romero , Miller , and Moore — has become too much .
" I ended up with these guys , but it was n't by design , " he says .
" The thing is , you can get crucified on the same cross that you worship . "
It 's finally time to climb down from the Owlship .

Archaeologizing Watchmen : An Interview With Dave Gibbons
Watchmen Art Reveals Ozymandias and the Gang
New exciting proof that Cleopatra was of African descent and killed her sister !
Really ?
Yes , if you believe the BBC .
The story , reported by AFP , the Times , and the Daily Telegraph , goes like this :
In the 1920s a tomb at Ephesus in Turkey was opened which contained a single skeleton .
The skull was removed , measured , and subsequently lost .
More recently , a team of Austrian archaeologists have reexamined what 's left of the skeleton , determining it to be the body of an apparently healthy youngfemale .
The basis for linking this skeleton to Cleopatra 's sister seems to be the octagonal shape of the tomb ( echoing the famous lighthouse of Alexandria , apparently .
Or , a stopsign .
Whichever . ) and the fact that Arsinoe was banished to Ephesus before her murder .
Coincidentally , there 's a new BBC documentary airing 23 March called ( cue the scary music ) Cleopatra : Portrait of a Killer .
Apparently the BBC has been taken over by Fox ( Homer S : Portrait of an Assgrabber , anyone ? )
The subject is treated suitably skeptically at rogue classicism First things first .
The Ptolemies ( that 's Cleopatra 's family ) had a habit of interbreeding .
A pretty major habit .
Another symptom of their apparent lack of reproductive creativity is that fact that they used the same family names over and over .
So , the Cleopatra in question , the famous one , the last of the pharaohs , the lover of Caesar and Antony , was actually Cleo 7.0 ( Cleopatra VII ) , and her sister was Arsinoe IV .
Here 's the conventional family tree , which I 've reproduced from Sheila Ager 's 2005 paper " Familiarity Breeds : Incest and the Ptolemaic Dynasty " .
Yes the double line means marriage , and yes , that 's gross , but it was the style at the time , so let 's move on .
Ptolemy XII === Cleopatra V___________|___________________________________| | | | | Berenice Arsinoe IV Ptolemy XIII == Cleopatra VII == Ptolemy XIVThe typical story says that Cleopatra was descended from one of Alexander the Great 's generals , who took over ruling Egypt after Alex 's empire broke up .
This would make Cleopatra a Greek queen of an Africancountry .
The reason why everyone 's got their pharaonic headdresses in a knot is the little question mark for Cleopatra 's parentage .
Strabo wrote that only the first born of Ptolemy XII 's children was legitimate , making the title of Cleopatra 's mother up for grabs .
But then , Strabo might have been confused by the genealogy ( and who can blame him ? ) , since Pausanias had earlier written that a different Ptolemy 's children were all illegitimate , minus the first born .
Some scholars have suggested that Cleopatra 's mother could have been a high - ranking Egyptian priestess , but there 's little evidence to back this up .
But then , if we 're looking for places where Egyptian ( or " African " ) ancestry could have creeped in since the good ol ' days back in Greece , there was plenty of lying , cheating and sleeping around going on in this family .
Cleopatra 's father and supposed mother both may have been products of extra-marital affairs .
All of this raises the question of what exactly do we mean by " African ancestry " ?
I mean , if we go back far enough , the entire human species is of African descent , and there was almost certainly interbreeding between Greek and Egyptian populations over the millennia that these two cultures were in contact before Cleopatra was born .
The cranio - facial measurements of " Arsinoe " that were taken ( in the 1920s , mind you .
No one has actually seen the skull since then ) are the basis of the assignment of this African ancestry .
The idea is to take measurements of the skull and assign the individual to the ancestral category ( or " race " , let 's be honest ) to which they are most similar .
This whole method presupposes that different " racial types " can be discretely identified , which often they can't on the basis of skeletal characteristics alone .
A growing trend in anthropology recognises that our idea of race is much more based on cultural characteristics ( with a slight input from morphological characteristics such as skin colour ) , than it is based on any genuine underlying physical differences .
The techniques that have been developed for distinguishing different racial types based on cranio - facial measurements , are often qualitative , rather than purely metric , and I am very interested to see the paper that will be published , detailing exactly which methods were used to compare this skull ( which does n't actually exist anymore ) to the reference descriptions that are available .
What 's a shame is that there 's actually a lot of cool stuff going on in the Ptolemaic dynasty , stuff that would make an episode of Desperate Housewives look like Leave it to Beaver .
If the makers of the BBC documentary were looking for something sensational , they need have looked no further than their history books .
A few generations earlier , Ptolemy VIII murdered his sister 's son , then married the sister , and then raped ( or seduced , who can tell , really ? ) and impregnated the same sister 's daughter , whom he subsequently also married .
The family is full of stuff like this , so there 's no need to go along grasping at straws , and making huge leaps of faith based on a lack of evidence .
Compared to the rest of her life , the question of whether Cleopatra had African ancestry is probably the least interesting thing about her .

The best defense is to be offensive ? : A response to Chait , Goldfarb , and Goldberg
You know your opponents are worried when they start calling you names .
Jonathan Chait says I ’m " paranoid , " that I " went bonkers " in a recent blog post , and that my scholarship is " wildly hyperbolic . "
He says his real objection to Charles Freeman ’s appointment as chair of the National Intelligence Council is that Freeman is an " ideological fanatic " ( is n’t it odd that this quality went undetected during Freeman ’s lengthy career as a public servant ? ) and that Freeman ’s other critics were mostly worried about his relations with Saudi Arabia ( as if this had nothing to do with their views on other aspects of our Middle East policy ) .
Nice try , but it is abundantly clear to almost everyone that the assault on Freeman has been conducted by individuals —
Chait included — who are motivated by their commitment to Israel and who are upset that Freeman has criticized some of its past behavior .
Of course Chait does n’t broadcast this openly , as it would immediately undermine the case he ’s trying to make .
As for the others , Michael Goldfarb compares me to Father Coughlin and says I assembled a " blacklist , " when in fact I did no such thing .
I ’m not suggesting that Freeman ’s critics should lose their jobs or face other forms of persecution ; I just pointed out what they were doing and said it was wrong .
Read what I actually wrote , and then ask yourself why Goldfarb would make this up .
Perhaps he ’s confusing me with Ron Radosh , who did call for the New York Times to fire Roger Cohen for writing a column about Iran that did n’t demonize it .
Jeffrey Goldberg says that my co-author and I are " viciously anti-Israel , " even though we have consistently declared our support for a Jewish state , said we " admired its many achievements , " and wrote that the United States " should come to Israel ’s aid if its survival is ever in jeopardy . "
M.J. Rosenberg challenges Freeman ’s critics too , and Goldberg labels him a " professional slander expert . "
What explains the false claims and overheated rhetoric these pundits employ ?
Why ca n’t Chait and his allies represent their opponents ’ views accurately , and deploy facts and logic instead of invective and character assassination ?
Answer : because the case they are defending is so weak .
Not the case for Israel ’s existence , which virtually everyone engaged in these debates supports ( including Freeman himself ) , but the case for continuing to give Israel nearly unconditional backing , even when it continues to build settlements in the Occupied Territories and when its newly - elected leaders openly declare their opposition to a two - state solution , which was the preferred outcome of the Clinton and Bush administrations and is now the stated goal of the Obama administration .
Because the case for never criticizing Israel and backing it no matter what it does makes little strategic or moral sense , advocates of that approach have no choice but to misrepresent their opponent ’s arguments , and to try to portray them as wild - eyed extremists ( i.e. , " ideological fanatics " or " paranoid " ) , in an attempt to marginalize them .
It never seems to occur to them that what we really have here is a straightforward policy disagreement , and that the policies they prefer might actually be harmful to Israel and the United States .
Their tactics used to work pretty well , but more and more people understand and resent the game that Israel ’s hardline supporters are playing .
But Messrs .
Chait , Goldfarb , and Goldberg do n’t get this .
They do n’t understand that their mean - spirited fulminations are undermining their own case , much as a loudmouth hogging the mike at a public meeting turns off the rest of the audience .
So it ’s hard to get too upset at all the name - calling .
As Napoleon once said , " when your opponent is making a very serious mistake , do n’t be impolite and disturb him . "
P.S. The Washington Times reports today that Freeman ’s appointment is going to be vetted by the DNI ’s Inspector General , to make sure there are no disqualifying conflicts of interest .
I see nothing wrong with that , provided he is judged by the same standards as other government officials in similar roles .
The article also quotes several former NIC members who support the vetting process but believe " It has to be looked at , but I do n’t see anything to disqualify him , " and that Freeman " should be a fine choice . "

Friedberg says it 's " a constitutional argument , and it's an argument suitable for the Minnesota Supreme Court , not for the trial court . "
What 's the argument ?
" We were ahead on the first count , so that 's the count that should count , unless we were behind on the first count , and ahead on the recount , then the recount is the count that should count " ?

The " constitutional argument , " Mr. Bilse , is Equal Protection .
Coleman argued that Bush v
Gore compels a determination that he would be denied equal protection unless the court adopted what amounted to lax standards that would permit the opening and counting of the absentee ballots he wanted counted .
In a 2/3/09 order denying Coleman ’s motion for summary judgment , the three - judge panel rejected Coleman ’s argument .
The panel observed that unlike the situation in Bush v Gore where Florida lacked a uniform standard for determining “ intent of the voter , ” Minnesota had “ enacted a standard clearly and unambiguously enumerating the grounds upon which an absentee ballot may be opened or rejected … ”
After the three - judge panel issued a 2/13/09 order issued a detailed ruling setting forth the rigorous standards required by MN law before an absentee ballot can be opened and counted , Coleman ’s legal team , recognizing that their case was indeed , as I posted here , “ dead in its tracks , ” grew increasingly strident claiming that MN ’s electoral system was “ fatally flawed ” in that absentee ballots previously opened may not have been uniformly subjected to the same rigorous standard .
The problem , as noted in a Franken filing , is that every electoral error does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation .
“ Under [ Coleman ’s ] theory , any mistake by a local election official — any misapplication of the statutory standard to particular ballots — would constitute a constitutional violation and draw the entire election into question …[ making ] democratic government impossible . ”
Franken went on to note that Bush v
Gore does not bar local variances in the administration of elections Coleman 's argument also fails because many of these ballots were opened and counted with his consent .

Ernest :
Thank you ... for explaining where things stand in layman terms ...
Iam , however , confused how the Bush v. Gore can be used as an argument : ( My understanding ) the SCOTUS justices ' ruling had specifically stated Bush v. Gore was not meant to set future precedent ( or something to that effect ? ) .
So in that regard it seems inconceivable Coleman 's lawyers could argue Bush v. Gore in the first place .
Even if they could , according to the reasons stated in your comments they are making arguments not even addressed in Bush v. Gore --- which then would render their case moot ?
With millions of dollars already spent , at the tax payers expense , on court costs and no feasible chance of winning Norm Coleman , who selfishly put his own political aspirations above the country 's best interests in the midst of a crisis , would be wise to bring this drama to an end .
Enough already !

Friedberg comments are surprising in that the Election Contest Court judges have not ruled … by making this comment , he is essentially telling them that they are irrelevant .
Not smart … but these judges have been taunted by the Coleman legal team before and they have worked very hard to be fair and not give the MN - Supreme Court a chance to overrule .
Coleman wants to appeal based on violations of Equal Protection but that is not really relevant here .
No voter was denied an opportunity to vote .
However those that choose to vote via absentee had to follow certain procedures .
In Minnesota , voting is a right , but to vote via absentee is a privilege .
The Court should see that there was no bias since the procedures were followed successfully in approximately 280,000 cases but 2 % of the participants had problems .
The Coleman ( and Franken ) legal teams agreed that many of these “ problems ” were rejected for just cause such as violation of the witness requirement , signature mismatches , non-registered voters , etc .
The main argument that is being made is that a county ( this may have to be rephrased to “ some counties ” but only Carver County was discussed in the trial ) applied a strict review while other counties were lax .
OK , except all candidates were subject to the same review by the county , so those that complied with the rules are probably in proportion to those that did not .
This is not a case of a “ class of voters ” that are being denied … just random people who did not comply with procedures .
And if the county did alert the voter to the error , a correction could have been made .
Materiality is also a consideration .
If Franken ’s lead is 500 and Carver had 83 voters rejected due to strict application of the rules , then even if every voter had been a Coleman voter , Franken would still win .
The purpose of an election is to determine a winner , not to determine the precise margin of victory .
I am glad that Coleman has taken his case to trial .
The trial is proving that the multiple reviews by local election officials and re-enforced by the State Canvassing Board , Minnesota had a clean election .
With 42 % of the vote , Franken may be able to claim that he prevailed in this contest , but clearly the voters are not enamored with either candidate .
Let ’s end the claims of fraudulent and stolen elections and get on to seating a Senator .
Coleman ’s talks of appeals are a waste of time … especially if Franken ’s 225 vote margin is over 500 .

I can understand a politician trying every legality to retain his / her seat , but this has turned ridiculous .
Now Coleman wants to drag all of this through the Minn. Supreme Court .
We are now 60 days past the election and probably headed for ( at least ) another 60 days of hearings , posturing and delays .
This sounds very intentional .
Watching all of this tells me there is a conscious effort to keep Franken from being seated while highly important economic bills are being handled by the senate .
Clearly , it is a ploy to delay Franken from reaching the senate .
No seat , no vote .

What about all the ballots that Franken supporters kept pulling out of the closet , out of the warehouse , out of the hat , days and even weeks after the election ?
Is this case just about the technical legitimacy of certain absentee ballots , but not about the gross abuses earlier in the recount ?
A sense of proportionality is the most common common sense to be absent at the present .

Minuteman Nobody was pulling anything both parties did n't get to see and approve or challenge .
I do n't think it 's reasonable to call the election officials " Franken supporters " , and it does n't matter who pulled ballots out of anywhere .
What matters is who put them in to begin with , that any mistakes be corrected , any crimes be dealt with , all legal ballots be counted accurately and the whole process be completely transparent ... no matter whose side anyone is on .
You 'll pardon me if I question your sense of proportionality here , I 'm sure .

You are correct , Serena , that the U.S. Sup. Ct. stated that Bush v Gore was not supposed to be relied upon as a precedent .
It nevertheless is a published decision which attorneys will cite .
The bigger problem is that Coleman did precisely what the Sup. Ct. criticized the Gore legal team for .*
In filing his election contest , Coleman sought only to have additional absentee ballots opened and counted in counties where he did exceedingly well .
The Franken counter claim sought a counting of a specified set of unopened absentee ballots it contended were improperly rejected in the remaining counties .
And where most of the ballots Coleman sought to add were properly rejected , Franken 's attorneys produced a greater number of ballots , backed up by voter testimony , that should have been opened and counted .
I anticipate that the net result will be a wider Franken victory margin .
To MN Central : A court must decide a case on the basis of the evidence admitted at trial .
The panel assigned to hear the contest entailed three very able jurists who would not let an out - of - court comment like Friedberg 's influence their decision .
* The Gore legal team operated from a perceptual disadvantage .
The focused on the very slender number of votes lost to hanging chads in a couple of heavily Democratic counties , unaware of the fact that some 90,000 mostly African - American voters had been illegally purged from FL 's computerized voter rolls by Katherine Harris & ChoicePoint ; unaware of the ability to manipulate the count in precincts where the vote either took place on paperless touch screens or optical scanners .

_____________________________________
I followed this election contest closely .
Team Coleman never offered " any " evidence that Franken supporters had done any of the things you claim .
I 'm afraid , Minuteman , that you have fallen prey to a vicious right - wing lie that has no more basis in fact than the ridiculous claim that President Obama was not born in the U.S. -- a claim repeatedly made despite an authentic birth certificate and despite the fact that the claim has repeatedly been rejected by our courts as frivolous .

As scapegoats go , Sir Fred Goodwin is straight out of Central Casting .
He 's a banker ; he 's mucked up big time , cost the taxpayer sums still too large to calculate properly , and he 's walked away from the mess with riches beyond the avarice of a Premiership footballer .
All he lacks , as a media villain , is a pair of staring eyes and record of cruelty to animals .
If Alastair Campbell were still around , Sir Fred might have been saddled with even that .
But this week , as loomed the handing to banks of further barrels of public cash on what the furniture stores used to call easy terms , the Government had no need for nudge - nudge rumours of scuttlebutt to create a diversion .
It had information even more incriminating and instantly unpopular : the size of Sir Fred 's pension pot .
It was huge ; it was blood - pressure raisingly indefensible ; and , above all , it seemed politically useful .
Ministers had known the scale of it for months ; something pretty close to its size had been reported on City pages as far back as 14 October last year .
But it had never become An Issue .
Now the time for it to do so had arrived .
And so , on Wednesday evening , the exact magnitude of it was leaked to Robert Peston of the BBC .
He went on air and could barely get the numbers out for hyperventilating : Sir Fred 's pot of gold was worth £ 16.9 m ; the man – so the story went – whose megalomaniac regime of compulsive acquisitions had brought down the Royal Bank of Scotland was now retired , at the age of 50 , with a pension worth £ 13,000 a week for the rest of his life .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The ploy worked .
By the following day , Fred 's Pension was dominating the news and provoking all the anti-banker indignation that a government spin - doctor hoped it might : " These fat cats must have their fortunes neutered " ( Daily Mail ) , " Obscene : I wo n't give up a penny " ( Daily Express ) , and " No shred of shame ; RBS boss Fred " ( Daily Mirror ) .
Yet all the while , behind this smokescreen , hundreds of billions of taxpayers ' cash was being committed to the banks on terms that seemed bewildering .
This – the biggest leap in the dark in British economic history – is what the row over Fred 's pension concealed .
It is a story that should now be told .
For a long time , it has been known that the big scheduled domestic event of last week would be RBS 's results .
Their gargantuan size was widely expected , and the final figures did n't disappoint : £ 24.1 bn in the red – bigger than any American bank could manage , vastly outscoring some of the week 's other losses ( such as housebuilder Barratt 's £ 592 m ) , and relegating to barely visible footnotes the other depressing statistics of the week , such as household spending declining at its fastest rate since 1991 ; house prices down 15 per cent in a year ; and service sector job losses at a 10 - year high .
RBS 's losses , and those of Lloyds HBOS the following day , meant a further extension to the Government 's bailout , and taxpayers ' exposure .
The size of the potential commitment to the banks is estimated at £ 1.3trn , equivalent to the value of the British economy for a whole year , and a burden equal to possibly as much as £ 36,000 for every man , woman and child in the country .
And there could yet be more unpleasant discoveries .
Looming rather less large in the public consciousness than Sir Fred 's pot was the appearance before the Treasury Select Committee of Mervyn King , Governor of the Bank of England .
Fully five months after the present crisis began with the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September , he told MPs that it is still not known just how big the liabilities of British banks are .
In his evidence to the Treasury Select Committee last week , he said it would take " many months " to establish the scale of toxic assets held by banks , requiring a detailed assessment contract by contract .
Also overshadowed by Sir Fred 's pot was the size of the latest government support for the banks .
For a fee of £ 6.5 bn , RBS will place £ 325 bn worth of toxic assets in the Government 's newly created Asset Protection Scheme .
The bank will then be liable for only the first £ 19.5 bn of these dodgy assets , with the taxpayer accepting the risk of the rest .
The shadow chancellor , George Osborne , said : " The British taxpayer is insuring the car after it has crashed . "
Lloyds Banking Group 's participation is not yet finalised , but is expected to involve about £ 250 bn worth of toxic assets .
In return , there is now some progress in getting the banks to start lending again .
Northern Rock and RBS have committed to increase lending by £ 25 bn this year , and a similar amount next .
This is important : for businesses – some of which need a line of credit to weather the present storm and , some months , even pay staff – and in getting the housing market at least stabilised .
On Friday , it was learnt that the number of Lloyds and HBOS mortgage customers who are in negative equity has gone up from 4,000 in 2007 to more than half a million today .
And quickly hidden , too , by the Goodwin pension kerfuffle was the testimony of Lord Turner , chairman of the Financial Services Agency , to the Treasury Select Committee last week .
He said of Gordon Brown 's watch at the Treasury : " All the pressure on the FSA was not to say : why are n't you looking at these business models , but why are you being so heavy and intrusive ?
Ca n't you make regulation a bit more light touch ?
We were supervising people like HBOS within a particular philosophy of the way you do regulation which I think , in retrospect , was wrong . "
His views , which no one in Government has had the brass neck to contest , vindicate Paul Moore , the HBOS whistleblower , and support the thesis that history will probably conclude that the trail of easy credit and light - touch regulation responsible for the present crisis leads to Gordon Brown 's front door .

Yet , for all that Sir Fred 's pension obscured , there were things it woefully exposed .
First is the Government 's powerlessness to alter the culture of excessive rewards for the men responsible for some of the bailed - out banks ' worst errors .
Sir Fred walks with a pot of £ 16.9 m , and Peter Cummings is expected to leave HBOS with one worth £ 400,000 a year .
Many are mystified that the Government , for all the enormous muscle that should come with a 70 per cent stake in RBS , and 43 per cent Lloyds , cannot stop such payments .
How is it , goes the question , that the Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer are reduced to asking Sir Fred , in an increasingly plaintive refrain , to be a good chap and give up part of his wealth in a gesture of contrition and solidarity ?
The answer is that while , through its present ownership and various inquiries , the Government can alter the rewards culture of the future , it can do very little about the past .
Agreements were made and , for all the huffing and puffing to the gallery by Brown about lawyers at UKFI combing case books for a means to penalise Sir Fred , there is very little hope of it unilaterally and legally clawing back part of Sir Fred 's pot .
Besides , part of his pension was accrued in previous employments .
Exposed , too , by the Goodwin pension fuss has been the Government 's claim that it knew only recently ( " I became aware of this deal only a few days ago , " Brown said last Thursday ) of the full size of the pot .
This is curious , not least because of the role of the Treasury minister Lord Myners , a recently ennobled denizen of the City , who was privy to the negotiations over Sir Fred 's pension last October .
Last summer , the RBS boss 's pension fund stood at £ 8 m , which assumed a retirement age of 60 .
But , in return for waiving the right to a year 's salary and other benefits in lieu of notice , and also not taking any legal action over loss of office , he agreed to retire at the age of 50 .
And , to fund this extra 10 years ' pension , RBS virtually had to double the size of his pot .
Lord Myners knew this .
He claims the reason he did not object to Sir Fred 's pension when he found out in October is that he was " unaware of any scope for discretion " .
Yet Lord Myners has extensive experience in the field of executive remuneration : he sat on the remuneration committees of Powergen , O2 and the Guardian Media Group .
He was chief executive of Gartmore and sat on the board of NatWest when it introduced significant bonus schemes , as well as being chair of the Low Pay Commission .
An innocent in matters of remuneration he is not .
An RBS source said yesterday that Lord Myners , and therefore the government , had full knowledge that the pension was a contractual obligation .
Another source said : " I was in the room when Lord Myners was talking to Sir Tom McKillop , the former chairman , over the phone that weekend in October , the 11th and 12th , when the talks took place and Sir Tom made it quite plain that Sir Fred was entitled to his pension . "
An RBS spokesman added : " The fuss being kicked up now by the Government is complete nonsense as it has known since October that Sir Fred 's pension would be this amount . "
And not just the Government .
Although the precise sum was not made public until last week , something close to its scale was being written about in the press as early as 14 October , when The Independent reported : " Goodwin forced out of RBS but still walks away with £ 580,000 pension . "
For the Government to claim that it did not realise the size of Sir Fred 's stipend looks remarkably disingenuous .
But the hoo - ha about it had served its smokescreen purpose – and continues to .
Yesterday the pleading to Sir Fred by ministers went on .
Lord Mandelson , the Business Secretary , told ITV News : " I think Sir Fred Goodwin undoubtedly should give it , or the bulk of it , back .
I do n't think he quite understands how people feel about this – how angry they feel . "
Opposition MPs , and every passing blogger , join in .
Sir Fred and his pension make an easily graspable scapegoat .
No doubt some gesture by Sir Fred – for charity , probably – will be made .
The public will be grudgingly assuaged .
The fit of national vapours will pass ; Sir Fred will fade into gold - plated discredit , but the real problems will remain .
Kenji Uchida , the president of the Sunrise anime studio , told attendees of a Tokyo International Anime Fair ( TAF ) 2009 symposium that actor Keanu Reeves ' enthusiasm for its Cowboy Bebop anime was the deciding factor in the recent live - action film deal .
Uchida said Reeves ( The Matrix , A Scanner Darkly , Johnny Mnemonic ) himself visited Japan twice to express his interest in adapting the stylized science - fiction anime , and added that if Reeves had not done so , the deal might not have been made .
Uchida further noted that the difficult negotiations with the 20th Century Fox film studio continued for two years until agreeable contract terms were drafted .
He emphasized that the contract allows Sunrise to assert quality control by stating , " If the script is terrible , the live - action film adaptation will not be approved . "
Uchida spoke at a Thursday symposium titled " Basquash ! to Cowboy Bebop ni Miru Kaigai Collabo Business Model " ( " The Collaborative Overseas Business Model , as Shown by Basquash ! and Cowboy Bebop " ) .
At the panel , Satelight executive director and anime creator Shoji Kawamori ( Macross , Escaflowne , Aquarion ) and French animation creator Thomas Romain ( Oban Star - Racers , Aria the Natural ) discussed how they collaborated on next month 's Basquash !
robot sports action anime series .
In describing the project 's genesis , Kawamori said that he felt there are limits and clichés in the weapon - based action genre .
Romain co-developed this unorthodox project about street basketball — as played by players in giant robotic mecha — with a team of both Japanese and French animators .

The launch of MySpace Music six months ago was supposed to herald a new era , with the four major labels at long last embracing social media as a disruptive force of good and developing a business model which did n't repulse their customers .
It did n't work out that way .
Though far from a misbegotten roll - out , the brief history of MySpace Music is a tale of missed opportunities , silo mentalities and unwarranted reluctance to trust the audience .
" It was plumbing and a playlist , " says Courtney Holt , who took command of MySpace Music in January , nearly three months after it launched .
" But it was n't overly social , it was n't deep enough , and we did n't really empower the users to do what they wanted to do . "
Starting with ... where is it ?
MySpace Music — not to be confused with the songs on MySpace artist pages , which are not part of the service — was so hard to find when it launched that most users probably did n't even know it was there .
" They tell me you can stream everything on MySpace , " wrote pundit Bob Lefsetz recently , " but I can't find the tracks on
MySpace .
The company 's roots , which are based in raping and pillaging for profit , have hindered the enterprise 's development . "
Ouch .
If you did stumble across the service , you quickly began to wonder why you had bothered .
It was n't particularly easy to make a playlist , and there was no easy way to share one .
The problem was classic disconnect : a lot of thought had been given to the business model ( high - end brands were delighted to be able sponsor on - demand music and playlists ) but very little to how people would want to use the service .
Part of the problem : the product development team was scattered , and lacked the sense that someone was in charge .
As a result , it worried about rocking the boat .
" You had a giant promotional platform for music , and you wanted to not upset the balance , " said Holt .
" There was no leadership in the original plan of how to do this , and where it needs to go .
There were 35 projects floating in the ether ...
We 've got incredible people that are smart , driven and focused , but sometimes you need someone to say , ' why are we doing that ? ' or ' let 's do it this way . ' "
As Steve Jobs knows , democracies do n't always produce the best results .
MySpace had given the major labels a valuable equity stake in MySpace Music for the right to stream their music on - demand , then completed all of the grueling back - end work to make the music play properly .
After all that , the main way to access the resulting service was through other peoples ' profile pages .
Making matters worse , MySpace — famous as the go - to place to hear from bands of any stripe — launched the service without any indie music , and that 's the kind lots of online music fans appreciate .
" Last year ... 38.9 percent of digital sales were of independent music , " said Rich Bengloff , president of the American Association of Independent Music .
" And Pandora plays 55 percent independent music . "
After a months - long search , the company hired Holt , a music veteran and early contender for the job with 16 years of industry experience ( Universal , Polygram , Warner , MTV Networks ) during which he launched several albums through MySpace ( Black Eyed Peas ,
Nine Inch Nails , Weezer ) .
His first taste of the business involved writing about music in college because he wanted free , unlimited access to review copies and concerts — so he knows a lot about the desire to have someone else support your habit , which aligns him nicely with his customers .
Are things improving ?
Yes .
Here are the main five steps MySpace Music has taken ( or is taking ) to make it a service worth exploring :
1. Bring back the album
Digital music has been charged with the death of the album , so it 's ironic that MySpace , of all things , wants to resuscitate it .
The site 's upcoming album pages will incorporate more than an old - school album sleeve ever could : videos , alternate versions , crowdsourced fan commentary , quotes from artists who were influenced by the album , and more .
MySpace users clamored for the rest of the improvements on this list , but this is Holt 's pet project — a purely top - down initiative .
" I worked a couple U2 records — they would put out the pre-release single , the album , there 'd be a special edition album , then there 'd be the DVD commemorating the tour , there were MP3s from the tour that got shared , and you sort of say , ' Can I just bring it all together in one place ? ' "
He hopes to resurrect the album as the locus for musical conversation , in part to teach post - internet music fans about albums , in addition to songs and artists .
" Digital is under - serving the long - tail of music , because everything is on equal footing , " he explained .
" As much as a catalog album is findable ... on iTunes or Amazon , I 'm concerned how people are going to discover these albums , " said Holt .
" A lot of people are discovering music through Rock Band and Guitar Hero , but even then , if you play a song 50 times , are you going to buy [ the album ] and get the story ?
...
Somebody who loves Lady Ga - Ga , they need to understand that that evolved from Debby Harry . "
" I look at this as what an interactive liner note could be , " added Holt . "
We took art and made it smaller with the CD , and with digital we almost made it disappear .
This may not be a tactile experience where I 'm holding this in my hand , but I also might be able to expand it back out . "
Holt 's right about the so - called " disappearing " album cover and liner notes representing a great opportunity for digital music to offer more digitally than was possible in the analog world .
" You can virtually do anything but roll a joint on them , " said Holt ( echoing Shelby Lynne 's notorious sentiment ) .

Since its launch , MySpace Music has added music from indie collectives IODA and The
Orchard , although the American Association of Independent Music ( A2IM ) and its international equivalent , Merlin , remain holdouts .
A2IM 's Bengloff told us that Holt has negotiated with both of those organizations , and that Holt " gets it . "
This could be a sign that
MySpace might succeed in signing those indies as well .
That said ,
MySpace Music 's equity structure , as a joint venture between News Corp and the major labels with the labels owning as much as 40 percent , will make it difficult or impossible to place indies on completely equal footing .

3 . Make search results playable __
Holt says he locked the MySpace Music engineering team in a room for two months to get them to develop a search tool that brings up not only the artist profile , but also the songs the user is probably looking for .
Even better , the team made these search results playable directly on the results page , a la SeeqPod , and added a drag - and - drop playlist loader .
" We turned search into a content experience , and a playlist builder , "
he said .
This new horizontal and vertical design , coupled with the album pages , will let MySpace Music run features such as the top 100
albums in a genre , with every album playable , evergreen comment areas , and a drag - and - drop playlist for collecting your favorites .
Try that with a music magazine .
4 . Make playlists open and social
MySpace freed playlists from profile pages so they can now be played as independent units — somewhat in the style of Muxtape .
And users can now make as many playlists as they want , and share them with each other .
In the first two weeks after this change went live on the site ( around March 10 ) , MySpace users built more than 105 million public playlists — a promising indication that the team 's more open approach is paying off handsomely .
Holt said MySpace Music is considering allowing playlists to be embedded on external sites , as imeem does , but only if there 's a business reason to do so .
5 . Treat users like an artists
MySpace Music hopes these sharable playlists can make users feel like artists , except they 'll be known for their ability to curate , rather than their ability to create .
Holt and his team will be actively looking for the best playlist creators , whom they plan to publicize as tastemakers .
To help them gain a following , MySpace Music will add the ability to " follow " playlists and their creators in the way one would a Twitter feed .
MySpace is already the place where much of the world goes to hear any artist 's music right away , so huge potential exists for its MySpace Music service to become a key place to collect and discuss music .
Still , one can only wonder what may have happened if they 'd come out of the gate with the saddle more firmly attached to the horse .

IT IS an ill wind that blows no one any good .
For many in China even the buffeting by the gale that has hit the global economy has a bracing message .
The rise of China over the past three decades has been astonishing .
But it has lacked the one feature it needed fully to satisfy the ultranationalist fringe : an accompanying decline of the West .
Now capitalism is in a funk in its heartlands .
Europe and Japan , embroiled in the deepest post - war recession , are barely worth consideration as rivals .
America , the superpower , has passed its peak .
Although in public China 's leaders eschew triumphalism , there is a sense in Beijing that the reassertion of the Middle Kingdom 's global ascendancy is at hand ( see article ) .
China 's prime minister , Wen Jiabao , no longer sticks to the script that China is a humble player in world affairs that wants to focus on its own economic development .
He talks of China as a “ great power ” and worries about America 's profligate spending endangering his $ 1 trillion nest egg there .
Incautious remarks by the new American treasury secretary about China manipulating its currency were dismissed as ridiculous ; a duly penitent Hillary Clinton was welcomed in Beijing , but as an equal .
This month saw an apparent attempt to engineer a low - level naval confrontation with an American spy ship in the South China Sea .
Yet at least the Americans get noticed .
Europe , that speck on the horizon , is ignored : an EU summit was cancelled and France is still blacklisted because Nicolas Sarkozy dared to meet the Dalai Lama .
Already a big idea has spread far beyond China : that geopolitics is now a bipolar affair , with America and China the only two that matter .
Thus in London next month the real business will not be the G20 meeting but the “ G2 ” summit between Presidents Barack Obama and Hu Jintao .
This not only worries the Europeans , who , having got rid of George Bush 's unipolar politics , have no wish to see it replaced by a Pacific duopoly , and the Japanese , who have long been paranoid about their rivals in Asia .
It also seems to be having an effect in Washington , where Congress 's fascination with America 's nearest rival risks acquiring a protectionist edge .
Reds under the bed
Before panic spreads , it is worth noting that China 's new assertiveness reflects weakness as well as strength .
This remains a poor country facing , in Mr Wen 's words , its most difficult year of the new century .
The latest wild guess at how many jobs have already been lost — 20 m — hints at the scale of the problem .
The World Bank has cut its forecast for China 's growth this year to 6.5 % .
That is robust compared with almost anywhere else , but to many Chinese , used to double - digit rates , it will feel like a recession .
Already there are tens of thousands of protests each year : from those robbed of their land for development ; from laid - off workers ; from those suffering the side - effects of environmental despoliation .
Even if China magically achieves its official 8 % target , the grievances will worsen .
Far from oozing self - confidence , China is witnessing a fierce debate both about its economic system and the sort of great power it wants to be — and it is a debate the government does not like .
This year the regime curtailed even the perfunctory annual meeting of its parliament , the National People 's Congress ( NPC ) , preferring to confine discussion to back - rooms and obscure internet forums .
Liberals calling for greater openness are being dealt with in the time - honoured repressive fashion .
But China 's leaders also face rumblings of discontent from leftist nationalists , who see the downturn as a chance to halt market - oriented reforms at home , and for China to assert itself more stridently abroad .
An angry China can veer into xenophobia , but not all the nationalist left 's causes are so dangerous : one is for the better public services and social - safety net the country sorely needs .
So China is in a more precarious situation than many Westerners think .
The world is not bipolar and may never become so .
The EU , for all its faults , is the world 's biggest economy .
India 's population will overtake China's .
But that does not obscure the fact that China 's relative power is plainly growing — and both the West and China itself need to adjust to this .
For Mr Obama , this means pulling off a difficult balancing act .
In the longer term , if he has not managed to seduce China ( and for that matter India and Brazil ) more firmly into the liberal multilateral system by the time he leaves office , then historians may judge him a failure .
In the short term he needs to hold China to its promises and to scold it for its lapses : Mrs Clinton should have taken it to task over Tibet and human rights when she was there .
The Bush administration made much of the idea of welcoming China as a “ responsible stakeholder ” in the international system .
The G20 is a chance to give China a bigger stake in global decision - making than was available in the small clubs of the G7 and G8 .
But it is also a chance for China to show it can exercise its new influence responsibly .
The bill for the great Chinese takeaway
China 's record as a citizen of the world is strikingly threadbare .
On a host of issues from Iran to Sudan , it has used its main geopolitical asset , its permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council , to obstruct progress , hiding behind the excuse that it does not want to intervene in other countries ' affairs .
That , sadly , will take time to change .
But on the more immediate issue at hand , the world economy , there is room for action .
Over the past quarter - century no country has gained more from globalisation than China .
Hundreds of millions of its people have been dragged out of subsistence into the middle class .
China has been a grumpy taker in this process .
It helped derail the latest round of world trade talks .
The G20 meeting offers it a chance to show a change of heart .
In particular , it is being asked to bolster the IMF 's resources so that the fund can rescue crisis - hit countries in places like eastern Europe .
Some in Beijing would prefer to ignore the IMF , since it might help ex-communist countries that have developed “ an anti-China mentality ” .
Rising above such cavilling and paying up would be a small step in itself .
But it would be a sign that the Middle Kingdom has understood what it is to be a great power .
NEW YORK - Crude oil fell more than $ 1 a barrel after a government report showed that US inventories climbed to the highest since 1993 because of falling demand .
Supplies rose 3.3 million barrels to 356.6 million last week , the Energy Department said yesterday .
Inventories were forecast to increase by 1.1 million barrels , according to a Bloomberg News survey .
Stockpiles of gasoline and distillate fuel , a category that includes heating oil and diesel , dropped as refineries cut operating rates .
Crude oil for May delivery fell $ 1.21 to settle at $ 52.77 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Prices are up 18 percent this year .
It was the 22d inventory gain in 26 weeks .
The increase left supplies 13 percent higher than the five - year average for the period , the department said .
Imports of crude oil increased 204,000 barrels a day to 9.38 million in the week ended March 20 , the highest level in six weeks , the report showed .
Stockpiles at Cushing , Oklahoma , where New York - traded West Texas Intermediate crude is delivered , fell 2.21 million barrels to 31.7 million last week .
Supplies in the week ended Feb. 6 were the highest since at least April 2004 , when the Energy Department began keeping records for the location .
" It 's hard to get bullish about crude oil with inventories at the highest since 1993 , " said Tom Bentz , a senior energy analyst at BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc. in New York .
" The only thing that 's positive for crude prices is the fall in supplies at Cushing . "
Consumption of fuels rose 2.2 percent to 19.2 million barrels a day last week .
Total daily fuel demand averaged over the past four weeks was 19.1 million barrels , down 3.2 percent from a year earlier .
Refineries operated at 82 percent of capacity , down 0.1 percentage point from the prior week , the Energy Department said .
Gasoline stockpiles dropped 1.14 million barrels to 214.6 million last week .
The decline left inventories 0.4 percent lower than the five - year average for the week , the department said .
A 650,000 - barrel drop was forecast , according to a Bloomberg News survey .

I keep seeing those ads on television about victims of mesothelioma , caused by exposure to asbestos , did some googling about the issue .
Lo and behold , it has an Iraq and Middle Eastern dimension ( as well as implications for US Iraq vets . )
As if we did n’t have enough to worry about some websites on the subject are reporting that US troops faced asbestos exposure in all those ramshackle buildings they were sent into , or ordered to bomb or demolish .
You can only imagine how much asbestos they inhaled that way .
The recommendation is that they be issued safety gear goggles and masks where this danger is reasonably expected to exist .
Not to mention the danger to Iraqis– it is not clear that the country has yet stopped importing the stuff , and it is still used elsewhere in the Middle East , too .
The issue even is related to Dick Cheney , Halliburton and KBR — all of them later involved heavily in Iraq ( though I do n’t know if they had learned their lesson about asbestos by then ) .
I had known that Cheney ’s decision - making contributed to Halliburton ’s later bankruptcy filing but had n’t realized how central asbestos and damage claims arising from its use was to it all .

Released We Are Change members tell of “ inhumane , insane surreal ” experience
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Monday , March 30 , 2009
We Are Change New York members have described the “ inhumane , insane and surreal ” experience of being arrested by police for asking Mayor Bloomberg a question and promise that “ the full story of this incident is yet to be heard . ”
Luke Rudkowski , along with fellow We Are Change members Manny and Anthony , were all arrested on Saturday night for asking Bloomberg a question about 9/11 first responders outside the Hilton Hotel on Sixth Avenue .
They followed orders by police to stay in one designated area and yet were arrested for trespassing and were later hit with the charge of “ impersonating a journalist , ” despite having Infowars press credentials .
As The George Washington Blog points out today , “ The media organization which sponsors Rudkowski is Infowars.com , a website which has many times the readership of small town “ establishment ” or “ professional ” newspapers .
Indeed , given the popularity of Infowars and its sister sites , Prisonplanet.com and Jonesreport.com , the Infowars news network probably has more readers than all but the largest traditional newspapers .
So the issue can not be one of size or audience . ”
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Our recent exclusive report about the MIAC controversy became a national story , being covered by Fox News and the Associated Press , amongst hundreds of other mainstream news outlets .
To claim that Infowars is not a genuine media outfit is manifestly absurd .
“ Rudkowski ’s arrest – like Amy Goodman ’s arrest at the RNC convention for documenting violence against protestors – is an attempt to crack down on real attempts to question the powers - that - be and to document their actions , ” concludes the George Washington Blog .
The We Are Change members have all now finally been released from Manhattan central bookings .
They plan to air a live web broadcast at 10 pm Eastern tonight to tell the full story and broadcast footage that led up to the incident .
However , since the prosecution has seized all three of the group ’s cameras and footage of the incident as criminal evidence , new cameras will have to be purchased .
We Are Change are asking all concerned activists to help them buy more cameras and create a legal defense fund by making a donation .
They are also asking anyone who can offer legal services to contact [ email protected ]
The court case will be in two months and the group is planning a countersuit on the basis of false arrest , official oppression and violation of the 1st amendment .
“ You can try to stop me , but you cant stop the idea of CHANGE !
This is not over by any means , ” promises Luke Rudkowski .

Comment on this article
After nearly two weeks of fighting , the outline of a ceasefire may be emerging .
But there is no telling where the stumbling diplomacy may lead
DESPAIR quivered in Muhammad al - Majdalawi's voice as he described the Jabaliya refugee camp in the northern Gaza Strip , four days after Israeli troops had entered the territory .
“ The soldiers are 500 metres from my house , ” he said .
“ Three children in my neighbourhood were killed last night .
The walls in my house are shaking .
Every minute there are explosions , every minute there are martyrs .
We can't sleep , we can't move , we have almost no food , no electricity , and it 's very cold . ”
He spoke hurriedly , afraid that his mobile phone would run out of power .
The death toll of Palestinians has risen inexorably .
Twelve days after the Israeli offensive began , Palestinians put the number at more than 770 , with at least 2,500 wounded .
Israel claims to have killed more than 130 Hamas fighters .
Some medical sources in Gaza say that as many as 40 % of the dead are women and children , and that a large majority have been non-combatants .
Several entire families have been wiped out .
On January 4th Gaza 's main vegetable market was hit : five people were killed , 40 wounded .
Two days later a school run by the United Nations in the Jabaliya camp was shelled , leaving at least 30 dead .
Nearly all were children .
Gazans have long felt they lived in an open prison ; now they are trapped in a shooting gallery .
The health services are flagging .
Eighteen months under siege had already drained hospitals of medicine and working equipment .
Now fuel for the generators has nearly run out .
Exhausted and demoralised staff struggle to find space for the wounded and the dead .
Since the operation started on December 27th , Israel has hit more than 1,000 targets from sea and air , including roads , government buildings , mosques , police stations , smuggling tunnels , rocket launchers and the Islamic University .
Seven Israeli soldiers have been killed , four by errant Israeli tank fire .
Hamas attacks on Israel have been reduced to about 30 rockets a day ; four Israeli civilians have died since the start of the war .
Israeli forces have so far stayed outside the main urban areas of Gaza .
So Hamas may still claim to have won , or at least not lost , the battle .
The Israelis say their strikes have targeted only Hamas ; they claim that the university , for instance , housed a Hamas laboratory .
There is no doubt , however , that the bombardment has hammered the civilian infrastructure .
The sole power plant has been shut down .
Of Gaza 's 1.5 m people , two - thirds lack electricity and nearly half have no running water .
Raw sewage is spilling into the streets , risking epidemics .
Most of the petrol stations in Gaza are closed .
Diesel fuel , which used to be smuggled from Egypt through tunnels that have been bombed , is no longer available on the black market .
Cooking gas and heating fuel are scarce .
In a cold winter , many families leave their windows open for fear of shattering glass from explosions .
People drag mattresses to the middle of their rooms and huddle together to keep warm .
The UN's World Food Programme gives warning of a looming crisis .
Flour , rice , sugar , milk , canned food and fresh meat have nearly run out .
Another UN agency says that fewer than 20 bakeries are still working .
Hundreds of people queue outside those that still sell bread .
One man waited for five hours , only to buy one packet of pitta bread to feed his large family for a day .
Others are living on stale bread and tea , heated on fires made out of pieces of wood and cartons collected on the street .
When the electricity supply briefly comes back on , people rush for their phone chargers .
Once plugged in , they turn on their televisions and , if they are rich enough to have computers , check their e-mails or contact relatives on Skype .
For a moment they feel less isolated .
But soon there is yet another blackout , and darkness falls again .
What Israel wants
As the casualties mount , Israel is increasingly obliged to justify its tactics .
Why , for example , did it shell the UN school , which had been assigned as a temporary refuge , and whose GPS co-ordinates had been given to the Israeli army ?
Because , officials said , Hamas fighters and a mortar crew had been spotted just outside it , and the building itself was booby - trapped or housed explosives .
( The UN hotly denies this . )
Israel also leaked intelligence information purporting to show that senior Hamas fighters and politicians were holed up in a warren of underground chambers under Shifa Hospital , the main health - care centre in Gaza City .
Israeli spokesmen said Hamas deliberately and cynically operated close to civilians .
Hence the number of children killed in the fighting .
But the alarming increase in the number of civilians among the Palestinian dead has jolted Israeli policymakers .
They remember 1996 , when an Israeli sweep against Hizbullah in southern Lebanon ended peremptorily when shells killed more than 100 civilians .
Rather than withdraw from Gaza , where the fighting has so far been inconclusive , Israel is now poised to send in units of reservists ( see article ) .
This would signal a determination to destroy Hamas 's strongholds completely .
The possibility of a wider ground war has spurred outside efforts to broker a ceasefire .
In the vacuum of the American presidential transition , a trio of European foreign ministers ( plus a brace of leading Eurocrats ) have been trying to fill the diplomatic gap by shuttling around the Middle East .
At the same time France 's president , Nicolas Sarkozy , has been engaged in a one - man peace mission .
The Europeans all carried — more or less — the same message : a call for an immediate halt to military action by Israel , matched by an unconditional ending of rocket attacks by Hamas .
All that was backed by an offer of renewed European help to oversee security at Rafah , Gaza 's border crossing into Egypt .
This is the Gaza Strip 's only opening to the outside world that does not depend solely on Israel .
Israel is holding out for ceasefire terms that would guarantee an end to arms smuggling across or under Gaza 's border with Egypt .
The border has never been made watertight , though the Egyptians are at present keeping it closed except for a trickle of medical aid .
After meeting Mr Sarkozy on January 6th , Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak repeated the French president 's calls for a ceasefire and agreed to discussions about how to police the border .
The two then put their proposal to the UN .
This is Mr Mubarak 's first public signal that he could co-operate once again with the Americans to create a border - crossing regime that might satisfy Israel .
According to Israeli sources , this would involve American engineers and other civilians helping Egyptian forces to ensure that the ground below the border is not again honeycombed with tunnels .
The Americans would use sophisticated technology to detect new digging .
Above - ground fences would be strengthened and Egypt would sharpen its intelligence in the Sinai Peninsula to spot and stop arms - smugglers .
The outgoing American secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , welcomed Egypt 's plan at the UN Security Council .
“ When this ends , ” she said , “ there must be new arrangements in place , not a return to the status quo ante . ”
Mr Mubarak has publicly blamed Hamas for the violence and is keen to prevent it from boasting of a victory .
And he is loth to admit that Hamas 's missiles have come into Gaza via Egypt .
The Egyptian government is jealous of its sovereignty in Sinai , the desert east of Gaza , but may now be ready to accept limited help from outside .
Mediators in Jerusalem and Ramallah , the headquarters of the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) that is still run by the Fatah group , Hamas 's rival for supremacy among the Palestinians , are trying to arrange a new border regime .
They envisage somehow restoring PA border guards — in fact , Fatah soldiers or police — at the Rafah crossing .
They would act alongside Egyptian officers , probably reinforced by returning monitors from the European Union .
A long - established division of labour in the Middle East supposed that America would deliver Israel , in the event of a long - lasting peace deal , and the EU ( the largest donor of aid to the Palestinians ) would deliver the Palestinian side .
But the EU does not talk directly to Hamas .
It is on its list of terrorist organisations .
Besides , Mahmoud Abbas , the Palestinian president , has asked Europeans not to talk to it , for fear of undermining the PA 's claims to represent all Palestinians .
And direct talks with Hamas might damage the EU 's credibility as a peace - broker with Israel .
Some EU officials say that if a credible ceasefire deal is on offer , the EU will find ways of reaching understandings with Hamas .
The EU 's foreign - policy chief , Javier Solana , maintains a channel of communication through Omar Suleiman , the head of Egyptian intelligence .
Dropping in on President Bashar Assad of Syria on January 6th , Mr Sarkozy asked him to use his influence to help all sides “ return to reason ” .
If the diplomacy succeeds and the fighting stops , the Israeli government will claim that “ Operation Cast Lead ” has dealt a telling blow to Hamas and sent a powerful message of deterrence and determination to the wider region .
The Gaza campaign has enjoyed support across the political spectrum , except among the Arab - Israeli parties .
Most peace - minded Israelis see Hamas 's missiles , with their increasing range , as a real threat to the state , not because of the limited damage and disruption they cause but because their incessant drizzle from across Gaza 's border has begun to make the prospect of a two - state solution , with Israelis and Palestinians living side - by - side in peace , seem untenable .
As Israel 's general election ( due on February 10th ) approaches , Ehud Barak , the defence minister who leads the Labour Party , and Tzipi Livni , the foreign minister who leads Kadima , the other main party in the ruling coalition , will both argue that the assault on Hamas in Gaza will make it easier for them — and more urgent — to forge peace with the Fatah - run PA .
Mr Barak will add , of course , that it was he who planned and ran so successful a military campaign .
But will Hamas budge ?
Hamas , meanwhile , has proved remarkably consistent in its aims .
True to its name , derived from the Arabic acronym for Islamic Resistance Movement , its strategy has been simply to keep the flame of resistance to Israel burning , with the ultimate goal of recovering all of historic Palestine .
Until the party contested Palestinian legislative elections in 2006 , and won , Hamas had conceded dominance of state institutions to its older , secular and nationalist rival , Fatah .
Once it won the election and found the world , led by America , seeking to isolate it and showering aid and arms on Fatah , divisions between the parties naturally widened : to the point where the Islamists , in the summer of 2007 , evicted Fatah from Gaza , leaving it in charge only of the rump Palestinian proto - state in the West Bank .
With its unilateral withdrawal from Gaza in 2005 , Israel had sought to wash its hands of the crowded , increasingly radicalised territory .
Yet it retained control of Gaza 's borders , airspace and supplies of water and power , while continuing to hold thousands of Palestinian prisoners , and continuing to expand its settlements on the West Bank .
So while Israel professed outrage at Hamas 's lobbing of rockets from Gaza , which had killed precisely one Israeli between July and the start of the present Israeli onslaught , the group 's supporters countered that they were simply exercising a right to “ resist ” this new mutation of Israeli occupation .

Too hard a lesson
After its 2007 victory , Hamas consolidated its hold over Gaza .
The mounting blockade by Israel , with American support and Egyptian acquiescence , was intended to force it to accept Israel 's right to exist and to renounce violence ; but Hamas refused to bend .
Its leaders believed that Israel could not blockade Gaza for ever in the face of growing global concern .
In particular , they reckoned that Egypt , as a Muslim and Arab neighbour , would eventually succumb to public outrage at its complicity in the siege .
But Egypt 's rulers proved unexpectedly stubborn ; not merely because they loathe Islamists , but because they feared , perhaps rightly , that Israel had intended all along to foist Gaza and its troubles onto them , perpetuating the truncation of the putative Palestinian state .
This is why they have insisted that the border will open only in accordance with an old protocol that would let the Fatah - dominated PA , and not Hamas , control the crossing .
Hamas remains committed to the immediate aim , beyond a ceasefire , of forcing an end to the siege , preferably by obliging Egypt to open its border .
Such an opening would , it hopes , not only allow for a free flow of aid , but would also amount to a tacit recognition of Hamas 's legitimacy as Gaza 's government .
In the long run , perhaps , that may be translated into some kind of legitimacy in the West , too .
But in the meantime Hamas 's fighters will continue to battle on , calculating that every day they continue to hold out , their cause gains strength .
For the time being , divisions within the movement have been healed , the carnage caused by Israel is making them popular , and they are still able to strike back .
On January 6th a Hamas missile hit the town of Gedera , just 20 miles from Tel Aviv , the farthest one has ever reached .
Arab dilemmas
For Arabs , the pain of watching Gaza 's agony is double .
This is not just because Palestinians are their kin .
It is because they have seen it all before , generation after generation , in place after place , and have been able to do very little to relieve the suffering .
Arab delays and difficulties over Gaza stem from a broader regional split that has pitted a “ resistance ” faction , including Iran , Syria and their militia allies , Hizbullah in Lebanon and Hamas in Palestine , against such Western - backed , pro-peace - with - Israel governments as those of Egypt , Jordan , the rump PA on the West Bank , and Saudi Arabia .
These governments hope for Hamas 's defeat ; the resisters hope , if not for an unlikely Hamas victory , then at least for Gaza 's rulers to survive , as proof that Israel cannot simply smash all its enemies into submission .
On January 8th rockets were fired into Israel from Lebanon , either by Hizbullah or Palestinian fighters .
But there is hardly an Arab city of any size that has not witnessed noisy protests , directed not only against Israel or America , but also against Egypt .
As demonstrators in Berlin hurled shoes at the Egyptian embassy , an online poll run by al - Jazeera , the most - watched Arab TV channel , revealed that 94 % of respondents believed some Arab governments were complicit in Israel 's attack .
Such feelings have now galvanised even those who had hoped to see Hamas punished .
Hence the decision , by Egypt and France , jointly to float their ceasefire plan at the UN .
Most governments , including the Bush administration , immediately endorsed the proposal .
Yet it remains unclear whether the actual belligerents will accept it .
Israel , though responding “ favourably ” to the UN initiative and saying it has agreed on the “ principles ” of a truce , is still debating how far it is prepared to go in its efforts to crush Hamas .
And Hamas leaders , though desperate for a ceasefire , will balk at any deal that reeks of capitulation .
Meanwhile Barack Obama , America 's president - elect , has remained deafeningly silent , refusing to take sides , though his friends say he will leap into the diplomatic fray the moment he takes office .
Israel may want to finish the military job in Gaza before he does so .

Italian artist Maurizio Savini has distinguished himself by using a very unusual material for his sculptures : pink chewing gum .
Here are some of his works .
Over the last 10 years Italian artist Maurizio Savini has been creating a series of sculptures using thousands of pieces of chewing gum .
The life size sculptures include a buffalo , a grizzly bear and suited businessmen suspended in gymnastic poses .
His works have been exhibited internationally and some of his pieces have sold for approximately 55 000USD .
They have recently been shown at testori UK gallery , London .
Chewing - gum , as a matter of fact known in Italian also as “ American gum “ , was introduced by American soldiers with the end of World war two together with jeans , nylon , stocking and boggie - woggie .
Its association with a state of euphoria of change and carefree youthfulness some how carried on in the following decades .
Also for those born in the sixties as Maurizio Savini and I , chewing - gum reaches in the mind ‘s meanders at a tie with childhood and adolescence , and a light pressure of a future still to be built and dreamt and the slaughterhouse of personal and collective memories of the past which is gone , no one knows where when and with whom .
The sensual act of chewing , the voluptuous warmth of rebelling saliva , the artificial and secretly aseptic fragrance which spreads from the mouth as a promise and missed kiss .
The synthetic fleshliness of the pink color , the obsessive square shape of the product unwrapped and ready to be shred to pieces by the power of the tongue , all compete in crashing on the senses .
Applying all this to the power and energy of the Sculpture and its history causes a short circuit having the capacity of turning the ludic into stately and vice versa .
The strict minimalism of parallelepiped is subverted by the uniform coating with many bars of chewing - gum completely cover it , rendering chewable to desire , soft and provoking to forbidden touch , what was abstract and distant .
Still Boggie- Woggie

In the past few years hundreds of LGBT families have tried to get tickets to the White House Easter Egg Roll as part of an outing by the Family Equality Council .
The campaign event is an opportunity for America to come face to face with loving and committed gay and lesbian couples raising children .
This year there are two big differences to note .
For starters , Obama has reached out to the Family Equality Council inviting LGBT families to sign up ( what a change from the former administration ) , and 2nd the sign - up for tickets will be done online as opposed to waiting in line .
March 2006 video coverage of LGBT families going to egg roll .
Tickets will be available on March 26th , nobody knows the time , so from midnight tonight start checking , they will run out fast !
White House Easter Egg-roll
If you are chosen for tickets , let the FEC know !

LIMA , Peru ( CNN ) --
A mayor in Peru has suggested that the federal government legalize illicit drugs and administer them through the national health ministry , a newspaper reported Friday .
Peruvian authorities show the press 1,500 kilograms of cocaine seized in March 2008 .
Gustavo Sierra , mayor of the Surquillo district in Lima , said a federal drug law is hypocritical because it allows maximum legally allowed quantities for some drugs and plants but does n't say where to acquire them , the Peru 21 newspaper reported in a front - page story headlined , " Say yes to drugs ? "
Sierra said the federal government should adopt his position in its war on drugs , adding that he will take the matter up with the nation 's executive branch .
His proposal has drawn strong criticism as well as support .
Milton Rojas , a specialist with a private , nonprofit , anti-drug organization called Cedro , told Peru 21 that the mayor 's initiative would lead to greater drug use .
" This is not an alternative that corresponds with Peruvian reality , given drugs ' low prices and large production , " Rojas said .
" There are no serious studies concerning the legalization of stupefacients . "
In addition , Rojas said some drugs -- such as PCP -- are addictive and have bad health consequences .
" Legalizing drugs would only bring more insecurity , " he said .
" It still would be sold on the street . "
Others see it differently .
Social psychologist Baldomero Cacares told Peru 21 he favors the mayor 's proposal because changing the nation 's drug laws is indispensable .
" I am in favor of marijuana and cocaine leaf , " Cacares said .
" They are medicinal plants rejected by science because of the false belief that they are drugs . "
It has been demonstrated , he told Peru 21 , that those plants can help some diseases , including some eye treatments , anxiety and depression .
" There are modern medical treatments that use these components , " he said .
" They are not used here . "
Cocaine , he said , should be used in pharmaceutical labs again because it has demonstrated pain - relieving qualities .
Cacares said he remembers a throat lozenge in the 1950s that used cocaine .
Surquillo , in the central part of Peru 's capital , Lima , is a lower - and middle - income residential and commercial district , parts of which are considered dangerous .
Several travel
Web sites warn about crime , one of them saying : " Surquillo should be avoided , specially at night .
Do not ever walk alone there .
It is full of thieves and gang violence . "
Surquillo is one of 43 districts that make up Lima , the district 's Web site says .
It has a population of about 100,000 .
The district has a motto on its Web site : " Surquillo is changing .
...
You change too . "

Are zero - tolerance policies turning schools into authoritarian fiefdoms ?
A case today before the Supreme Court challenges how far schools can go .
I
n Manassas , Va. , a 9 - year - old student was suspended for giving a friend a Certs breath mint under a policy that not only bans any drugs but also anything that looks like a drug .
A girl in Oklahoma was suspended for bringing a prescription hormone tablet to school to deal with her ovarian disease .
At least 20 students in four states have been suspended for bringing Alka - Seltzer to their schools .
Under zero - tolerance policies , officials across the country have been suspending kids for possession of aspirin , cough medicine and even sunscreen .
The question is what lessons are being taught to our children about basic rights of speech , privacy and due process .
Even more troubling , what type of citizens are we shaping in this increasingly arbitrary and authoritarian atmosphere ?
This controversy will be before the U.S. Supreme Court today in the case of Savana Redding .
Six years ago , Savana was a 13 - year - old eighth - grader when her friend was found with prescription ibuprofen pills .
When the friend was searched , teachers at her Arizona school also found a day - planner that Redding had loaned her .
The friend implicated Redding as the source of the ibuprofen .
A good student without disciplinary problems , Redding was confronted by assistant principal Kerry Wilson .
She denied any knowledge of the pills but agreed to let Wilson search her bag .
When no ibuprofen was found , Redding was taken to the nurse 's office and told to strip down to her underwear in front of the school nurse and an administrative assistant , both women .
She stood in her underwear and bra as the two went through her clothes .
Finding nothing , they then made the teen move her bra and panties , exposing her breasts and pelvic area .
Redding sued .
After a lower court found the search to be unreasonable , the Supreme Court took up the issue — the latest in a long line of cases that have treated students as little more than legal nonentities .
This is a far cry from 1969 , when the Supreme Court insisted that students do not " shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate . "
Over the next few decades , however , a new and more conservative majority chipped away at these rights to the point that most are now lost long before students even approach the schoolhouse gate .
Indeed , the courts have allowed students to be punished for speech occurring outside of school , including on social networking sites .
The Supreme Court has given shifting and conflicting rationales to justify school searches .
In 1985 , it ruled that students have little expectation of privacy in schools — a self - fulfilling prophecy given its failure to protect their rights .
Ten years later , in Vernonia School District v. Acton , the court allowed random suspicionless drug testing of student athletes .
But the justices based their decision on the school 's history of drug problems and the fact that athletes were susceptible to a particular danger of injury if using drugs .
The court insisted that athletes have less expectation of privacy because they have to undress in open locker rooms and that forcing teenagers to urinate in cups under the supervision of teachers was a " negligible " intrusion .
Then , in 2002 , the court all but abandoned its earlier logic .
Justice Clarence
Thomas wrote that it did not matter if there was no history of drug problems in Tecumseh , Okla . , and dismissed the notion that athletes warranted different treatment .
The court allowed random and suspicionless testing of any students in extracurricular activities from 4 - H to chess club .
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented , mocking the " nightmarish images of out - of - control flatware , livestock run amok , and colliding tubas disturbing the peace and quiet of Tecumseh . "
In the current case , few people would disagree that the search of Redding 's backpack was justified .
After all , there had been a couple of prior incidents involving drugs at the school , and the teachers heard that students were planning to take the ibuprofen at lunch as a dare .
Yet , the quantum leap from a bag search to a strip search shows how the court has created virtual feudal estates where students are treated as scholastic serfs .
The impact of such a search on a 13 - year - old girl being stripped in front of teachers is obvious and severe .
Ironically , nurses at most public schools cannot give a student an aspirin without notifying and getting the consent of the parents .
Yet , rather than simply hold the student for parents or police , the school can force the child to strip and expose herself without even notice to the parents .
We need to think seriously about the type of citizens being shaped in these authoritarian environments .
These kids are learning that they must accept arbitrary and often illogical actions by public figures .
This month in Virginia , an honors high school student was suspended and faces expulsion for taking her prescribed birth control pill in school .
With such cases , the government appears to be training a generation of passive citizens ideal for subjugation and control .
In the name of maintaining safe schools , we have created rights - free zones that treat free speech and privacy as virtual threats to education .
When citizens learn rights as mere abstractions , we should not be surprised when they treat their obligations as citizens with the same disregard .
Until rights join writing and arithmetic as required components of public education , our schools will remain laboratories of authoritarian living .

Battlestar Galactica :
What the frak happened in the series finale ?
I thought about posting last night , but I ’ve gotten into a rhythm this season with letting the episode marinate in my brain overnight and then posting on Saturday morning .
I know a lot of people TiVo shows nowadays ( myself included ) and end up watching the episode later that night , the next day or the next week , so there is n’t a huge rush to get something up .
Was it a great finale ?
Absolutely .
Was I blown away ?
Not entirely .
Let ’s start at the beginning ( which is always a good place to start ) — more flashbacks of life on Caprica .
Bill is thinking about retiring and entering the private sector , Roslin has a blind date with a former student , Lee gets to know Kara .
Great , let ’s move on .
Back in the future , Baltar ’s vision tells him that he will “ take mankind ’s remnants and guide them to their end . ”
Last week , after watching him struggle with the decision in the hanger , I wondered whether or not Gaius would in fact volunteer to go along with the rescue mission .
The truth is that it should have been obvious that he would .
Creator Ronald D. Moore was n’t about to take one of the main players out of the game in crunch time .
After an emotional scene between Roslin and Doc Coddle , Laura had a great line :
“ Do n’t spoil your image .
Just light a cigarette and go and grumble . ”
Then the planning began for the assault on the colony — that ’s when the episode really got going .
The final four move Sam to the CIC ( more on this later ) and Galactica prepares to jump .
Like just about every battle scene in the entire series , this one rocked .
Galactica jumps in and immediately starts to get pummeled by the colony ’s weapons .
After the terrific rescue mission on New Caprica , the show had a lot to live up to , and once the birds were away and Bill ordered his crew to ram the colony , Moore and Co. had cleared the bar .
It was very cool to see Lee leading a group of Centurions into the colony .
Even when they ’re on “ our ” side , they still scare the ever - loving crap out of me .
It ’s still a little incredible that Kara ’s group would find Hera so quickly , but Boomer came to their aid .
She broke that Cylon ’s neck ( !!! ) and got Hera out of there .
It just goes to show what kind of an effect that little girl has on people / machines .
After a great scene with Boomer , Athena , Helo and Kara — with Kara ’s great line , “ Uh , can we not tell her the plan ! ” —
Athena kills her “ sister ” and the group makes its escape .
When Boomer said that she owed the old man , I thought she was referring to the fact that she once tried to kill him , but apparently she was talking about one day when she was a rookie and Bill gave her another chance to complete her raptor landing .
( Maybe it ’s just me , but I think she owes him more for the attempted assassination . )
Meanwhile , on Galactica , Gaius and Caprica Six are chitchatting while they ’re waiting for something to shoot .
That ’s when they both see both visions , who say , “ You will hold the futures of humans and Cylons in your hands . ”
Now there has been a lot of speculation about what his / their visions represent , but they ’re not crazy and they do n’t have chips in their heads ( or at least Gaius does n’t ) .
Moore said on “ The Last Frakking Special ” that Baltar ’s visions were divine .
They were guiding him down this path , and his storyline over the last few episodes revolved around his possible redemption .
He turned over the keys to Caprica ’s defense systems to his Six and that allowed the near - destruction of the human race .
Granted , he did n’t know that ’s what he was doing at the time , but he is still responsible for his actions .
Anyway , Baltar starts firing his gun and it turns out that Lee and his gang are just around the corner .
Then there was this subtle yet fantastic interaction …
Baltar : Sorry about that .
Lee : Doc , you did good .
Succinct and to the point , that was one of the most touching moments in the entire finale ( for me ) .
Lee has always been one of Baltar ’s harshest critics and for Gaius to do enough to earn a compliment from him ( which was no doubt boosted by the Doctor ’s decision to stay on Galactica ) , it was a major milestone in Baltar ’s road to redemption .
So Hera runs off as Helo is shot , and the whole opera house flashbacks begin .
This was a very cool way to intertwine the show ’s past with its present and give meaning to those dreams .
I ’m guessing this was Moore ’s plan from the start .
Usually , when you ’re writing fiction , you know how it begins and how it ends , and you ’ll figure out the middle later .
I think once Moore introduced the opera house dream , he knew that it was going to come full circle as all the parties involved search for Hera on Galactica .
The dreams made Caprica Six and Baltar look nefarious , as if they were snatching the girl away .
But in fact , they had the best interests of the girl at heart .
This all led to Baltar and Caprica Six taking Hera into the CIC , where the final five were positioned above them , same as the dream .
Very , very cool .
All right , so somehow Cavil gets a hold of Hera , and instead of Bill or someone else putting a bullet in his “ brain , ” Baltar finally redeems himself .
If he ’s not on Galactica ( the one true , selfless act that Lee was talking about earlier this season ) , then he ’s not there to convince Cavil to give up the girl , and who knows how that confrontation ends .
Gaius talks about the visions , refers to them as “ angels ” and gets Cavil to buy into the whole “ let ’s break the cycle of violence ” plan , providing that the final five give the cylons the key to resurrection .
Only the plan goes awry when Tyrol sees Torry ’s memory of killing his wife — so he flips out and kills her .
Cavil , ever the survivor , says “ frak ” and offs himself .
This does n’t make any sense to me .
Anyway , now it ’s time for Starbuck to take over .
Moore did a great job of setting up this scene .
From the final four hearing “ All Along the Watchtower , ” to Hera giving the drawing to Starbuck , to her interaction with her “ dad ” in the bar , to her working with Anders to try to put the song into some sort of numerical connotation , it was a long , fleshed - out journey .
Of course , the fact that she jumped Galactica to a second Earth ( which oddly enough , has all the same continents as the original Earth ) requires a huge leap of faith .
It ’s clear now that Moore is pushing the idea of intelligent design , which he ( possibly ) sees as a compromise between the inaccuracies of the Bible ( as they relate to established science ) and the finality of atheism .
This is confirmed when Bill , Gaius , Coddle and a few others are observing a tribe of prehistoric humans walk by .
The fact that humans evolved independently requires some sort of a belief in divine intervention .
At some point , Starbuck / Lee have a flashback to the time that they met , and it turns out that they almost slept together .
But the most important part of the flashback was Kara revealing that she is n’t afraid of death .
It ’s not that she does n’t know fear , she does , but she ’s not afraid of dying , which was yet another clue that she was not human ( nor cylon ) .
Whatever she is — some sort of angel that walks the Earth , twice — she is built in such away that she ’s not afraid of death , and this lack of fear has allowed her to do amazing things in her time with the fleet .
Regarding the other flashbacks , I think we were supposed to see just how close Bill was to not being in charge of Galactica at the time of the attack and what it took for Roslin to convince herself that a move into politics was the right thing for her .
I ’m not sure why it took sleeping with her former student ( though that ’s admittedly a bit on the sketchy side , even that late in life ) , but that ’s what it took .
Back to New Earth .
Not unlike the finale to the “ Lord of the Rings ” trilogy , this one had about five or six endings .
It ’s understandable — the viewers want to know how each major character moves on , and it ’s impossible to do that quickly .
I think that this is why they decided to do a two - hour combined finale instead of breaking it up into two episodes .
It just would n’t have worked as well separately .
All right , so the assumption is that the fleet is willing to give up all of their technology and live and breed with the natives .
There ’s no other way to explain the lack of technology , so I guess I ’m willing to buy it .
I just have a hard time believing that the fleet , after arguing about every little thing , would be so homogeneous in its position on this .
Back in April of 2008 , I wrote the following on the blog entry for this season ’s ( first ) premiere …
Based on what I ’ve read , it does appear that the fleet will find some version of Earth this season .
They could arrive in our past , our present or our future , or they could arrive to an alternate version of Earth .
They could be the first humans to settle on Earth ( maybe the two hybrid babies are Adam and Eve – though all the technology would be a problem ) or they could arrive to a futuristic Earth that has the ability to fend of the Cylons .
A grimmer possibility is that they arrive to find that the human civilization destroyed itself , not unlike the ending of “ Planet of the Apes . ”
It turns out I was almost right .
( Mind you , this does n’t mean anything — I floated all sorts of theories on this blog so I was bound to have one or two that turned out to be right . )
They did find a “ Planet of the Apes ” - type Earth , but they found it early in the season , which opened up more possibilities for the finale .
It was revealed that Tyrol ’s son was n’t really his son , so the Adam and Eve thing was out ( which is probably good , since Moore is going with more of an intelligent design explanation ) but it did turn out that Hera was Eve…mitochondrial Eve , that is .
So let ’s see …
— After killing Torry , Galen is sick of people and wants to live and die alone .
In about five years , I picture him sitting in a tent somewhere cold ( with a huge , grizzly beard ) , wishing that he had some interpersonal interaction .
Before he leaves ,
Tigh says that he would have done the same thing to Torry had she killed Ellen .
Apparently , Tigh is the only one who is allowed to kill his wife …
— We were treated to a semi-useless flashback of Ellen and Tigh in the strip club where she says that all she wants to do is spend time with him .
So now they get to spend a lot of time together .
( How ’s that going to work if they do n’t have any booze ? )
— Helo is going to teach Hera how to hunt .
No , Athena is .
No Helo is .
I get it .
They ’re happy .
( At least Helo did n’t die — when he got shot , I thought he might be Moore ’s sacrificial lamb . )
— Bill takes off with Laura to show her some wildlife .
The way he said goodbye to Lee and Starbuck ( after saying , “ I do n’t have much time left . ” ) , I thought he was going to fly off into the sun .
After all , he ca n’t leave that raptor lying around for future scientists to find , right ?
So I ’m assuming that after he buried Laura , that ’s just what he did .
( I ’m not sure why he kept talking about the cabin after she died though .
I think that ’s where the title of the last three hours , “ Daybreak , ” came from . )
And here ’s a tip :
If someone tells you that they think their “ work is done , ” do n’t look away .
They ’re just going to disappear .
Starbuck is apparently some sort of angel ( who ca n’t see Baltar ’s angels ) who was sent to Caprica to help guide the fleet to New Earth .
Moore did n’t have a whole lot of options with her when he said that there would be no more “ surprise cylons ” after they revealed the final five .
She could n’t be a cylon and she could n’t be human , because she found her body on Earth .
So she had to be something else .
So that ’s what she was — something else .
And then there ’s Baltar and Caprica Six , who decided to start a farm .
Baltar knows about farming because of his dad , which was one of the purposes of his flashback .
And this is one of the problems I have with Lee ’s intention to break the cycle by saying , “ no cities . ”
People are eventually going to settle down .
When they learn how to grow things , they ’re going to stay in one place , and that ’s how towns are developed .
When there are towns , there are eventually going to be cities .
And when there are cities , there are eventually going to be killer robots .
Or I guess that ’s what Moore is saying .
When we jump forward 150,000 years to modern day New York , was anyone really surprised ?
It was a really cool transition — the camera hovering over Central Park before shooting up to show all the skyscrapers — and that ’s when Moore actually made his cameo .
He was the guy holding the magazine about mitochondrial Eve that the vision of Caprica Six was reading .
I get the sense that the vision of Six and the vision of Baltar are actually angels that can take any form .
In this case , they took the form of Baltar and Six so that they could communicate with the real Baltar and Six .
Moore left them in that form for the final scene for continuity ’s sake , as it would have been strange to see two new actors in their place .
Moore gets a little preachy here with all of the “ technology run amok ” talk , and the implication is that we ’re headed towards destruction if we continue down this path .
I ’m not sure exactly what path he ’s talking about , but given the montage of shots at the end , he ’s most likely referring to the work being done in the world of robotics .
I ’ve heard this story before .
The vision of Caprica Six says that she thinks this time it will be different , saying that something unexpected may come up because “ that too is in God ’s plan . ”
This is when Baltar says something odd , and I ’m not really sure what it means …
“ You know it does n’t like that name …
Silly me .
Silly , silly me . ”
Okay , so he ’s referring to a higher power , one that he knows well enough to know that “ it ” does n’t like to be called “ God . ”
I ’m assuming the “ silly me ” comment refers to the fact that humans will have no other name for “ it , ” though he may mean something else .
Thoughts ?
Also , who knew that Bob Dylan did n’t originally write “ All Along the Watchtower ” ?
I bet that ’s news to him !
So that ’s it .
The end of a great science fiction show ( maybe the best ever ? ) and less importantly , the end of this blog .
I hope everyone enjoyed reading my scatterbrained thoughts each week and that this forum allowed fans to enjoy the series a bit more .
During the finale , there were two previews — one for “ Caprica , ” which I fully intend to blog once it starts , and another for “ Battlestar Galactica : The Plan , ” which is a two - hour event that shows how the cylons developed their plan to attack Caprica .
I knew about the former , but not the latter , so needless to say I ’m excited to see what Moore comes up with .
I just hope that whatever it is , it does n’t take away from the finality of the finale .
( Try saying that ten times fast . )
3/22 Update : Here ’s a link to an interview with Ronald D. Moore .
He discusses a number of the last minute decisions , but does n’t shed any light on why the fleet was so willing to give up its technology .
Posted on 26 March 2009 by Quaid
Universal has bought the rights to Image Comics upcoming graphic novel “ The Strange Adventures of H.P. Lovecraft , ” citing that the horror property would fit in well with their tradition of creating classic movie horror monsters .
The book , created by Mac Carter and Jeff Blitz , mixes factual elements of the esteemed horror writer ’s life with the writer ’s fantastic stories about monsters , gods , and ancient cults .
Carter will write the script .
Both Carter and Blitz will serve as executive producers .
Most interestingly , Imagine ’s Brian Grazer and Ron ” The DaVinci Code ” Howard are producers .
No word on if there is any chance of Howard directing this .
I hope they get someone more in - tune with the source material , personally .
This story comes from Variety .
After playing Demigod for the past few days , it 's clear that you almost have to play another game before giving any thoughts .
That game is , of course , Defense of the Ancients , a custom scenario for WarCraft 3 .
You can't talk about Demigod without talking about DotA , at least as far as I can tell from reading the threads on various gaming fora .
There is an entire section of the review guide for Demigod that deals with the differences between itself and Defense of the Ancients .
I have n't played Defense of the Ancients .
You can filter all my thoughts through that sentence , or howl with rage if that makes you feel better .
In Demigod , you play as one of eight ... well , demigods , on maps where you face off against the opposing side .
Each player has a demigod he or she controls , and there are computer - controlled armies that clash against each other as you battle .
You can set differing conditions for success , including killing the other side 's demigods , destroying its Citadel , or controlling enough flags to score a set number of " war points . "
In fact , the options for the game are rather extensive , even though they may not seem so at first blush .
You basically play a hero unit , and you have many decisions to make .
Should you attack the other team 's Citadel ?
Keep their demigods busy ?
Fight the underlings for easy victories to level up and gain more abilities ?
You can't be everywhere , and deciding where to use your power and to what extent is a large part of the strategy of the game .
The other side 's demigods are just as active as you are , and it 's always amusing when players ignore each other in order to take care of more pressing business on the map .
As you fight , you gain powers , which use mana and are as varied as the demigods , and as you gain possession of different flags on the map you also gain the ability to earn more gold or visit stores where you can buy items .
Or you can spend your gold making your buildings or soldiers more powerful .
The strategy is abyssal , even if the maps are relatively small .
It 's like a chess board : limited space to move , but a ton of strategy to use within those barriers .
The game does n't offer much in the way of a manual , there are no tutorials , and the single - player mode consists of games against the AI .
It 's not a very welcoming game , although in an hour or so you 'll feel right at home and will have begun to work out some strategy .
I recommend playing with a friend against the computer for a while , so you can be confused together .
Even at the lower levels of strategy though , you can have fun going toe - to - toe with other demigods , taking flags , leveling up , and exploring the powers of each demigod .
There are only eight maps , but by changing the conditions of each one and playing with different combinations of Demigods and human and AI opponents , you can stretch out the replay value quite well .
Even playing against another player with the same demigod , you can both try very , very different strategies .
I do n't feel like I 'm in much of a position to review the game , but I 'm having a great time learning about the system and feeling my way around the game to find out what works well .
Expectations about game length is a funny thing : I 've put the length of a normal single - player game into Demigod so far , and I feel like I 'm barely scratching the surface of what there is to learn about the title .
Unfortunately I 've also run into a few connection problems while playing online with friends , and going online shows that I 'm far from the only one .
That 's disappointing , and as we were trying to get the issues worked out , I was chatting with my friends on our Vent server .
It became clear how this is affecting the game 's chances at retail .
" I 'm going to wait until all this is worked out , " one of my online gaming buddies said when I asked if he was buying the game .
He said he did n't want to beta test it for the first week , and when I tried to argue about how good the game is , he brought up the fact that he had listened to us curse the online system for fifteen minutes .
That was hard to argue against .
You know it 's bad news when the CEO of the publisher suggests you use a third - party solution to play online .
" Now right now , Demigod , as a game , is awesome .
Demigod , as an on - line service , however , sucks ass .
It works fine for what I dare say most people but for others , it 's just awful , " Brad Wardell wrote on his blog yesterday .
I can say I 'm enjoying the game mightily so far , and discovering new strategies every day as I play more and more skirmishes online and off .
For $ 40 , this is an easy game to recommend for those who like their strategy fast - paced .
While I 'm sure I could give a much more thorough review if I had a day or two to do nothing but play Demigod , I can say that after the first ten hours or so , I 'm going to give it a thumbs up , would play again .
A stronger single - player game , built - in voice chat , and working multiplayer would have made this one much easier to recommend , but I have a feeling the game we 'll be playing in a week will feel nothing like the online experience players are having now .
We 'll keep checking in .

One of the reasons for the ascendance of the English - speaking world has been that the English language is almost alone among major languages in having the word " earn . "
Those of us whose native language is English assume that the phrase " to earn a living " is universal .
It is n't .
It is almost unique to English .
Few languages have the ability to say this .
In the Romance languages , for example - a list that includes such major languages as Spanish , French , and Italian -- the word used when saying someone " earns " money , is " ganar " in Spanish , " gagner " in French .
The word literally means " to win . "
In Hebrew the word " marveach " means " profits . "
In German , the word " verdient " means " deserves . "
Obviously , it is very different to " win " or to " deserve " or to " profit " than to " earn . "
Since the 1960s - ‘70s , a concerted effort has been made to weed the word , and therefore the cultural value , of " earning " from American life .
Increasingly little is earned .
Instead of earning , we are increasingly owed , or we have more rights , or we are simply given .
Many American kids no longer earn awards or trophies for athletic success .
They are given trophies and awards for showing up .
These trophies are not earned , just granted -- essentially for breathing .
Another increasingly widespread concept that undermines the notion of earning is " unconditional love . "
The term , which was barely used prior to the 1960s , is now ubiquitous .
It is a prominent goal , a human ideal to strive for .
The idea of having to earn love is more than unheard of today ; it would strike most moderns as morally suspect .
We expect unconditional love not only from parents to babies and toddlers , but to children of any age , no matter how they act .
Parental unconditional love means that all people , no matter how disgracefully they act --- even toward a parent -- and no matter how old they are , must be shown infinite love from their parents .
Parental love is never to be earned , always to be given .
We expect God to show unconditional love to all people , again no matter how they act .
According to the doctrine of divine unconditional love , God loves sadists as much as He loves the kindest individuals .
No one earns God 's love ; we receive it , like sports trophies , for breathing .
Many fine people believe this about God , but I think it is religio- cultural - specific , and non-biblical .
In 15 years of study in a yeshiva I had never heard the phrase , and it would have struck me , as it still does , as quite odd .
It depicts God as a love machine who , like an air - conditioner that emits the same amount of cold air no matter how the inhabitants of a house act , emits the same amount of love no matter we act .
It means that we in no way influence God 's love for us .
I do n't find that comforting .
And it is certainly no more likely to induce decent behavior in human beings than a God who does show conditional love based on human decency .
We expect unconditional love -- meaning unearned love -- from spouses .
No matter how awfully you treat your wife or husband , as soon as you were married , you were owed unconditional love .
While your spouse and you had to earn each other 's love prior to marriage , the moment you got married , you no longer had to earn the other 's love .
We also expect forgiveness to be given without being earned .
Many people believe in what I call automatic forgiveness -- the obligation to forgive anyone any crime , committed against anyone , no matter how many victims and no matter how removed from my life .
Thus the pastor of a church attended by then - President Bill Clinton told the president and all others at a Sunday service that all Christians were obligated to forgive Timothy McVeigh , the terrorist murderer of 168 people .
Did McVeigh earn this forgiveness ?
Of course not .
So where did the notion of unearned forgiveness come from , especially unearned forgiveness from people who were not the victims of the evil being forgiven ?
It is one thing for me to forgive those who have hurt me ; it is quite another for others to forgive those who have hurt me .
God Himself demands that we earn forgiveness .
The term for that is repentance .
No repentance , no forgiveness .
Finally , the increasingly powerful culture of entitlement and rights further undermines the value of earning anything .
The more the state gives to its citizens , the less they have to earn .
That is the basic concept of the welfare state -- you receive almost everything you need without having to earn any of it .
About half of Americans now pay no federal income tax -- but they receive all government benefits just as if they had paid for , i.e. , earned , them .
America became a great civilization thanks to a culture based on the value of having to earn almost everything an American got in life .
As it abandons this value , it will become a mediocre civilization .
And eventually it will not be America .
It will be a large Sweden , and just as influential as the smaller one .
I would n’t mind having her take all my calls , handle my mail and …
Well , that last one does n’t exactly fit the typical secretary job description .
Must be nice being able to hold two jobs , one as a secretary and one as a contortionist , it ’s easier to pay the bills .
Or she could be a secretary for a firm that handle a lot of male clients , she ’s the perfect bait .
I wonder if she knows Rubber Boy , they could really hit it off .
Mr. Obama has called on the Bush administration to accelerate $ 25 billion in federal loans provided by a recent law specifically to help automakers retool .
Late in his campaign , Mr. Obama proposed doubling that to $ 50 billion .
But industry supporters say the automakers , squeezed both by the unavailability of credit and depressed sales , need unrestricted cash now , simply to meet payroll and other expenses .
On Friday , Mr. Obama said he would instruct his economic team , once he chooses it , to devise a long - range plan for helping the auto industry recover in a way that is part of an energy and environmental policy to reduce reliance on foreign oil and address climate change .
While Mr. Obama campaigned on a promise of bipartisan conciliation , his choice for his White House chief of staff , Representative Rahm Emanuel , indicated on Sunday that no such deal linking auto - industry aid and a stimulus package with trade pacts was in the cards .
“ You do n’t link those essential needs to some other trade deal , ” Mr. Emanuel said on ABC ’s “ This Week . ”
Democrats close to both Mr. Obama ’s transition team and to Congressional leaders seemed willing to call Mr. Bush ’s bluff , calculating that he would not want to gamble that G.M.  an iconic , century - old American corporation with business tentacles in every state  would fail on his watch and add to the negative notes of his legacy .
Also , economists as conservative as Martin Feldstein , an adviser to a long line of Republican presidents and candidates , have called more broadly for stimulus spending of up to $ 300 billion .
The major automakers  G.M. , Ford and Chrysler  are each using up their cash at unsustainable rates .
The Center for Automotive Research , which is based in Michigan and supported by the industry , released on Election Day an economic analysis of the impact of one or all of them failing .
If the Big Three were to collapse , it said , that would cost at least three million jobs , counting autoworkers , suppliers and other businesses dependent on the companies , down to the hot - dog vendors and bartenders next door to their plants .
The center also concluded that the cost to local , state and federal governments would reach to as much as $ 156.4 billion over three years in lost taxes and higher outlays for things like unemployment and health care assistance .
Separately , some economists say the demise of even one of the automakers could tip the current recession toward a depression .
For Mr. Bush , however , the hard - line approach is his only leverage to make the trade agreements part of his legacy .
The Colombia deal , especially , is strongly opposed by organized labor groups , which are a major force in the Democratic Party , and by human - rights activists .
We wrote in an article published yesterday that stocks of metals on Earth would n't last forever , even if large - scale recycling programs were implemented , and that the obvious solution was to start mining operations on the Moon or other planets .
It seems that Russia is one step ahead of other nations , the country led by Vladimir Putin announcing its intention to build a lunar base by 2015 .
But the facility 's main purpose will not be to mine metals , but a fuel which is scarce on our planet : helium - 3 .
This fuel would be used for future fusion reactors .
One of the main advantages associated with such a reactor is the absence of radioactive waste .
In addition , aside from helium - 3's obvious advantages , the Moon seems to contain large quantities , estimates placing the figure around 500 million tons .
Gazeta.ru quoted the head of the company which built the Soyuz and Progress shuttles , Nikolai Sevastyanov , as saying that obtaining helium - 3 was a key priority in the moon exploration program .
According to the statements made by Sevastyanov , one ton of this isotope would generate the energy produced by 14 million tons of oil .
" We are planning to build a permanent base on the moon by 2015 and by 2020 we can begin the industrial - scale delivery ... of the rare isotope helium 3 , " Mr Sevastyanov told The Independent .
The mining method does n't imply the use of any helmet or axe , the Russian scientists thinking of using lunar bulldozers to heat the Moon 's surface in order to get to the raw material .
Set in 1999 , a woman ( Dommartin ) has a car accident with some bank robbers , who enlist her help to take the bank money to a drop in Paris .
On the way she runs into another fugitive from the law ( Hurt ) , an American who is being chased by the CIA .
The charges are false , he claims .
They want to confiscate a device his father invented which allows anyone to record their dreams and vision .
On the run from both the bank robbers and the CIA , the couple span the globe , ending up in Australia at his father 's ( von Sydow ) research facility , where they hope to play back the recordings
Hurt captured for his blind mother .
Set in the futuristic year of 1999 , a subplot about a damaged Indian nuclear satellite crashing and causing the end of civilization is a puzzling addition to the film .

A lot of the projected budget improvement is premised on economic recovery beginning in 2010 , which may or may not happen .
But much of it is premised on raising taxes .
The proposed increases signal a serious attempt to tame deficits in a way that restores fairness to a tax code that has for too long been tilted in favor of the wealthiest Americans , resulting in budget shortfalls that disproportionately burden everyone else .
At the same time , Mr. Obama has proposed a separate , targeted increase to help pay for health care reform in a way that does n’t dig a deeper budget hole .
All of the proposed increases apply to couples making more than $ 250,000 ( $ 200,000 for single taxpayers ) — about the top 3 percent of taxpayers .
None are big enough to derail an economic recovery .
And contrary to Republicans ’ knee - jerk protests , they impose no outsize burden on small businesses :
Most sole proprietors and other small - business owners do not make anywhere near a quarter - of - a- million dollars a year .
To combat deficits , Mr. Obama proposes to let Mr. Bush ’s high - end tax cuts expire in 2011 , raising the top rate from 35 percent to as high as 39.6 percent .
He would also impose a 20 percent rate on investment income , up from the current super - low 15 percent .
And he would reinstate a tax provision enacted by the first President Bush , but undone by his son , that limited tax write - offs by high - income taxpayers for dependents and other expenses , like mortgage interest on vacation homes .
The proposal also calls for taxing private equity partners just like the rest of us .
Under current law , multimillionaire buyout mavens pay tax on much of their income at about the lowest rates in the tax code .
Under the Obama budget , their earnings would lose favored status and be taxed as the ordinary income of ordinary mortals .
No one who really believes in fiscal responsibility could object to the proposed tax increases .
And yet , each one presages a political fight .
At issue is not only the tax burden on the wealthiest Americans or election - year debates , but the real - life difficulty of weaning people hooked on unsustainable debt — whether it is unpaid - for tax breaks or over - leveraged buyouts or junk mortgages .
It ’s a challenge avoided for too long .

Venus is about to be ousted as the brightest star - like object in the night sky .
The next space shuttle mission , STS - 119 is slated to launch on Wednesday night , March 11 at 9:20 p.m. EDT ( 1:20 a.m. Thursday March 12 GMT ) , and astronauts will deliver and install the fourth and final set of solar array wings to the International Space Station .
Once the array is deployed , the station will surpass Venus as the brightest object in the night sky , second only to the Moon .
The new array will increase the amount of electricity available for science experiments by 50 % , providing the power needed for the ISS to house a crew of 6 astronauts instead of the current 3 .
The solar array truss segment , known as Starboard 6 or S6 for short , weighs 14,000 kilograms ( 31,060 pounds ) and measures 5 meters ( 16.3 feet ) wide , 13.8 meters ( 45.4 feet ) long in the shuttle ’s cargo bay .
Once deployed , the ISS will then have four panels on each end of its power truss .
Total surface area of all the arrays will be roughly one acre , generating 84 to 120 kilowatts of useable power , depending on the time of year and angle to the sun .
“ It takes up the entire payload bay , so unlike the last flight ( in November ) , this is pretty much what our focus will be on the mission , getting the element installed and activated and the wings deployed , ” said ISS program manager Mike Suffredini .
There are a few interesting aspects to this mission .
Two teachers are part of the crew , but they wo n’t be teaching from space .
Both Richard Arnold and Joe Acaba , who were selected by NASA as part of the educator astronaut initiative , will be conducting two spacewalks each – one of those together –to help outfit the S6 truss , preparing it for deploy .
“ As an educator , ” Arnold said , “ you presumably believe in the notion that education can take you anywhere .
Here we are .
We ’re knocking on the door .
We ’re about to go to space . ”
They hope to demonstrate that educators can contribute as astronauts , just as well as military pilots , engineers and scientists .
“ Teachers have to think on their feet and be at their absolute best all the time , ” Acaba said .
“ Our performance will speak a lot for the profession . ”
STS - 119 also will bring up Japan ’s first long - duration resident of the ISS station flier , veteran Koichi Wakata , who has flown on the shuttle twice previously .
He ’ll be taking the place of Sandy Magnus who has been on board the station for the past four months .
Other crew members are Commander Lee Archambault , pilot Tony Antonelli , and Mission Specialists John Phillips , and Steve Swanson .
This mission has been delayed because of concerns about possible cracks in the three hydrogen flow control valves used to pressurize the hydrogen section of the external fuel tank .
But the valves have now been replaced and so far , the weather looks favorable for Wednesday night ’s launch .
By the time Discovery leaves the station , the mass of the ISS will increase to 669,291 pounds – 335 tons – and construction of the station be 81 % complete .
S6 is the last US - built piece of the station .
Despite the delay getting Discovery off the ground , NASA still hopes to launch five missions this year .
The Hubble repair mission is scheduled for launch May 12 , and Endeavour returns to space around June 13 for a mission to attach an external experiment platform on the space station ’s Japanese Kibo lab module .
Atlantis is scheduled to fly again in late August , followed by Discovery in November or December .

Tooth fish
Enlarge Image
Scientists have discovered a highly unusual fish with fangs made of bone .
Dubbed the " Dracula " fish , the creature is about 17 mm ( 0.7 inches ) long and has been found in only one Burmese stream .
The researchers , from London 's Natural History Museum ( NHM ) , believe the fish lost its teeth over evolutionary time , but later evolved the bone fangs .
Writing in the Royal Society 's journal Proceedings B , they say the males use the fangs to jostle each other - but do not appear to draw blood .
" When you watch them in captivity you can see the males sparring , " said NHM 's Ralf Britz .
I thought 'my God , what is this , they can't be teeth '
Ralf Britz
" They display with their lower jaws open incredibly widely , then they nudge each other ; but we do n't see any wounds . "
Dr Britz , who has worked with Burmese wildlife for more than a decade , named the species Danionella dracula in honour of mythology 's most eminent fanged predator .
Early developer
The tiny specimens came to the UK in a consignment of aquarium fish , and at first the researchers mistook them for another related species .
" After a year or so in captivity they started dying ; and when I preserved them and looked at them under the microscope , I thought 'my God , what is this , they can't be teeth ' , " Dr Britz told BBC News .
Rather than being true teeth , the fangs are made of bone " And when I looked in more detail , and stained the bone and cartilage with different colours and used an enzyme to dissolve away the muscle , I saw they clearly were not teeth . "
Instead , the jawbones appear to have developed rows of sharp protrusions resembling teeth and presumably serving the same purpose - plus , in the males , these extraordinary fangs .
Using DNA data to place the new species in its family tree , the researchers believe the lineage lost its teeth about 50 million years ago .
Compared to relatives , they appear to reach sexual maturity when their bodies have not fully developed .
The Dracula fish contains 44 fewer bones than its most studied relative , the zebrafish Danio rerio , and these are bones that form late in the zebrafish 's life .
The researchers believe the Dracula fish evolved to mature sexually before its body was fully developed - perhaps because individuals reproducing earlier in life had more reproductive success .
Given that these scientists , experienced with the family of fish , did not immediately spot D dracula as a new species , they suggest it is entirely possible that the little fanged creatures are swimming round unrecognised in other aquaria even now .

MYAWADDY , Myanmar
Before entering Myanmar from Thailand , you scrub your bags of any hint that you might be engaged in some pernicious evil , such as espionage , journalism or promotion of human rights .
Then you exit from the Thai town of Mae Sot and walk across the gleaming white “ friendship bridge ” to the Burmese immigration post on the other side .
Entering Myanmar ( which traditionally has been known as Burma ) , you adjust your watch : Myanmar is 30 minutes ahead  and 50 years behind .
Already Myanmar ’s government is one of the most brutal in the world , and in recent months it has become even more repressive .
A blogger , Nay Phone Latt , was sentenced to 20 years in prison .
A prominent comedian , Zarganar , was sentenced to 59 years .
A former student leader , Min Ko Naing , a survivor of years of torture and solitary confinement , has received terms of 65 years so far and faces additional sentences that may reach a total of 150 years .
Detainee ’s Harsh Treatment Foiled No Plots
Waterboarding , Rough Interrogation of Abu Zubaida Produced False Leads , Officials Say
By Peter Finn and Joby Warrick
Washington Post Staff Writers
When CIA officials subjected their first high - value captive , Abu Zubaida , to waterboarding and other harsh interrogation methods , they were convinced that they had in their custody an al - Qaeda leader who knew details of operations yet to be unleashed , and they were facing increasing pressure from the White House to get those secrets out of him .
The methods succeeded in breaking him , and the stories he told of al - Qaeda terrorism plots sent CIA officers around the globe chasing leads .
In the end , though , not a single significant plot was foiled as a result of Abu Zubaida ’s tortured confessions , according to former senior government officials who closely followed the interrogations .
Nearly all of the leads attained through the harsh measures quickly evaporated , while most of the useful information from Abu Zubaida — chiefly names of al - Qaeda members and associates — was obtained before waterboarding was introduced , they said .
Moreover , within weeks of his capture , U.S. officials had gained evidence that made clear they had misjudged Abu Zubaida .
President George W. Bush had publicly described him as “ al - Qaeda ’s chief of operations , ” and other top officials called him a “ trusted associate ” of al - Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and a major figure in the planning of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
None of that was accurate , the new evidence showed .
Abu Zubaida was not even an official member of al - Qaeda , according to a portrait of the man that emerges from court documents and interviews with current and former intelligence , law enforcement and military sources .
Rather , he was a “ fixer ” for radical Muslim ideologues , and he ended up working directly with al - Qaeda only after Sept. 11 — and that was because the United States stood ready to invade Afghanistan .
Abu Zubaida ’s case presents the Obama administration with one of its most difficult decisions as it reviews the files of the 241 detainees still held in the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
Abu Zubaida — a nom de guerre for the man born Zayn al - Abidin Muhammed Hussein — was never charged in a military commission in Guantanamo Bay , but some U.S. officials are pushing to have him charged now with conspiracy .
The Palestinian , 38 and now in captivity for more than seven years , had alleged links with Ahmed Ressam , an al - Qaeda member dubbed the “ Millennium Bomber ” for his plot to bomb Los Angeles International Airport on New Year ’s Eve 1999 .
Jordanian officials tied him to terrorist plots to attack a hotel and Christian holy sites in their country .
And he was involved in discussions , after the Taliban government fell in Afghanistan , to strike back at the United States , including with attacks on American soil , according to law enforcement and military sources .
Others in the U.S. government , including CIA officials , fear the consequences of taking a man into court who was waterboarded on largely false assumptions , because of the prospect of interrogation methods being revealed in detail and because of the chance of an acquittal that might set a legal precedent .
Instead , they would prefer to send him to Jordan .
Some U.S. officials remain steadfast in their conclusion that Abu Zubaida possessed , and gave up , plenty of useful information about al - Qaeda .
“ It ’s simply wrong to suggest that Abu Zubaida was n’t intimately involved with al - Qaeda , ” said a U.S. counterterrorism official , speaking on the condition of anonymity because much about Abu Zubaida remains classified .
“ He was one of the terrorist organization ’s key facilitators , offered new insights into how the organization operated , provided critical information on senior al - Qaeda figures . . . and identified hundreds of al - Qaeda members .
How anyone can minimize that information — some of the best we had at the time on al - Qaeda — is beyond me . ”
Until the attacks on New York and Washington , Abu Zubaida was a committed jihadist who regarded the United States as an enemy principally because of its support of Israel .
He helped move people in and out of military training camps in Afghanistan , including some men who were or became members of al - Qaeda , according to interviews with multiple sources , who spoke on the condition of anonymity .
He was widely known as a kind of travel agent for those seeking such training .
That role , it turned out , would play a part in deciding his fate once in U.S. hands :
Because his name often turned up in intelligence traffic linked to al - Qaeda transactions , some U.S. intelligence leaders were convinced that Abu Zubaida was a major figure in the terrorist organization , according to officials engaged in the discussions at the time .

Mr Spillane said that the entrance to the cave was first found by a local man , Ho Khanh , in 1991 .
" Khanh has been a guide for the team in many expeditions to the jungle to explore caves and this year he took a team to the cave which had never been entered before by anyone including local jungle men , " he said .
Since the recession began , the economy has eliminated a net total of roughly 4.4 million jobs , with more than half of those positions  some 2.6 million  disappearing in the last four months alone .
This rapid deterioration has prompted talk that some industries are being partly dismantled .
Layoffs are multiplying because of dysfunction in the financial system , which is prompting even healthy companies to shed workers and shut down operations out of concern they may soon lose access to credit .
“ Everybody is so fearful that companies are thinking , ‘ What can we hang on to and what should we liquidate ? ’ ” said Martin N. Baily , a chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Clinton and now a fellow at the Brookings Institution .
“ A lot of the reduction in employment is businesses deciding to close down operations or get out of a line of certain activity . ”
American car sales have dropped to an annual pace of nine million , from some 17 million in 2007 .
Even if sales increase considerably , that is likely to leave a lot of unneeded auto factories .
“ The decimation of employment in legacy American brands such as General Motors is a trend that ’s likely to continue , ” said Robert E. Hall , an economist at Stanford University ’s Hoover Institution .
“ We have to stimulate the economy to create jobs in other areas . ”
In February , 168,000 more manufacturing jobs were eliminated , bringing losses over the last year to 1.2 million .
In Michigan , where the troubles of the auto industry have been particularly traumatic , the unemployment rate sits at 10.6 percent , the highest of any state in the nation .
“ The people who do what I do in the Detroit area are a dime a dozen , ” said Kim Allgeyer , 46 , a machine toolmaker in Westland , Mich. , who was laid off in January from a company that makes assembly lines for the automakers .
Unable to find another full - time job , he is subsisting on day labor and one - week stints for contractors .
“ Who ’s going to put me to work ? ” he asked .
“ Where ’s the work at ?
It ’s just a great big black hole . ”
Much the same can be said for financial services , which gave up 44,000 jobs in February .
During the housing boom , banks hired tens of thousands of well - compensated traders , analysts and marketers to sell mortgage - backed securities and other investments .
That industry is unlikely to return to its former shape .
Lawrence “ Larry ” King was n’t sexually harassing fellow eighth - grade student Brandon McInerney in the weeks leading up to King ’s shooting death , prosecutors contend in court documents .
McInerney was the aggressor , teasing the effeminate King for weeks and vowing to “ get a gun and shoot ” him , according to a prosecution brief .
Multiple students provided accounts of a growing hostility between the two boys , the document shows .
Their dispute ended in tragedy a year ago today when McInerney allegedly armed himself with a . 22 - caliber revolver and shot King in the back of the head twice in an Oxnard classroom as the school day was beginning .
“ In the days before the shooting , the defendant tried to enlist others to administer a beating to Larry , ” Deputy Dist .
Atty .
Maeve
Fox wrote in a “ statement of facts ” filed with the brief .
“ When that failed for lack of interest , he decided to kill Larry . ”

Prosecutors said they provided their most detailed account to date of the events leading to the classroom killing to counter the defense ’s argument that murder charges against McInerney , then 14 , were improperly filed in adult court .
Defense attorney Scott Wippert contends that Ventura County Dist .
Atty .
Gregory Totten abused his discretion in deciding to try McInerney as an adult rather than filing charges in juvenile court .
Fox said she filed the statement of facts in December to show that the case was filed properly .
The Ventura County Star published details from the document this week .
“ It was an absolutely brutal crime , with premeditation and deliberation , ” Fox said Wednesday .
“ He was familiar with firearms and had fired that gun before .
He knew what he was doing . ”

Wippert said the prosecution filing was a “ one - sided version of the facts . ”
He said it was meant to sway the jury pool before the case reaches trial .
“ We do n’t know if any of this version of what she says happened will ever go before a court of law , ” Wippert said .
“ It was irresponsible to release it . ”
The one - year anniversary of the shooting is being marked in Ventura County by a candlelight march and vigil organized by a local gay - rights group .
Similar memorials are being planned across the state , said Jackie Downing of the Gay - Straight Alliance Network in San Francisco .
“ We also had a conference in Fresno over the weekend with 275 students dedicated to preventing further tragedies like this , ” Downing said .
“ They talked a great deal about Lawrence . ”

King ’s death struck a chord with parents , teachers , students and gay - rights advocates concerned that McInerney ’s alleged bullying of King had been minimized by school authorities .
“ It ’s an opportunity to come forward and talk about changes we ’ve seen , what we have n’t seen and what we still need to do , ” Jay Smith of the Ventura County Rainbow Alliance said of today ’s candlelight vigil .
Since King ’s death , teachers have asked Smith ’s group for training in how to identify gay and lesbian students who might be struggling with their sexual identity .
Teachers also have asked for resources to help students who have already come out or who may be experiencing bullying , he said .
It ’s been tougher getting school districts to expand any diversity awareness they already offer to faculty and students , Smith said .

“ There ’s always that sense that you ’re pushing an agenda , ” he said .
“ We ’re not .
We just do n’t want to have another gay or lesbian student shot twice in the head during school . ”
In her statement of facts , Fox contends that King and McInerney had an acrimonious relationship for months prior to the shooting .
They sparred with “ typical 8th grade , back - and - forth insults ; some sexual , some not , ” she wrote .
Witnesses said King was usually not the aggressor .
But after months of teasing by McInerney and other male students who called him “ faggot , ” he had began to retort , according to prosecutors .
The day before the shooting , the two boys were bickering during seventh period .
When King left , a student witness said that McInerney commented , “ I ’m going to shoot him . ”

Just after that class , another student heard King say “ I love you ” to McInerney as they passed in a hallway .
The same student then heard McInerney say he was “ going to get a gun and shoot ” King , according to prosecutors .
A few minutes later , prosecutors allege , McInerney told one of King ’s friends : “ Say goodbye to your friend Larry because you ’re never going to see him again . ”
The prosecution brief also reveals for the first time that McInerney was familiar with firearms , and that he had used that particular weapon in the past during target shooting with his family .
Investigators found a training video in his possession titled “ Shooting in Realistic Environments , ” as well as skinhead and neo -Nazi books and similar writings from the Internet , prosecutors wrote .

Fox said a public airing of prosecution facts was appropriate .
“ I had to tell the court what we knew at the time the decision was made to file in adult court , ” Fox said .
“ So that ’s what I did . ”

A Thai fireman turned superhero when he dressed up as comic - book character Spider - Man to coax a frightened eight - year - old from a balcony , police said on Tuesday .
Teachers at a special needs school in Bangkok alerted authorities on Monday when an autistic pupil , scared of attending his first day at school , sat out on the third - floor ledge and refused to come inside , a police sergeant told AFP .
Despite teachers ' efforts to beckon the boy inside , he refused to budge until his mother mentioned her son's love of superheroes , prompting fireman Sonchai Yoosabai to take a novel approach to the problem .
The rescuer dashed back to his fire station and made a quick change into a Spider - Man costume before returning to the boy , he said .
" I told him Spider - Man is here to rescue you , no monsters are going to attack you and I told him to walk slowly towards me as running could be dangerous , " Somchai told local television .
The young boy immediately stood up and walked into his rescuer 's arms , police said .
Somchai said he keeps the Spider - Man costume and an outfit of Japanese television character Ultraman at the station in order to liven up school fire drills .

From Newsarama :
DC Comics announced on Tuesday that a mini-series in December entitled Vibe : Rebirth will re-introduce the once - dead character Paco Ramone , bringing Vibe back for good into the fictional world he left more than 20 years ago .
Unlike other comic book deaths – even Superman went up , up and away for just a year – Vibe was so good at dying that his demise became part of comic book lore .
Many fans had come to like the character better dead than alive after he was murdered by a mad scientist ’s android in 1987 .
Vibe : Rebirth will be written by Geoff Johns with art by Ethan Van Sciver , who orchestrated similar returns of the formerly - deceased Green Lantern Hal Jordan and formerly - deceased Flash Barry Allen .
The return of Hal Jordan in 2005 under the hands of Johns and Van Sciver marked a dramatic resurgence of the Green Lantern comic book , with the title now ranking as one of DC ’s best - selling comics .
Flash : Rebirth is expected to sell equally well , if not better , and is available today in comic book shops across the country .
News of Paco Ramone ’s return to the DC Universe was initially reported in the New York Daily News , but his “ return ” was seen by many fans as probably being temporary .
But this announcement yesterday indicates comic book readers better get used to seeing Vibe around , and the two guys who revived Green Lantern and Flash will be the ones bringing him back for good .
Now that this announcement confirms Paco is back as Vibe , the fate of Armando Ramone is unknown .
Armando , one of Vibe ’s younger brothers , developed a similar set of vibration - based powers after Paco ’s death .
Armando joined Booster Gold ’s team of heroes , the Conglomerate , using the code names Reverb and later Hardline .
Armando carried on the family tradition of shaking things up and proudly wearing the black and yellow that Vibe made so famous .
Newsarama spoke to Johns and Van Sciver to find out more about the series , why Paco Ramone will redefine the DC Universe , what will happen to Armando , and what this means for the future of other deceased Justice Leaguers .
.
Newsarama : Geoff Johns and Ethan Van Sciver together again , huh ?
Ethan Van Sciver :
As the Beach Boy ’s said , “ I ’m pickin ’ up good vibrations ” .
NRAMA : Because it ’s Rebirth again ?
EVS : It ’s a lot of things .
GJ : What Ethan and I want to do to the world of Vibe is what we ’ve done to the world of Green Lantern .
NRAMA : The worlds are so different , though , are n’t they ?
GJ : They are vastly different , but we want to turn Vibe into a pillar of the DC Universe , just like Green Lantern has become a pillar .
Our goal is to elevate the Vibe Universe .
EVS : He ’s entitled to that .
GJ : Yeah .
He deserves it .
He ’s one of DC ’s great untapped characters .
He was the first Justice Leaguer to be killed in the line of duty .
He was only around for few years and did n’t really get a chance to explore his full potential .
EVS : To me , he ’s DC ’s # 1 under - utilized character .
NRAMA : OK , now , we need to clarify .
Is Vibe : Rebirth mainly about Paco , or is it more about the Vibe Universe ?
And what is the Vibe Universe ?
GJ : Paco ’s the central character .
I do n’t want to say much more than that .
EVS : Are we being very careful here ?
GJ : We ’re being very careful .
We do n’t want to give anything away .
NRAMA : OK , it ’s centered around Paco , but what about Armando ?
EVS : It ’s centered around Paco , but we touch on all the other vibration - based characters as well .
We ’re not just talking about Armando , but also folks like Black Canary and the Fiddler .
GJ : Just like Green Lantern : Rebirth touched on all the GLs .
EVS : I do n’t think anybody …
I mean , if you ’re an Armando fan , you ’ll be happy to see this book .
If you ’re a Paco fan , you ’ll be happy with this book .
GJ : …at least until issue # 2 !
NRAMA : Oh , now that ’s going to get people talking .
But will other Vibe - related characters be in this book , like Mother Windom , or the rest of Vibe ’s family ?
GJ : We ’ll be delving into everything we can .
EVS : Nothing will be ignored , really .
GJ : This is literally taking , like , every vibration - powered character , looking at it and saying , OK , what ’s the next level we can take this stuff to ?
EVS : Right .
How does this all work together ?
GJ : And where is it going to go ?
‘ Cause Vibe has always been about shaking things up .
And we ’re going to register an 11 on the Richter scale .
Just like Green Lantern .
NRAMA : Why is Paco more relevant now than he was back then ?
EVS : Well , because breakdancing is popular again . [ laughs ]
GJ : Yeah . [ laughs ]
But also , Paco ’s outlook and everything are different — as a character , he ’s different because of his intrinsic values and what he believes in and how he approaches crime and how he approaches criminals and how he approaches the guilty and the not guilty .
There are very specific details to his character and personality that we ’ll be exploring on a completely new level .
The Vibe action figure that came out late last year was one of the most anticipated figures in years .
After seeing the fan support for the character , both as a figure and the cameos in the Justice League Unlimited cartoon , we knew now was the time to bring him back .
The other cool thing is that he has been gone for so long .
‘ Cause he ’s never met Tim Drake , and he ’s never seen these other things .
There ’s so much that has happened in the DCU that he has n’t seen .
To me , Paco led the way in the Bronze Age .
But now that he ’s been gone , bringing him into the DC Universe is going to make everything very different from anything we ’ve seen for a very , very long time .
NRAMA : So is this Rebirth more about the story of Paco than it is an actual “ rebirth ? ”
GJ : It ’s a rebirth because it ’s about what the Vibe Universe is going to be .
It ’s about who Vibe is going to be .
It ’s about what vibratory - powers are .
It ’s about a lot of things .
It ’s about re-envisioning the whole Vibe Universe .
NRAMA : Ethan , with Green Lantern : Rebirth , you added a lot of elements to the Green Lantern look that are now incorporated into all the GL books .
Are we going to see something similar with Vibe ?
EVS : For me , as an artist , this presents so many interesting visual opportunities .
Both Green Lantern and Vibe are energy - based and visually exciting and appealing .
They both do cool things and it ’s just an opportunity to draw cool effects .
I think there are some easy ways that artists can use to show vibration powers .
And I want to toss all of those out and come up with some brand new ways to show , with a still picture , a human being shaking things apart .
It ’s incredibly , incredibly exciting .
NRAMA : Will some of Vibe ’s old foes be in Vibe : Rebirth ?
Characters such as Overmaster , Crowbar , Despero , and Professor Ivo ?
EVS : A few of them .
NRAMA : OK , so you ’ve done Green Lantern : Rebirth and Flash : Rebirth .
Now you ’re doing Vibe : Rebirth .
Who are you two going to “ Rebirth ” next ?
GJ : If you look at the DC Universe , there are a tremendous amount of dead characters just waiting for someone to breathe new life into .
EVS : We have plans .
GJ : But for now , Vibe is going to be a major focus for me .
EVS : Vibe is so important to both of us .
Right now , at this point , Geoff and I have the right energy and it ’s the right time to take a new look at the Vibe mythos and build it back up again .

The announcement of Vibe : Rebirth has the fan community buzzing .
Here are a few blogs already discussing Vibe : Rebirth : Fortress of Baileytude , K - Squared Ramblings , Crimson Lightning , and the Justice League Detroit Blog .
Every April 20 , marijuana smokers around the country light up for an unofficial holiday celebrating pot that stems from the smoker slang " 420 . "
This year , as the drug war rages in Mexico , the festivities fall against an increasingly violent backdrop .
Some antidrug advocates are using the occasion to jump - start a movement against marijuana not just for health and legal reasons , but on moral grounds .
American pot smokers , they say , are unwittingly supporting drug cartels in Mexico .

Optical discs have been a leading storage solution for decades A disc that can store 500 gigabytes ( GB ) of data , equivalent to 100 DVDs , has been unveiled by General Electric .
The micro-holographic disc , which is the same size as existing DVD discs , is aimed at the archive industry .
But the company believes it can eventually be used in the consumer market place and home players .
Blu -ray discs , which are used to store high definition movies and games , can currently hold between 25GB and 50GB .
Micro-holographic discs can store more data than DVDs or Blu-ray because they store information on the disc in three dimensions , rather than just pits on the surface of the disc A single GE disc could be used to package up a library of high definition movies but is there pent - up consumer demand for such an offering ?
News website Technology editor Darren Waters
Read more on the Dot .
Life blog
The challenge for this area of technology has been to increase the reflectivity of the holograms that are stored on the discs so that players can be used to both read and write to the discs .
Brian Lawrence , who leads GE's Holographic Storage said on the GE Research blog : " Very recently , the team at GE has made dramatic improvements in the materials enabling significant increases in the amount of light that can be reflected by the holograms . "
More capacity
The higher reflectivity that can be achieved , the more capacity for the disc .
While the technology is still in the laboratory stage , GE believes it will take off because players can be built which are backwards compatible with existing DVD and Blu-ray technologies .
In a statement the firm said : " The hardware and formats are so similar to current optical storage technology that the micro- holographic players will enable consumers to play back their CDs , DVDs and Blu-ray discs . " '' GE 's breakthrough is a huge step toward bringing our next generation holographic storage technology to the everyday consumer , '' said Mr Lawrence in a statement .
He added : " The day when you can store your entire high definition movie collection on one disc and support high resolution formats like 3D television is closer than you think . ''
Micro-holographic technology has been one of the leading areas of research for storage experts for decades .
Discs are seen as a reliable and effective form of storage and are both consumer and retail friendly .
However , General Electric will need to work with hardware manufacturers if it is to bring the technology to the consumer market .
The relatively modest adoption of Blu-ray discs sales globally might be an issue with some companies who believe digital distribution and cloud computing is the long - term answer to content delivery and storage .
" This is truly a breakthrough in the development of the materials that are so critical to ultimately bringing holographic storage to the everyday consumer , " said Mr Lawrence .

VANCOUVER -- RCMP
Constable Kwesi Millington admitted to the Braidwood inquiry Monday that his statements of why , when and how many times he Tasered Robert Dziekanski are at odds with the bystander video of the event .
Mr. Dziekanski , a Polish immigrant , became agitated after 24 hours of travel and 10 hours in the Vancouver airport .
Four RCMP officers answered a call to the airport about 1:30 a.m. on Oct. 14 , 2007 , and in less than two minutes , Mr. Dziekanski was on the airport floor , motionless , handcuffed behind his back and starting to turn blue .
Const .
Millington , 32 , a former personal trainer who appeared confident on the stand despite the multiple inconsistencies between his account and videotaped evidence , was the officer who fired the Taser five times at Mr. Dziekanski for a combined total of 31 seconds , in bursts of six seconds , then five , five more , nine more and finally six seconds .
On the video shot by teacher Paul Pritchard , Mr. Dziekanski goes down howling in pain after the first Taser shot , but Const .
Millington insisted Monday : “ I believed I cycled [ the Taser ] twice when he was standing . ”
In statements to police Oct. 14 , 2007 , Const .
Millington also said : “ He seemed to feel the effects of the Taser but did n’t fall due to that . ”
According to Const .
Millington , “ Once I had [ hit him with the Taser more than once ] the members moved in because he had n’t gone to the ground and we were able to wrestle him to the ground . ”
In the face of these statements , Const .
Millington was asked Monday by inquiry lawyer Art Vertlieb to watch the video , which clearly shows Const .
Millington aiming the Taser , a sharp crack and then Mr. Dziekanski falling to the ground , howling .
“ He fell to the ground on his own , ” admitted Const .
Millington , noting Mr. Dziekanski appeared to fall after one Taser shot .
“ He had fell on his own , I did n’t realize that . ”
Const .
Millington was asked why Mr. Dziekanski was Tasered at all , and if he was given the required police warning of “ Police : Stop or you ’ll be hit with 50,000 volts of electricity . ”
Const .
Millington said he gave no such warning and agreed with Mr. Vertlieb that it is possible Mr. Dziekanski moved toward his luggage only in response to Const .
Millington ’s request that the traveller produce a “ passport and identification . ”
Mr. Dziekanski was then told to move away from his luggage , and when he threw up his hands in a shrug , Const .
Millington said he decided Mr. Dziekanski ’s shrug was an act of “ defiance . ”
In an account remarkably similar to that given by his fellow officers at the scene , constables Bill Bentley and Gerry Rundel , who testified last week , Const .
Millington said Mr. Dziekanski then picked up a stapler and moved toward police .
“ I perceived the stapler to be combative behaviour because he had it and was moving toward us , ” said Const .
Millington .
“ I formed the impression he wanted to attack one of the officers or all of the officers . ”

Last week I wrote an article about Australia ’s largest bank , ANZ , and their strategy to encourage Gen - Y to save money rather than spend it .
They teamed up with US - based Smarty Pig to develop a web app for social networking sites that can track your savings from your MySpace or Facebook page .
- Most people ’s “ friends ” on their social networking sites are n’t really friends but sometimes acquaintances , and would not want their financials broadcast to these people they barely know .
-ANZ said the “ new venture is targeting Generation - Y in an attempt to teach financial responsibility and My two arguments were : - Most people ’s “ friends ” on their social networking sites are n’t really friends but sometimes acquaintances , and would not want their financials broadcast to these people they barely know .
-ANZ said the “ new venture is targeting Generation - Y in an attempt to teach financial responsibility and promote savings . ”
However they offer incentives for their customers to convert their savings and / or interest earned into gift cards ; which appears entirely contradictory to ANZ ’s mission .
Shortly after posting , Smarty Pig ’s co-founder , Michael Ferrari responded with the following :
Josh ,
Thanks for the post .
My name is Michael Ferrari and I 'm one of the co-founders of Smarty Pig .
Saw your post come across my alerts .
I spend a great deal of my time each and every day listening to customer feedback , thoughts and suggestions .
And jump in whenever I can .
I started SmartyPig as a way to help people save money for specific goals in their life .
Be it a down payment on a house or apartment , an emergency fund , a Wii , a MacBook Pro or a family vacation .
And in doing so I thought it would be great to let people make these goals " public " allowing friends and family to contribute .
And in making them " public " give users the opportunity to share their gals on their social networking site of choice ( if they choose ) like Facebook , MySpace , their personal blog or their desktop .
Our widget platform is built on the Clearspring technology http://www.clearspring.com/.
In doing so , it provides an opportunity to let others know what you are saving and allows friends and family the chance to contribute to your interest - bearing goals .
Do n't want that " sweater " for your birthday , perfect , please contribute to my " Trip to Honduras " goal instead .
Again , the social side of Smarty Pig is optional .
Our goal is to help change the mindset of " buy now , pay later " .
And in doing so , should you choose , Smarty Pig has some great features to help you get the word out to friends and family be it moral support or financial support .
Some quick stats :
- 66 % of our customers in the U.S. are under the age of 35
- 1 out of every 3 goals created on Smarty Pig are public
...
Thanks for the opportunity to share my thoughts .
Really appreciate it .
Mike Ferrari , Smarty Pig co-founder @mferrari
First off I want to thank Michael Ferrari for taking the time to comment .
I think that he helped to help paint a clearer picture of Smarty Pig 's intentions .
I think it ’s also important to note that the article originally quoted , neglected to mention that the widget has a privacy setting and does n’t have to be broadcast to everyone ( for those of us who do n’t want to share our financials ) .
While I personally cannot see myself sharing my financials on Facebook , I can see the value of Smarty Pig ’s widget if I could change my privacy setting .
However , I must still push back – but not at Smarty Pig , but at ANZ .
As stated in the beginning of this post , I have two gripes : privacy , and hypocrisy .
Michael addressed the issue of privacy , but what still rubs me the wrong way is that ANZ is promoting and what almost seems like encouraging customers to convert their savings and interest earned to gift cards .
If their goal was to “ attempt to teach financial responsibility and promote savings ” to Echo Boomers , then why are they trying to get us spend our savings on gift cards ?
I do n’t think this is just an issue with ANZ , but with banks at large .
All the “ perk ” that go along with savings programs , credit cards , etc. encourage more spending , not saving .
It ’s the same irresponsible spending habits that got us into this financial crisis in the first place .
If we ’re to progress out of the recession and truly learn from our mistakes , we need to change our spending / saving habits moving forward .
Having our “ savings institutions ” encourage more irresponsible spending habits is only furthering the process .
What is your take on the saving habits of Gen-Y ?
Will the current recession help change our notoriously bad savings habits , or do you think we 'll see more of the same ?
A sincere thank you again to Smarty Pig ’s co-founder Michael Ferrari .

When I reported this a few weeks ago , I think I was the first to see significance in what former Drug Czar Brigadier General Barry McCaffrey said – and to be honest , I ’m surprised it has n’t been picked up more .
( The full video of the Council on Foreign Relations event on US - Mexico relations is here . )
One of our more aggressive drug czars who vehemently attacked those politicians who suggested even allowances for medicinal marijuana and under whom arrests for mere marijuana possession went way up [ pdf ] now says this :
QUESTIONER : … [ W ] hy not just legalize drugs ?
Former Drug Czar , General BARRY MCCAFFREY ( retired ) : … [ S ] ince I ’m not in public life , [ I can say ] I actually do n’t care .
I care about 6th graders through 12th graders .
If you ’re 40 years old , and you ’re living in Oregon , and you have 12 giant pot plants in the back of your log cabin , knock yourself out .
( Laughter . )
( For those watching the video , the first questioner who did not identify himself sounded like Ted Sorenson , the venerable former Kennedy speechwriter who is a frequent guest at Council on Foreign Relations events . )
McCaffrey is not the first drug czar to reveal more nuanced views after his tenure was over .
Matthea Falco , a drug czar in the 1970s , has become a strong proponent of the harm reduction over the prohibition approach .
When asked why by PBS , she responded :
It ’s very hard not to change your vision if you stay in the field long enough …
If you look over the sweep of time , what changed for me from 1980 until about 1990 , and continuing today , is that the price of drugs has just plummeted in this country …
So that ’s got to be a failure [ of the War on Drugs ] …
It ’s also a flawed strategy .
Many people argue that it just has n’t been implemented enough , that , “ If you just put ten times as much money into it , it would change everything . ”
But , in fact , it ’s a flawed strategy at its very core .
[ my emphasis ]
Yet another former Drug Czar Peter Bourne commented on the evolution of the War on Drugs into the war on marijuana – beginning here with the claims that marijuana had significantly bad health effects :
It was policymakers trying to hide behind the skirts of science , trying to say that marijuana poses a threat to the health of young people .
Taking any drugs is probably not a good idea .
But [ marijuana ] certainly posed no significant public health problem .
In many ways , it ’s somewhat reminiscent of 50 years ago when moralists argued that masturbation was morally wrong .
They could n’t just argue that it was morally wrong , so they argued that it made you insane .
They were able to get enough physicians to say , “ Yes , masturbation makes you insane , ” and people argued that this was causing insanity .
Therefore , you were justified in condemning masturbation .
I see the same sort of process with the use of marijuana , which is a trivial health problem .
These are the men and women who were in charge of the War on Drugs – and in running this war , they have come to see it ’s madness .
As Matthea Falco said , “ It ’s very hard not to change your vision if you stay in the field long enough . ”
Those who are engaged with these issues begin to see the obvious :
The War on Drugs is a war on our citizenry which has led us to imprison a higher percentage of our population than any other country on earth .
It is destabilizing our neighbors and other countries essential to our national security with the Pentagon going to far as to claim that Mexico is at risk of a complete collapse due to the effects of the Drug War .
Domestically , it competes with police resources leading to a measurable rise in non -drug related serious crimes [ pdf ] as police attention is diverted .
It competes with counterterrorism measures and resources .
The War on Drugs is actively making us less safe – and it has failed to stop or even reduce the availability or price of drugs .
As one wise senator said in 2004 :
The war on drugs is an utter failure .
Now that senator is president of the United States of America – and though he offers better policies and a softening of the hardest edges of the Drug War ( which includes refraining from calling it a war ) , he does not offer the bold action that we need to make us safer .
The Obama administration seems content to maintain the prohibitionist policies “ firmly rooted in prejudices , fears and ideological visions ” that have failed decisively ( in the words of the major report on the Drug War by the former presidents of Mexico , Brazil , and Columbia . )
But the War on Drugs and the prohibition it is based on endanger both our liberty and our security .
Both must end .

Advertisement Pakistan opposition leader Nawaz Sharif has defied an apparent bid to put him under house arrest in Lahore ahead of a " march " on the capital Islamabad .
Thousands of supporters joined him after he broke through a police barricade of his home to reach a rally .
Police fired tear gas as protesters hurled stones .
Sharif activists later managed to overcome barriers blocking access to the main highway to Islamabad and Mr Sharif left Lahore in a convoy .
The Pakistan Muslim League ( PML - N ) supporters plan a " long march " to the capital to demand judges sacked by the former government be reinstated .
" It 's now a matter of the future of Pakistani nation and coming generations , " Mr Sharif said earlier by telephone from his bullet - proof car .
" How can we abandon our mission halfway ? "
Mr Sharif is expected to arrive in Rawalpindi - near Islamabad - in the early hours of Monday .
He is due to be joined there by his brother , Shahbaz Sharif , former chief minister of the Punjab , and leaders of the lawyers ' movement .
Police are said to be surrounding the property in Rawalpindi where his brother is believed to be staying .
' Fascist tactics '
Sharif activists used mobile hydraulic lifts , apparently brought along for the purpose , to remove massive containers placed as obstacles on the highway .
The house arrest is illegal and immoral , all these decisions are unconstitutional
Nawaz Sharif
A crisis about more than judges
In pictures : Pakistan protests Deja-vu in crackdown
The BBC's Barbara Plett says it is not clear if Mr Sharif will be able to reach Islamabad , given the authorities have blocked routes leading to the capital .
Ahead of the protest , the government has also arrested hundreds of opposition activists and banned rallies , saying they could trigger violence .
Our Islamabad correspondent says the campaign over the judges has become a power struggle between Mr Sharif and current President Asif Ali Zardari .
She says the unrest has alarmed the West , which wants Pakistan to focus on the battle against the Taleban on the Afghan border .
President Zardari - the widower of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto - promised to bring back the judges when he took office last year following his wife 's assassination .
Early on Sunday , riot police blocked access roads to Mr Sharif 's home and reportedly baton - charging his supporters .
Leaving his home later in the morning , Mr Sharif told a crowd : " The house arrest is illegal and immoral .
All these decisions are unconstitutional , " reported AFP news agency .

Party spokesman Ahsan Iqbal told the BBC : " A government which claims to be a democratic government is coming with such heavy - handed fascist tactics . "
But interior ministry chief Rehman Malik told the BBC the police were outside Mr Sharif 's home for his own protection because of the threat from terrorists .
Long - running tensions
Mr Sharif was ousted as prime minister in 1999 during a coup by General Pervez Musharraf , who ruled until August 2008 .
Tensions between Mr Zardari and Mr Sharif date back to the 1990s , but the two formed a brief partnership in government after parliamentary elections in February 2008 .
Mr Sharif 's party later left the alliance , complaining of reluctance by Mr Zardari's Pakistan People 's Party to reinstate the judges sacked by the last government .
Relations have been further strained in recent weeks by a Supreme Court decision to ban Mr Sharif and his brother Shahbaz from elected office , and President Zardari 's decision to put their stronghold in Punjab province under direct rule from Islamabad .
But on Saturday , in a move seen as a conciliatory gesture , the government agreed to seek a review of the Supreme Court ruling .
The political instability comes as Pakistan faces an economic crisis and a growing militant insurgency based in the north - west .

Striking testimony has emerged from Israeli soldiers involved in the Gaza war in which they describe shooting unarmed civilians , sometimes under orders from their officers .
One soldier described how an Israeli sniper shot dead a Palestinian mother and her two children , adding that fellow troops believed the lives of Palestinians were " very , very less important than the lives of our soldiers " .
The testimony , published in the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz today , gives a rare insight into how Israeli soldiers fought the war on the ground ; reinforces Palestinian accounts of disproportionate Israeli force ; and sharply contradicts the Israeli military 's official version of events .
The accounts come from unnamed soldiers who were graduates of a pre-military course at Oranim Academic College in Tivon and who spoke in a session in mid-February .
The transcript of the session was published this week and obtained by Ha'aretz .
In that transcript , one infantry squad leader said : " There was a house with a family inside … We put them in a room .
Later we left the house and another platoon entered it , and a few days after that there was an order to release the family .
They had set up positions upstairs .
There was a sniper position on the roof .
" The platoon commander let the family go and told them to go to the right .
One mother and her two children did n't understand and went to the left , but they forgot to tell the sharpshooter on the roof they had let them go and it was OK , and he should hold his fire and he ... he did what he was supposed to , like he was following his orders .
The sharpshooter saw a woman and children approaching him , closer than the lines he was told no one should pass .
He shot them straight away .
In any case , what happened is that in the end he killed them . "
The squad leader said he believed the sniper did not feel regret .
" I do n't think he felt too bad about it , because after all , as far as he was concerned , he did his job according to the orders he was given .
And the atmosphere in general , from what I understood from most of my men who I talked to ... I do n't know how to describe it ...
The lives of Palestinians , let 's say , is something very , very less important than the lives of our soldiers .
So as far as they are concerned they can justify it that way . "
A second squad leader , from the same brigade , described how a company commander ordered troops to shoot an elderly Palestinian woman who was walking on a road about 100 metres from a house the soldiers had taken over .
He said he argued with his commander about the rules of engagement , particularly the way they shot without warning to clear houses .
Ha'aretz reported : " After the orders were changed , the squad leader 's soldiers complained that ' We should kill everyone there [ in the centre of Gaza ] .
Everyone there is a terrorist . ' "
The squad leader said : " You do not get the impression from the officers that there is any logic to it , but they wo n't say anything .
To write ' death to the Arabs ' on the walls , to take family pictures and spit on them , just because you can .
I think this is the main thing : to understand how much the IDF [ Israel Defence Forces ] has fallen in the realm of ethics , really .
It 's what I 'll remember the most . "
The head of the Oranim course was apparently " shocked " after hearing the soldiers ' accounts of their fighting and reported his concerns to the army chief , Major General Gabi Ashkenazi .
Ashkenazi's office asked for a transcript of the discussion , which was provided .
The Israeli military today first denied having " any previous knowledge or information about these incidents " .
Then in a later statement it admitted that the head of the course had sent a letter to the chief of staff 's office " several weeks ago " describing the soldiers ' accounts and that the military 's chief education officer then met with the course head .
It said the military advocate general , Brigadier General Avichai Mendelblit , today instructed the military police to investigate the soldiers ' accounts .
Before a standing army can rule , the people must be disarmed ; as they are in almost every kingdom in Europe .
The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword ; because the whole body of the people are armed , and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops that can be , on any pretence , raised in the United States .
A military force , at the command of Congress , can execute no laws , but such as the people perceive to be just and constitutional ; for they will possess the power , and jealousy will instantly inspire the inclination , to resist the execution of a law which appears to them unjust and oppressive .
~ Noah Webster
While we stumble along economically with bailouts , buyouts , and poor sales in almost all sectors , two products in America are seeing dramatic increases in sales : guns and ammo .
People who never owned a gun before are buying ; people are buying multiples of military style weapons and ammo is being bought by the case instead of by the box .
Many explain this away as folks simply worried that Obama will move to ban certain firearms , especially those referred to by the ignorant as " assault weapons , " I believe the motivation to buy firearms and ammunition goes much deeper .
More and more Americans are becoming increasingly aware of the storm that is brewing on the horizon , a storm driven by the possibility of a complete economic collapse .
The more astute are reading the handwriting on the wall : military combat units being assigned for stateside duty to quell domestic disturbances , a militarization of law enforcement , and the fear of what will happen when the state is no longer able to provide monthly checks to the millions currently living on government handouts labeled as " entitlements . "
A strong possibility exists , when the checks stop , those who no longer have will seek to forcibly take from those who do .
The scenes from New Orleans after Katrina have not disappeared from the public memory .
Regardless , legislation has been pre-planned and is now in place to be implemented just as soon as we have another tragedy involving a criminal idiot with guns .
Most are unaware that Congressional representative , Carolyn McCarthy from New York , introduced H.R. 1022 in February 2007 .
This draconian , unconstitutional piece of socialist baloney would ban a multitude of firearms currently available , including the Ruger 10 / 22 , one of the most popular .22 caliber rifles on the market .
. 22 caliber rifles are commonly used for small game hunting , plinking and target practice ; none are in use either in the military or law enforcement as the caliber is considered too small and underpowered for use on targets larger than small game or predators ; a fact that somehow escaped the intelligence of Ms. McCarthy .
Proof positive that politicians do n’t really care what type of weapon you have ; it is the simple fact they do not want you to have any weapon at all .
Representative McCarthy ’s husband Dennis was shot and killed by Colin Ferguson on the Long Island Railroad in December of 1993 .
Her son , Kevin , was also seriously injured .
The logic that has escaped Ms. McCarthy is : if her husband had possessed a weapon , he could have possibly saved his life and the lives of others that fateful day .
Instead , those who were prohibited by the laws of the state from protecting themselves were hopelessly slaughtered and maimed by a madman who cared not about those laws , and thanks to the liberal laws of New York , is still breathing good air .
Ms. McCarthy won election to congress based on her anti-gun position .
Ironic , is it not , that one can be elected to congress by proposing laws contrary to the constitution and then take an oath pledging to " support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies , foreign or domestic … "
McCarthy reportedly was inspired to run for congress because her predecessor , Congressman Dan Frisa , supported the Constitution and voted against an assault weapons bill .
Leave it up to New Yorkers to defeat those who support the constitution and elect those who seek to destroy it .
Comrade McCarthy displayed her true colors when she filed a lawsuit against the Olin Corporation , makers of the ammunition used by Ferguson , but never filed suit against Ferguson himself .
Obviously , McCarthy sought to profit from the death of her husband and the injuries to her son by accusing the manufacturers of an inanimate object of the crimes .
Of course the company who manufactured this inanimate object had much " deeper pockets " than Mr. Ferguson , the person who actually loaded the ammunition into a firearm and pulled the trigger , killing six people and wounding nineteen .
Thank goodness her frivolous lawsuit failed .
Americans are purchasing firearms and ammunition in record numbers , not because they believe 2009 will offer unusually good duck hunting , but because they fear the fallout from the coming economic storm and the state ’s reaction to that fallout .
The larger question is : how many of those who have gone out and purchased firearms and ammo will actually use them ?
I believe a large number would bring those weapons to bear against criminals who would steal and threaten their families and property , but , how many would use them against the criminal state as it moves to seize their weapons , as was done in New Orleans , when the next " emergency " occurs , be it an economic meltdown or terrorist attack ?
Rest assured , there will be a great majority who will not stand against tyranny .
Those who have " gone along to get along " and those who have continually voted for the " lesser of two evils " will capitulate and surrender their weapons , as cowards normally do .
They will rue the day they failed to support those who stood for liberty such as Ron Paul .
Remember , they were offered liberty , but chose instead to support the status quo , because , in their eyes , liberty could not be elected .
Those among us who are afraid to be free will surrender their guns , their families , and their freedom to tyranny .
Do not place your freedom or trust in their hands or depend on them to cover your six .

Lincoln Self Shielded Flux cored Weld Wires
and Apathetic , Chrysler WELD Management :
The prime cause of all robot weld issues starts in the front office .
An E-mail addressed to this site .
Ed .
The tier one automotive parts company I work for has been told by the Chrysler corporate weld engineer that we have to use " self shielding flux cored wires " when welding galvaneald steel parts .
The Lincoln self shielded flux cored wires we have tried have caused us numerous welding issues .
Our robot weld rework rates so far have been in the sixty to a hundred percent range .
The robot operators and workers around the robot cells frequently complain about the self shielded weld fumes and the paint shop is appalled at having to paint over a weld slag that is very difficult to remove .
Ed what is the logical justification for using these useless steel weld wires ?
Ed 's Answer : I feel your pain .
This self shielded flux cored nonsense has been going on for more a decade .
Let me tell you one weld application story about the same Chrysler engineer and how over a decade his companies " self shielded , flux cored wire recommendations " have cost his company at least fifty million dollars .
Stage One : 1995 - 96 , the $ 800,000 per-month Neon Cross member Robot Weld Fiasco :
The following weld application is a description of a robot weld management disaster and how a big three weld engineer along with some good old weld product salesmanship had dramatic cost repercussions for both Chrysler and it 's part suppliers .
This unique robot weld application is an indication of the costly damage that can result from apathetic engineering management and unqualified engineers , individuals who lack the ability to or take ownership of their equipment or responsibility for their weld process decisions .
It was late 1995 : The Chrysler Twinsburg plant manager had requested that I assist him with a major robot weld issue occurring at his plant .
I knew from my short conversation with this man that he was an excellent manufacturing manager and let 's face it , you have to be a top gun manufacturing manager to manage Chrysler 's prime Minivan stamping facility .
Looking very frustrated with his plant 's robot weld issues , the Chrysler manager informed me that in the past his plant had not been involved with " robot welds " and the issues on his newly installed robot line were making him ill .
The new multi-million dollar robot line was set up in his plant to weld Neon cross member parts .
The plant manager informed me that the robot cell quality / production issues on this line was costing his plant > $ 800,000 per month .
At the time of our meeting the cross member robot weld repairs and weld production issues had gone on for more than a year , costing Chrysler approx .
10 million dollars .
POOR DESIGN AND POOR WELD MANAGEMENT : The Neon steel cross member parts to be welded , ranged from 1.5 to 2 mm thick .
From a weld perspective I pointed out to the Chrysler team that the overlap parts were poorly designed .
The cross member parts were made out of two sections that overlapped , as indicated in the left sketch .
In the robot welded , continuos lap seam joint , the 1.5 mm section became the weld base of the horizontal welded joint .
A simple fact that few Chrysler designers were aware of , it 's much more difficult to create weld burn through a 2 mm part than it is to burn through a part 1.5 mm , especially when you use large weld wires and have poor joint fit and weld gaps up to 4 mm .
This common weld design oversight , along with the incorrect selection of weld consumables selected contributed to the extensive weld burn through .
THE SELECTION OF SOME OF THE WORST WELDING CONSUMABLES AVAILABLE :
The welded parts were " galvanealed " .
To weld the parts the Chrysler corporate weld engineer had selected a variety of self shielded wires .
The self shielding wires utilized were Lincoln , E71T - G ( NR 212 ) and NR 211 wires .
The weld wire size available at that time was 5/64 wire .
The Lincoln Electric plant that made the wires was less than 20 miles away and Lincoln was involved in the decision to utilize this weld wire .
The self shielded flux cored weld wire selected for the very thin cross members were large and required a weld current range of 280 to 350 amps .
Note .
Approx .
320 - 330 amps is the optimum current for this size weld wire .
The high weld current required for this wire had more in common with robot welding steel applications >
1/4 (> 6 mm ) thick , rather than welding thin gage parts 1.5 mm with gaps .
THE LACK OF ABILITY TO MAKE PARTS TO THE DESIGN TOLERANCES .
When the top part and bottom part of the new stamped cross member components were joined together , there were extensive weld gaps typically 2 to 4 mm between the parts .
Possibly the self shielded weld wire was initially selected as its a " straight polarity " weld wire in which most the weld heat goes into the part rather than to the wire as it does with reverse polarity .
Keep in mind with this type of weld wire , only large wire sizes were available .
What the Chrysler engineer did not appear to realize , that irrespective of the weld polarity of a weld consumable , a thin gage part retains a great portion of it's weld heat and therefore can only take so much weld current .
The bottom line , as any weld technician with six months experience would have known , the 280 - 320 amps and the 1.5 mm steels were simply not compatible .
Compatible or not , the large self shielded weld consumable was the wire selected by the Chrysler weld engineer for the robot line .
It 's interesting to note that at that time , this weld wire was not marketed by any wire manufacture including Lincoln as a weld wire designed specifically for " thin galvanealed or galvanized parts " .
The high weld current required by the Lincoln straight polarity , self shielded flux cored wires , created so many weld burn holes in the Neon parts that during each shift Chrysler had to utilize up to 13 manual weld personnel to manually weld over the entire robot flux cored welds .
The welding fumes and conditions were so bad at the end of the robot line that the MANUAL REPAIR WELDERS HAD TO WEAR FRESH AIR BREATHING MASKS and due to health concerns the management had to rotate the manual repair welders every four hours .
The picture above right shows the typical weld fumes generated by the Lincoln self shielded flux core wires when exhaust equipment is not used .
Once this poor excuse for a weld wire was embedded in the Chrysler plant , the weld folklore , myths and process chaos began .
When asked why he choose a weld wire that was causing numerous weld quality , productivity and safety issues , the Chrysler weld engineer would inform all that his choice of this self shielding weld wire was necessary when " welding steel galvanealed applications " .
From that day onwards he was committed to that incorrect , multi million statement and for years to come all Chrysler part suppliers had to weld galvanealed parts with this unsuitable weld consumable .
The daily weld rework on the Chrysler Neon cross members was often 100 % and the weld reject rate of the robot sub assembly parts averaged 60 to 100 % .
Note : THE INFLUENCE OF SALESMANSHIP ON AN INDUSTRY THAT OFTEN RELIES ON SALES ADVICE : Later on , as the use of galvanealed parts grew and as the Lincoln self shielded weld wire sales grew at the Chrysler and their tier plants welding galvanealed applications , Lincoln changed it 's self shielding sales literature to read
" This self shielded flux cored wires is developed for single and multiple pass , semiautomatic and automatic welding of mild steel , sheet metal , plate and coated applications Without any weld metallurgical justification , Lincoln changed it 's self shielded marketing for the consumables in question and informed it 's weld customers that " these " self shielded flux cored wires were designed for coated steel " applications .
This data is available on the Lincoln web site under self shielded data Nov. 27 / 05 .
THERE IS A REASON YOU HAVE TO CLICK ON A BULL TO ENTER THIS WEB SITE : Some weld consumable manufacturers , ( not all ) will recommend a weld consumable that their competitors do not sell .
Typically this so called unique weld consumable may not be the best weld consumable for the intended application , however this common weld sales tactic ensures no one else can bid on on the weld consumable business .
In the auto / truck industry , where few managers want ownership of the weld processes in their plants , once a weld consumable is selected , it 's typically embedded in concrete and could be used for decades .
Any reputable welding technician and Lincoln has a few , would be aware that irrespective of the weld polarity utilized , > 300 plus amps is simply not compatible with 1.5 mm gage parts .
Is it possible that the Chrysler weld engineer never had the ambition to acquire the weld knowledge of a reputable weld technician ?
If so it 's unfortunate as the choice of the weld wire has cost his company and part suppliers millions in weld rejects and rework .
On the right is a picture of the self shielded flux cored weld .
Its a pity people who buy cars do n't get to see the welds that hold their cars together .
The majority of the self shielded robot welds were full of weld burn through holes and had welds that were coated with a surface weld slag .
The parts with the weld defects were not cleaned before the second manual repair pass was made .
Note the heavily contaminated weld slag that occurs with these welds .
To try to remove this slag from the robot weld surface was a hopeless task as the tenacious slag was influenced by the high weld current used and it was almost impossible to remove .
Due to the weld conditions , weld alloy and impurities content and surface slag formed , no process or consumable was suited to make the manual weld repairs , however the repairs were made with the same weld self shielded wires .
Every junior weld technician that has anything to do with welding would know that no weld should be made over the top of another weld when the first weld has slag on it's surface , however the Chrysler engineers did not seem concerned .
IT WAS NOT A SMALL WELD REPAIR :
As the robot weld burn through was so extensive around the cross member seam weld that held the two cross member parts together , the manual repair welders would frequently weld around the complete cross member seam .
In most instances the manual welders wearing breathing masks would make a repair welds approx .
100 inches long .
The second pass , manual repair welds were made over the total robot seam weld .
Can you imagine how these over sized , over heated welds full of defects and questionable alloy combinations on the thin 1.5 to 2 mm parts , would perform in a crash test .
If you can not imagine try this data .
1998 : Three years after I tried to get Chrysler management to do the right thing and improve the welds on the Neon , the following collision data was presented by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety .
Chrysler Neon 1998 Injury , Collision , Indicators
Index : Score : Rating :
Injury Index 131 .
This is substantially worse than average score of 100 .
These scores are stated in relative terms , with 100 being the average for all cars in each category .
Scores greater than 100 represent higher risk in each category .
For example , an injury indicator score of 131 means that a passenger in this model is 31 % more likely to be injured in an accident .
The injury , collision , indicators for the 1998 PLYMOUTH NEON are provided by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety , Highway Loss Data Institute .
Learn more about these results .
March 2005 .
After a decade of self shielded flux cored , on national TV , a Crash Test organization announced that of all the cars it tested in 2005 the Chrysler Neon got the worst crash test results .
WELD APPEARANCE :
The manual repair welds were made on top of defective welds that either burnt through , had lack of weld fusion and extensive porosity and entrapped weld slag .
Off course the resulting welds would have poor mechanical and fatigue properties .
Not that anyone seemed to care but the finished weld quality on this project would be frowned on in a third world country weld shop , ( ironically this project did end up in a plant in Mexico ) .
E-COAT FOR CORROSION PROTECTION :
It was very difficult to remove the self shielded weld slag , so you can be sure on these welded parts the E Coat which was later applied did not adhere as it should , well who 's worried about corrosion when the parts are not mechanically sound .
SINGLE PASS WELD WIRES :
It 's ironic that some the self shielded weld wires that made the welds were at this time approved by the AWS for " single pass welds only " .
A single weld pass limitation for a weld consumable is an indication of either excess or uncontrolled alloy content in the weld wire .
When requiring weld repairs and welding with two layers , these weld wires will automatically result in excess alloy content resulting typically in welds that may have poor ductility .
The weld chemistry and weld mechanical issues generated by the two weld layers are further aggravated when you add the affects of excess slag , excess weld heat , internal weld defects along with the addition of zinc from the galvanealed coating .
" WELD ENGINEERS AND FUNDAMENTAL WELD PROCESS EXPERTISE "
[ ]
A self shielded weld wire recommendation for auto / truck parts would never be accepted by a knowledgeable weld engineer and this weld wire recommendation would never be accepted in a facility that prides itself on it's engineering , weld production and weld quality capability .
[ ]
The self shielded weld wire recommendation would never be accepted by a facility that has pride in the components it builds and worries about weld quality , weld mechanicals and product liability .
[ ]
The self shielded weld wire recommendation would never be accepted by any management who is concerned about the health of its workers . []
The lack of an effective manual weld repair procedure would not have been approved in an organization that is concerned about the weld integrity on the parts it delivers .
[ ]
The self shielded wire more than doubled the production time required to produce the parts .
WORKERS and HEALTH :
Poor quality , self shielded robot welds and poor robot weld
production rates were not the only weld problems in the Chrysler plant .
The self shielded weld wires had alloys that were maxed out ( PEL ) in the MSD sheets .
The alloy levels in the weld wires recommended create a serious health hazard and some of the self shielded wires accepted and still in use have alloys which in the form of smoke or dust are classed as " carcinogenic " .
The robot cells utilized had exhaust units , however the manual repair welders working
near the cells were required to wear breathing apparatus and the smoke from the manual weld repair area floated throughout the rest of the plant .
This photo
Shows the SS smoke generated in a plant wothout ventilation .
Another concern with the self shielded flux cored wires that create so
much weld rework is the grinding and cleaning of the welds on the parts to be repaired or coated .
The dust created from the rework also creates a severe safety hazard .
Once the self shielded , high level alloy particles and dust from grinding repairs get into your shop air how do you control it ?
The bottom line you do n't have to worry about weld fume or dust controls if you make rational weld engineering decisions and refuse to use these weld consumables .
JOB SATISFACTION , WORKERS , FATIGUE , WELDER TURN OVER AND LIABILITY :
For those of you not used to these self shielded wires promoted by Lincoln Electric , please be aware that your robot operators and weld repair personnel when working with these weld consumables can expect fatigue , and other weld fume symptoms .
The company using these products can also anticipate employee turn over issues and poor worker moral .
Perhaps one day a knowledgeable person in the plant that uses these products will pick up the dusty , rarely opened MSD specifications for these weld wires and become aware of the potential weld fume safety issues .
The sad part about making worker use these products is that the self shielded wires were not necessary for the application in the first place .
These welds could be made with the cleaner MIG process and lower cost MIG wires .
On the galvanealed parts , the MIG process fumes would offer no known safety hazards and the welds would provide greater weld quality and productivity potential .
CHRYSLER GOES ONE DIRECTION .
THE REST OF THE WELD WORLD GOES THE OTHER :
By the way , if the self shielded products could achieve what the Chrysler corporate engineer claimed and Lincoln Electric they could do , every car / truck plant in the world would be using these obnoxious products .
The weld reality is the majority of companies worldwide that weld both galvanealed and hot dipped galvanized steel applications have always successfully used the MIG process with conventional steel MIG wires and two part gas mixes .
THE CHRYSLER PLANT MANAGER WANTED A
PROPOSAL FROM ME FOR HIS COSTLY ROBOT WELD ISSUES :
The frustrated and very tense Chrysler plant manager informed me he had little respect for the weld advice coming from his corporate center .
He asked if I would present a proposal to the corporate engineering team responsible and rectify the costly robot weld problems for the welded cross members .
WITH ROBOT WELD ISSUES , YOU FIRST HAVE TO RESOLVE THE PEOPLE ISSUES .
I knew it would be a difficult task to convince the engineer who had made the weld wire decision , to admit that he had made a multi-million mistake about a simple two control weld process .
I therefore proposed to the plant manager that rather than waste time trying to cut through egos in denial or have exhaustive discussions with inexperienced individuals , I would present to the Chrysler corporation engineering team responsible for the Neon cross m embers , the following practical proposal .
I would simply MIG weld the parts with a robot using both the MIG and self shielded flux cored process and let the resulting mechanical tests , weld quality and productivity data from an outside , unbiased , testing agency speak for itself .
For the welds on the cross member parts , I would utilize a reputable Detroit testing agency .
The weld test data would be taken from both the MIG and self shielding welds .
The report would provide micro / macro weld and HAZ samples .
Appropriate hardness tests for welds and HAZ and tensile tests .
THE NEW NEON CROSS MEMBER WELD PROCEDURE : I robot welded the Neon cross member parts using the common E70S - 3 , and 0.045 and 0.035 ( 1.2 - 1 mm ) MIG wires .
I selected the 70S - 3 as it has lower silicon and manganese than the E70S - 6 MIG wire , ( less alloy reactions with the galvanealed ) .
THE AUTO INDUSTRY HAS FOR DECADES BEEN MAKING INCORRECT WELD WIRE DECISIONS .
The E70S - 6 MIG wire has for three decades mistakenly been used throughout the global auto and truck weld industry for zinc coated application s. Lower silicon in the weld as available with the S3 wire , can reduce the potential for micro weld crac ks when combined with the zinc found in galvanized and galvanealed coatings .
For some of the the robot cross member project welds , I used the E70S - 3 , MIG weld wire and argon - 10 % CO2 in the spray transfer mode in the 200 to 220 amp range , much lower than the 280 plus amps used with the self shielded wires .
With the robot welds I also used the short circuit process using 160 to 180 amps which was beneficial on the parts where the weld gaps were most sever .
In less than 5 days I eliminated the majority of the weld burn through issues , established the required robot cross member and sub assembly procedures .
It took another week for the Detroit Testing Agency to provide the weld test results .
T HE UNBIASED WELD TEST REPORT THAT SHOULD HAVE CONVINCED A RATIONAL ENGINEER :
I sent the Detroit Testing agency both the new MIG cross member samples on the galvanealed parts and the self shielded weld samples .
The resulting weld test report indicated that in contrast to the self shielded wires , all the MIG welds provided superior weld / mechanical results and the MIG welds all passed the mechanical destructive and CDT tests with flying colors .
With the Chrysler MIG robot welded parts and weld report in the back of the car I went back to the Chrysler Corporate Center and presented the results in an extensive report to all the engineers on the cross member team .
I placed the new welded parts on the table the quality of which they had never seen before .
I kept the presentation simple and to the point .
By the way my MIG weld data also provided Chrysler with a great bonus as I increased the robot weld speed and resulting weld productivity by 30 % .
I also reduced the total weld rework from 100 % to an anticipated 8 % .
Yes some weld rework was still required due to the poor part fit and excess weld gaps < 4 mm in the parts .
The weld solutions I presented at the Chrysler meeting in January 1996 , would immediately save Chrysler approx .
$ 800,000 per month and increase the cross member robot weld productivity by 30 % .
All the weld data presented at this meeting indicated that the primary issue was with the weld process and consumables selected .
The poor part fit issues could be addressed with a possible die change which the engineers informed me was in the budget .
The Chrysler corporate management who managed the engineers responsible for the parts received the report .
I knew that these managers and their engineers and designers understood little about the weld processes discussed so I kept the report data at a level anyone can understand .
The new MIG test weld data was very well received by the Chrysler plant manager and by all the corporate , cross member team except by one individual , " the Chrysler weld engineer " .
I thought the battle was over , however it turned out to be a battle I never would win .
CHRYSLER WELD ENGINEER DENIAL :
After I left , I found out that the Chrysler weld engineer denied that the problem was with his wire selection and insisted that the self shielded wires had to be used to compensate for the galvanealed coating .
His peers ALL HIGHLY TRAINED ENGINEERS had all seen the engineering evidence necessary to know that the wrong process had been used , however they simply did not have the balls to stand up to the weld engineer and let him have his way .
It 's obvious the Chrysler weld engineer was not interested in the success of the MIG process on his companies parts .
It 's evident he was concerned about protecting his " credibility " as an engineer .
Lets face it , who wants it known that you are the individual that 's responsible for a the multi-million dollar loss for your corporation .
To show his team his " flexibility " for change , the Chrysler weld engineer allowed the use of a slightly smaller self shielded weld wire to weld his cross member parts .
After 15 pus million dollars lost to rework and rejects , the President of Chrysler decided that his less than two year old , state of the art , multi-million dollar , cross member weld line was a project he wanted buried and therefore did what many Detroit executives have done in the past .
Rather than fire his weld engineer , the Chrysler president " gave up on the project " and made the brilliant management engineering decision to sweep his robot weld issues under a rug located in Mexico .
The president of Chrysler decided that the new state of the art robot line in his Ohio plant should be shut down .
The new robots , the million dollar fixtures and what should have been a simple common weld application that would have been welded with ease using MIG , would now be moved south to Mexico .
I suppose the Chrysler president anticipated that in Mexico there would be less objections to the use of the self shielded wires and of course less concern for the manual weld repair costs and the safety and environmental issues .
Mexico can thank America for many jobs , but this is not one of them .
By the way I later visited the plant in Mexico where these part were being made .
It was the same weld mess , only instead of a providing a new die that provided parts that fit to the design tolerances the plant provided the Mexican workers with " hammers " .
The welds were still full of holes and still made with the same consumables , only this time I did not see workers using fresh air helmets when doing the manual welds .
MORE EVIDENCE THIS TIME FROM A LITTLE COMPANY CALLED US STEEL : Its 2OO4 : Eight years had passed and I was back at the Chrysler corporate center face to face with you know who .
The same corporate weld engineer was still working for the Chrysler , in a way I was surprised that he had not been promoted to some VP position .
I was back at Chrysler in a consultant roll to discuss another galvaneal project handled by a tier one supplier .
I was basically talking to many of the same Chrysler engineering group .
This time I represented a supplier who was loosing over $ 250,000 annually because he was made to use the same self shielded wires on some small galvanealed parts .
At this meeting new weld test data was presented along with an unusual letter that I had attained from a company that knows a little about steel components , the letter was from US Steel .
The US Steel Corporation makes most of the high strength galvanealed steels sold in North America .
In the letter which was addressed to Chrysler , the US Steel chief metallurgist recommended that the MIG process rather than the self shielded SS process be used for the coated steel applications .
Again the data we presented was well received by the majority of Chr ysler corporate engineers and also by a very frustrated Chrysler purchasing manager who chaired the meeting .
It seems the purchasing manager was fed up with dealing with suppliers who had many complaints against the use of the self shielded flux cored weld wires .
The Chrysler Corporate Purchasing manager chaired the weld meeting and he did not looking pleased with his weld engineer .
I was not aware till some of the engineers informed me that It seems over the years the purchasing manager had to attend too many of these self shielded weld wire meetings with many other disgruntled tier suppliers .
Let 's face it , all good purchasing personnel are driven by cost reduction and this purchasing manager knew that many times Chrysler had been presented with great opportunities for multi-million dollar weld cost reduction and yet over and over he had seen the engineering team turn their backs on engineering logic .
At the end of the day these Lincoln self shielded weld wire meetings always got bogged down as the weld engineer would stand his ground and would not back down on his process decision .
This meeting as with the presentation eight years ago , again provided over overwhelming evidence along with the support letter from US Steel , yet the Chrysler weld engineer stood behind his choice of the self shielded weld consumables .
This report also took a further step in the examination of " fatigue properties " .
The report dealt with crash weld test data and showed their were unusual weld failure issues occurring with the self shielded wire welds , while all the MIG welds passed the tests .
With all the evidence the Chrysler weld engineer would again not allow the change to MIG .
Each supplier who used the self shielded products and bought the related weld issues and considerable cost savings from the MIG process to the table for Chrysler was shot down by the Chrysler weld engineer .
From a weld mechanical , weld chemistry , weld quality and weld productivity perspective , in contrast to MIG wires , the self shielded flux cored wires when tested offer no weld benefits , the Lincoln self shielded wires do however offer ;
[ a ] excess weld spatter ,
[ b ] tenacious difficult to remove weld slag ,
[ c ] poor weld fill and inconsistent weld fusion potential ,
[ d ] higher weld consumable costs ,
[ e ] weld fumes that should be considered a hazard .
[ f ] higher than normal weld repair rates that lead to excess part heat on high strength , coated thin gage applications .
This heat can greatly reduce both the part mechanical properties and lower the corrosion resistance along side the welds .
[ g ] welds with excess porosity and slag inclusions will lower fatigue and impact properties .
[ h ] welds in which quality weld repairs will always be suspect .
2005 : Conclusion : Today you will find the self shielded weld wires used at many big three locations , this statement is simply a reflection of the sheep leading the sheep and of course general lack of weld process expertise that prevails at these corporations .
After a decade of costly weld disasters since this product was first used on the Neon , the self shielded flux cored weld wire recommendation is still endorsed in 2005 by the same Chrysler corporate engineer .
Is it a coincidence that in March 2005 ten years after my discussions with Chrysler a major Crash Test organization announced that of all the cars it tested in 2005 the Chrysler Neon got the worst crash test results ?
As with most robot weld problems , the weld issues are typically people issues .
I think when you look at this situation in this report , you may want to know why the managers and engineering team at Chrysler did not do their job .
If you are an engineer involved in welding decisions and you have minimal weld process control expertise , it 's easy to understand why you will not want to take a stand against a person who is supposed to be qualified .
However when you are handed evidence such as presented in this report and you do n't react , you did not do the job you are paid to do .
I anticipate at least 30 million dollars has now been lost to the weld process decision made at Chrysler .
If I was Chrysler management I would use this report for future engineer training sessions called " How not Run a Project " If I was a Chrysler Purchasing Manager I would use this report to show management how engineers can impede cost reduction .
May 2006 E - Mail From PL England .
Ed .
I have just read your Chrysler Neon article regarding the cross members and self shielded flux cored wire issues .
I fully endorse your views and comments .
Its a shame that many " welding engineers " in the automotive industry lack the actual knowledge and skills to fulfill this critical role .
I myself am a welding engineer for a tier one supplier to the auto industry and see this too often .
As a time served boilermaker in the UK , I feel that there is an extensive lack of weld process knowledge and experience with the welding and engineering personnel in the auto / truck industry .
I must also thank you for your books ' A Management & Engineering Guide to MIG & the Training ' materials both of which we as a company refer to regularly .
Cheers Mate .

FEW ENGINEERS OR DESIGNERS IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY ARE AWARE OF THE WELD CURRENT AND PART THICKNESS COMPATIBILITY WITH THE COMMON AVAILABLE MIG AND FLUX CORED WELD CONSUMABLES USED IN THEIR FACILITIES ?
EVEN FEWER WILL UNDERSTAND THE WELD ENERGY DIFFERENCES GENERATED BETWEEN A REVERSE POLARITY MIG WIRE USING SHORT CIRCUIT , PULSED OR A SPRAY , VERSUS A STRAIGHT POLARITY SELF SHIELDED WIRE ?
The bottom line .
In the North American Auto industry I can count on the fingers on one hand the engineers who truly understand the processes that are used to join their metal parts .
However it 's just not an engineering or robot problem .
The sad reality is after two decades of using robots and weld process apathy , the senior corporate management at all the major North American and Japanese auto / truck manufacturers lack the ability to recognize the fundamental human requirements necessary to establish robot weld process controls .
IN THE GOOD OLD DAYS , ENGINEERING KNOWLEDGE USED TO BE GAINED FROM BOOKS AND HANDS ON EXPERIENCE .
TODAY FEW ENGINEERS GET THEIR HANDS DIRTY , EVEN FEWER WILL READ A BOOK ON WELD PROCESS CONTROLS .
IT'S ALSO A SAD WELD REALITY THAT TOO MANY ENGINEERS IN AUTO / TRUCK PLANTS RELY ON WELD ADVICE FROM SALES REPS OR FROM ORGANIZATIONS THAT MAKE THE WELD CONSUMABLES OR WELD EQUIPMENT .
FOR THOSE MANAGERS WHO ARE TOO BUSY PUTTING OUT THEIR DAILY , COSTLY ROBOT WELD SHOP FIRES AND SPENDING MILLIONS ON UNNECESSARY ROBOT WELD REWORK , ALL ANY PERSON HAS TO DO TO GET CONTROL OF THE MIG WELDING ROBOTS IS TAKE LESS ADVICE FROM THE WELD EQUIPMENT AND CONSUMABLE MANUFACTURES AND TAKE A FEW HOURS TO READ MY PROCESS CONTROL MATERIALS , LINK BELOW .
There are many common denominators in this story and in the Lincoln self shielded wires selected for CA buildings that suffered in the North Ridge earth quake .

2009 : May 5 .
This week as Chrysler heads towards bankruptcy and Fiat looks to take over this basket case of a corporation , one thing Fiat needs to realize , when it buys into this company .
It will take ownership of out dated plants and engineers and managers who do n't exactly have a track record they can be proud of .
If the Chrysler Engineer had purchased my $ 300 robot weld process control , self teaching / training resources , or my Management - Engineers Guide to MIG and Flux Cored , he would have learnt someting they did not teach at the University that he graduated from , and he would have saved his Chrysler and their suppliers millions of dollars .
Cambridge Bomb Squad Inspects Burton Third ’s Concrete ‘ Bomb ’
On Friday morning , a dormitory hall ’s publicity stunt bombed .
The Cambridge Bomb Squad responded to a heavy concrete block painted to look like a cartoon bomb , advertising the annual Dance Till You Drop party held by the Burton Third Bombers .
On Friday morning , students watched as bomb squad members sent a robot to inspect the concrete block , which was painted black with “ DTYD ” written in orange letters .
A man in a protective suit inspected the block up close .
A small explosive charge was detonated near the block .
Burton - Conner will be billed by the city for the costs of the multi- hour effort , residents were told by Barbara A. Baker , Senior Associate Dean for Students .
Those costs are not yet clear .
The bomb squad was called in by the Cambridge Fire Department , who were called by MIT police at about 5 a.m.
Friday to ensure that the concrete block was not dangerous .
Eventually , bomb squad personnel chained the block to a fire truck and used a winch to pull the block out of the ground .
After the block was flipped over , the bomb squad declared an all - clear , and Facilities employees with a forklift removed the block .
The “ bomb ” turned out to be a heavy concrete hemisphere made to look like it was buried in the ground , with a concrete “ fuse ” glued on top and with metal spikes attached to the bottom that made it hard to remove from the ground .
An MIT police sergeant was told the bomb was fake at about 3 a.m. by Eric D. Schmiedl ’09 , who photographed it , Schmiedl said .
( Schmiedl is also a Tech staff photographer . )
Noah S. Jessop ’09 , the outgoing Undergraduate Association President , witnessed the bomb squad in action and saw the squad when they eventually realized the “ bomb ” was a just a block of concrete .
After the block was flipped , a bomb technician wearing a blast - resistant suit took off his suit as others posed for photos with the block .
In a written statement , residents of Burton Third apologized for the incident and said that the block was a hack meant to advertise the evening ’s party .
“ We understand that our actions have resulted in significant havoc for the Spring Weekend Committee , MIT Police , and community of Cambridge , and we regret wholly our failure to anticipate such an outcome , ” they said in the statement .
“ We did not intend to convey any threat or danger to the community .
We pledge our full cooperation to the MIT police and administration to address any concerns , ” they said in the statement , available online at http://tech.mit.edu/V129/N21/bombsquad-statement.html.
The event was a “ big misunderstanding , ” said Burton - Conner housemaster Merritt Roe Smith .
Objects that look like bombs are part of “ very sensitive issues , and I understand that . ”
But , he said , if people were to “ pay a little closer attention to student culture , ” there might be fewer misunderstandings like today ’s event .
Charles Lin G , a Tech senior editor , said he was disappointed that the bomb squad had been called in hours after MIT Police were told that the concrete block was a harmless student prank .
“ I ’m just mad that the police knew it was a hack .
The police knew it was a hack and ended up calling in a bomb squad ? ” , said Lin , who is also a Graduate Resident Tutor for Burton Third .
Lin said he was speaking personally and not on behalf of the dormitory .
The Cambridge Bomb Squad is led by a City of Cambridge Police Department lieutenant and has four part - time technicians on staff , according to the department ’s website .
The squad ’s commanding officer , lieutenant Stephen Ahern , was not immediately available for comment .
The party itself , scheduled to start at 9 p.m. tonight , is still on .
An earlier version of this article said that Undergraduate Association President Noah S. Jessop ’09 saw a bomb technician posing for photos with a cherry - bomb - shaped concrete block .
Actually , Jessop saw others posing for photos with the block while the technician removed his blast - resistant suit , after the Cambridge bomb squad had concluded that the concrete was not a bomb .
Michael Taylor , perhaps stowed away in Hillary Clinton 's trunk as a nostalgic reminder of the good ole days when Bill put him in charge of the FDA and he approved rBGH , has reentered government along with her .
He slipped onto Obama 's transition team somehow ( just how ? ) and is now hoping to slip into an office ... in the White House .
What would he do there , he who subjected this country and many others to the increased risk of breast cancer ( 7 times greater risk ) , prostate and colon cancer because of what he did to milk , cheese , yogurt , ice cream with rBGH as well as to all the foods that rely on milk solids and other parts of milk ?
Why , over see " food safety . "
Food Democracy
Now wants people to " [ w ] rite Secretary Vilsack ( AgSec@usda.gov ) and tell him to stand strong on food safety . "
But is n't that the same Vilsack who has no record on food safety , a strong record of support for Monsanto and genetic engineering , and oversaw a huge increase in CAFOs in Iowa and the loss of thousands of small farmers ?
How is he supposed to " stand strong " on something he has never stood on before and actually supports the opposite of ?
And he 's Monsanto's boy and the guy who dreamed up the Monsanto laws that preemptively remove democracy from communities wishing to control what is planted on them or how farms are used .
Food Democracy
Now describes Taylor as :
" Michael Taylor , a former Monsanto executive , whose career literally fits the definition of the revolving door between government , lobbying and corporate interests .
Before serving on the Obama ag transition team , Taylor made a name for himself rotating in and out of law firms , Monsanto , the USDA and FDA .
While at the FDA he helped write the rules to allow rBGH into the American food system and our children ’s milk .
They go on to say " We need a food safety system with some teeth - one that is independent of corporate interests , " yet , mysteriously , they have not even mentioned or yet opposed the bogus " food safety " bills that Monsanto , Cargill , Tysons , and giant surveillance companies want which are designed to destroy our farmers and give control of the US food supply and control of US farmland to multinationals .
Deborah Bryceson of Oxford UK calls it “ de- peasantization ” – the phasing out of traditional family farms to make fertile farmland available for intensive capital accumulation using factory farming . ”
Third world countries were the original target , now it is our turn .
Food Democracy
Now wants people to write " Secretary Vilsack and ask him to reconsider these decisions " but they do n't seem to have the picture yet :
There is a huge plan in place for Monsanto to take over control of all food in the US .
Vilsack was potentially put in at the USDA to help .
Comment Well , was n't that a wonderful little budget ?
We 're broke , borrowing the entire output of many a small nation , and this as a result of the policies from the man who promised to abolish boom and bust .
But it 's not all bad news .
Some of it is worse .
Take , as a minor example , the increase in statutory redundancy pay announced .
Some will point to the huge numbers losing their jobs and say ah , how lovely , they 'll get a little more money when they get shipped out the door .
Few will note that such an increase is likely to increase the number losing their jobs .
As the dismal science continually tries to point out , there are very few actual solutions , there are only trade offs .
And here the trade off is one that we might not really want to be making in such troubled times .
For a company , if it wants to continue trading , must have enough money to cover its bills .
To not have such dosh available is to be trading insolvently and yes , the sum you have available does indeed have to cover the statutory redundancy pay .
Raising the amount that would have to be paid in the event of an unfortunate bankruptcy is therefore going to increase the likelihood of such a bankruptcy occurring .
At this time , when it 's terribly difficult to make a profit or get capital , we 've increased the requirement to have such .
The top tax rate rise has the class warriors cheering , of course .
But it 's a little unfortunate that the Institute for Fiscal Studies has pointed out that the earlier planned tax rise might actually lose the Treasury money .
This is all very contentious of course , but the basic idea of the Laffer Curve is obvious .
There 's a tax rate which raises the maximum revenue .
Too high and you 'll get less money as people change their behaviour , too low and you could get more .
That is uncontroversial amongst economists .
What exactly the rate is for a specific tax in a specific situation is the controversy .
The IFS did make a few slightly heroic assumptions to get to the conclusion that the mooted 45 p tax rate ( now increased to 50p ) on high earners would lose revenue , it 's true , but who do you believe in such circumstances ?
The politician whose lips are moving or the independents ?
Yes , quite .
So that £ 2bn predicted , which is a pittance in the larger scheme of things , might well not turn up at all .
Bit like the internet boom really , lose money on every transaction and then make it up in volume .
But the worst news is what was not done .
We need to have a thorough overhaul of the UK 's income tax system .
It 's not that many decades ago that you only started to pay income tax as your income approached the average .
Now you pay income tax if you 're working part time on the minimum wage ( no , really , 20 hours a week or so will get you into that tax net ) .
The mechanism that has been used to get us to this horrible state is " fiscal drag " .
In most years ( the current perhaps excepted ) and certainly over time , wages rise faster than inflation .
This is the end result of that useful thing which capitalism alone amongst economic systems manages : a general and sustained increase in the standard of living .
But successive Chancellors have raised the personal allowance in line with general inflation and not the higher rises in wages .
So ever more people on ever lower wages get to pay income tax , with the absurd result that for many we are now taking income tax away and then paying it back to the same people in the same week in benefits .
The Budget itself recognises this : there are some 2 million people who face marginal tax rates of over 60 per tax .
Hundreds of thousands face even higher rates than this with the combination of income tax and benefits being withdrawn as their working income rises .
Yes , just as we think that there are Laffer Curve effects on the rich , we also believe that exactly the same happens to the poor .
Yet in this monstrosity of a tax system we tax the working poor at higher marginal rates than we do the rich .
The solution to this is well known : to raise the personal allowance .
The Adam Smith Institute ( where I'm a Fellow ) has been shouting in the wilderness about this for years .
As a simple rule of thumb the personal allowance should be the same as working full time all year on the minimum wage .
Some £ 11,500 or so .
At the moment it 's around £ 6,400 .
The Joseph Rowntree Trust produced a survey on what it is to be poor in the UK .
It concluded that you needed a pre-tax income of £ 13,400 in order not to be poor .
That 's just about that £ 11,500 after tax .
Yes , we really do insist that those we define as poor pay income tax .
UKIP ( where I 'm also involved ) has had the same policy for some years .
Last week Oxfam urged the same and Nick Clegg of the Liberal Democrats unveiled his third tax policy of the past year and urged the allowance be raised to £ 10,000 .
As happens so often , good ideas start out way way out there , and then as people consider their merits they approach the mainstream .
Or at least , they can do .
And that 's what I think has been the biggest mistake of this budget .
Sure , bashing the rich for a few pennies here and there will always get cheers from Labour backbenchers , but we should really be concentrating our attention upon the poor .
And the best thing we can do for them is to stop bloody taxing them .
That 's my complaint : that Darling 's allowed a good crisis to go to waste . ®
Small , well - designed and low - cost homes are a key tool for building cities and dense communities where many people and families can live safely and comfortably while sharing resources efficiently .
With the green theme growing in popularity across every stretch of the world , more and more people are turning to cargo container homes for green alternatives for office , and even new home , construction .
There are countless numbers of empty , unused shipping containers around the world just sitting on the shipping docks and taking up space .
The reason for this is that it ’s too expensive for a country to ship empty containers back to the their origin in most cases , it ’s just cheaper to buy new containers from Asia .
The result is an extremely high surplus of empty shipping containers that are just waiting to become someone ’s home or office .
Here are 7 of our favourite shipping container homes , offices and hotels .
7 .
The first official 2 - story shipping container home in the US was designed by Southern California architect Peter DeMaria in 2006 .
The only big obstacle that he encountered during construction of his shipping container pad was making sure that the house passed all of the strict guidelines of the Uniform Building Code ( UBC ) .

A bach “ is the name given in New Zealand to structures akin to small , often very modest holiday homes or beach houses .
They are an iconic part of New Zealand history and culture . ”
Wp
Cecile Bonnifait and William Giesen of atelier workshop have built a bach out of a box , a 20 ′ shipping container .
This is n’t easy to do ; they are narrow inside .
They pulled it off by having one side of the container fold down to open it up to the outdoors ; suddenly it is bright and open .
( much like the All - terrain Cabin ) Every inch of it is used cleverly , even the container doors become support for a bed .
Port - a - Bach Shipping Container Holiday Home .
5 .
The world ’s first hotel built from recycled shipping containers has popped - up in Uxbridge , West London .
Each prefabricated container comes fully - equipped with fixtures , furniture , and windows from a factory in China .
The company , called Travelodge , says that constructing a hotel this way is 25 % faster and 10 % cheaper than the more traditional construction methods .
Also , construction is much quicker , because all that has to be done is to fit each container together like it was a giant Lego set .
Rooms at this London hotel start at about $ 30 per night .
The London area may see more these ‘ portable hotels ’ pop-up around the city as the 2012 Olympics approaches .

Completed in 2003 , this East London youth center took only 1 day to construct the exterior !
The structure is composed entirely of 7 used storage containers .
The result was a cost - effective solution to traditional construction .
Mile End Youth Centre has been considered the future of inexpensive construction for buildings such as this one .
3 .
Check out this retro-looking prefabricated house located in the Austrian countryside .
This inexpensive home was created by Espace Mobile who sell prefab homes like this one for between 55,000 and 95,000 Euros .
Each one of these homes comes with a 3 - year warranty , and each section of the house is 4 meters wide by 1 - 15 meters long .
Each section can be pieced together to the customer ’s liking .
This place offers spectacular views of the countryside through its floor - to - ceiling windows .
2 .
The awesome Riverside Building in London is a masterpiece of storage container recycling .
This large office building is constructed out of a total of 73 used storage containers .
It took only 8 days to piece together each container into a total of 22 office space units .
Construction of this building was completed in 2005 , and the result was a cost - effective office space and awesome views of the Thames River .
1 .
This stunning home is almost like a piece of art that you can live in .
Constructed using 12 recycled shipping containers , the 12 container home home has all of the modern conveniences of a traditionally built home but with a unique element of style as well .
A modern kitchen , huge wide - open floor plan , and gigantic windows that bring in tons of natural lighting are just a few of the great features of this home , plus construction costs were relatively inexpensive when compared to traditional construction .

LAW EVERYWHERE
Something ’s amiss when a girl in kindergarten , all of 40 pounds , is led away in handcuffs by police .
That ’s what happened in the spring of 2005 in St. Petersburg , Florida .
Equally strange , the whole episode was taped and shown on national television .
There ’s the little girl , hair neatly braided , going from desk to desk , throwing books and pencils on the floor , tearing papers off the bulletin board , and methodically destroying her classroom .
The assistant principal circles her , arms outstretched as if in a linebacker drill , but assiduously avoiding contact .
( Why not just hold on to her ?
You wonder , watching …
Is the child a hemophiliac ? )
The little girl is eventually steered into the principal ’s office , where she continues to wreak havoc on the orderly piles of paper and announcements tacked to the wall .
Eventually the police arrive and handcuff the five - year - old .
She screams .
The tape ends .
All this law has provided ample fodder for late - night comedians , who regale us with the latest legal idiocy .
No one could make up stories like the first - grade boy in North Carolina suspended for sexual harassment when he kissed a first - grade girl .
For as long as there have been schools , teachers have had to deal with unreasonable five - year - olds .
Calling the cops is n’t the time - tested solution .
Let ’s rewind the tape and handle this sensibly .
Problem : temper tantrum in kindergarten classroom .
Solution : Ask the girl to stop .
When she refuses , hold her by the arm , preventing more destruction .
If necessary , take her to another room until she calms down .
Doing what ’s right here is n’t rocket science .
But teachers in America ca n’t do this .
Taking hold of a child ’s arm is verboten — touching is taboo , except to prevent harm to others .
So a five - year - old ends up in handcuffs .
The rule against touching a student is now pretty much universal in America .
One of my daughter ’s college roommates , teaching beginning swimmers in East Harlem , was strictly forbidden to hold her students up in the water ( to prevent drowning ) until she had asked and received explicit permission from each child .
She had to ask not once , but each and every time she did it .
“ May I put my hand on your stomach ? ” over and over again .
The youngsters realized this made no sense .
“ Why do you keep asking me if you can put your hand on my stomach ? ”
But she had been instructed never to make contact without asking the question .
Physical contact is one of those subjects thats a little touchy .
We can all agree that anyone who has a tendency to act inappropriately around children should be shown the door , or put in the slammer .
There are some people , as we learned with the Catholic priest scandal , who have this problem .
But a blanket rule against physical contact is itself weird , almost as disturbing as contact that ’s a little too friendly .
Young children need physical reassurance .
Sometimes older children need physical restraint , or least the fear of physical restraint .
Otherwise some students will flout the teacher ’s powerlessness .
OK , let ’s change the rule about physical contact .
That ’s our instinct whenever we hear stories like this .
But what would the rule say ?
“ Appropriate conduct is acceptable ” ?
That should be implicit in a free society .
Nor do we need a rule to say that physical abuse of students is forbidden .
We know that already as well .
The problem is in implementation :
How does law sort out what ’s appropriate in this or that situation ?
The rule against physical contact is n’t really there to protect children .
The ban on touching is meant to protect teachers and schools .
You bet there ’s a rule against any touching — doing that could get you sued .
Teachers have had their lives ruined by grabbing hold of a misbehaving child .
Josh Kaplowitz , a young college grad in the Teach for America corps , put his hand on the back of a misbehaving seventh grader to make him leave the classroom and was sued for $ 20 million .
The parents even got him criminally indicted .
After two years of hell , the criminal case was finally dropped .
The lawsuit was settled with the school paying $ 90,000 .
Other teachers have had their careers ruined by an accusation not of any sexual misconduct but just of holding on to the child , or , in one case of a music teacher , of positioning a child ’s fingers on a flute .
No organization can function effectively unless people can make choices and someone else has responsibility to hold those people accountable .
The teacher must be free to do what makes sense , including restraining disruptive students and putting an arm around a crying child .
And the principal must be free to make judgments — for example , about the credibility of the student , or about whether he has a queasy feeling about the teacher .
Today the principal lacks that authority , and looks to grab hold of a legal lifeline .
But how can he prove that the conduct was appropriate , or that the teacher is creepy ?
So the rule , by default , is zero contact .
******
We must draw legal boundaries here .
The only way to normalize adult - child relations is to remove law from incidental relations :
No claim should be allowed without credible allegations of overt sexual misconduct .
For conduct short of that , people must have the freedom to deal with people as they think best — for example , by the principal ’s reassigning or firing the teacher about whom he has qualms .
Straining daily choices through a legal sieve basically kills the human instinct needed to get things done .
Law applied to ordinary decisions leads to bad choices , which leads to more law , which leads to worse choices .
Pretty soon law is everywhere , separating people from their instincts of right and wrong .
****
Rules can’t make decisions , to paraphrase the philosopher Joseph Raz , any more than a book on chess can tell you how to win .
But that ’s the core assumption of modern law .
In an effort to avoid human error , we have created legal structures based on an unspoken premise that correctness can be proved or programmed in advance .
Two great intellectual currents came together over the past century to bring America to this state of hyper - legalism .
The first , which grew naturally out of the Industrial Revolution , is the idea of organizing how to do things .
Frederick Winslow Taylor , the father of scientific management , preached the idea of creating systems in order to increase productivity .
Organization is undeniably essential for complex products ; Henry Ford ’s assembly lines proved that .
Regulatory organization is also necessary to rein in the abuses of big business .
Today we assume unquestioningly that any activity will be more effective if we detail in advance how to get the job done .
That ’s how we ’ve organized schools .
Instead of an assembly line of machines , schools are organized by a kind of assembly line of rules .
Do this and then do that , and then fill out forms that say you did what the rules required .
The second social current , which burst out of the 1960s in an explosion that still reverberates 40 years later , is based on a new idea of individual rights :
Let any individual who feels aggrieved bring a legal claim for almost anything .
Fairness , the thinking went , would be guaranteed by letting people assert their own rights .
The abuses of discrimination were long overdue for a remedy and required a dramatic shift in law .
But looking at disputes as a matter of individual rights had implications far beyond patterns of discrimination .
These modern rights gave undefined powers to individuals to assert claims over other free individuals .
Unlike constitutional rights , which shield citizens from state power , these new rights gave citizens a sword against other free citizens .
To legal thinkers in the 1960s , however , legal self - help seemed like the perfect solution to the conflicts of a diverse society .
Let each defendant demonstrate why his actions were appropriate .
Why did n’t we think of this before ?
These two great currents of social organization — prescribing rules to specify how to do things and affording individual rights to invoke a legal proceeding — now sweep us along through our day like a mighty river , causing us to cling to legal logic for ordinary daily choices .
To stay afloat , we must constantly be prepared to answer this question :
Can you show this was done properly ?
Where the rallying cry for our revolutionary forebears was “ No Taxation Without Representation , ” today ’s cry is “ No Decision Without Justification . ”
****
All this law has provided ample fodder for late - night comedians , who regale us with the latest legal idiocy .
No one could make up stories like the first - grade boy in North Carolina suspended for sexual harassment when he kissed a first - grade girl .
Emails fly around the country with stories of crazy lawsuits , many of which never happened but are nonetheless believable in a legal system disconnected from accepted norms of right and wrong .
People behave in genuinely bizarre ways .
The warning labels that manufacturers plaster all over products are priceless .
There ’s a “ wacky warning contest ” every year that gives prizes to the stupidest labels — for a letter opener , “ Caution : Safety Goggles Recommended . ”
My favorite is the fourth - place winner in 2003 — a five - inch fishing lure , with three - pronged hook , with the following legend on its side : “ Harmful if swallowed . ”
The totality of stupid rules and lawsuits does not come close , however , to describing the effects of the modern legal order .
It has changed our society .
In this new legalistic culture , people no longer look inside themselves to do what ’s right .
Instead they focus on possible legal implications .
What if something happens ?
How will you justify your decision ?
Defensiveness has swept over the culture like a giant wave , drenching daily choices in cold water .
Doctors routinely order tests and procedures that they do n’t believe are needed — squandering so many billions of dollars , according to some estimates , that the waste could provide health insurance to the 47 million Americans who are uninsured .
Hardly any disagreement in the workplace is far from the threat of a possible discrimination claim .
Teachers and principals spend their days filling out forms and “ making the record clear , ” just to show they ’ve been attentive to legal concerns .
Authority has been turned upside down .
A 2004 survey by Public Agenda found that 78 percent of middle - and high - school teachers in America have been threatened with lawsuits or accused of violations of rights by their students .

All these rules and rights , we ’re told , are just the price of living in a crowded society , necessary to ensure fairness and to make the institutions of society work properly .
Maybe things were simpler for our pioneer forefathers , but modern society is diverse , with many different values .
Detailed legal codes and processes are needed to keep society in working order .
But the institutions of modern society are not in working order .
Schools have been in a steady decline for decades .
Reforms are passed almost every year , with little or no effect .
Health care is like a nervous breakdown in slow motion .
***
We have it backward .
The legal shackles that frustrate teachers , doctors , and managers in daily dealings are not the inevitable price of a working social order .
Modern law is a main cause of the decline of our social order .
Schools and hospitals are failing in part because the people within them no longer feel free to make decisions to make them work .
America indeed is in a crisis — a crisis of individual freedom .
We have lost the idea , at every level of public life , that people can grab hold of a problem and fix it .
We have become a culture of rule followers , driven to frame every solution in terms of existing law or possible legal risk .
Gradually , without noticing when it happened , we ’ve lost our ability to make the choices needed to run a society .

Since netbook displays are small , desktop space should not be wasted .
I have here some tips that I hope you will find useful on how you can optimize GNOME for your netbook ’s diminutive desktop area .
GNOME is highly customizable and can be tweaked to suit every user ’s needs .
That ’s why I think its versatility makes it a perfect desktop environment for Linux netbooks
Since netbook displays are small , desktop space should not be wasted .
I have here some tips that I hope you will find useful on how you can optimize GNOME for your netbook ’s diminutive desktop area .
Customize Panel
* Use one panel only
GNOME comes with two panels by default .
For netbook displays , it is best to use a single - panel layout to save some desktop space .
GNOME desktop with single panel
* Shrink the panel size
There are two easy ways to make the panel thinner .
One is to adjust the panel size ; the other is to install and use a minimalist theme .
* Change “ Window Selector ” to “ Window List ”
Window Selector can fill the panel area when you open plenty of applications together .
With Window List , you do n’t have to worry about this as opened windows are displayed as vertical drop - down list .
Window Selector
Window List
* Autohide panel
Autohiding panel is optional as some people find it convenient to have the panel objects like the main menu , notifications , and icons present at all times .
Optimize Fonts
To make fonts look a lot clearer on a netbook ’s small display , I recommend you set the fonts preferences to this :
Experiment with Themes
There are plenty of available space - saving themes
* Use a GTK theme with slim window borders
There are plenty of available space - saving themes HERE and HERE .
I usually use ThinMC , Bentham , and Simplebox so look for them .
However , there are still plenty of themes that I have n’t explored yet so do n’t be afraid to try some .
Since you can change the theme of Firefox , Thunderbird , and other desktop applications , it is best to utilize space - saving themes .
Like for example , I use the
So there you have it .
If you have better ways to optimize a desktop for netbook display , you can always ignore my tips .
However , please share with us how you did it via comment so that we too can learn from you .
* Utilize tiny themes for different applicationsSince you can change the theme of Firefox , Thunderbird , and other desktop applications , it is best to utilize space - saving themes .
Like for example , I use the Littlefox theme on Firefox .

Susan Boyle ’s Britain ’s Got Talent video is on track to become the most popular video in the history of YouTube , amassing nearly 100
million views in its first nine days and earning the producers of the program a serendipitous , potential windfall that should already be in the millions .
Update , 6:58 pm EST : Hours later , a Google spokeswoman responded to our e-mail and phone queries with some surprising news :
" That video is not being monetized . "
We ’ve contacted Sony ( Simon Cowell ’s label ) and FremantleMedia ( the show ’s producer , owned by RTL Group not Sony as appeared in this update earlier ) and now ITV to try to determine why the $ 500,000 or more Boyle ’s video should have generated so far is apparently being left on the table — despite the fact that both companies are confirmed revenue - sharing partners of YouTube .
Update , 5:55 pm EST , 4/21 : A Fremantle spokesman said via e-mail , " No comment is our official position . "
4/23 : Waiting to hear back from ITV , which apparently could not come to an agreement with YouTube over how to share ad revenue .
The YouTube clip got massive play on U.S. cable television and made the 48 - year - old Boyle — whose performance was a mere first - round audition , after all — into an international star whose career in an instant seems assured , no matter what the outcome of the British talent show she is the odds - on favorite to win .
As a contestant , Boyle would likely not have a piece of the action — yet .
And it is n’t clear what deal Cowell , a judge and producer of the show , and his label , Sony have with YouTube as part of their revenue - sharing deal .
If it were half a cent per play — a typical figure for such deals — that would translate into a $ 500,000 payday so far .
And if Google sold a decent amount of video overlays on the video ( earning an estimated $ 20 per thousand views ) , Cowell and company would be owed millions more in revenue sharing .
[ Again , Google says it somehow did n’t sell a single ad against these 100 million or so views ; see update above . ]
The tsunami of interest in a single YouTube clip could not have come at a better time for YouTube , which is aggressively trying to shed its reputation as a repository for mindless clips uploaded by self - absorbed users .
It appears to be a platform where Hollywood and advertisers can do serious business , without alienating the millions of people who have made it what it is today .
This might be the perfect storm :
A feel - good story that generates a wild amount of traffic and attracts new users precisely as the company doubles down on its reputation as a music destination as well as a nascent TV and studio film portal .
All of this happened in under a week and a half .
By comparison , Avril Lavigne ’s " Girlfriend " — YouTube ’s current reigning champion — took more than two years to accumulate its tally of 118 million views ( and required some gaming of the system by her fans to do so ) .
Boyle ’s rendition of " I Dreamed a Dream " from Les Misérables currently has 70 million views on YouTube ’s first search - result page alone , and multiple estimates have pegged the total number of views at around 100 million and still climbing steeply over the weekend .
If YouTube ’s audio fingerprinting technology works as advertised ,
Cowell and company should be paid when people watch the user - uploaded videos , in addition to the official version .
Avril ’s manager suggested last summer that she would earn $ 2 million from her YouTube video views , as part of the labels ’ revenue - sharing program ( which almost certainly offers more favorable terms than those offered by the standard YouTube Partners program ) .
But despite breakaway successes like Lavigne ’s and Boyle ’s , some licensing deals between music copyright holders and Google have broken down over revenue - sharing disagreements — an indication that the labels see YouTube as an important source of revenue .
As a result , Warner ’s pulled its videos , and all official music videos on YouTube are blocked in Germany and the United Kingdom .
Assuming Boyle continues her run without succumbing to a fan backlash , she ’ll win the Britain ’s Got Talent
competition ’s $ 200 K first prize and a possible a recording contract with Cowell .
Will she see a piece of this YouTube action ?
If her lawyer has any sense , he or she will insist that
Boyle receive a share of YouTube revenue going forward .

A Purdue University researcher has found a way to eliminate bacteria in packaged foods such as spinach and tomatoes , a process that could eliminate worries concerning some food - borne illnesses .
Kevin Keener designed a device consisting of a set of high - voltage coils attached to a small transformer that generates a room - temperature plasma field inside a package , ionizing the gases inside .
The process kills harmful bacteria such as E. coli and salmonella , which have caused major public health concerns .
Keener 's process is outlined in an article released online early in LWT - Food Science and Technology , a journal for the Swiss Society of Food and Technology and the International Union of Food Science and Technology .
" Conceptually , we can put any kind of packaged food we want in there , " said Keener , an associate professor in the Department of Food Science .
" So far , it has worked on spinach and tomatoes , but it could work on any type of produce or other food . "
By placing two high - voltage , low - watt coils on the outside of a sealed food package , a plasma field is formed .
In the plasma field , which is a charged cloud of gas , oxygen has been ionized and turned into ozone .
Treatment times range from 30 seconds to about five minutes , Keener said .
Ozone kills bacteria such as E. coli and salmonella .
The longer the gas in the package remains ionized , the more bacteria that are killed .
Eventually , the ionized gas will revert back to its original composition .
advertisement
The process uses only 30 - 40 watts of electricity , less than most incandescent light bulbs .
The outside of the container only increases a few degrees in temperature , so its contents are not cooked or otherwise altered .
Other methods of ozone treatment require adding devices to bags before sealing them to create ozone or pumping ozone into a bag and then sealing it .
Keener 's method creates the ozone in the already sealed package , eliminating any opportunity for contaminants to enter while ozone is created .
" It 's kind of like charging a battery .
We 're charging that sample , " Keener said .
" We 're doing it without electrode intrusion .
We 're not sticking a probe in the package .
We can do this in a sealed package . "
Keener said testing has worked with glass containers , flexible plastic - like food - storage bags and rigid plastics , such as strawberry cartons and pill bottles .
He said the technology also could work to ensure pharmaceuticals are free from bacteria .
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , about 40,000 cases of Salmonellosis , an infection caused by salmonella , are reported each year in the United States , causing 400 deaths .
The CDC reports that about 70,000 E. coli infections are reported each year , causing dozens of deaths .
Funding for Keener 's research came from Purdue Agriculture .
A patent on the technology is pending .
Keener said the next step is to develop a commercial prototype of the device that could work on large quantities of food .
This story is , literally , stone age meets digital age : University of Washington researchers are combining the ancient art of ceramics and the new technology of 3 - D printing .
Along the way , they are making 3 - D printing dramatically cheaper .
About five years ago , Mark Ganter , a UW mechanical engineering professor and longtime practitioner of 3 - D printing , became frustrated with the high cost of commercial materials and began experimenting with his own formulas .
He and his students gradually developed a home - brew approach , replacing a proprietary mix with artists ' ceramic powder blended with sugar and maltodextrin , a nutritional supplement .
The results are printed in a recent issue of Ceramics Monthly .
Co-authors are Duane Storti , UW associate professor of mechanical engineering , and Ben Utela , a former UW doctoral student .
" Normally these supplies cost $ 30 to $ 50 a pound .
Our materials cost less than a dollar a pound , " said Ganter .
He said he wants to distribute the free recipes in order to democratize 3 - D printing and expand the range of printable objects .
Glitzy three - dimensional printers have become common in the industrial world , churning out fast 3 - D prototypes of everything from airplane parts to running shoes .
But the machines also are becoming popular among artists , hobbyists and educational institutions .
For the past 15 years Ganter has taught an engineering course introducing students to rapid prototyping that draws students from engineering , art and architecture .
" When powders are $ 30 a pound , I can't let students try something new or experimental , " Ganter said .
" But when it 's $ 1 a pound , I do n't care .
I encourage them to try new things . "
The lab can go through $ 4,000 of materials per quarter , he said .
In the 15 years of the lab 's operation , bills for materials dwarf the roughly $ 20,000 initial costs for a printer .
advertisement
Lab fees were already at the maximum , Ganter said , so instead the group went looking for a different approach – cheaper materials .
" If we 're in trouble financially , imagine what 's it like at a high school or a technical school ? "
Three - dimensional printers are based on inkjet technology and look like photocopying machines that spit out solid objects .
The inkjets are filled with an adhesive , or binder , that prints onto thin layers of powder .
Any surface with binder will be included in the finished object .
Users generally create their designs on a computer and send the completed design file to the printer .
The object gets built up layer by layer , each about the thickness of a piece of paper , over 10 to 60 minutes .
Users then dust or blow away the excess powder to reveal the prototype .
The UW group has initially published results and formulas using three different types of ceramic powders , which are sold at local pottery or clay stores by the 50 - pound bag .
Most other supplies are purchased at local restaurant supply stores .
" Clay is dirt cheap , " commented Ganter .
advertisement
Using anything but company product may violate the printers ' warranties .
" We can fix our own printers , so we 're not worried , " Ganter said .
" And most of our materials are so close to what 's being used that the risk of damaging the machine is small .
In the worst - case scenario , if we can't fix the machine ourselves , we would have to pay for a repair . "
Ganter describes his lab , strewn with fanciful objects , as a toy shop .
The UW's Solheim Rapid Manufacturing Laboratory houses two do - it - yourself kits ( Fab@Home systems ) assembled by undergraduate students , a homemade 3 - D printer designed by a team of students , and several state - of - the - art commercial machines used in teaching and research .
The low - cost ceramics experiment began about four years ago when the group had a National Science Foundation grant to print custom dental implants .
Utela began experimenting with different materials and processes , and eventually published papers describing how to figure out if one could 3 - D print in a given material , and suggesting many of the required parameters .
The ceramic printing follows from Utela 's work .
Three - dimensional printing was already possible for engineering - grade ceramics that have high firing temperatures .
This is one of the first 3 - D printers to use artist - grade ceramics , which fire at lower temperatures .
Creating the actual formulas was a process of experimentation and sometimes trial and error .
Graduate student Ian Blanch spent six months perfecting the procedures and formula for a single powder - and - binder combination , Ganter said .
Much progress has been made since then , and the team continues to experiment with new materials , including rice flour .
Now that the ceramics formulas are working , it should make the technology more accessible to anyone who are used to working with traditional art ceramics , he said .
" I 'm printing in the exact materials they use .
So they can even use all the same glazes and glazing techniques , " Ganter said .
Artists and museum curators are already investigating possible collaborations , he said .

LINC is a typical touch screen smart phone with all the connectivity and features you come to expect .
Its got a cell phone , a media player , a web browser , GPS , downloadable content , Bluetooth , wifi , the latest 3G network .
But here ’s the catch .
LINC is leased to the user as a service , not a product .
The user holds on to the device for about a year , and when the next generation of hardware comes along , the user receives a new LINC in the mail .
The LINCs inform the user of their hardware upgrade , wirelessly transfer the digital account , and before being shipped back to the manufacturer , LINC informs the user of the next part of its journey .
LINC is to be shipped back to a regional manufacturing facility .
The device contains valuable materials like aluminum , glass , and electronic components that the producer can harvest for re-use .
Typically , mobile phones contain hazardous waste that goes into a landfill or are left in a desk drawer to sit in .
LINC is designed for automated disassembly .
A directed radiant heat beam targets its internal memory metal latch , releasing the assembly .
In one step , LINC automatically disassembles into its few simple components , glass , aluminum and its circuit flex .
The glass and aluminum , not containing any paints or adhesives , are easily recycled to pure grade materials for immediate reuse .
The remaining flexible circuit contains all the electronics necessary for the entire device .
It ’s full of hazardous materials , but it has been safely recovered for proper disposal .
Many of the chip sets can easily be pulled for reuse .
Components like the graphics card are out dated for LINC , but can be used in devices like portable gaming systems .

The hits just keep on coming from Department of Energy ’s Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory .
So far this month , the lab has announced the discovery of a rare single top quark , and then narrowed the gap — twice , actually — for the mass of the elusive Higgs Boson particle , or “ God particle , ” thought to give all other particles their mass .
Now , scientists have detected a new , completely untheorized particle that challenges what physicists thought they knew about how quarks combine to form matter .
They ’re calling it Y( 4140 ) , reflecting its measured mass of 4140 Mega - electron volts .
“ It must be trying to tell us something , ” said Jacobo Konigsberg of the University of Florida , a spokesman for Fermilab ’s collider detector team .
“ So far , we ’re not sure what that is , but rest assured we ’ll keep on listening . ”
Matter as we know it comprises building blocks called quarks .
Quarks fit together in various well - established ways to build other particles : mesons , made of a quark - antiquark pair , and baryons , made of three quarks .
But recently , electron - positron colliders at Stanford ’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and the Japanese laboratory KEK have revealed examples of composite quark structures — named X and Y particles — that are not the usual mesons and baryons .
And now , the Collider Detector at Fermilab ( CDF ) collaboration has found evidence for the Y( 4140 ) particle .
The Y( 4140 ) particle decays into a pair of other particles , the J / psi and the phi , suggesting to physicists that it might be a composition of charm and anticharm quarks .
However , the characteristics of this decay do not fit the conventional expectations for such a make - up .
Other possible interpretations beyond a simple quark - antiquark structure are hybrid particles that also contain gluons , or even four - quark combinations .
The Fermilab scientists observed Y( 4140 ) particles in the decay of a much more commonly produced particle containing a bottom quark , called the B+ meson .
Sifting through trillions of proton - antiproton collisions from Fermilab ’s Tevatron , they identified a small sampling of B+ mesons that decayed in an unexpected pattern .
Further analysis showed that the B+ mesons were decaying into Y( 4140 ) .
The Y( 4140 ) particle is the newest member of a family of particles of similar unusual characteristics observed in the last several years by experimenters at Fermilab ’s Tevatron as well as at KEK and the SLAC lab , which operates at Stanford through a partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy .
“ We congratulate CDF on the first evidence for a new unexpected Y state that decays to J/ psi and phi , ” said Japanese physicist Masanori Yamauchi , a KEK spokesperson .
“ This state may be related to the Y( 3940 ) state discovered by Belle and might be another example of an exotic hadron containing charm quarks .
We will try to confirm this state in our own Belle data . ”
Theoretical physicists are trying to decode the true nature of these exotic combinations of quarks that fall outside our current understanding of mesons and baryons .
Meanwhile , experimentalists happily continue to search for more such particles .
“ We ’re building upon our knowledge piece by piece , ” said Fermilab spokesperson Rob Roser , “ and with enough pieces , we ’ll understand how this puzzle fits together . ”
The Y( 4140 ) observation is the subject of an article submitted by CDF to Physical Review Letters this week .
Besides announcing Y( 4140 ) , the CDF experiment collaboration is presenting more than 40 new results at the Moriond Conference on Quantum Chromodynamics in Europe this week , including the discovery of electroweak top - quark production and a new limit on the Higgs boson , in concert with experimenters from Fermilab ’s DZero collaboration .

In an interview with POLITICO , the Utah governor says his party needs to change - bigtime .
Huntsman takes aim at GOP
There was at least one 2012 presidential contender missing from the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington this weekend , traditionally a testing ground for any Republican even remotely considering a White House bid .
That could be in part because Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. risked getting booed off the stage for some of his views .
Advertisement
Largely under the radar of the national media and even out of sight of many in his own party , Huntsman , 48 , is emerging as an articulate , unapologetic and unlikely spokesman for a new brand of Republicanism , one that seems out of vogue at a time when many in the GOP attribute their fall from power to a deviation from right - wing orthodoxy .
Huntsman thinks the party 's challenge is more profound , owing less to its excessive spending practices during the Bush era than to sweeping demographic and political changes that threaten to consign
Republicans to a long - term minority status and confine their appeal to narrow sections of the country .
The party needs to be more intellectually rigorous , and to compete for the votes of the young , the elites and minorities , he said in an interview with POLITICO .
To do so , the GOP needs to tack toward the middle on environment , gay rights and immigration .
And , yes , Ronald Reagan is to be admired – but as much for his oft - overlooked pragmatism as for his conservative principles .
It ’s a view that places him out of step with the prevailing conservative sentiment among most members of the GOP base , but it ’s also one that makes Huntsman , a wealthy Mormon scion , the first 2012 Republican primary prospect to unabashedly embrace a middle ground somewhere between moderate Northeastern Republicanism and Sun Belt conservatism .
“ We need to pull up the stakes of the tent and draw them out a little bit , ” he told POLITICO , while in town for the National Governors Associaton meeting .
Huntsman ’s model comes not from the Reagan and Gingrich revolutions , but instead resembles a Republican brand of Clintonism : practical solutions , softened rhetorical edges aimed to appeal to the center and an overall modernization of a party badly in need of a new image .
“ I would liken it a bit to the transformation of the Tory Party in the U.K. , ” Huntsman explained .
“ The defeat in ’ 97 , John Major to Tony Blair , after years of strong , conservative rule with Margaret Thatcher setting the mark .
They went two or three election cycles without recognizing the issues that the younger citizens in the U.K. really felt strongly about .
They were a very narrow party of angry people .
And they started branching out through , maybe , taking a second look at the issues of the day , much like we ’re going to have to do for the Republican Party , to reconnect with the youth , to reconnect with people of color , to reconnect with different geographies that we have lost .
You cannot succeed being a party of the South and a couple of Western states .
It just – it is n’t long - term sustainable . ”
Implied but unsaid was that one of the leaders of that effort to reform the Tory party was David Cameron , the youthful opposition leader who is now poised to become Prime Minister when the next national election is called in Great Britain .
That Huntsman has a similar aspiration also goes unmentioned – he only jokes that he ’ll start showing up in Iowa and New Hampshire if they have good motocross races on which he can ride his beloved dirtbike – but is also plain to see .
By the standards of David Brooks ’s Traditionalist vs. Reformer dichotomy , Huntsman falls squarely in the second category – perhaps the only potential 2012 candidate to unambiguously do so .
He has little use for the congressional wing of his party and believes their arguments often fall on deaf ears beyond Washington .
“ We will be irrelevant as a party until we become the party of solutions and until we become the party of preeminence , ” he said .
“ It ’s easy to fall back on gratuitous rhetoric and that ’s kind of what this town is all about . ”
To become viable again to the 40 - and - under bloc that went overwhelmingly for President Obama and will comprise the future voting majority in the country , Huntsman argued the GOP must shift on two issues as generational as they are political : gay rights and the environment .
The two issues “ carry more of a generational component than anything else , ” he said .
Huntsman , the father of seven , points to his own children , all of whom were born after Reagan ’s second term began , to underscore the shift .
“ Just sit around your dinner table with your kids , as I do , my teenagers and college kids , and you ’ll get a sense of the world for what it is and what it is becoming , ” he said .
“ And it ’s a whole lot different than the dinner conversations I used to have with my parents , that grew up during the ’ 50s . ”
After running for governor in 2004 as a supporter of a ballot measure that year that not only banned gay marriage but also civil unions , Huntsman made national news earlier this month by saying that he had changed his mind on civil unions .
Reminded that many in his state disagree with his view – one Salt Lake Tribune poll pegged it at 70 % -- Huntsman fired back without hesitation .
“ Many agree , and I think the Republican Party will ultimately have to take a lot of competing ideas and blend them into some sort of governing philosophy , ” he stated .
“ That , above all , begins to broaden the base of the party . ”
On the environment , Huntsman was just as outspoken and tied the issue to broader problems his party is encountering with educated voters .
“ We cannot become the anti-science party and succeed , ” he said .
“ We have to be intellectually honest as a party , and I think we ’ve drifted a little bit from intellectual honesty in the tradition of Theodore Roosevelt , for example , where they would use rigorous science to back up many of their policies , and in this case many of their environmental policies .
Richard Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency ... .
A lot of intellectual rigor went into the policies of those days , and we ’ve drifted a little bit from taking seriously the importance of science to buttress much of what we ’re doing today , whether it ’s basic research and development [ or ] whether it ’s looking at climate science . ”
Without acknowledging and addressing issues like climate change , Huntsman said the party stands to lose not only the youth vote but also the constituencies that once formed core GOP ’s strongholds -- what he called “ the old suburbias . ”
These are the counties -- highly educated , socially moderate and affluent -- that began favoring Democrats as cultural conservatism came to dominate GOP thinking , often trumping the tax issues on which Republicans had typically won over such voters .
Obama won them overwhemingly last fall , cementing the trend .
Two decades ago , those places were reliably Republican -- and enamored of Ronald Reagan - style conservatism .
Huntsman recalled a different Reagan than some of the party ’s true believers .
“ I think he has been , in some cases , misinterpreted , ” said Huntsman , who was a junior White House staffer in his administration .
“ Reagan was a person of solid beliefs , but he was also someone with – with a solid dose of pragmatism . ”
Huntsman , a fluent Mandarin Chinese speaker who was once Ambassador to Singapore , cited Reagan ’s shift to a more moderate stance on China but also hinted at areas where the conservatives of today may find fault with their sainted Gipper .
“ He was n’t afraid to negotiate with the evildoers in the world , ” said Huntsman , using a word associated with another president who was emphatically opposed to engaging America ’s enemies .
“ You know , in some cases we shy away from confrontation , meeting people on the world stage .
He sat down with Gorbachev . ”
On immigration , Huntsman used what amounts to the Scarlet A for many modern - day conservatives .
“ He ’s also the man , in 1987 , who decided that the policy of amnesty would be one way of properly addressing our immigration policy , ” Huntsman recalled .
“ Everyone sort of bowed and accepted that .
Today , we do n’t . ”
Huntsman himself signed a hard - line immigration bill last year but is now saying that he does n’t think it should take effect this year .
So just how , exactly , is a moderate on such core cultural issues as gays , the environment and immigration supposed to be competitive in a conservative - dominated GOP primary ?
Though he may appeal to centrist elites , that does n’t exactly mean much in Sioux City .
Huntsman said he does n't expect to be a lonely voice encouraging the party toward the center .
“ It will be a whole lot of people who will probably want to expand the horizons so that we include more people into our party , ” he said , again citing the Tory model .
“ There ’s no other way to get it done . ”
Compounding his challenge , though , is Huntsman ’s religion – he hails from a rich and powerful Latter Day Saints family with deep roots in Utah .
As Mitt Romney showed in 2008 , a Mormon background can be a hindrance in running in evangelical - dominated early primary states such as Iowa and South Carolina .
On this , Huntsman said Romney , who himself may well run again in 2012 , had made it easier for future Mormon candidates .
“ Every election cycle will bring new dynamics , people who have never before been in the race , whether it is ethnicity or whether it ’s culture or whether it ’s religion , ” he said .
“ And in every attempt , you chip away a little bit more at those stereotypes , at those misunderstandings and it paves the way for , you know , the three or four or five behind , who ultimately will make it happen . ”

Dr. Paul in 1976 : “ An evil political maneuver … blatant advertising efforts to panic people into
taking swine flu shots ”
Robert Allison
Prison Planet.com
Monday , April 27 , 2009
In the book Swine Flu Expose , a book by Eleanora I. McBean , Ph.D. , N.D. , from 1976 , Dr. Ron Paul calls the Swine Flu Vaccination Program ( which was a deadly failure ) , “ a shocking misuse of funds … and an evil political maneuver ” .
Dr. Paul continues “ blatant advertising efforts to panic the people into taking Swine Flu shots will fail . ”
( Excerpt of ‘ Swine Flu Expose ’ )
A FEW CONGRESSMEN BLAST THE SWINE FLU HOAX
Not all of our Congressmen are hopeless .
Some are actually on our side .
Congressman Ron Paul of Texas is also a doctor and is able to see both sides of the swine flu question .
Most doctors have tunnel vision and see only one side — the side with the dollar mark .
Congressman Paul , in an interview with the Enquirer ( Dec. 21 , 76 ) said : “ I am outraged by this program .
It has been a shocking misuse of funds … and an evil political maneuver .
There are people whose careers are in question because of this program .
And I predict these blatant advertising efforts to panic the people into taking swine flu shots will fail .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ I think Congress has wasted more than one hundred million dollars .
The swine flu program should be brought back to Congress and discontinued at once .
The program should be stopped , and those who were responsible should be held morally accountable to the American public . ”
Congressman Larry McDonald of Georgia , also a medical doctor , said : “ I think the swine flu program is a tailor - made hoax that finds its roots in frightening the American people . . .
I believe that a full investigation of those in charge should be launched . . . and if it turns out to be a dishonest promotion , everyone responsible should be removed from their jobs . ”
It ’s heartening to find that all our Congressmen are not corrupt .
But where were they , the good ones , when the vote was being taken to endorse and finance this mass poisoning program ?

Comment on this article
Twenty years ago , a political philosopher named James Flynn uncovered a curious fact .
Americans — at least , as measured by I.Q. tests — were getting smarter .
This fact had been obscured for years , because the people who give I.Q. tests continually recalibrate the scoring system to keep the average at 100 .
But if you took out the recalibration , Flynn found , I.Q. scores showed a steady upward trajectory , rising by about three points per decade , which means that a person whose I.Q. placed him in the top ten per cent of the American population in 1920 would today fall in the bottom third .
Some of that effect , no doubt , is a simple by - product of economic progress : in the surge of prosperity during the middle part of the last century , people in the West became better fed , better educated , and more familiar with things like I.Q. tests .
But , even as that wave of change has subsided , test scores have continued to rise — not just in America but all over the developed world .
What ’s more , the increases have not been confined to children who go to enriched day - care centers and private schools .
The middle part of the curve — the people who have supposedly been suffering from a deteriorating public - school system and a steady diet of lowest - common - denominator television and mindless pop music — has increased just as much .
What on earth is happening ?
In the wonderfully entertaining “ Everything Bad Is Good for You ” ( Riverhead ; $ 23.95 ) , Steven Johnson proposes that what is making us smarter is precisely what we thought was making us dumber : popular culture .
Johnson is the former editor of the online magazine Feed and the author of a number of books on science and technology .
There is a pleasing eclecticism to his thinking .
He is as happy analyzing “ Finding Nemo ” as he is dissecting the intricacies of a piece of software , and he ’s perfectly capable of using Nietzsche ’s notion of eternal recurrence to discuss the new creative rules of television shows .
Johnson wants to understand popular culture — not in the postmodern , academic sense of wondering what “ The Dukes of Hazzard ” tells us about Southern male alienation but in the very practical sense of wondering what watching something like “ The Dukes of Hazzard ” does to the way our minds work .
As Johnson points out , television is very different now from what it was thirty years ago .
It ’s harder .
A typical episode of “ Starsky and Hutch , ” in the nineteen - seventies , followed an essentially linear path : two characters , engaged in a single story line , moving toward a decisive conclusion .
To watch an episode of “ Dallas ” today is to be stunned by its glacial pace — by the arduous attempts to establish social relationships , by the excruciating simplicity of the plotline , by how obvious it was .
A single episode of “ The Sopranos , ” by contrast , might follow five narrative threads , involving a dozen characters who weave in and out of the plot .
Modern television also requires the viewer to do a lot of what Johnson calls “ filling in , ” as in a “ Seinfeld ” episode that subtly parodies the Kennedy assassination conspiracists , or a typical “ Simpsons ” episode , which may contain numerous allusions to politics or cinema or pop culture .
The extraordinary amount of money now being made in the television aftermarket — DVD sales and syndication — means that the creators of television shows now have an incentive to make programming that can sustain two or three or four viewings .
Even reality shows like “ Survivor , ” Johnson argues , engage the viewer in a way that television rarely has in the past :
**{ : .break one} **
When we watch these shows , the part of our brain that monitors the emotional lives of the people around us — the part that tracks subtle shifts in intonation and gesture and facial expression — scrutinizes the action on the screen , looking for clues .
. . .
The phrase “ Monday - morning quarterbacking ” was coined to describe the engaged feeling spectators have in relation to games as opposed to stories .
We absorb stories , but we second - guess games .
Reality programming has brought that second - guessing to prime time , only the game in question revolves around social dexterity rather than the physical kind .
**
How can the greater cognitive demands that television makes on us now , he wonders , not matter ?
Johnson develops the same argument about video games .
Most of the people who denounce video games , he says , have n’t actually played them — at least , not recently .
Twenty years ago , games like Tetris or Pac - Man were simple exercises in motor coördination and pattern recognition .
Today ’s games belong to another realm .
Johnson points out that one of the “ walk - throughs ” for “ Grand Theft Auto III ” — that is , the informal guides that break down the games and help players navigate their complexities — is fifty - three thousand words long , about the length of his book .
The contemporary video game involves a fully realized imaginary world , dense with detail and levels of complexity .
Indeed , video games are not games in the sense of those pastimes — like Monopoly or gin rummy or chess — which most of us grew up with .
They do n’t have a set of unambiguous rules that have to be learned and then followed during the course of play .
This is why many of us find modern video games baffling : we ’re not used to being in a situation where we have to figure out what to do .
We think we only have to learn how to press the buttons faster .
But these games withhold critical information from the player .
Players have to explore and sort through hypotheses in order to make sense of the game ’s environment , which is why a modern video game can take forty hours to complete .
Far from being engines of instant gratification , as they are often described , video games are actually , Johnson writes , “ all about delayed gratification — sometimes so long delayed that you wonder if the gratification is ever going to show . ”
At the same time , players are required to manage a dizzying array of information and options .
The game presents the player with a series of puzzles , and you ca n’t succeed at the game simply by solving the puzzles one at a time .
You have to craft a longer - term strategy , in order to juggle and coördinate competing interests .
In denigrating the video game , Johnson argues , we have confused it with other phenomena in teen - age life , like multitasking — simultaneously e-mailing and listening to music and talking on the telephone and surfing the Internet .
Playing a video game is , in fact , an exercise in “ constructing the proper hierarchy of tasks and moving through the tasks in the correct sequence , ” he writes .
“ It ’s about finding order and meaning in the world , and making decisions that help create that order . ”
It does n’t seem right , of course , that watching “ 24 ” or playing a video game could be as important cognitively as reading a book .
Is n’t the extraordinary success of the “ Harry Potter ” novels better news for the culture than the equivalent success of “ Grand Theft Auto III ” ?
Johnson ’s response is to imagine what cultural critics might have said had video games been invented hundreds of years ago , and only recently had something called the book been marketed aggressively to children :
**{ : .break one} ** Reading books chronically understimulates the senses .
Unlike the longstanding tradition of gameplaying — which engages the child in a vivid , three - dimensional world filled with moving images and musical sound - scapes , navigated and controlled with complex muscular movements — books are simply a barren string of words on the page .
. . .
Books are also tragically isolating .
While games have for many years engaged the young in complex social relationships with their peers , building and exploring worlds together , books force the child to sequester him or herself in a quiet space , shut off from interaction with other children .
. . .
But perhaps the most dangerous property of these books is the fact that they follow a fixed linear path .
You ca n’t control their narratives in any fashion — you simply sit back and have the story dictated to you .
. . .
This risks instilling a general passivity in our children , making them feel as though they ’re powerless to change their circumstances .
Reading is not an active , participatory process ; it ’s a submissive one .
**
He ’s joking , of course , but only in part .
The point is that books and video games represent two very different kinds of learning .
When you read a biology textbook , the content of what you read is what matters .
Reading is a form of explicit learning .
When you play a video game , the value is in how it makes you think .
Video games are an example of collateral learning , which is no less important .
Being “ smart ” involves facility in both kinds of thinking — the kind of fluid problem solving that matters in things like video games and I.Q. tests , but also the kind of crystallized knowledge that comes from explicit learning .
If Johnson ’s book has a flaw , it is that he sometimes speaks of our culture being “ smarter ” when he ’s really referring just to that fluid problem - solving facility .
When it comes to the other kind of intelligence , it is not clear at all what kind of progress we are making , as anyone who has read , say , the Gettysburg Address alongside any Presidential speech from the past twenty years can attest .
The real question is what the right balance of these two forms of intelligence might look like .
“ Everything Bad Is Good for You ” does n’t answer that question .
But Johnson does something nearly as important , which is to remind us that we should n’t fall into the trap of thinking that explicit learning is the only kind of learning that matters .
In recent years , for example , a number of elementary schools have phased out or reduced recess and replaced it with extra math or English instruction .
This is the triumph of the explicit over the collateral .
After all , recess is “ play ” for a ten - year - old in precisely the sense that Johnson describes video games as play for an adolescent : an unstructured environment that requires the child actively to intervene , to look for the hidden logic , to find order and meaning in chaos .
One of the ongoing debates in the educational community , similarly , is over the value of homework .
Meta - analysis of hundreds of studies done on the effects of homework shows that the evidence supporting the practice is , at best , modest .
Homework seems to be most useful in high school and for subjects like math .
At the elementary - school level , homework seems to be of marginal or no academic value .
Its effect on discipline and personal responsibility is unproved .
And the causal relation between high - school homework and achievement is unclear : it has n’t been firmly established whether spending more time on homework in high school makes you a better student or whether better students , finding homework more pleasurable , spend more time doing it .
So why , as a society , are we so enamored of homework ?
Perhaps because we have so little faith in the value of the things that children would otherwise be doing with their time .
They could go out for a walk , and get some exercise ; they could spend time with their peers , and reap the rewards of friendship .
Or , Johnson suggests , they could be playing a video game , and giving their minds a rigorous workout . ♦
bento#33 Calvin and Hobbes February 5 , 2009
Posted by AnnaTheRed in bento blog ( all ) Tags : bento
EDIT : I just realized that this bento was featured on reddit , and getting a lot of traffic to this page from different sites .
I noticed that one editor in particular praising my bento on their site said that the potato salad “ is probably spoiled . ”
I usually ignore any negative comments , especially if it ’s someone else ’s page , but this is a bit different .
Not just assuming my bento is spoiled , but to actually write it out is uncalled for .
It ’s freedom of speech , I know .
So I decided to defend myself on my blog .
For the people who are coming to this site from the website I ’m talking about , I want you to know that my bento is n’t “ only for the looks ” and everything on my bento is definitely not spoiled .
( Yes , not “ probably ” but “ definitely ” )
If you read my “ about ” page , you ’ll know I keep all my food in the fridge while I make different food for my bento .
For me taste is just as important appearance , after all I ’m giving it to my boyfriend to eat for lunch , and he’d be the FIRST to know if anything was wrong with the food . 😛
Now to my actual post …
The last bento in 2008 was “ Where The Wild Things Are . ”
I enjoyed making it , but it was more for me than for my boyfriend … so I wanted to make a bento of something he grew up with .
Bento # 33 : Calvin and Hobbes
Created and eaten on : 1/15/2009
I knew he loved Calvin and Hobbes , but I did n’t grow up with it , so it was not easy for me to decide what kind of bento I ’d make .
When I ’m making bento of what I ’m familiar with , I know what “ element ” to pick for bento , but I really did n’t know with this one .
So , I google - searched images , and picked the iconic image where Calvin and Hobbes were on a wagon .
I drew a sketch , and wrote down what food I was going to use .
In the morning , I put lettuce in the bento box , and rice mixed with black sesame seed and salt on it as background , and string beans on the rice .
I put plastic sheet over my drawing , and mixed rice with ketchup to create Hobbes ’ orange body , and shaped it .
On the first try , I tried to make Hobbes ’ white part ( his face , stomach , hand and feet ) with rice , but did n’t turn out well …
So I decided to make it again , and this time using cheese for the white part on Hobbes .
I had to be really careful not to tear the cheese out but I think it came out okay .
I used potato salad I ’d made the night before and shaped it for Calvin ’s head and body .
I cut ham for his face and arms , fake crab meat for his shirt , and seaweed on cheese for his shoes .
Actually , the most difficult part for Calvin was his hair .
I thought I would just cut seaweed , put cheese over it and cut it around the seaweed , but for some reason it ended up looking like a buzzcut …
I used red pepper for his wagon , cheese on rice for the wheels , and seaweed on kamaboko ( fish cake ) for the handle .
After everything was done , I put seaweed stripes on Hobbes ’ body , and put face pieces that I had cut out of seaweed on .
Like I mentioned before , moisture can ruin seaweed .
So I try to put small seaweed pieces in the very end .
To finish up , I sliced carrot and cut it into star - shape and sprinkled around Calvin and Hobbes .
Regardless of what people told me , I think I could ’ve made this bento a lot better …
Bill Watterson ’s drawing was a lot harder to make it into bento than I anticipated .
Someone sent me a link to a site that had various snowman comic strips from Calvin and Hobbes after my boyfriend posted this on his flickr …
Darn it !
I totally could ’ve done it instead of Totoro snowman !
Oh well , there ’s always next time …
Anyway , to be honest , I was pleasantly surprised that may of my co-workers were very happy to see this bento as well as my boyfriend .
They all told me that Calvin and Hobbes were their favorite childhood comic when they were young .
Maybe I ’ll come back to this someday …
Calvin :
– potato salad
– fake fish crab meat
– seaweed on cheese
– cheese on ham
Hobbes :
– rice mixed with ketchup
– seaweed for the stripes and face
– cheese for the white par
Other food :
– rice mixed with black sesame seed and salt
– lettuce
– broccoli
– string bean
– carrot
– potato croquette

Last month , Top Gear was busted for using MR2 - based fake Ferraris in their live show .
Now the Italian stallions at Ferrari are demanding Top Gear only hoon authentic Ferraris in the future .

According to Drive.com.au , Ferrari's CEO admitted the company reached out to Top Gear to get them to " stoppa da crap " when it comes to the next show .
Speaking at the Geneva motor show , Ferrari CEO Amedeo Felisa said it was important to protect the brand and , as a consequence , the company had spoken to the Top Gear Live show 's organisers from the BBC .
A spokesman for Ferrari said Top Gear Live had admitted to using fake Ferraris .
" We asked them to change it … for the Hong Kong [ Top Gear Live ] show ( the last stop on the world tour ) , " said the spokesman .
" We said ‘ please use real Ferraris ' . "

The organizers for Top Gear Live said they'd be using drift cars , not fakes , for the Hong Kong show , thus removing the problem .
Felisa was later heard saying " Nut up , this is Top Gear , not Top Pussy . "

Joss Whedon's new show Dollhouse is about a secret organization that supplies mind - wiped sex ninjas to the rich .
It 's not set in the future because neuromanipulated technoslaves could exist today .
Here 's proof .

1 . We can erase people 's memories .
Back in October a study was published in Neuron that proved an enzyme called CaMKII can erase bad memories while you recall them .
In Dollhouse , the " actives " have their own memories erased first , and then new memories implanted .
The brain - erasure technology is actually the cornerstone of the operation , as it's what turns the actives into blank slates ready to be reprogrammed .
Right now , with the cooperation of desperate people , scientists could be using CaMKII to erase their old lives .
Then they 'll just need to implant new personalities and emotions .
2 . We can regulate people 's moods with microchips .
Right now , there are a series of implantable microchips on the market that send out electrical impulses over your nerves that can soothe a depressed person or reduce seizures .
Some call them neurological pacemakers , and we are discovering new things about them every day - such as the fact that some can cause instant orgasm .
Wipe somebody 's brain , then install these brain pacemakers , and you might start shaping a whole new person by controlling what gives them pleasure and what makes them depressed .
3 . We can use brain implants to steer animals left and right .
Several years ago , neuroscientists invented a little rat - sized brain implant that sent directional signals to the rodent 's brain .
Using a handheld remote , scientists sent electrical signals to the parts of the rats ' brains connected to right and left whisker sensations - and could induce the rats to turn right or left at the press of a button .
Dubbed the " robo - rat , " the creatures could be used for complicated search and rescue efforts that require crawling into small places .
Or they could be the beta version for a more nefarious technology implanted into humans ' brains that would allow a corporation like the Dollhouse to remote - control an active 's every move , right down to which street they turn on .

4. Infrared brain scans can predict what people want .
As we reported last week , researchers have discovered that a simple infrared brain scan can reveal patterns in brain activity that show simple preferences .
Ask a person whether they 'd rather have a dog or a cat , and this scan will give you the answer .
This is the first step towards knowing how to shape people 's preferences .
If scientists could trigger a reaction in your brain that reversed the pattern , they might be able to turn a cat person into a dog person and vice versa .
5. Human - computer interfaces link human brains directly to computers .
You may have heard of BrainGate , a technology that uses electrodes sunk into your gray matter to convert electrical impulses from your brain into computer commands .
It is currently used by people who are profoundly paralyzed to communicate by moving a cursor around .
If we can open up communication between brain and computer like that , it stands to reason that the communication might be two - way .
Who is to say there is no secret organization using a BrainGate - esque technology to reprogram people 's thoughts ?
International Business Machines Corp. is in talks to buy Sun Microsystems Inc. , people familiar with the matter said , a combination that would bolster IBM 's heft on the Internet , in software and in finance and telecommunications markets .
The two companies have a common interest in that both make computer systems for corporate customers that are n't reliant on Microsoft Corp . 's
Windows software , and their product lines are less dependant than rivals ' on Intel Corp .'s microprocessor technologies .
The two companies are also strong ...
CAN Israel still call the United States its best friend ?
Not if you believe the media in Israel .
The increasingly tense dialogue between the US President , Barack Obama , and the new Israeli Prime Minister , Benjamin Netanyahu , has taken on all the trappings of a duel here .
Almost every day brings news of another sore point , blighting the once warm relationship between the two countries .
Anyone could be forgiven for thinking the most immediate threat to national security in Israel lay across the Atlantic .
That Mr Obama uses almost every opportunity he gets to set the parameters of a final peace agreement between Israel and Palestine is bad enough .
But now officials in his administration are openly using Israeli anxiety at Iran 's nuclear program as a bargaining chip to force its hand on giving up control of the West Bank Palestinian territory .

During the Security and Prosperity Partnership ( SPP ) Summit in Montebello , Canada in 2005 , the “ three amigos ” ( Bush , Harper and Calderon ) released “ North American Plan for Avian and Pandemic Influenza , ” described as a “ collaborative North American approach that recognizes that controlling the spread of avian influenza or a novel strain of human influenza , with minimal economic disruption , is in the best interest of all three countries . ”
The plan outlines how “ Canada , Mexico and the United States intend to work together to prepare for and manage avian and pandemic influenza . ”
Ban Ki-moon said the Mexican flu outbreak is the “ first test ” of the “ pandemic preparedness work undertaken by the international community over the past three years . ”
It was hardly a coincidence that at the same time the U.S. Northern Command , or NORTHCOM , created a webpage dedicated to avian flu and subsequently ran exercises in preparation for the possible use of U.S. military forces in a continental domestic emergency involving avian flu or pandemic influenza .
In 2006 , NORTHCOM held an international exercise with more than 40 international , federal , and state agencies “ designed to provoke discussion and determine what governmental actions , including military support , would be necessary in the event of an influenza pandemic in the United States . ”
In addition , NORTHCOM participated in a nationwide Joint Chiefs of Staff - directed exercise code - named Exercise Ardent Sentry 06 to rehearse cooperation between Department of Defense and local , state , federal agencies , and the Canadian government .
In 2005 , then president Bush shifted U.S. policy on avian flu and pandemic influenza and placed the U.S. under international guidelines .
“ The policy shift was formalized Sept. 14 , 2005 , when Bush announced a new International Partnership on Avian and Pandemic Influenza to a High - Level Plenary Meeting of the U.N. General Assembly , in New York , ” Jerome Corsi wrote in September , 2007 .
“ The new International Partnership on Avian and Pandemic Influenza was designed to supersede an earlier November 2005 Homeland Security report that called for a U.S. national strategy that would be coordinated by the Departments of Homeland Security , Health and Agriculture . ”
In other words , any U.S. response to an avian flu pandemic would be directed under WHO , WTO , U.N. and NAFTA directives .
Congress and U.S. agencies would be cut out of the picture .
“ The U.N. - WHO - WTO - NAFTA plan advanced by SPP features a prominent role for the U.N. system influenza coordinator as a central international director in the case of a North American avian flu or pandemic influenza outbreak , ” Corsi adds .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Dr. David Nabarro , WHO executive director of sustainable development and health environments , was appointed the first U.N. system influenza coordinator .
In 2005 , Nabarro said during a press conference that his number one priority was to prepare for the H5N1 virus , known as the avian flu .
Nabarro played into the global fear that an epidemic was inevitable .
“ I ’m not , at the moment at liberty to give you a prediction on numbers , but I just want to stress , that , let ’s say , the range of deaths could be anything from 5 to 150 million , ” said Nabarro .
On March 8 , 2006 , during a U.N. press conference Nabarro predicted an outbreak of the H5N1 virus would “ reach the Americas within the next six to 12 months . ”
On Monday , UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon stoked the fear of a global flu pandemic .
He said the Mexican flu outbreak is the “ first test ” of the “ pandemic preparedness work undertaken by the international community over the past three years . ”
Ban Ki-moon said if “ we are indeed facing a pandemic , we need to demonstrate global solidarity .
In our interconnected world , no nation can deal with threats of such dimension on its own . ”
For Ki-moon and the global elite , “ global solidarity ” in “ our interconnected world ” translates into yet another push for world government .
Ki-moon ’s dire warning falls on the heels of the G20 summit where plans were announced for implementing the creation of a new global currency to replace the U.S. dollar ’s role as the world reserve currency .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and others repeatedly called for “ global governance ” and a “ New World Order . ”
The current flu pandemic hype serves as punctuation mark between the G20 held in London and the upcoming one to be held in Italy in June .
“ The G20 summit has agreed to try to kick start stalled Doha trade liberalization talks at the next G8 meeting , ” Reuters reported on April 2 .
So - called “ trade liberalization ” is code for the neoliberal plan to “ privatize ” public and private industries around the world , impose “ flexibilization ” of labor markets ( create massive unemployment ) , “ deregulate ” consumer and financial markets , and foster foreign buyouts , layoffs , wage cuts , transient employment , higher prices , and potentially destabilizing capital flows .
As noted by the Eagle Forum in October , 2007 , the SPP ’s North American Plan for Avian and Pandemic Influenza “ is not only about combating a flu epidemic but is far - reaching in seeking control over U.S. citizens and public policy during an epidemic . ”
The Plan would give authority to international bureaucrats “ beyond the health sector to include a coordinated approach to critical infrastructure protection , ” including “ border and transportation issues . ”
On April 26 , Infowars covered the Department of Defense ’s “ Implementation Plan for Pandemic Influenza ” that proposes nothing less than the militarization of health care , military augmentation of civilian law enforcement , and the mass vaccination of the population as directed by the government .
Ki-moon , the United Nations , and the globalists , with the participation of the globalist - dominated corporate media and the ruling elite in Mexico , are hyping the flu outbreak as a possible pandemic in order to sell us their scheme for world government .
It is an ongoing process .

John Dean : Cheney is guilty of ' murder ' if Hersh claims are true David Edwards and Rachel Oswald
Published : Friday March 13 , 2009
Print This Email This Investigative reporter Seymour Hershs bombshell earlier this week that Vice President Dick Cheney controlled an executive assassination ring continues to reverberate throughout Washington , with Nixon aide John Dean going so far as to accuse the former VP of murder if the charges are true .
MSNBCs Keith Olbermann visited the issue on his show Countdown Thursday night where he discussed the legal implications of Hersh 's allegations with Dean , who was White House legal counsel under President Richard Nixon .
 It s potentially a war crime ,  Dean said of the reported assassination ring .
 It s potentially just outright murder and its clearly in violation of the Ford Executive Order . 
Hersh told the students at the University of Minnesota on Tuesday that the assassination squad was a special wing of our special operations community that is set up independently .
In the Bush - Cheney Days , they reported directly to the Cheney , Cheney office .
They do not report to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff or to Mr. Gates , the secretary of defense .
They report directly to him .
Congress has no oversight of it .
It s an executive assassination ring , essentially . 
 If this is true you have to prosecute this .
There is no way around this ,  said Olbermann , noting the 1976 executive order of President Gerald Ford which explicitly outlawed the engagement of political employees in political assassination .
Cheney was Fords chief of staff at the time the order was issued .
 By the time Cheney was back in the West Wing it appears that Cheney had forgotten his own bosss executive order , or worse , he had decided to ignore it ,  Olbermann said .
Dean told Olbermann that  the Presidents the only one you can argue who may have the authority to engage in assassinations .
Newsweek editor Howard Fineman shared with Olbermann his own investigation into the veracity of Hersh 's claims .
Fineman said his talks Thursday with sources in the intelligence community had revealed that while they are skeptical of the existence of any assassination ring , they had too much respect in Hersh 's reporting to dismiss the allegations outright and that they warranted further study .
However , not everyone is buying the claims made by Hersh .
The Weekly Standard 's Bill Roggio writes , " Hersh has made a living of making fantastic claims that do n't quite live up to the hype .
Chalk this one up as another Hersh fantasy . "
Claims by the CIA that the Hersh allegations were utter nonsense ,  are not surprising , said Fineman .
 If there is in fact such a thing ... and the CIA was kept in the dark about it , the last thing they would want to do right now is to admit it ,  Fineman said .
Fineman said he has been told by aides to Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) , chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee who has proposed forming an independent  Truth Commission to investigate abuses of the Bush administration , that not many members of the Senate have signed on to the proposal as of yet .
However , the new allegations by Hersh may be shocking enough to push more senators over to Leahys side , Fineman said .
 This could be that thing , depending on how much it pans out ,  Fineman said .
 One more really serious allegation I think you re going to see a lot of senators wanting to join Sen .
Leahys side on this .

These are heady times at the editorial offices of the New York Times and at the Washington , D.C. , home of Sojourners .
Columnist Thomas Frank of the Wall Street Journal cannot contain his glee , and the editors of The Nation are enraptured .
College and university faculty members still are celebrating .
Indeed , one would think that " Happy Days are Here Again " is playing over and over wherever there is a music box .
Barack Obama has delivered .
He not only has produced a federal budget so profligate that even Paul Krugman has endorsed it , but his actions on the tax - borrow - spend front have earned the praise of none other than God Himself .
That ’s right , Jim Wallis , the founder and leader of the Marxist organization Sojourners , has studied the highlights of the document and declared them fit for praise from the Almighty .
Thus , we finally are seeing the convergence of the atheists and those who say they believe in God : all can worship Obama .
I have scanned many writers and editorial pages and websites that make their home on the Left , and all seem consistent in their praise of the president ’s new proposals .
After Obama ’s recent speech to Congress , Wallis gushed :
This was n’t really a budget speech , or even a State of the Union .
It was a call to rebuild a country — from its infrastructure , to its economy , to its values .
Last night , Barack Obama called a new generation to a new American future .
And from the " twittering " and Facebook status updates I am aware of going on last night , the new generation stayed up late to watch and got the speech they wanted — a vision for the new America they hope to raise their children in .
Lest one think that Wallis was enjoying just a momentary flash of glee , read on :
Some people do n’t like strong leadership .
I do .
And this is the kind of leadership that calls and inspires people to act themselves and be part of the solutions we need .
I like that too .
And it ’s a new kind of leadership that invites being held accountable to results .
That ’s fair .
Obama has a vision and last night offered a road map .
And he invited citizens across the political spectrum to bring their own ideas but to join the journey and stop standing by the side of the road with their arms folded in critique .
Disagreement comes with a responsibility to offer better ideas , says this president .
The words of Ty ’Sheoma , a school girl from South Carolina , sitting in the gallery next to Michelle Obama , were lifted up by President Obama last night .
She wrote the Congress to ask for help for her school but wanted them to know , " We are not quitters . "
Furthermore , lest one thinks that Wallis is speaking only for himself , read these recent words from Paul Krugman :
Elections have consequences .
President Obama ’s new budget represents a huge break , not just with the policies of the past eight years , but with policy trends over the past 30 years .
If he can get anything like the plan he announced on Thursday through Congress , he will set America on a fundamentally new course .
The budget will , among other things , come as a huge relief to Democrats who were starting to feel a bit of postpartisan depression .
The stimulus bill that Congress passed may have been too weak and too focused on tax cuts .
The administration ’s refusal to get tough on the banks may be deeply disappointing .
But fears that Mr. Obama would sacrifice progressive priorities in his budget plans , and satisfy himself with fiddling around the edges of the tax system , have now been banished .
As the Obama administration continues on its legislative and political path , I think that we have to re-frame the terms of the argument .
For most people , the dispute supposedly is over the way to an economic recovery .
On one side , there is the Keynesian demand that we spend out way out of the crisis , and the recent Nobel Prize conferred on Krugman , who is the loudest and most prominent spokesman for this policy prescription , supposedly lends this path some legitimacy .
On the other side , there are people like Peter Schiff and the Austrian Economists and mainstream economists like Robert Barro , who say that the government ’s " solution " is upside down and is making the economic crisis worse .
Writes Barro :
Given our situation , it is right that radical government policies should be considered if they promise to lower the probability and likely size of a depression .
However , many governmental actions — including several pursued by Franklin Roosevelt during the Great Depression — can make things worse .
I wish I could be confident that the array of U.S. policies already in place and those likely forthcoming will be helpful .
But I think it more likely that the economy will eventually recover despite these policies , rather than because of them .
As one who admires Schiff and others who have spoken out and told the truth — and I believe they are correct — I believe that it is time for us to understand a basic truth that is coming out of the new regime :
There is not going to be a recovery , and that is just fine with Obama and the political classes that now have a death grip on our lives .
This is a harsh and seemingly conspiratorial statement , and people who know me know that I am extremely skeptical of " conspiracy theories , " yet here I am peddling what some very well might call a " conspiracy theory . "
Do I believe that what Washington is doing is a diabolical plot aimed at fundamentally changing the U.S. economy in a way that economic depression will be a permanent way of life ?
In a word , yes .
The Obama and Democratic proposals are not simply economic documents .
They are fundamentally political in nature and they reflect an understanding that few people have of the Great Depression .
When people discuss the Great Depression , it usually is in the context of whether or not the New Deal was " successful . "
Economists such as Robert Higgs and Murray Rothbard have argued that it was not , and Barro ’s comments above add to that side of the discussion .
On the other hand , we have a recent article in Salon which claimed that the New Deal produced " spectacular " economic growth , and we also have Krugman ’s columns which claim that the only problem with the New Deal was that Franklin Roosevelt did not spend enough money because the " conservatives " had his ear .
Now , I go with the first group .
The New Deal was an unqualified economic failure , if one judges economic " success " by things like unemployment rates , private investment , real output , and the move of people from lives of poverty to lives of plenty .
Unemployment stayed in double digits throughout the decade , many people lived in poverty , and the economic output never did match what it had been during the 1920s .
However , I have to add something that most people leave out of the discussion : the New Deal was an unqualified political success , and it was successful precisely because it blocked the economic recovery .
This is counter - intuitive , I realize .
I have heard discussion in the halls of my university that the public will lose patience with Obama and the Democrats if they do n’t deliver and " political guru " Dick Morris even predicts that further economic failure will result in the Republicans gaining political strength .
Do n’t count on it .
During the 1930s , the Roosevelt administration never had to worry about losing political power , and it held and added to its political majorities .
Roosevelt even won a third term of office although the first eight years of his presidency had barely moved the rate of unemployment below what it had been during the worst days of the Herbert Hoover administration .
This spectacular run of political power did not come in spite of the economic crisis ; it came because of it .
The crisis never ended , and that provided vast opportunities for the political classes in Washington to add to their power over the lives of individuals .
We have to remember that with the exception of the U.S. entry into World War I , most Americans had little contact with governments , and especially the federal government .
They lived their lives mostly employed in private business , and with their own families and private associations like churches and clubs .
The Great Depression and the New Deal changed all of that .
Americans who once had held jobs that were lifting them from poverty now had to depend upon the pittance of money they received from Washington to keep them from sliding off into economic oblivion .
The Works Progress Administration might have paid very little , but whatever money these people received helped to keep them alive for another month .
As James Couch and William Shughart have pointed out in their book , The Political Economy of the New Deal , the Roosevelt administration understood the political power that it had and , more important , the power that it held over the very survival of individuals and their families .
In previous times , people could have ignored what was going on in Washington , but during the years of the New Deal , that no longer was possible .
Indeed , they were utterly dependent upon the political classes in Washington and that meant voting " for the right people . "
In his recent Christmas Day column , Krugman claimed that the Roosevelt administration was nonpolitical in its economic spending , and provided a roadmap for " good government . "
The meticulous research of Couch and Shughart exposes Krugman ’s claim for the Big Lie that it is .
Indeed , the New Deal was a vast vote - buying scheme created and maintained for one purpose : keeping Roosevelt and his party in power , and it succeeded beyond expectations .
We know that Obama and his political minions have been reading all about FDR and the New Deal , and we also know they have not been reading Murray Rothbard or Ludwig von Mises .
They know all about how FDR and the New Dealers manipulated policies and continuously blocked an economic recovery that would not come about until after Roosevelt was dead and government spending was reduced drastically .
A true economic recovery would mean that the government would play a secondary role in our lives at best .
That clearly is not good enough for Obama and the Democrats , who are not interested in being politically irrelevant .
Just as the Republicans ’ " K - Street Project " was about forcing businesses and individuals to pay protection money to the GOP , the Democrats are going to stay in power because anyone who votes against them is not going to be able to find meaningful employment .
A true economic recovery would strengthen businesses and families , but it would do so at the expense of the power of the political classes .
Such a state of affairs no longer is acceptable in Washington , and Obama and his friends are going to make sure that we do n’t forget that either .
The key to holding power , however , is blocking an economic recovery and having an economy in which double - digit unemployment is the norm .
Do n’t think that this would trigger a revolt from the American voters .
Once the voters have come to believe that their own futures are tied to the whims of the political classes , they will vote their personal security .
Furthermore , the administration and Congress will do everything possible to further empower labor unions , and we can look for huge inroads as the government simply will declare that businesses and organizations become unionized — or else .
Organized labor is a political creation , and that means that every working individual is going to constantly be scrutinized for political loyalties — if that person wants to keep his or her job .

Microsoft said on Monday it had signed a deal with LG Electronics , under which the world 's third - largest cell phone maker will use Windows software in most of its smartphones .
" A majority of their smartphones will use Windows , " Andy Lees , the head of Windows ' wireless unit , told Reuters in an interview .
Small handset vendor HTC is currently the world 's largest maker of phones using Windows software .
The search will continue this morning for a five - year - old boy feared taken by a crocodile in far north Queensland .
Searchers have found several crocodiles close to where a boy went missing on the Daintree River , north of Cairns , yesterday .
Rangers from the Environmental Protection Agency conducted spotlighting on the river overnight to locate crocodiles .
A local tourism operator who helped with the search says three crocs - a male known as ' Lumpy ' and two females - were spotted near where the boy disappeared .
Police say he vanished after following his dog into the water from a boardwalk on his parents property on the river 's northern bank .
His seven - year - old brother was with him and told police he saw a crocodile soon after his brother vanished .
His parents are local tourism operators and his father has been involved in the search overnight .
Authorities are hoping to search the area on foot where the boy disappeared before the tide rises later this morning .
The disappearance has shocked the small Daintree community .
If confirmed as a fatal crocodile attack , it would be the second in far north Queensland since October when a 62 - year - old man was killed near Cooktown .
The BAS hopes to encourage tradespeople to leave the rat race behind .
The British Antarctic Survey ( BAS ) has launched a recruitment drive to find tradespeople to work at its research centre in Antarctica .
The organisation is looking for around 40 carpenters , electricians , plumbers , chefs and technicians .
" It 's an opportunity of a lifetime .
As well as the scenery you are supporting science , " said Athena Dinar of the BAS .
Successful applicants will earn around £ 23,000 with free travel , accommodation , food and clothing .
' More money '
Engineer William
Ray spends two months each summer working at the base .
He told the BBC's Breakfast programme : " It 's fantastic : beautiful scenery , great wildlife , it 's everything you 'd imagine . "
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The salaries offered may not compare favourably to wages for similar jobs in the UK , but with a distinct lack of opportunities to spend their income , new recruits could well end up better off .
" We know that probably can't compete with what tradespeople can get in the UK , " said personnel officer James Miller .
" But , of course , your accommodation is included , all your food 's included and all your clothing 's included .
So , you get to see a lot more of that money when you get back . "
Up to 100 people operate from the base in Antarctica at any one time , conducting research into climate change and biodiversity - work which recruits will support .
Contracts will run from four to 18 months .
With the UK's employment market distinctly chilly , the BAS hopes that even the - 30C Antarctic conditions will prove attractive .
The government has been accused of creating laws that have a chilling effect on freedom of expression in the UK in a sharply critical report from the United Nations ' committee on human rights .
The report calls for the reform of Britain 's libel laws and controls introduced under recent terrorism laws .
The government 's use of the Official Secrets
Act to prevent issues of public interest being published is also condemned in an intervention from the UN which warns that public servants are being gagged even where national security is not at risk .
The criticisms are made as part of the committee 's analysis of a report which the UK is required to submit to the UN every three years , appraising human rights in its jurisdiction .
Among the problems identified , the UN says :
· Terrorism Act 2006 provisions covering encouragement of terrorism are too broad and vague , and should be amended so that their application does not lead to " a disproportionate interference with freedom of expression " .
· Libel laws should be reformed to end so - called " libel tourism " , whereby wealthy foreigners have gone to the high court to sue over articles that would not warrant action in their own country .
· Powers under the Official Secrets
Act have been " exercised to frustrate former employees of the crown from bringing into the public domain issues of genuine public interest , and can be exercised to prevent the media from publishing such matters " .
The committee also warns that , in the age of the internet , Britain 's unduly restrictive libel laws create the danger of affecting freedom of expression worldwide , contrary to a UN covenant on civil and political rights which guarantees the right to freedom of speech and to exchange ideas and information " regardless of borders " .
On the phenomenon of libel tourism , the case which has provoked most concern is that of the American researcher Dr Rachel Ehrenfeld , who was sued in London by a Saudi businessman and his two sons over a book which was not published in the UK , although 23 copies had been sold here via the internet and one chapter was available online .
The action led to the New York state legislature passing legislation to protect writers and publishers working there from defamation judgments elsewhere , unless the defendants enjoyed the same freedom of speech rights as under New York and US federal law .
The UK government has been urged to consider " a so - called ' public figure ' exception " , which would require a would - be claimant to prove actual malice by a publisher or author .
This would apply in cases involving public officials and prominent public figures , as currently exists in the US , where a public figure can only sue for libel if he or she can demonstrate malice , recklessness or indifference to the truth .
The 2006 Terrorism Act's " broad and vague " definition of the offence of " encouragement of terrorism " - an offence which can attract a jail term of seven years - was also criticised by the committee .
" In particular , a person can commit the offence even when he or she did not intend members of the public to be directly or indirectly encouraged by his or her statement to commit acts of terrorism , but where his or her statement was understood by some members of the public as encouragement to commit such acts , " concluded the committee .
The government 's abolition earlier this year of the common - law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel in England and Wales was noted and welcomed , as was the adoption of the civil partnership act recognising unions between gay and lesbian couples .
The UK also came under fire for its treatment of the Chagos Islanders , whose case for return to their former homes was heard by the law lords last month .
The committee urged that the islanders be allowed to return , and also be compensated .
There was also condemnation over the extension of detention without charge from 14 to 28 days under the Terrorism Act .
The committee was " even more disturbed " at plans to extend this to 42 days .
On the issue of the libel laws , media law specialist Mark Stephens said yesterday that " libel lawyers in this country have remained insouciant to the deficiencies highlighted by the UN " .
The civil rights organisation , Liberty , has already expressed concern about the Terrorism Act and its potential effect on free expression .
" Free speech has been a victim of the ' war on terror ' , with offences of ' encouragement ' and ' glorification ' of terrorism threatening to make careless talk a crime , " said a spokesperson .
ANALYSIS / OPINION :
In a market economy , business deaths are like death itself - an unfortunate but inevitable fact of life .
However , recent government bailouts have tried to stop the inevitable by intervening in the market , at least temporarily saving failed firms from the economic grim reaper .
Before putting the next failed business on life support , it ’s worth remembering why it makes sense to let struggling producers expire .
• When failing businesses are allowed to fail , resources are released from employments where they do n’t add value and made available for employments where they do .
Resources used for one purpose ca n’t be used for another .
Thus , it ’s important that they find their way to the purposes we value most .
Enter the profit - and - loss system .
Under this system , when producers use resources in ways that are consistent with our wants , they earn profits .
When they do n’t , they earn losses .
If losses are severe enough or accumulate over time , the producers who earn them go under .
Far from cause for concern , this failure is cause for celebration .
When ineffective producers fail , resources committed to producing goods we value less are freed for producing goods we value more .
Polaroid ’s failure released resources for the production of digital cameras ; Commodore Computers ’ failure released resources for the production of IBM computers ; and Chi Chi ’s restaurant ’s failure released resources for , well , the production of food that tastes good .
Who better to sacrifice the resources required to expand production of the things we want than producers of the things we do n’t ?
If government prevents failing producers from going out of business , resources get “ stuck ” in employments where they ’re less productive .
We ca n’t have as many of the products we care more about because the means needed to make them remain locked in the manufacture of products we care less about .
Society suffers as a result .
• When failing businesses are allowed to fail , producers learn how to combine resources in ways that create wealth .
We take it for granted that producers know what we want .
But this information does n’t appear magically .
It has to be produced .
The profit - and - loss system produces this information - but only when government lets failing businesses fail .
Profits and losses do for producers what traffic signals do for drivers .
They tell them when to “ go , ” “ slow down ” and “ stop ” their productive activities .
By communicating which resource combinations consumers value most and which they do n’t , profits and losses direct “ economic traffic , ” informing producers how to produce .
If government prevents ineffective producers from failing , the red light on the “ economic traffic signal ” stops working .
Production continues and resources flow when they should halt , destroying wealth instead of creating it .
• When failing businesses are allowed to fail , producers have incentives to combine resources in ways that create wealth .
The profit - and - loss system works because successful producers reap rewards when they combine resources effectively and unsuccessful producers incur costs when they do n’t .
The prospect of profits from making good decisions and losses from making bad ones encourages producers to make choices that improve our lives .
But if government shields ineffective producers from the consequences of their bad decisions , producers ’ incentives become skewed .
For instance , when policy permits producers to enjoy the benefits of successful risk - taking but subsidizes the losses of unsuccessful gambles , producers have an incentive to take on more risk than they should .
Since they ’re no longer responsible to consumers when they make poor choices , the link connecting producers ’ and consumers ’ interests is weakened and , with it , the economy ’s ability to advance .
At a time when failure is the new dirty word and government seems willing to prop up floundering firms at any cost , we would do well to remember the benefits of letting failing businesses go belly up .

A better Caching system for Django
Django has pretty good support for caching , which is one of the easiest ways of speeding up a web application .
The default is to cache for ten minutes , which means that if you get multiple requests for a page within a ten minute window then Django can serve up a stored copy of the page without hitting the database or rendering the HTML .
The caching period can be set per-page and fragments of pages can be cached rather than the whole , but the system rests on the fact that it does n't matter if the content does n't change for a period of time .
Trouble is , not many web applications work that way .
Consider a humble blog post with a piece of content and a list of comments .
Granted , the post content is n't going to change very often and will probably never change again once the author has corrected all the typos , but a list of comments may change at any point through the life - time of the blog .
If the page were cached , comments would not be visible on the page for a short period of time , which does n't give that instant gratification that web users expect these days .
It would be nice if a web app could benefit from caching and still serve a fresh page when content changes .
Alas , Django 's default time - based caching is never going to achieve this .
What is needed is a way of invalidating an item in the cache when there are changes that alter the content ; using the blog example , this would be when the post content changes or a new comment is submitted .
Django does give you the tools to do this -- using the low level cache API , you can construct a cache key ( a simple string ) that changes according to the page content , then store and retrieve your content manually .
For example you might create a cache key with the modification date of the post , and the ID of the most recent comment .
Then the page need only be rendered when the cache key is n't found in the cache .
The downside of this approach is that it can take a little work to calculate the key ( you may still have to hit the database to generate the cache key ) .
This is not quite as nice as time - based caching , which will do negligible work for cached pages .
A better approach , which has the benefit of always serving a fresh page , and still requires negligible work for cached pages is to construct the cache key based on the request , then invalidate ( i.e. delete ) the cache key when the content changes .
Again , this can be done with Django , although it has no explicit support for it .
Such a system requires more work because the web app must track any event that could potentially require a fresh page to be generated , but has the major advantage that up - to - date pages are virtually always going to be available in the cache .
I 've written ad - hoc page - event cache systems a couple of times and they are a major headache to maintain .
Even on simple pages there can be multiple events that may invalidate a cached page .
What would be nice , is some formal way of associating a model instance with a the URL (s ) that depend on it , so that when the instance is saved , the associated pages will be invalidated and re-generated at the next request .
I 've not yet settled on the best way of implementing this , but it will probably be a decorator that builds up a mapping of object type plus primary key to its dependant URLs , and a mixin for models that hooks in to the save method .
I 'm open to suggestions regarding the most elegant implementation , and any other potential solutions !
The Geithner plan has now been leaked in detail .
It ’s exactly the plan that was widely analyzed — and found wanting — a couple of weeks ago .
The zombie ideas have won .
The Obama administration is now completely wedded to the idea that there ’s nothing fundamentally wrong with the financial system — that what we ’re facing is the equivalent of a run on an essentially sound bank .
As Tim Duy put it , there are no bad assets , only misunderstood assets .
And if we get investors to understand that toxic waste is really , truly worth much more than anyone is willing to pay for it , all our problems will be solved .
To this end the plan proposes to create funds in which private investors put in a small amount of their own money , and in return get large , non-recourse loans from the taxpayer , with which to buy bad — I mean misunderstood — assets .
This is supposed to lead to fair prices because the funds will engage in competitive bidding .
But it ’s immediately obvious , if you think about it , that these funds will have skewed incentives .
In effect , Treasury will be creating — deliberately ! — the functional equivalent of Texas S&Ls in the 1980s : financial operations with very little capital but lots of government - guaranteed liabilities .
For the private investors , this is an open invitation to play heads I win , tails the taxpayers lose .
So sure , these investors will be ready to pay high prices for toxic waste .
After all , the stuff might be worth something ; and if it is n’t , that ’s someone else ’s problem .
Or to put it another way , Treasury has decided that what we have is nothing but a confidence problem , which it proposes to cure by creating massive moral hazard .
This plan will produce big gains for banks that did n’t actually need any help ; it will , however , do little to reassure the public about banks that are seriously undercapitalized .
And I fear that when the plan fails , as it almost surely will , the administration will have shot its bolt : it wo n’t be able to come back to Congress for a plan that might actually work .
What an awful mess .
Update : Calculated Risk and Yves Smith have similar reactions .
A few hours ago , certain sections of The Pirate Bay were flagged by Google as containing malware and were subsequently blocked .
Similar warnings are being shown by Firefox , which states that the world 's largest tracker is an " attack site " .
The Pirate Bay team are working on the problem now .
Right now , trying to access certain sections of The Pirate Bay via Google or using the Firefox browser is proving worrisome .
While other parts of the site appear to function normally , the ‘ user ’ sections of the site ( such sections are identifiable via this type of URL : http://thepiratebay.org/user/XXXX) appear to have some significant problems .
Accessing the site via Firefox generates the following message ;
A Google search on the same pages returns , “ This site may harm your computer . ”
So what exactly is the problem ?
Torrent Freak spoke with Peter Sunde ( brokep ) who told us that right now they do n’t have a clear idea of what is causing the problem although they are working hard on fixing it .
Current thinking by some says that the problems are being caused by malicious ads from third parties which are embedded in the site .
Google has made its own analysis and is reporting that the /user sections of the TPB site were listed once for suspicious activity , yesterday 14th March 2009 .
Of 699 pages tested , it found that 2 pages resulted in malicious software being downloaded and installed without user consent .
Google goes on to say that the malicious software includes 68 scripting exploits although they report that a successful infection resulted in zero new processes on the target machine .
The malicious software in question is said to be hosted on 3 domains ; savelocity.com , seekerfeed.com , and xoads.com , with another 6 reported as distribution intermediaries including parkneed.com , yieldmanager.com and zxxds.net .
This type of problem is nothing new on torrent sites .
Last year we reported how Google and Firefox blocked Empornium , the world ’s largest porn tracker , when they suffered similar problems at the hands of outsiders .
Just yesterday , the h33t.com torrent site suffered a similar problem , but that now appears to be fixed after we tipped off the staff there .
We will add to this post during the day to include the latest updates .

No , of course not .
Because so far , that little arrangement has been working rather well for them - they got obscenely rich , and we got the tab :
NEW YORK -- Bank of America Corp. rebuffed earlier news reports that its chairman and chief executive , Ken Lewis , intended to suggest to President Barack Obama to separate commercial and investment banking .
The Charlotte bank said in a statement , " Mr. Lewis was referring to people 's understanding of banks and how they should view the difference between commercial and investment banks in terms of forming perceptions of their various activities . "
The CEO " was not talking about reinstating a legal separation between commercial and investment banking , " the statement said .
Bank of America bought Merrill Lynch & Co. , a major investment - banking and brokerage company , in January .
Mr. Lewis , and the leaders of several big banks , met with President Obama in Washington .
Following Mr. Lewis ' arrival at the White House , Bloomberg News reported that he said a separation of the two businesses should be considered .
The Glass - Steagall Act of 1933 prohibited banks from having commercial - and investment - banking businesses under one roof , but the law was repealed in 1999 by the Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act .
The change followed the merger of Citicorp Inc. with Travelers Corp. Inc. to form Citigroup Inc .
In his campaign and inaugural address , Barack Obama cast himself as a moderate man seeking common ground with conservatives .
Yet , his budget calls for the radical restructuring of the U.S. economy , a sweeping redistribution of power and wealth to government and Democratic constituencies .
It is a declaration of war on the Right .
The real Obama has stood up , and lived up to his ranking as the most left - wing member of the United States Senate .
Barack has no mandate for this .
He was even behind McCain when the decisive event that gave him the presidency occurred — the September collapse of Lehman Brothers and the market crash .
Republicans are under no obligation to render bipartisan support to this statist coup d’tat .
For what is going down is a leftist power grab that is anathema to their principles and philosophy .
Where the U.S. government usually consumes 21 percent of gross domestic product , this Obama budget spends 28 percent in 2009 and runs a deficit of $ 1.75 trillion , or 12.7 percent of GDP .
That is four times the largest deficit of George W. Bush and twice as large a share of the economy as any deficit run since World War II .
Add that 28 percent of GDP spent by the U.S. government to the 12 percent spent by states , counties and cities , and government will consume 40 percent of the economy in 2009 .
We are not “ headed down the road to socialism . ”
We are there .
Since the budget was released , word has come that the U.S. economy did not shrink by 3.8 percent in the fourth quarter , but 6.2 percent .
All the assumptions in Obama ’s budget about growth in 2009 and 2010 need to be revised downward , and the deficits revised upward .
Look for the deficit for 2009 to cross $ 2 trillion .
Who abroad is going to lend us the trillions to finance our deficits without demanding higher interest rates on the U.S. bonds they are being asked to hold ?
And if we must revert to the printing press to create the money , what happens to the dollar ?
As Americans save only a pittance and have lost — in the value of homes , stocks , bonds and other assets — $ 15 trillion to $ 20 trillion since 2007 , how can the people provide the feds with the needed money ?
In his speech to Congress , Obama promised new investments in energy , education and health care .
Every kid is going to get a college degree .
We ’re going to find a cure for cancer .
Who is going to pay for all this ?
The top 2 percent , the filthy rich who got all those Bush tax breaks , say Democrats .
But the top 5 percent of income earners already pay 60 percent of U.S. income taxes , while the bottom 40 percent pays nothing .
Those paying a federal tax rate of 35 percent will see it rise to near 40 percent and will lose a fifth of the value of their deductions for taxes , mortgage interest and charitable contributions .
Yet , two - thirds of small businesses are taxed at the same rate as individuals .
Consider what this means to the owner of a restaurant and bar in Los Angeles open from noon to midnight , where a husband and wife each put in 80 hours a week .
At year ’s end , the couple finds they have actually made a profit of $ 500,000 that they can take home in salary .
What is the Obama - Schwarzenegger tax take on that salary ?
Their U.S. tax rate will have hit 39.6 percent .
Their California income tax will have hit 9.55 percent .
Medicare payroll taxes on the proprietor as both employer and salaried employee will be $ 14,500 .
Social Security payroll taxes for the proprietor as both employer and employee will be $ 13,243 .
In short , U.S. and state income and payroll taxes will consume half of all the pair earned for some 8,000 hours of work .
From that ravaged salary they must pay a state sales tax of 8.25 percent , gas taxes for the 50 - mile commute , and tens of thousands in property taxes on both their restaurant and home .
And , after being pilloried by politicians for having feasted in the Bush era , they are now told the tax deduction they get for contributing to the church is to be cut 20 percent , while millions of Obama voters , who paid no U.S. income tax at all , will be getting a tax cut — i.e. , a fat little check — in April .
Any wonder native - born Californians are fleeing the Golden Land ?
Markets are not infallible .
But the stock market has long been a “ lead indicator ” of where the economy will be six months from now .
What are the markets , the collective decisions of millions of investors , saying ?
Having fallen every month since Obama ’s election , with January and February the worst two months in history , they are telling us the stimulus package will not work , that Tim Geithner is clueless about how to save the banks , that the Obama budget portends disaster for the republic .
The president says he is gearing up for a fight on his budget .
Good .
Let ’s give him one .

The internet ’s network structure is similar to that of the human brain ( Image : ImageSource / Getty )

Yes , if we play our cards right – or wrong , depending on your perspective .
In engineering terms , it is easy to see qualitative similarities between the human brain and the internet ’s complex network of nodes , as they both hold , process , recall and transmit information .
“ The internet behaves a fair bit like a mind , ” says Ben Goertzel , chair of the Artificial General Intelligence Research Institute , an organisation inevitably based in cyberspace .
“ It might already have a degree of consciousness ” .
Not that it will necessarily have the same kind of consciousness as humans : it is unlikely to be wondering who it is , for instance .
To Francis Heylighen , who studies consciousness and artificial intelligence at the Free University of Brussels ( VUB ) in Belgium , consciousness is merely a system of mechanisms for making information processing more efficient by adding a level of control over which of the brain ’s processes get the most resources .
“ Adding consciousness is more a matter of fine - tuning and increasing control … than a jump to a wholly different level , ” Heylighen says .
How might this manifest itself ?
Heylighen speculates that it might turn the internet into a self - aware network that constantly strives to become better at what it does , reorganising itself and filling gaps in its own knowledge and abilities .
If it is not already semiconscious , we could do various things to help wake it up , such as requiring the net to monitor its own knowledge gaps and do something about them .
It should n’t be something …

Bill O'Reilly 's ' great ambushes ... of justice ' stalks blogger Muriel Kane
Published : Monday March 23 , 2009
Print This Email This Blogger Amanda Terkel of ThinkProgress has become the latest victim of an ambush by a producer for Fox News host Bill O'Reilly .
The O'Reilly Factor 's producers -- who have been dubbed " great ambushers ... of justice " by The Daily Show 's Jon Stewart -- are well - known for attempting to catch competing journalists as they go about their daily routines and firing accusatory questions at them .
Terkel had criticized O'Reilly for accepting an invitation to speak before a support group for rape survivors , even though he had suggested on his radio show last year that an 18 - year - old , 5 - foot - 2 - inch college student who was raped and murdered would " be alive today " if she had n't been drunk and wearing an outfit with a bare midriff .
" This weekend , while on vacation , I was ambushed by OReillys top hit man , producer Jesse Watters , who accosted me on the street and told me that because I highlighted OReillys comments , I was causing ' pain and suffering ' to rape victims and their families , " Terkel writes .
" He of course offered no proof to back up this claim , instead choosing to shout questions at me . "
The producer accused ThinkProgress of being part of a " smear pipeline " and demanded that Terkel offer an apology on camera to rape victims .
" OReilly never asked me for a statement nor invited me on his show before sending Watters to harass me , " Terkel emphasizes .
" Since Im a 5 ft , 100 pound woman with an opinion that he doesnt like , perhaps OReilly believes I deserve to be treated this way . "
What makes the incident particularly disturbing is that it occurred while Terkel was on vacation , and the Fox producer and cameraman had apparently been stalking her for some time .
She explains , " My friend and I were in this small town for a short weekend vacation and had told no one about where we were going .
I can only infer that the two men staked out my apartment and then followed me for two hours .
Looking back , my friend and I remember seeing their tan SUV following us for much of the trip . "
Just a few weeks ago , Jon Stewart dissected O'Reilly 's stalking techniques , contrasting them with his hypocritical attacks on paparazzi .
Stewart commented that his " favorite part about the Factor is that they have no trouble reconciling their defense of celebrities ' right to privacy with their intimidation of everyone else . "
One widely - reported stalking incident occurred last June , when an O'Reilly producer ambushed veteran journalist Bill Moyers at the National Conference on Media Reform and demanded to know why he would n't appear on O'Reilly 's program , telling him , " You like to beat up on producers instead of answering questions from tough journalists like Bill O'Reilly . "
In October 2007 , MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann reported that O'Reilly had responded to Olbermann 's coverage of his racist remarks after visiting a black restaurant " by threatening to ' come after , hunt down ' all those who criticized him . "
" Mr. O'Reilly 's reference to hunting you down and coming after you is a dead giveaway that he plans another onslaught of attacks by his stalker producers , " Olbermann noted .
He illustrated the point with video of O'Reilly 's people approaching NBC military analyst Bill Arkin in a store parking lot and asking him , " How could you say what you said ?
Do n't you think that was really hurtful and harmful to the military families ? "
Olbermann 's conclusion was that the best was to respond in such a situation was to " fight fire with fire " by reciting references to particularly embarrassing incident in O'Reilly 's own past .
" Repeat them in any combination , " he suggested , " intelligible or not , and you will be safe when the O'Reillyist attack inevitably comes . "

WASHINGTON , March 30 ( Reuters ) - Reform of the U.S. healthcare system is vital this year because of growing costs and worsening care , the Health and Human Services Department said in a report on Monday .
The HHS report , published at www.healthreform.gov, compiles findings of dozens of studies that have been used to justify calls for a complete overhaul of the healthcare system .
While the need for change is not controversial , conservatives and liberals differ on how that should be approached .
President Barack Obama has said he wants legislation this year but is leaving the details up to Congress to work out .
“ Today ’s report outlines the high cost of waiting to fix a system that has left too many Americans without the affordable , quality care they deserve , ” HHS spokeswoman Jenny Backus said in a statement .
The report points out that the United States spent $ 2.2 trillion on healthcare in 2007 , or $ 7,421 per capita .
Healthcare accounts for more than 16 percent of gross domestic product , nearly twice the average of other developed nations .
Healthcare costs doubled from 1996 to 2006 , and are projected to rise to 25 percent of GDP in 2025 ; 49 percent by 2082 if something does not change .
“ Employer - sponsored health insurance premiums have more than doubled in the last nine years , ” the report reads .
“ As a result of these crushing health care costs , American businesses are losing their ability to compete in the global marketplace . ”
More than 160 million Americans get health insurance through employers .
" Health care at General Motors puts the company at a $ 5 billion disadvantage against Toyota 7203.T , which spends $ 1,400 less on health care per vehicle , " the report added -- quoting former General Motors Corp 's GM.N chief executive officer Rick Wagoner .
[ ID :nSP207882 ]
“ In spite of the vast resources invested , the health care system has not yet reached the goal of high - quality care , ” the report said .
“ Across 37 performance indicators , the United States achieved an overall score of 65 out of a possible 100 , ” it said , citing the non-profit Commonwealth Foundation .
The Obama administration has relied heavily on such reports in setting its healthcare strategy .

California jobless rate climbs to 10.5 percent THE ECONOMY IN TURMOIL
Randell Haile uses the free computers at the Emploment Development Department to look for a job on Friday , March 20 , 2009 in San Francisco .
The state unemployment rate jumped to 10.5 percent in February , a level not seen since 1983 , as employers cut 116,000 payroll jobs in an economic slide that has left 1.95 million Californians out of work .

The state unemployment rate jumped to 10.5 percent in February , a level not seen since 1983 .
All told , the recent economic slide has left 1.95 million Californians scrambling for work .
Friday 's report from the Employment Development Department charts a sharp rise from January 's 10.1 percent rate and brings the state closer to its modern peak of 11 percent , which occurred in late 1982 and early 1983 .
The U.S. unemployment rate for February was 8.1 percent .
During the Great Depression , unemployment got as high as 25 percent .
" What we 're seeing now is not a depression , it 's not the end of the world , it 's a normal bad recession , " said Chris Thornberg with San Rafael 's Beacon Economics .
Stephen Levy , with Palo Alto's Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy , compared the current situation to the long and painful 1980s recession .
" I think this will be a little bit deeper and a little bit longer than the 1982 - 83 recession , " he said .
Back then , unemployment remained above 10 percent for a year and briefly hit 11 percent .
This time Levy said unemployment probably will break 11 percent and stay there for months , until the housing market hits bottom and starts to recover , healing the state 's biggest economic wound .
But there was no sign of healing in Friday 's figures as employers cut 116,000 payroll jobs statewide in February .
" Usually , a very bad month for California is to lose 20,000 to 30,000 jobs , " said former EDD commissioner Michael Bernick , now a San Francisco attorney .
Statewide , payroll employment has shrunk 4 percent since February 2008 , with nearly 606,000 jobs vanishing .
Virtually every industry in the state has lost jobs on an annual basis , the big exception being health and education services , where payrolls have grown 1.8 percent .
But construction employment has plunged 18.5 percent in 12 months .
Manufacturing is down 6.2 percent on an annual basis .
Employment in professional and business services is off 4.5 percent while leisure and hospitality payrolls are down 2.8 percent .
Friday 's report shows that the Bay Area continues to fare slightly better than the state .
But there was considerable variation among the region 's three major metropolitan areas and all three zones saw the job market deteriorate .
Metropolitan San Francisco , consisting of San Francisco , San Mateo and Marin counties , had a jobless rate of 7.8 percent in February , better than the state or the nation .
This three - county area has been less afflicted by the housing bust and buoyed by a concentration of jobs in tourism , business services , high - tech and other sectors with fewer payroll losses .
Metropolitan San Jose , made up of Santa Clara and San Benito counties , had the worst rate in the region at 10 percent .
Levy blamed San Jose 's jobless rate on a jump in the size of the labor force , as more people went looking for work even as jobs were getting harder to find .
The South Bay has lost thousands of jobs in business services and retail .
In the Oakland metropolitan area , made up of Alameda and Contra Costa counties , unemployment stood at 9.6 percent in February .
The two East Bay counties have been hit particularly hard by losses in construction , down 9,900 jobs since last year , and retail trade , where payrolls have shrunk by 7,100 on a year - over - year basis .
First , let us look at the stats of bankruptcies for the last two years :
Bankruptcy is normally the rock bottom financial point for companies but also individuals and in 2008 we saw a steady rise in people filing .
For many bankruptcy is a fresh start even though the connotation of filing may make many people weary about going down the path .
In recent years , filing bankruptcy has become harder in part because of tougher legislation but there is only so much you can do when someone is unable to meet their financial obligations .
This week we saw that General Motors and Chrysler were given a timeline by the government before they would enter into a pre-packaged or structured bankruptcy .
First , let us look at the stats of bankruptcies for the last two years :
In September of 2008 we broke the 1,000,000 mark for bankruptcy filings over a 12 - month period .
This number has been steadily increasing and we can expect to see more filings in 2009 .
Even though many will look at unemployment as a lagging indicator regarding the health of the economy , a family that is teetering on the financial edge will not have much room to breath and a job loss is normally the tipping point .
With over 5 million jobs lost since the start of the recession , many of the job losses are occurring only in the last four months , we can expect that bankruptcies will begin skyrocketing in the summer and fall of this year .
Another major trend we are seeing is many are opting to go with Chapter 7 bankruptcies , which are liquidations .
Take a look at the recent rise :
Now why would this be such a big deal ?
Well first , Chapter 13 is normally regarded as a “ wage earners ” bankruptcy where a plan is restructured and debts are modified to help make the payments more manageable .
Yet how are all those people that are now unemployed going to make a mortgage payment ?
In other markets , the lag time in finding another job was relatively short if the economy was robust .
Now , you have 4 people competing for every 1 job position that opens up .
The rise in Chapter 7 in relation to Chapter 13 tells us many people are simply unable to make their payments even if a plan is restructured .
Now this makes complete sense on a micro level .
If a person over extended their financial commitments when credit was easily accessible and now has lost their job , they may no longer be able to meet their financial obligations .
For example , say a person purchased a home at the peak with an adjustable rate mortgage with very little down , this person may have had problems even if they still had their job .
Add unemployment into the mix and it is a recipe for financial disaster .
This would even be the case with a traditional mortgage and we are now seeing this with the rise of defaults in prime mortgages .
You may be wondering why in 2004 and 2005 filings spiked up .
During this time legislation was being pushed to make it harder on people to file for bankruptcy .
One of the provisions looked at median income of the state in relation to the debt .
That is , if you were working you had to rework some sort of payment plan .
That is why you still see that Chapter 13 although not as high as Chapter 7 , is now reaching levels that are close to 2004 and 2005 .
Now looking at bankruptcy filings may be a good indicator of the overall health of the economy .
Some are looking at the stock market but employment and bankruptcies provide a better sense of how the average family is feeling this recession .
We should keep our eye on this quarterly filing since it will be a good place to see when things will be bottoming out for the average consumer .
I receive many questions about using an IDE to build VLC .
Usually , the answer is VIM .
But I will try to introduce something else today .
Needs
Yeah , VIM is TEH awesome , but sometimes we would like more .
But usually , more is slow , incomplete and boring ...
Would you want an editor with :
VIM syntax and command ,
Completion that is faster than the one from Eclipse
Git inclusion
Does n't eat all your RAM
Debuggueur and step - by - step + breakpoints integration like MSVC ?
I guess so !
Believe it or not , there is a solution : QtCreator from Nokia / QtSoftware that I have tested to work with VLC .
Even if you do n't think this will be useful for you , at least read in diagonale the following post .
Installation
Take QtCreator 1.1 ( do n't take older versions , they wo n't fit for VLC , or the VIM part will suck ... )
`apt - get install qtcreator` in Debian / Sid
Take Qt4.5.1 ( I mean it , Qt 4.5.0 is buggy ! )
Setup
General Setup
Run QtCreator and launch Tools - > options Activate FakeVim and set ShiftWidth to 4 Text Editor -> Behaviour , set Tab size at 4 Text Editor -> Display , enable Text Wrapping and display right margin , and if you like Alexis ' vim , Visualize whitespace Text Editor , change the colour schemes to match you old editor
Save options .
VLC Setup
For the example , I assume that you build your vlc in a " build " subdir of the source ( as xtophe usually gives advice )
* File -> New Select ' Import of Makefile - based Project ' - Project Name ' VLC ' Location '/ home/you/vlc ' and Choose , Next -
Let it process ...
It should take around 1 minute Finish .
EXIT QtCreator ... I MEAN it .
Setup Indexation
QtCreator will have done VLC .
includes VLC.creator , VLC.files and a VLC . config in your vlc/ folder .
Overwrite the VLC.includes and the VLC. files with the one you can find :
Doing this will gain you some time .
Those could be auto - generated one day , I guess ...
Setup Build
Relaunch QtCreator
Select Projects ( on the left ) and select VLC on the list
Build Settings , Change Build directory to / home / you / vlc / build , using browse
Run Settings ,
Add a custom Executable with the blue '+'
Name it VLC , browse to / home / you / vlc / build /vlc for Executable Put - Iqt in Arguments
Click on Edit on the left .
You should see VLC with most useful files .
Build VLC and launch it .
In the Menu , Build and Build All , you should see the Compilation output on the bottom ( or by clicking on the left build progressbar )
In the same menu , Build and Run it , and VLC will launch directly , outputting everything in the Application output .
Cool .
But that was just a minimum ...
Using it like VIM : Good !
Open modules / codec / avcodec / audio.c from the file browser and see ...
You are using VIM commands to control .
You have Visual , Edit and all usual VIM modes !
Completion is triggered with Ctrl + Space and will give you a list .
If there is no ambiguition , it is filled .
. and -> triggers the list of the members of the struct or the class by default .
After function completions , it will give the type of the arguments .
F2 will give you access to the function definition where your mouse is .
Debugging it : awesome !
You can put breakpoints in the margins near the line numbers .
( Like in modules / gui/qt4/main_interface.cpp:100 and 108 )
Now re run it using debug running .
It will stop at your breakpoint and you will have the function call lists ( and line numbers ) but also pointers values ( like p_intf , and this in main_interface.
cpp )
You can , of course Step In , Step Into and Step Out , resume or stop the code
More coolness :
Locate
Use the locate search box to find quick declarations : 'm vlc_object_act ' will help you to go quickly to the method declaration , etc ...
Git
Use the Git menu to checkout from within QtCreator .
Nota Bene
The indexing should n't be too long , but could be a bit longer the first time you launch the project !
Have fun !
Seriously , is there anything a laser can't do ?
A team of mad scientists in Washington have concocted a system that could essentially eliminate malaria - carrying mosquitoes with lasers , and the whole thing can be built from parts sourced on eBay .
The so - called mosquito laser is credited to an idea from Lowell Wood , an astrophysicist who worked with Edward Teller , the " architect of the original plan to use lasers to shield America from the rain of Soviet nuclear arms . "
In theory , at least , the technology could one day be used to draw a laser barrier of sorts around a village .
Of course , the trick is to make the lasers powerful enough to smoke the bugs without harming humans -- any of you Earthlings up for a clinical trial or two ? [ Via eHow
By Reva Bhalla , Lauren Goodrich and Peter Zeihan Russian President Dmitri Medvedev reportedly will travel to Turkey in the near future to follow up a recent four - day visit by his Turkish counterpart , Abdullah Gul , to Moscow .
The Turks and the Russians certainly have much to discuss .
Russia is moving aggressively to extend its influence throughout the former Soviet empire , while Turkey is rousing itself from 90 years of post -Ottoman isolation .
Both are clearly ascendant powers , and it would seem logical that the more the two bump up against one other , the more likely they will gird for yet another round in their centuries - old conflict .
But while that may be true down the line , the two Eurasian powers have sufficient strategic incentives to work together for now .
Russia 's World Russia is among the world 's most strategically vulnerable states .
Its core , the Moscow region , boasts no geographic barriers to invasion .
Russia must thus expand its borders to create the largest possible buffer for its core , which requires forcibly incorporating legions of minorities who do not see themselves as Russian .
The Russian government estimates that about 80 percent of Russia 's approximately 140 million people are actually ethnically Russian , but this number is somewhat suspect , as many minorities define themselves based on their use of the Russian language , just as many Hispanics in the United States define themselves by their use of English as their primary language .
Thus , ironically , attaining security by creating a strategic buffer creates a new chronic security problem in the form of new populations hostile to Moscow 's rule .
The need to deal with the latter problem explains the development of Russia 's elite intelligence services , which are primarily designed for and tasked with monitoring the country 's multiethnic population .
( click image to enlarge ) Russia 's primary challenge , however , is time .
In the aftermath of the Soviet collapse , the bottom fell out of the Russian birthrate , with fewer than half the number of babies born in the 1990s than were born in the 1980s .
These post -Cold War children are now coming of age ; in a few years , their small numbers are going to have a catastrophic impact on the size of the Russian population .
By contrast , most non-Russian minorities — in particular those such as Chechens and Dagestanis , who are of Muslim faith — did not suffer from the 1990s birthrate plunge , so their numbers are rapidly increasing even as the number of ethnic Russians is rapidly decreasing .
Add in deep - rooted , demographic - impacting problems such as HIV , tuberculosis and heroin abuse — concentrated not just among ethnic Russians but also among those of childbearing age — and Russia faces a hard - wired demographic time bomb .
Put simply , Russia is an ascending power in the short run , but it is a declining power in the long run .
The Russian leadership is well aware of this coming crisis , and knows it is going to need every scrap of strength it can muster just to continue the struggle to keep Russia in one piece .
To this end , Moscow must do everything it can now to secure buffers against external intrusion in the not - so - distant future .
For the most part , this means rolling back Western influence wherever and whenever possible , and impressing upon states that would prefer integration into the West that their fates lie with Russia instead .
Moscow 's natural gas crisis with Ukraine , August 2008 war with Georgia , efforts to eject American forces from Central Asia and constant pressure on the Baltic states all represent efforts to buy Russia more space — and with that space , more time for survival .
Expanding its buffer against such a diverse and potentially hostile collection of states is no small order , but Russia does have one major advantage :
The security guarantor for nearly all of these countries is the United States , and the United States is currently very busy elsewhere .
So long as U.S. ground forces are occupied with the Iraqi and Afghan wars , the Americans will not be riding to the rescue of the states on Russia 's periphery .
Given this window of opportunity , the Russians have a fair chance to regain the relative security they seek .
In light of the impending demographic catastrophe and the present window of opportunity , the Russians are in quite a hurry to act .
Turkey 's World Turkey is in many ways the polar opposite of Russia .
After the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire following World War I , Turkey was pared down to its core , Asia Minor .
Within this refuge , Turkey is nearly unassailable .
It is surrounded by water on three sides , commands the only maritime connection between the Black and Mediterranean seas and sits astride a plateau surrounded by mountains .
This is a very difficult chunk of territory to conquer .
Indeed , beginning in the Seljuk Age in the 11th century , the ancestors of the modern Turks took the better part of three centuries to seize this territory from its previous occupant , the Byzantine Empire .
The Turks have used much of the time since then to consolidate their position such that , as an ethnicity , they reign supreme in their realm .
The Persians and Arabs have long since lost their footholds in Anatolia , while the Armenians were finally expelled in the dying days of World War I .
Only the Kurds remain , and they do not pose a demographic challenge to the Turks .
While Turkey exhibits many of the same demographic tendencies as other advanced developing states — namely , slowing birthrates and a steadily aging population — there is no major discrepancy between Turk and Kurdish birthrates , so the Turks should continue to comprise more than 80 percent of the country 's population for some time to come .
Thus , while the Kurds will continue to be a source of nationalistic friction , they do not constitute a fundamental challenge to the power or operations of the Turkish state , like minorities in Russia are destined to do in the years ahead .
Turkey 's security is not limited to its core lands .
Once one moves beyond the borders of modern Turkey , the existential threats the state faced in years past have largely melted away .
During the Cold War , Turkey was locked into the NATO structure to protect itself from Soviet power .
But now the Soviet Union is gone , and the Balkans and Caucasus — both former Ottoman provinces — are again available for manipulation .
The Arabs have not posed a threat to Anatolia in nearly a millennium , and any contest between Turkey and Iran is clearly a battle of unequals in which the Turks hold most of the cards .
If anything , the Arabs — who view Iran as a hostile power with not only a heretical religion but also with a revolutionary foreign policy calling for the overthrow of most of the Arab regimes — are practically welcoming the Turks back .
Despite both its imperial past and its close security association with the Americans , the Arabs see Turkey as a trusted mediator , and even an exemplar .
With the disappearance of the threats of yesteryear , many of the things that once held Turkey 's undivided attention have become less important to Ankara .
With the Soviet threat gone , NATO is no longer critical .
With new markets opening up in the former Soviet Union , Turkey 's obsession with seeking EU membership has faded to a mere passing interest .
Turkey has become a free agent , bound by very few relationships or restrictions , but dabbling in events throughout its entire periphery .
Unlike Russia , which feels it needs an empire to survive , Turkey is flirting with the idea of an empire simply because it can — and the costs of exploring the option are negligible .
Whereas Russia is a state facing a clear series of threats in a very short time frame , Turkey is a state facing a veritable smorgasbord of strategic options under no time pressure whatsoever .
Within that disconnect lies the road forward for the two states — and it is a road with surprisingly few clashes ahead in the near term .
The Field of Competition
There are four zones of overlapping interest for the Turks and Russians .
First , the end of the Soviet empire opened up a wealth of economic opportunities , but very few states have proven adept at penetrating the consumer markets of Ukraine and Russia .
Somewhat surprisingly , Turkey is one of those few states .
Thanks to the legacy of Soviet central planning , Russian and Ukrainian industry have found it difficult to retool away from heavy industry to produce the consumer goods much in demand in their markets .
Because most Ukrainians and Russians cannot afford Western goods ,
Turkey has carved out a robust and lasting niche with its lower - cost exports ; it is now the largest supplier of imports to the Russian market .
While this is no exercise in hard power , this Turkish penetration nevertheless is cause for much concern among Russian authorities .
So far , Turkey has been scrupulous about not politicizing these useful trade links beyond some intelligence - gathering efforts ( particularly in Ukraine ) .
Considering Russia 's current financial problems , having a stable source of consumer goods — especially one that is not China — is actually seen as a positive .
At least for now , the Russian government would rather see its trade relationship with Turkey stay strong .
There will certainly be a clash later — either as Russia weakens or as Turkey becomes more ambitious — but for now , the Russians are content with the trade relationship .
Second , the Russian retreat in the post - Cold War era has opened up the Balkans to Turkish influence .
Romania , Bulgaria and the lands of the former Yugoslavia are all former Ottoman possessions , and in their day they formed the most advanced portion of the Ottoman economy .
During the Cold War , they were all part of the Communist world , with Romania and Bulgaria formally incorporated into the Soviet bloc .
While most of these lands are now absorbed into the European Union , Russia 's ties to its fellow Slavs — most notably the Serbs and Bulgarians — have allowed it a degree of influence that most Europeans choose to ignore .
Additionally , Russia has long held a friendly relationship with Greece and Cyprus , both to complicate American policy in Europe and to provide a flank against Turkey .
Still , thanks to proximity and trading links , Turkey clearly holds the upper hand in this theater of competition .
But this particular region is unlikely to generate much Turkish - Russian animosity , simply because both countries are in the process of giving up .
Most of the Balkan states are already members of an organization that is unlikely to ever admit Russia or Turkey : the European Union .
Russia simply cannot meet the membership criteria , and Cyprus ' membership in essence strikes the possibility of Turkish inclusion .
( Any EU member can veto the admission of would - be members . )
The EU - led splitting of Kosovo from Serbia over Russian objections was a body blow to Russian power in the region , and the subsequent EU running of Kosovo as a protectorate greatly limited Turkish influence as well .
Continuing EU expansion means that Turkish influence in the Balkans will shrivel just as Russian influence already has .
Trouble this way lies , but not between Turkey and Russia .
If anything , their joint exclusion might provide some room for the two to agree on something .
The third area for Russian - Turkish competition is in energy , and this is where things get particularly sticky .
Russia is Turkey 's No. 1 trading partner , with energy accounting for the bulk of the trade volume between the two countries .
Turkey depends on Russia for 65 percent of its natural gas and 40 percent of its oil imports .
Though Turkey has steadily grown its trade relationship with Russia , it does not exactly approve of Moscow 's penchant for using its energy relations with Europe as a political weapon .
Russia has never gone so far as to cut supplies to Turkey directly , but Turkey has been indirectly affected more than once when Russia decided to cut supplies to Ukraine because Moscow felt the need to reassert its writ in Kiev.
Sharing the Turks ' energy anxiety , the Europeans have been more than eager to use Turkey as an energy transit hub for routes that would bypass the Russians altogether in supplying the European market .
The Baku - Tbilisi - Ceyhan ( BTC ) pipeline is one such route , and others , like Nabucco , are still stuck in the planning stages .
The Russians have every reason to pressure the Turks into staying far away from any more energy diversification schemes that could cost Russia one of its biggest energy clients — and deny Moscow much of the political leverage it currently holds over the Europeans who are dependent on the Russian energy network .
There are only two options for the Turks in diversifying away from the Russians .
The first lies to Turkey 's south in Iraq and Iran .
Turkey has big plans for Iraq 's oil industry , but it will still take considerable time to upgrade and restore the oil fields and pipelines that have been persistently sabotaged and ransacked by insurgents during the fighting that followed the 2003 U.S. invasion .
The Iranians offer another large source of energy for the Turks to tap into , but the political complications attached to dealing with Iran are still too prickly for the Turks to move ahead with concrete energy deals at this time .
Complications remain for now , but Turkey will be keeping an eye on its Middle Eastern neighbors for robust energy partnerships in the future .
The second potential source of energy for the Turks lies in Central Asia , a region that Russia must keep in its grip at all costs if it hopes to survive in the long run .
In many ways this theater is the reverse of the Balkans , where the Russians hold the ethnic links and the Turks the economic advantage .
Here , four of the five Central Asian countries — Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan , Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan — are Turkic .
But as a consequence of the Soviet years , the infrastructure and economies of all four are so hardwired into the Russian sphere of influence that it would take some major surgery to liberate them .
But the prize is a rich one : Central Asia possesses the world 's largest concentration of untapped energy reserves .
And as the term " central " implies , whoever controls the region can project power into the former Soviet Union , China and South Asia .
If the Russians and Turks are going to fight over something , this is it .
Here Turkey faces a problem , however — it does not directly abut the region .
If the Turks are even going to attempt to shift the Central Asian balance of power , they will need a lever .
This brings us to the final — and most dynamic — realm of competition : the Caucasus .
Turkey here faces the best and worst in terms of influence projection .
The Azerbaijanis do not consider themselves simply Turkic , like the Central Asians , but actually Turkish .
If there is a country in the former Soviet Union that would consider not only allying with but actually joining with another state to escape Russia 's orbit , it would be Azerbaijan with Turkey .
Azerbaijan has its own significant energy supplies , but its real value is in serving as a willing springboard for Turkish influence into Central Asia .
However , the core of Azerbaijan does not border Turkey .
Instead , it is on the other side of Armenia , a country that thrashed Azerbaijan in a war over the disputed Nagorno - Karabakh enclave and still has deep historical bitterness against the Turks over claims of genocide .
Armenia has sold itself to the Russians to keep its Turkish foes at bay .
This means Turkish designs on Central Asia all boil down to the former Soviet state of Georgia .
If Turkey can bring Georgia fully under its wing , Turkey can then set about to integrate with Azerbaijan and project influence into Central Asia .
But without Georgia , Turkey is hamstrung before it can even begin to reach for the real prize in Central Asia .
In this , the Turks do not see the Georgians as much help .
The Georgians do not have much in the way of a functional economy or military , and they have consistently overplayed their hand with the Russians in the hopes that the West would come to their aid .
Such miscalculations contributed to the August 2008 Georgian - Russian war , in which Russia smashed what military capacity the Georgians did possess .
So while Ankara sees the Georgians as reliably anti-Russian , it does not see them as reliably competent or capable .
This means that Turkish - Russian competition may have been short - circuited before it even began .
Meanwhile , the Americans and Russians are beginning to outline the rudiments of a deal .
Various items on the table include Russia allowing the Americans to ship military supplies to Afghanistan via Russia 's sphere of influence , changes to the U.S. ballistic missile defense ( BMD ) program , and a halt to NATO expansion .
The last prong is a critical piece of Russian - Turkish competition .
Should the Americans and Europeans put their weight behind NATO expansion , Georgia would be a logical candidate — meaning most of the heavy lifting in terms of Turkey projecting power eastward would already be done .
But if the Americans and Europeans do not put their weight behind NATO expansion , Georgia would fall by the wayside and Turkey would have to do all the work of projecting power eastward — and facing the Russians — alone .
A Temporary Meeting of Minds ?
There is clearly no shortage of friction points between the Turks and the Russians .
With the two powers on a resurgent path , it was only a matter of time before they started bumping into one another .
The most notable clash occurred when the Russians decided to invade Georgia last August , knowing full well that neither the Americans nor the Europeans would have the will or capability to intervene on behalf of the small Caucasian state .
NATO 's strongest response was a symbolic show of force that relied on Turkey , as the gatekeeper to the Black Sea , to allow a buildup of NATO vessels near the Georgian coast and threaten the underbelly of Russia 's former Soviet periphery .
Turkey disapproved of the idea of Russian troops bearing down in the Caucasus near the Turkish border , and Ankara was also angered by having its energy revenues cut off during the war when the BTC pipeline was taken offline .
The Russians promptly responded to Turkey 's NATO maneuvers in the Black Sea by holding up a large amount of Turkish goods at various Russian border checkpoints to put the squeeze on Turkish exports .
But the standoff was short - lived ; soon enough , the Turks and Russians came to the negotiating table to end the trade spat and sort out their respective spheres of influence .
The Russian - Turkish negotiations have progressed over the past several months , with Russian and Turkish leaders now meeting fairly regularly to sort out the issues where both can find some mutual benefit .
The first area of cooperation is Europe , where both Russia and Turkey have an interest in applying political pressure .
Despite Europe 's objections and rejections , the Turks are persistent in their ambitions to become a member of the European Union .
At the same time , the Russians need to keep Europe linked into the Russian energy network and divided over any plans for BMD , NATO expansion or any other Western plan that threatens Russian national security .
As long as Turkey stalls on any European energy diversification projects , the more it can demand Europe 's attention on the issue of EU membership .
In fact , the Turks already threatened as much at the start of the year , when they said outright that if Europe does n't need Turkey as an EU member , then Turkey does n't need to sign off on any more energy diversification projects that transit Turkish territory .
Ankara 's threats against Europe dovetailed nicely with Russia 's natural gas cutoff to Ukraine in January , when the Europeans once again were reminded of Moscow 's energy wrath .
The Turks and the Russians also can find common ground in the Middle East .
Turkey is again expanding its influence deep into its Middle Eastern backyard , and Ankara expects to take the lead in handling the thorny issues of Iran , Iraq and Syria as the United States draws down its presence in the region and shifts its focus to Afghanistan .
What the Turks want right now is stability on their southern flank .
That means keeping Russia out of mischief in places like Iran , where Moscow has threatened to sell strategic S - 300 air defense systems and to boost the Iranian nuclear program in order to grab Washington 's attention on other issues deemed vital to Moscow 's national security interests .
The United States is already leaning on Russia to pressure Iran in return for other strategic concessions , and the Turks are just as interested as the Americans in taming Russia 's actions in the Middle East .
Armenia is another issue where Russia and Turkey may be having a temporary meeting of minds .
Russia unofficially occupies Armenia and has been building up a substantial military presence in the small Caucasian state .
Turkey can either sit back , continue to isolate Armenia and leave it for the Russians to dominate through and through , or it can move toward normalizing relations with Yerevan and dealing with Russia on more equal footing in the Caucasus .
With rumors flying of a deal on the horizon between Yerevan and Ankara ( likely with Russia 's blessing ) , it appears more and more that the Turks and the Russians are making progress in sorting out their respective spheres of influence .
Ultimately , both Russia and Turkey know that this relationship is likely temporary at best .
The two Eurasian powers still distrust each other and have divergent long - term goals , even if in the short term there is a small window of opportunity for Turkish and Russian interests to overlap .
The law of geopolitics dictates that the two ascendant powers are doomed to clash — just not today .
This is the first of a three - part essay on modern character string processing for computer programmers .
Here I explain and illustrate the methods for storing Unicode characters in byte sequences in computers , and discuss their advantages and disadvantages .
These methods have well - known names like UTF - 8 and UTF - 16 .
The next essay will consider string handling in the Java , and to a lesser extent C# , computer languages and argue that it is significantly broken , both in terms of efficiency and correctness .
The third essay will propose a new approach to string handling in Java .
I 've previously discussed Unicode , and recommended it enthusiastically as something that any modern programmer needs to be at least somewhat on top of .
Let 's assume that when you 're processing text , the characters you 're going to be processing are Unicode characters .
How do you store them in memory ?
This turns out to be more complicated than you 'd think , and can really matter to the programmer .
Before Unicode ·
In the early decades of our profession , much computing was centered in North American and done in English .
You stored your text in ASCII or EBCDIC characters , which were stored one - per - byte in memory , ASCII using 7 and EBCDIC 8 bits of each byte .
In other parts of the world , they invented their own systems for storing their own characters .
In Japan , these are various flavors of the “ JIS ” encoding , “ KOI8 ” for Russian , various “ ISCII ” standards for the languages of India , and so on .
I am told that at one time , there were more than twelve different systems in use for Chinese text in Taiwan alone .
For the huge number of people in America , Europe , and the Middle East who use relatively small alphabets , there was ISO - 8859 , parts 1 through 10 , which left ASCII as ASCII and used the range 128 through 255 for accented characters ( parts 1 through 4 ) , Cyrillic ( part 5 ) , Arabic ( 6 ) , Greek ( 7 ) , Hebrew ( 8 ) , and then more accented characters for Turkish and Nordic lanuages in parts 9 and 10 .
Of course , you could only be using one part at a time , so you could n't easily have Greek and Polish in the same sentence .
Finally , there were the proprietary encodings dreamed up by operating system makers such as Apple , and Microsoft with its “ code pages . ”
Clearly , this was an unsatisfactory situation .
A partial solution was provided by ISO 2022 , which allowed you to combine many different encodings , with “ shift sequences ” that allowed you to shift from one encoding to another in the middle of a string .
Until recently , when I got email with mangled headers from Asia , I 'd often see the letters “ ISO2022 ” in among the junk .
ISO2022 was difficult and irritating for programmers and few will miss it .
It 's important to note that pretty well all the characters from ASCII and EBCDIC and JIS and KOI8 and ISCII and Taiwan and ISO 8859 made it into Unicode .
So at one level , it 's reasonable to think of all these things as encodings of Unicode , if only of parts of Unicode .
XML blesses this approach , and allows you to encode XML text in any old encoding at all , but does n't provide a guarantee that software will be able to read anything but the standard Unicode UTF encodings , which we 'll discuss below .
The Characters in Unicode ·
As discussed in the previous article , Unicode characters are identified by number or “ code point ” , usually given in hexadecimal , so for example the Hebrew letter “ he ” is 5D4 , usually written U+05D4 .
Unicode currently defines just under 100,000 characters , but has space for 1,114,112 code points .
They are organized into 17 “ planes ” of 216 ( 65,536 ) characters , numbered 0 through 16 .
Plane 0 is called the “ Basic Multilingual Plane ” or BMP and contains pretty well everything useful .
In particular , it contains every character that had ever been available to a computer programmer before Unicode came along .
The characters in the BMP are dealt out more or less West to East , with the ASCII characters having their familiar ASCII values from 0 to 127 , the ISO - Latin - 1 characters retaining their values from 128 to 255 , and then ( ignoring special characters and math and so on ) moving East in Europe ( Greek , Cyrillic ) , on to the Middle East ( Arabic , Hebrew ) , across the Indus ( the scripts of India ) , through Southeast Asia ( Thai , Laotian and so on ) and ending up with the vast character sets from China , Japan , and Korea .
Past the BMP , planes 1 through 16 are sometimes humorously called the “ astral planes ” and are used for exotic , rare , and historically important characters .
A quick glance at the code charts shows a few examples : “ Old Italic , ” “ Deseret , ” and ” Byzantine Musical Symbols . ”
The Sixteen - Bit Illusion ·
In the early days of the Unicode consortium , there was some thought that Unicode would be a sixteen - bit design , and the notion of a “ 16 - bit Unicode character ” is still often encountered .
While this is notion is fundamentally wrong ( because of the extra material in the “ astral planes ” ) it 's hard to stamp out because it 's almost right .
I 've never had the need to deal with a character outside of the BMP , and such beasts are likely to remain rare at least in the near term .
I think , though , that hardwiring in sixteen - bit assumptions is silly and dangerous ; the history of computing contains many examples of these kinds of assumption , which turned out to be wrong .
Many people assumed that 16 bits of address space is all you 'd ever need , then repeated the error with 32 bits .
And let 's not forget the notion that you could store a year in two digits , because the software would never still be running when the year 2000 came around .
UTF · Along with the characters , Unicode also defines methods for storing them in byte sequences in a computer .
One of the nice things about the recent 4.0 release of Unicode ( I 'd enclose a pointer , but it 's only up at the Unicode site in draft form as of this writing , and might well be moving around ) is that they 've brought the descriptions of these techniques together in one place and organized them much better than before .
This would be Chapter 3 of the standard , in particular the part starting at section 3.8 .
There are three approaches , named UTF - 8 , UTF - 16 , and UTF - 32 .
“ UTF ” may be explained as standing for Unicode Transformation Format , or UCS Transformation format where “ UCS ” stands for Unicode Character Set .
I 'm going to use the four characters illustrated above as examples .
They are :
U+0026 AMPERSAND ( decimal 38 )
U+0416 CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER ZHE ( decimal 1,046 )
U+4E2D HAN IDEOGRAPH 4E2D ( decimal 20,013 )
U+10346 GOTHIC LETTER FAIHU ( decimal 66,374 )
Since the BMP has codepoints 0 through 65,535 ( 0 through FFFF hex ) , you can see that U+10346 is one of the astral - plane characters .
UTF - 32 · This is about the simplest imaginable way of storing characters .
As the name suggests , you use 32 bits or four bytes for each character .
So each of the example characters would be stored as a 4 - byte number with values 38 , 1046 , 20013 , and 66374 respectively .
This corresponds to the way most modern C compilers store characters when they are declared as wchar_t ( for example , on the Macintosh that I 'm using now ) .
On the other hand , if you 're an English - speaker like me and most of your characters are ASCII , you 're using 32 bits to store characters that could fit just fine into 8 , which seems extremely wasteful .
Also , the old fashioned C - language routines like strcpy , strcmp , and so on wo n't work with this because they go a byte at a time and there are lots of bytes filled with zeros .
Of course , there are equivalent routines that work with wchar_t rather than char arrays , but that 's quite possibly not what you 're using now .
It 's probably quite OK to use wchar_t characters in your programs if you can afford the memory overhead , but it may be unacceptably wasteful to use UTF - 32 to store them on disk or transmit them over the wire .
The Problem of Byte Order · Saying that a character is stored in a four - byte integer does n't quite solve the problem , because there are lots of ways to deal out 32 bits among four bytes ; programmers may recall learning about “ big- endian ” and “ little - endian ” integers back in college .
So if you send one of these four - byte quantities between two computers that have different ideas on how to deal out bytes , you can expect breakage .
Fortunately , Unicode also has a solution to this problem : the wonderful magic character “ U+FEFF ZERO WIDTH NO - BREAK SPACE ” , essentially a no - op .
The trick here ( one which XML uses , by the way ) is to lead off your message with one of these things .
If you have your byte order backward , it 'll show up as U+FFFE instead instead of U+FEFF .
And Unicode cleverly guarantees that U+FFFE will never be a character , so this is easily detectible .
The character , when used this way , is typically called a “ Byte Order Mark . ”
There 's another approach , too .
Unicode , along with UTF - 32 , also defines UTF - 32BE and UTF - 32LE ( for Big End and Little End ) which have a guaranteed byte ordering .
UTF - 16 · UTF - 16 stores Unicode characters in sixteen - bit chunks .
All the characters in the BMP appear as themselves , but clearly some trickery is going to be involved if you want to store astral - plane characters , because they just do n't fit in sixteen bits .
To handle this , Unicode has a trick called the “ Surrogate ” blocks .
There are two blocks of codepoints in the BMP , each 1,024 characters in size , the “ high ” surrogates starting at U+D800 and the “ low ” surrogates at U+DC00 .
These will never be used for ordinary characters .
You split astral - plane characters in two , using one of the low surrogates for the low ten bits , and the high surrogates for the high ten bits .
So U+10346 becomes encoded as two sixteen - bit quantities with values D800 and DF46 .
This gives you 220 characters , which just exactly fits the sixteen astral planes of 216 characters each .
I 'm skipping some detail here ( you have to subtract hex 10000 from the code - point before splitting into surrogates ) but it 's conceptually easy and quite straightforward for programmers to implement .
Also , when you look at a sixteen - bit quantity , you can tell right away whether it's an ordinary BMP character or half of an astral - plane character , and if so , which half .
Our first three example characters would be encoded naturally in sixteen bits , and the Gothic one in thirty - two bits via surrogates , as illustrated .
At one level , UTF - 16 hits an 80 - 20 point .
At another , it 's kind of kludgy and ugly , and is often summarized as “ characters in Unicode are sixteen bits , except when they 're not . ”
UTF - 16 potentially has a byte - ordering problem just like UTF - 32 , but the Byte Order Mark is there to help deal with that , and as you might expect , so are UTF - 16BE and UTF - 16LE .
UTF - 16 is probably what most people thought most programmers would use for Unicode ; this is reflected in the fact that the native character type in both Java and C# is a sixteen - bit quantity .
Of course , it does n't really represent a Unicode character , exactly ( although it does most times ) , it represents a UTF - 16 codepoint .
UTF - 16 is about the most efficient way possible of representing Asian character strings , each character nestling snugly into two bytes of storage .
For ASCII characters , of course , you end up using two bytes to represent what would actually fit into one .
Also , UTF - 16 is really irritating to deal with in C , since it's not the same size as wchar_t on most installations , but you still can't use strcpy and friends since lots of the bytes are zero .
UTF - 8 · UTF - 8 is a trick originally devised at Bell Labs as part of the “ Plan 9 ” attempt to build the successor to Unix .
It works like this : Characters whose value is less than 128 ( i.e. ASCII ) are encoded as themselves in one byte ; the high - order bit will always be zero .
( Which means that a pure ASCII text is actually UTF - 8 as it sits . )
The rest have their bits ripped apart and dealt out into several ( from two to four ) bytes as follows :
The first byte has a bunch of high - order one bits telling you how many bytes are used to encode the character , followed by a zero bit .
The rest of the bytes each begin with a single one bit followed by a zero bit .
The bits of the character are dealt out in the space left over after these signaling bits .
Suppose a character is encoded in two bytes .
Then the first byte has two one bits and a zero bit , leaving five bits of payload .
The second has a one , a zero , and six bits of payload .
Thus there are eleven bits of payload , and the biggest character that can squeeze into two bytes in UTF - 8 is U+07 FF , which is 11 ones .
In a three - byte encoding , the first byte has 4 signaling bits , so four bits of payload , and the remaining two each have six bits , so you get sixteen bits of payload .
This means that anything in the BMP fits into three bytes of UTF - 8 .
Let 's look at our examples :
U+0026 , the ampersand , appears in one byte as itself .
U+0416 , Cyrillic zhe , is two bytes ( in hex ) : D0 , 96 ( do the bit - twiddling , you 'll see ) .
U+4E2D , the Chinese character , is three bytes : E4 , B8 , AD .
U+10346 , from the astral plane , becomes four : F0 , 90 , 8D , 86 .
Is UTF - 8 a Racist Kludge or a Stroke of Genius ?
·
You may be forgiven for rolling your eyes at the details of UTF - 8 .
I certainly did , the first time I ran across it .
But actually , it turns out to have a lot of advantages , and only one really important disadvantage .
Let 's address the problem first : UTF - 8 is kind of racist .
It allows us round - eye paleface anglophone types to tuck our characters neatly into one byte , lets most people whose languages are headquartered west of the Indus river get away with two bytes per , and penalizes India and points east by requiring them to use three bytes per character .
This is a serious problem , but it 's not a technical problem .
All that bit - twiddling turns out to be easy to implement in very efficient code ; I 've done it a few times , basically reading the rules and composing all the shifts and masks and so on , and gotten it pretty well right first time , each time .
In fact , processing UTF - 8 characters sequentially is about as efficient , for practical purposes , as any other encoding .
There is one exception : you can't easily index into a buffer .
If you need the 27th character , you 're going to have to run through the previous twenty - six characters to figure out where it starts .
Of course , UTF - 16 has this problem too , unless you 're willing to bet your future on never having to use astral - plane characters and pretend that Unicode characters are 16 bits , which they are ( except when they 're not ) .
This may sound like a big deal , but in practice it does n't seem to be .
I 've been writing mostly text - processing code for a living for decades , and the number of times when I need to index into a buffer that 's big enough that I can't afford to count characters is really small .
And there are intermediate measures such as building an array of the position of each character , or each tenth character , or some such .
UTF - 8 also has the advantage that null - termination , and all the old routines like strcpy , strncpy and their friends , which in practice are insanely efficient in terms of space and time , work just fine .
Finally , UTF - 8 also has the advantage that the unit of encoding is the byte , so there are no byte - ordering issues .
This can cause a minor problem when you convert from UTF - 16 or - 32 and there 's a now - useless Byte Order Mark at the front of the text , but this , as I said , is not major .
By the way , the text you are reading right now is UTF - 8 , as is all text from ongoing .
If it 's not already obvious , I like UTF - 8 a lot , and think it 's the best approach for quite a few programming situations .
There 's that space penalty for East Asian texts , but in these days of 100 MB / minute video files , it 's quite possible the 50 % overhead for text will vanish in the static .
The Almost - ASCII Gotcha ·
One common problem that people ( particularly in North America ) get into is to look at their text , see a bunch of ASCII characters , and think “ Oh , I can just pretend this is UTF - 8 . ”
This sometimes works , but unfortunately there 's not that much pure ASCII left in the world .
If there 's even one é or smart quotation mark ( “ instead of " ) in your text , it 's probably encoded in ISO - 8859 or some Microsoft code page , and will seriously confuse software that thinks it 's reading UTF - 8 , including most XML software .
Conclusions ·
There are Unicode and non-Unicode ways of storing your Unicode characters .
In general , you 're better off using the Unicode ways , because they 're designed to not break no matter what kind of characters you throw at them , and there 's better support from XML processors .
None of the three UTF approaches ( - 32 , - 16 , - 8 ) are really better than any of the others .
UTF - 8 works better with traditional C programming practice , while Java and C# share a sort - of - UTF - 16 culture .
I think there are real problems with the Java / C# approach , which I 'll discuss next time , but for everyday work that does n't have huge text - processing requirements , they get the job done well enough .
The good news is that all of these are well - specified in one place in the Unicode documentation , and if you have to write code to deal with them , it 's just not that hard .
