SAN FRANCISCO — Click .
With the highest court in the land holding the remote control , any broadcast of the historic trial of the legal challenge to California ’s ban on same - sex marriage just got shut off for good .
The U.S. Supreme Court , sharply divided along its usual conservative - liberal lines , on Wednesday banned the broadcast of the Proposition 8 trial now unfolding in the federal courthouse here , putting a swift end to Chief U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker ’s planned experiment to post the proceedings on his court ’s Web site through YouTube .
Walker , at the conclusion of Wednesday ’s trial proceedings , sent some signals that there may be broadcast issues yet to be resolved , but even disappointed same - sex marriage backers appeared ready to move on with the central fight over the challenge to the 2008 voter - approved ban on gay nuptials .
“ We want to keep the focus on proving our case , winning our case , ” said plaintiffs ’ attorney Theodore Boutrous Jr. , who called the trial “ ideal ” for public broadcast .
While the ruling stressed that it was not “ expressing any view on whether such trials should be broadcast , ” it signaled the Supreme Court is not quite ready to embrace cameras in the federal courts , which traditionally have forbid them .
The majority concluded that Walker did not follow proper procedures that would have allowed a change in federal court rules to permit cameras in the trial and that the broadcast threatened to harm the fair trial rights of Prop.
8 ’s defenders .
Justice Stephen Breyer , writing for the four dissenters , criticized the decision , saying there was no harm in broadcasting such an important trial .
Prop. 8 backers had challenged Walker ’s order allowing cameras in his courtroom , arguing a number of their witnesses feared they ’d be exposed to harassment and intimidation if their testimony were broadcast on the Internet .
Walker and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected those arguments , but the Supreme Court intervened , even blocking the simulcast of the trial to five other federal courthouses in San Francisco , Portland , Pasadena , Seattle and Brooklyn .
Meanwhile , the trial moved through its third day with the continued testimony of witnesses for the challengers to Prop. 8 , which restored California ’s ban on same - sex marriage .
Same - sex couples have sued to overturn the law , arguing that it violates the equal protection clause of the federal constitution by denying them the same right to marry as heterosexual couples .
There were some sparks during the testimony of Yale University historian George Chauncey , who had been called by the plaintiffs for his expertise on the history of discrimination against gays and lesbians .
But it had little to do with his testimony .
Instead , the plaintiffs ’ lawyers unveiled their first attack on the Prop.
8 campaign through the testimony of one of its leaders , William Tam , who was deposed in December .
A video of that testimony was played for Chauncey in an attempt to undercut the Prop. 8 lawyers ’ argument that discrimination against gays is diminishing over time .
In both statements and letters , Tam during the campaign equated allowing same - sex marriage to legalizing prostitution and underage sex and warned that allowing gay marriage would encourage youths to become gay , according to the videos of his testimony .
Same - sex marriage advocates plan to call Tam as a witness Friday , and he can be expected to be a reluctant witness .
Tam , who intervened to defend Prop. 8 in the federal court case , recently asked Walker to remove him as a defendant because of worries that gay marriage supporters would target him and his family ; the judge has not ruled on the issue .
The challenge to Prop. 8 rests in part on the argument that the law was motivated by bias and hostility against gays and lesbians , and the campaign will be a central feature of that argument .
Defense lawyers dispute that theory , saying the law was based on a desire to preserve traditional marriage .
The plaintiffs will resume their case today with testimony from Edmund Egan , San Francisco ’s chief economist , who is expected to testify on the costs to local governments of denying same - sex couples the right to marry .
The trial will also reveal another side of the gay marriage debate through the testimony of Helen Zia , a lesbian who married her partner before Prop. 8 went into effect .
The California Supreme Court last year refused to invalidate about 18,000 marriage licenses issued to same - sex couples before Prop. 8 was approved by the voters , and Zia is expected to testify on the difference in the lives of those couples .

Pittsburgh police have reassigned three plainclothes officers to uniformed duty pending an investigation into the beating of an 18 - year - old student .
A police report indicates that officers became interested in Jordan Miles when they suspected he had a gun in his coat .
After beating Miles in the head with a closed fist , the officers discovered the object was a Mountain Dew bottle .

Miles , a violinist and honor student who attends the prestigious Creative and Performing Arts High School , says he resisted arrest because he thought the men were trying to abduct him and did n’t identify themselves as police .
The student is black , and the three officers are white .
Police and the family ’s attorney are n’t commenting on whether race was a factor , according to the Associated Press .
Pittsburgh Tribune - Review reports , “ Miles suffered a swollen face , hair ripped from his scalp and a twig jabbed through his gum during the incident . ”
Elizabeth Pittinger of the Pittsburgh Citizen Police Review Board told KDKA , “ So we have a very real dispute , a very real controversy involving suspicion of misconduct on the part of the police officers so the test of that is to search for the truth . ”

Myleene Klass is stepping up security at her home TV presenter Myleene Klass has said she has " no regrets " after being warned by police for waving a knife at youths who entered her back garden .
The former pop star was in the kitchen when she spotted the teenagers and grabbed a knife and banged the windows in an effort to get them to leave .
She says Hertfordshire Police officers told her that brandishing an " offensive weapon " was illegal .
But a police spokeswoman said that " at no point " were any warnings given .
The 31 - year - old was at her Potters Bar home on Friday with her daughter upstairs when she spotted the youths peering into the house .
Klass said : " It was a scary incident but I 've got no regrets as to how I reacted .
I think I did what any other mother would do .
" This is my house and that 's my daughter up there and I will do anything to protect my daughter and my family .
That 's what I did . "
The star was speaking at the launch of new ITV1 series Popstar To Operastar - which features former chart stars as they try to make it as classical singers .
' Utmost respect ' Klass 's spokesman , Jonathan Shalit , told the Sunday Telegraph the singer had been " utterly terrified " and was stepping up security at her home .
" Myleene was aghast when she was told that the law did not allow her to defend herself at home , " he said .
" All she did was scream loudly and wave the knife to try and frighten them off .
" She is not looking to be a vigilante , and has the utmost respect for the law , but when the police explained to her that even if you 're at home alone and you have an intruder , you are not allowed to protect yourself , she was bemused . "
But a statement from Hertfordshire police said : " Officers spoke to reassure the home owner , talked through security and gave advice in relation to the importance of reporting suspicious activity immediately to allow officers to act appropriately . "
It added : " For clarification , at no point were any official warnings or words of advice given to the home owner in relation to the use of a knife or offensive weapon in their home . "
Mr Shalit could not immediately be reached for further comment .
Klass 's fiance Graham Quinn was away on business at the time of the scare , but the couple 's daughter was upstairs at the time the intruders were spotted .

There will be many new financial stories in 2010 but one that is certainly to garner much attention is the implosion of the commercial real estate market .
A $ 3.5 trillion market that has taken it on the chin alongside the residential real estate market .
The commercial real estate debacle usually follows a similar pattern .
Residential real estate pulls back followed by commercial real estate .
But in this massive decade long real estate bubble commercial real estate debt ballooned into uncharted territory .
The bust is going to be deep and has no parallel in history just like the housing bubble bursting .
Yet the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve have already had backroom talks about coming out with a “ Plan C ” to bailout this segment of the American economy .
Yet the commercial real estate bust reveals again the hypocritical nature of the banking industry .
Hank Paulson last year came out and stated that homeowners that walked away on their obligations were acting immorally .
Well Morgan Stanley just demonstrated not only that Wall Street is amoral but corrupt to the bone :
“ ( WSJ ) So we ’ve discussed the ethics of individual borrowers walking away from their mortgages .
( Some say we ’ve over - discussed it . )
If it ’s immoral , as some would say , for a borrower to walk away their mortgage , is it any different for a bank ?
Morgan Stanley is doing just that .
News reports on Thursday said the bank plans to give back five San Francisco office buildings to its lender - just two years after buying them at the top of the market .
“ This is n’t a default or foreclosure situation , ” spokeswoman Alyson Barnes told Bloomberg News .
“ We are going to give them the properties to get out of the loan obligation . ”
Sound familiar ?
Morgan Stanley bought the buildings , along with five others , in San Francisco ’s financial district as part of a $ 2.5 billion purchase from Blackstone Group in May 2007 .
The buildings were formerly owned by billionaire investor Sam Zell ’s Equity Office Properties and acquired by Blackstone in its $ 39 billion buyout of the real estate firm earlier that year , Bloomberg reports .
One analyst estimates that the buildings are now worth half of what Morgan Stanley paid . ”
And keep in mind that Morgan Stanley is raking in massive profits since the corporatocracy bailouts :
So they are making a conscious choice of walking away from their bad choice .
The problem with this of course is that the American taxpayer has bailed out this company that actually had a direct hand in creating massive amounts of mortgage backed securities that imploded the residential housing market .
Now , here they are moving away their commercial real estate obligations and wiping their hands of any responsibility .
Average Americans are getting the raw end of deal in so many of these banking bailouts .
The commercial real estate bailouts have no justification for the safety of our economy but hundreds of banks will implode because of local loans they made .
Yet bigger banks enjoy the safety of the U.S. government and their printing press .
Unlike the too big to fail banks smaller regional banks will fail in the upcoming year as they have in 2009 .
They made loans on local businesses that simply had no way of succeeding in a new austerity that demands people cut back .
The revised GDP number is down to 2.2 percent and without the government stimulus , the economy would still be contracting .
And those great retail sales ?
Where did they come from ?
The biggest jump came from gasoline stations .
As you might guess there is little need for commercial real estate in this segment of the economy .
So we are left with countless buildings that now sit empty while banks try to figure out their next step .
At least with homes , there will be a price point where homes sell .
Lower the price enough like some of the foreclosures and people will buy the property .
But in some commercial real estate buildings there is little demand for properties .
It is amazing that a bank like Morgan Stanley can simply walk away while having their industry chastise average Americans who even contemplate the idea of walking away .
The hypocrisy of the corporatocracy has reached a crescendo .
Of the $ 14 trillion in bailouts Wall Street received 87 percent of all the money :
The above is disturbing .
What we are seeing is that the banks are basically pushing all the downside of risk to average Americans while keeping any ill gotten profits .
They are rushing to payback TARP funds because they want to be unchanged so they can go back to gambling again .
So what if another crisis hits in a year or two ?
After all , the poor U.S. taxpayer will be robbed yet again .
What has changed ?
Nothing has changed .
These corporate friendly bailouts do n’t even reflect a healthy capitalist system .
This is socialism for the too big to fail .
The way the commercial real estate bust is handled will tell us a lot regarding our government and Wall Street .
However , given the continuous hypocrisy coming from Wall Street expect more sweetheart deals for these failed bets .
And as a holiday gift , the Congress voted to raise the debt ceiling :
“ ( ABC ) The Senate voted Thursday to raise the ceiling on the government debt to $ 12.4 trillion , a massive increase over the current limit and a political problem that President Barack Obama has promised to address next year .
The Senate ’s rare Christmas Eve vote , 60 - 39 , follows
House passage last week and raises the debt ceiling by $ 290 billion .
The vote split mainly down party lines , with Democrats voting to raise the limit and Republicans voting against doing so .
There was one defection on each side , by senators whose seats will be on the ballot next year : GOP Sen .
George Voinovich of Ohio and Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana . ”
Merry Christmas from your friendly Wall Street and Congress cronies .

State television was on hand to show the alleged rises in prices Government inspectors backed by soldiers have shut more than 70 shops in Venezuela accused of trying to cash in on last week 's currency devaluation .
Soldiers have been on the streets to check prices as people queue to buy imports , fearing prices could rise .
Devaluing the bolivar by at least 17 % will aid competition and cut reliance on imports , President Hugo Chavez says .
On Sunday he warned that businesses engaging in what he called speculation would be shut down or taken over .
As soon as trading started again after the president 's comments a series of supermarkets and other businesses across Venezuela were taken over by government tax inspectors .
State - run news agency ABN said food , car parts and other businesses were temporarily closed " for changing the price of products and for speculation " .
The National Guard stepped in at three superstores belonging to the Exito supermarket chain .
State television showed the alleged rises in prices on everything from plasma television screens to packets of cereal .
The bolivar 's official exchange rate , which is set by government decree , had been held steady at 2.15 to the US dollar since the last devaluation in March 2005 .
Chavez said the devaluation would limit unnecessary imports
But on Friday , President Chavez announced that it would now have two rates - 2.60 to dollar for " priority " imports , and 4.30 to the dollar for other items considered non-essential - a 50 % devaluation .
The BBC's Will Grant , in Venezuela , says that since the devaluation was announced long queues have formed outside outlets selling electronic goods and technology .
Customers fear that significant price rises are on their way .
Venezuela already has the highest rate of inflation in Latin America - currently at about 25 % .
President Chavez says that these measures will rein it in but many economic analysts predict that it will only get worse in the short term .
Oscar Meza , director of a Venezuelan economic think tank , Cendas , predicted the move would push annual inflation above 33 % .
' Irresponsible policy ' " It 's impossible for prices not to be adjusted , " he told the Associated Press .
" If they are n't adjusted , they 'll disappear . "
President Chavez dismissed the criticism on Sunday on his weekly television and radio programme , Alo Presidente , saying there was " no reason for anybody to be raising prices " .
He urged his supporters to " publicly denounce the speculator " and warned business owners that he had asked the military to formulate an " offensive plan " that would see them " take over any business , of any size , that plays the bourgeois speculation game " .
Luis Ignacio Planas of the opposition Copei party said the government was " acting like a pickpocket , sticking its hands in the pockets of Venezuelans , taking their money to continue financing and paying for an irresponsible economic policy " .

Resistor calculator ( series and parallel )
If you need a non-standard resistor value you could probably realize a close match using two resistor .
If you use two resistor in series it is quite easy to figure out which values give the best match ; on the other hand , using a parallel connection it is not so easy ( at least for me ) to find a good combination .
This resistor calculation tool shows which combinations of two resistors ( series or parallel ) gives a match better than the closest standard value , for the E12 ( 10 % ) , E24 ( 5 % ) and E96 ( 1 % ) series .

If the final version of the health care legislation being hammered out in Congress requires all Americans to carry health insurance , Susan Breuer thinks it 's only fair that the new law cover those who rely on her form of medical treatment : prayer .
" ' Why ' is n't the question , " Breuer said .
It 's " Why are we excluding it ? "
A lifelong Christian Scientist , Breuer of San Mateo is a full - time practitioner , meaning she provides prayer professionally for the purposes of healing .
Breuer was trained by a church - sanctioned teacher and is paid by those who come to her for healing .
With time running short for Congress to pass a health care bill by Christmas , Christian Scientists are lobbying lawmakers to include a provision that would ban discrimination against " religious and spiritual " health care and encourage private insurers to cover prayer as medical treatment .
Such a provision was passed by committees in both the House and the Senate this year , but was stripped from the House bill as well as the current version being debated in the Senate .
But Christian Scientists are hoping they can still get the measure reinserted into the Senate bill , and ultimately locked into the final legislation .
They recognize they 're facing an uphill battle , with the debate centering on such hot - button issues as restrictions on abortion coverage and whether a final bill should include a public option or a Medicare buy - in .
But Christian Scientists say they see the acknowledgment of spiritual healing in a health overhaul bill as important to their religion and to others who may turn to prayer or other nontraditional healing methods as an alternative to medical care .
These could include followers of some American Indian religions or those who seek care at holistic healing centers .
Advocates for public
" It 's our intention that the health care bill recognizes the fact that medical care is not the only form of health care , " said Eric Nelson , spokesman for the Christian Science church in Northern California and also a practitioner .
" We are advocates , not just for Christian Scientists , but for the public at large . "
Opponents of prayer coverage dismiss as ridiculous equating prayer with medical treatment and warn that including " spiritual " health care in the legislation could violate the separation of church and state .
" No one is denying them the freedom to practice their religion .
But if they ( Christian Scientists ) get this in , other groups are going to say the same thing , " said Dan Barker , co-president of the Freedom From Religion Foundation , a group of atheists and agnostics who promote separation of church and state .
" All these tent - revival faith healers will say , ' What we 're doing is medicine , and we want to charge for this . ' "
Nelson said he does not believe the church 's request violates that legal principle because it is not asking that any public funds pay for prayer .
Instead , they want their preferred form of care to be recognized without discrimination .
The Internal Revenue Service already allows prayer sessions to be deducted on income tax forms as medical expenses , Nelson said .
Christian Scientists generally eschew traditional medical care in favor of healing through prayer , believing that genuine healing is rooted in God .
That said , many Christian Scientists do carry health insurance and comply with state and federal laws , such as immunizing their children if they attend public school .
They say the church allows members to make their own decisions about their health and finances , although a basic tenet of the religion is to rely on prayer for healing .
Practitioners typically charge $ 20 to $ 50 a day for a day of prayer or about the same as a co-payment for a medical doctor visit .
They need not see their patients , who may be in another state or country , and may pray for more than one person throughout the day .
Healing may come from a single session , but occasionally additional sessions are needed , practitioners say .
Prediction it will fail
Barker believes Christian Scientists will fail to persuade Congress to reinstate the provision into the bill but said the church is a force to be reckoned with .
" They have powerful connections with a lot of state legislators , " he said .
" They 're a small group , but historically they 've been very successful in lobbying .
They 're not going to give up . "
Sen . Orrin Hatch , R - Utah , who is Mormon , had the support of Sen. John Kerry and the late Sen.
Edward Kennedy , both Massachusetts Democrats , when he introduced the provision to ban discrimination against " spiritual " health care early in the summer .
Boston is the headquarters of the Christian Science church , known formally at the Church of Christ , Scientist .
It was approved by two House committees and one Senate committee , but was dropped from the final House version and the bill under discussion in the Senate after critics called it unconstitutional .
The United States is home to more than 1,200 Christian Science congregations , about 185 of them in California .
While the church will not reveal estimates on individual membership , they said congregations typically range from about 15 to more than 100 members .
Practitioners such as Breuer , who must have a proven track record of healing before becoming a professional , acknowledge that prayer services do n't always work , but said traditional medical treatments do n't always work either .
" We just have different methods , " Breuer said .

REVIEW
Their second full length album , “ The Rhumb Line ” was my favourite in 2008 .
Catchy beats and great vocals make them a standout band , with an indie pop sound that ca n’t be mistaken .
The album sounds so fine tuned , a perfect remembrance for their lost friend .
Personally , this is one of the top bands I will be looking out for within the next 1 or two years ,
If this album is any judge , they have some amazing potential .
If you get into this band , be sure to check out an off - spin “ Discovery ” which is a collaboration of Ra Ra Riot ’s Wes Miles ( vocals ) and Vampire Weekend ’s Rostam Batmanglij ( keyboard / vocals )

The combination of low concentrations of oxygen and nutrients in the lower layers of the beaches of Alaska 's Prince William Sound is slowing the aerobic biodegradation of oil remaining from the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill , according to researchers at Temple University .
Considered one of the worst environmental disasters in history , the Exxon Valdez spilled more than 11 million gallons of crude oil into Alaska 's Prince William Sound , contaminating some 1,300 miles of shoreline , killing thousands of wildlife and severely impacting Alaska 's fishing industry and economy .
In the first five years after the accident , the oil was disappearing at a rate of about 70 percent and calculations showed the oil would be gone within the next few years .
However , about seven or eight years ago it was discovered that the oil had in fact slipped to a disappearance rate of around four percent a year and it is estimated that nearly 20,000 gallons of oil remains in the beaches .
The researchers , lead by Michel Boufadel , director of the Center for Natural Resources Development and Protection in Temple 's College of Engineering , have been studying the cause of the remaining oil for the past three years .
Their study was posted Jan. 17 in advance of publication on Nature Geoscience 's Web - site .
Boufadel said the beaches they studied consisted of two layers : an upper layer that is highly permeable and a lower layer that has very low permeability .
He said that , on average , water moved through the upper layer up to 1,000 - times faster than the lower layer , and while both layers are made up of essentially the same materials , the lower layer has become more compacted through the movement of the tides over time .

These conditions , said Boufadel , have created a sort of sheltering effect on the oil , which often lies just 1 - 4 inches below the interface of the two layers .
Boufadel said that oxygen and nutrients are needed for the survival of micro-organisms that eat the oil and aid in aerobic biodegradation of the oil .
But without the proper concentrations of the nutrients and oxygen along with the slow movement of water , anaerobic biodegradation is probably occurring , which is usually very slow .
Boufadel , who is also chair of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Temple , said that an earlier study , published in 1994 , had already established a low concentration of nutrients was affecting the remaining Exxon Valdez oil .
He said that because of Alaska 's pristine environment , you would expect to find a low concentration of nutrients and this recent study confirmed the earlier findings .
What Boufadel and his team found was , on average , that the nutrient concentration in the beaches was 10 times lower than what is required for optimal aerobic biodegradation of oil .
They also found that the oxygen levels in the beaches are also insufficient to sustain aerobic biodegradation .
Using groundwater hydraulic studies , the researchers found that the net movement of water through the lower layer of beach was outwards , so it is preventing oxygen from diffusing through the upper layer to where the oil is located .
" You have a high amount of oxygen in the seawater , so you would like to think that the oxygen would diffuse in the beach and get down 2 - 4 inches into the lower layer and get to the oil , " said Boufadel .
" But the outward movement of the water in the lower level is blocking the oxygen from spreading down into that lower layer . "
Boufadel and his team are now exploring ways to deliver the much needed oxygen and nutrients to the impacted areas in an effort to spur aerobic biodegradation of the remaining oil .
The study was funded by a grant from the Exxon Valdez oil Spill Trustee Council .
One of the motherhood and apple pie items in econ-land is that the world needs global rebalancing , which is code for China has to stop being a mercantilist and currency manipulator , and the US has to quit borrowing a ton and overconsuming ( or underproducing , which is another way to frame the same problem ) .
But once everyone agrees that that ’s a swell idea , no one seems particularly inclined to do anything about it , except complain about the consequences .
One of the things that has led to somewhat less attention to this elephant in the room is the perception that China has “ decoupled . ”
If it has managed to fare reasonably well in this global upheaval , then surely it is becoming more self sufficient and therefore less dependent on US demand , so the situation is already righting itself , correct ?
Wrong , says Dror Poleg ( hat tip reader Michael ) .
He argues that many of the beliefs about China ’s economy are off base :
Back in the middle of 2008 , many publications , most prominently The Economist magazine , suggested that a downturn in developed countries might not have any significant effect on developing economies , since the latter have already “ decoupled ” …
Within a few months , the “ decoupling ” theory proved to be false :
The downturn in the developed world had a significant impact on China ’s economic well - being , causing a dramatic rise in unemployment and a sharp slowdown in economic growth …
And so , in the second half of 2009 , China ’s ( and America ’s ) stock exchange (s ) started to go up again , and the decline in economic growth was reversed , albeit not yet reaching the levels of 2007 - 2008 .
And together with traces of growth , again came the “ decoupling ” theory :
The Economist attributed China ’s relative success in averting a major crisis to its ‘ strong domestic markets ’ and implied that it was due to China ’s economy shifting ‘ further from state - sponsored investment to private consumption ’ .
As I noted back then , the assumptions made by The Economist and other leading publications concerning China ’s growth are false .
A new study published by Professor Hung Ho-feng at the New Left Review ( of all places ! ) provides some interesting information that helps put things in perspective .
The article compares China ’s development path to that of other Asian economies , including Japan , Korea , Taiwan , Singapore , and Hong Kong .
It provides a concise summary of political and economic events in East - Asia since World War II as well as some colorful predictions and recommendations , but for the purpose of this post , I will only mention some of Prof .
Hung ’s key observations : 1 . Private consumption as a share of China ’s GDP has been going down consistently since the early 1960s , including a dramatic drop following China ’s “ Reform and Opening Up ” policy at the end of the 1970s .
2 . The average wage of a Chinese manufacturing worker in comparison to his American counterpart remained constant over the past 30 years , hovering around 2 % .
This means that despite the massive increase in Chinese exports to the US , a Chinese factory worker still earns a 50th of his American counterpart , just like in 1980 .
In comparison , the average wage of Japanese manufacturing workers in comparison to their American counterparts went from 7 % in 1950 to nearly 60 % in 1980 .
Korean manufacturing workers enjoyed a similar relative increase in their buying power between 1975 and 2000 , as did their counterparts in Taiwan .
Yves here .
I do n’t have the foggiest idea of how to reconcile this factoid with what I hear from people who have spent time in China , namely , the affluence of the coastal cities , and how , for instance , university faculty enjoy a much better lifestyle than their US counterparts .
Of course , the people I know probably do not spend much time with factory workers , but still … .
Hung Ho -Feng offers an explanation , which relies on the power of the rising coastal elites , but I do n’t find it sufficient ( as in more has to be at work for his theory to be valid ) .

I think you completely have a right to be offended .
It was an extremely sexist comment from every angle , and was completely inappropriate .
Granted , they may have been joking , but if you think he / she was serious , I do n't think you'd be out of line to talk to their superior about it , especially since it upset you so much .

Lol sorry that 's your own fault .

YOU basically said " I 'm a girl I do n't want to learn football , that 's a boys sport , nagnagnag . "
So which response did you expect ?
If you give stupid statements like that above , you have to be prepared to get stupid statements back .
I 'm not sure if the guy was serious about it or not , as I do n't know him , but be sure that if one of my students gave me a sentence like that , I would have been very snarky .
Sorry , I can't give you sympathy here , I 'm much to nerved by lazy students who always ask " What will I ever need that for ? "

well , I think there 's a difference between a language course and football .
Also , she did n't say that football was a men's sport - you did .
The distinction is that English language courses have a useful , positive benefit , while football is unlikely to do so if you 're not considering playing professionally .

My boyfriend / unofficial fiance loves football .
He does n't mind that I hate it and would much rather spend some time in my studio while he goes out to watch " The Game " with his friends -- half of whom are females .
It was a sexist answer , but then again it was a loaded question .
To avoid crap like this in the future , try asking your gym teacher if you can do something more cardiovascular - ly constructive with your time , like jog laps around the gym while everyone else plays .
You do n't have to deal with football and you 're improving your fitness , and I can't see him objecting to you doing something more active than a stop - and - go game .

Yes , some gym teachers are cool with it , I was allowed to jog the track instead of a lot of team sports .
Though he knew full well no one wanted me on their team , and we had an odd number of students .
The only team sport anybody wanted me on was water polo because I could tread water the longest :P
In any case , it 's definitely worthwhile to ask .

I 'm assuming you 're in high school here ?
Pointing out to any teacher that their curriculum sucks is n't really the greatest idea .
They tend to get a bit defensive .
HOWEVER , your gym teacher really overreacted .
I 'd be offended because of all the reasons to make a bunch of kids play football ( and I can give you a handful off the top of my head ) , not a single one of them is gender - specific .
So maybe learn to pick your battles , and know that your gym teacher is WRONG WRONG WRONG .
Also , I know jackshit about football , and my father - in - law loves it , so I 've spent a lot of time learning the game with him , which is fun .

I 'm frankly a little shocked at the people who are attacking the op , here .
It 's everyone 's prerogative to react as they see fit to this , of course , but basically I do n't think it matters whether the op ought to have been complaining about gym class or not .
What 's relevant to me is that during a discussion with a student , an authority figure made a blatantly heterosexist remark , leaving that student feeling not safe to protest it .
In my opinion , that 's just not appropriate , and saying , " You should n't have said anything in the first place , " comes dangerously close to victim - blaming .
Feminists need to stick together , not shoot each other down , and if we feel that someone 's reacting to something in sort of the wrong way , i think there 's a way to say that without implicitly condoning the sexism to which the op is referring .
The gym teacher could have said any number of things , from it 's good exercise to it's on the state curriculum , or even , because girls should be allowed to play the same sports as boys .
Instead , the gym teacher chose to make an assumptive and demeaning remark , and I think that 's terrible .
I 'm sorry you had to experience this , op .

the why the hell did he choose to take that class ? .
Your reaction to his comment however , was not overreacting .
He had no right to say those things to you .
Perhaps if he had just said something more general it would have been all right .
Speaking as someone who likes watching football , I still would rather not play myself , nor do I expect every man in America to like football .
Given my tendency to like foreign guys , I do n't think my husband will be watching the football he 's thinking of ...
Obviously you and I are n't
To be fair to the gym teacher , you were complaining about sports in a gym class which probably came out all wrong to him / her .
At least you 're a million times better than the guy in my creative writing class who claimed writing creatively has no meaning and there fore literature and poetry were useless

Personally I 've always hated gym / p.e .
If it was just about exercising and keeping fit that would be one thing ; we always started the class with exercise and running laps , but when we moved on to the sports ... ugh .
I never understood the point .
I mean , if we'd had the choice to keep exercising or jog the rest of the class , instead of playing teh sprot of the week , that would be one thing , but the whole " it teaches kids about teamwork / trust " is b.s .
The kids who already like sports / are good at sports already know this lesson , for one .
The kids who are n't good at sports , instead of learning teamwork , learn humiliation .
And your teacher 's answer ?
WAY out of line .
I would have given him some back talk and probably been written up , but that 's just me .

and at least in my high school , the gym teacher obviously favored the athletes ( probably were their coach as well after school ) and treated everyone else like crap ( if he even remembered we were there , sometimes he would get caught up in other shit and barely even conduct class ) .

The borna virus is at once obscure and grotesque .
It can infect mammals and birds , but scientists know little about its effects on its victims .
In some species it seems to be harmless , but it can drive horses into wild fits .
The horses sometimes kill themselves by smashing in their skulls .
In other cases , they starve themselves to death .
Some scientists have even claimed that borna viruses alter human behavior , playing a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder , although others say there is no solid evidence of a link .
The virus now turns out to have an intimate bond with every person on Earth .
In the latest issue of Nature , a team of Japanese and American scientists report that the human genome contains borna virus genes .
The virus infected our monkey - like ancestors 40 million years ago , and its genes have been passed down ever since .
Borna viruses are not the only viruses lurking in our genome .
Scientists have found about 100,000 elements of human DNA that probably came from viruses .
But the borna virus belongs to a kind of virus that has never been found in the human genome before .
Its discovery raises the possibility that many more viruses are left to be found .
Scientists who hunt for these viruses think of themselves as paleontologists searching for fossils .
Just as animals get buried in rock , these viruses become trapped in the genomes of their hosts .
While their free - living relatives continue to evolve , fossil viruses are effectively frozen in time .
January 18 , 2010
Jesse spoke with Eric Ruder via telephone from Port - au - Prince on January 15 and 16 about the crisis unfolding around him .
On Sunday , he and his family were able to travel from Haiti to the Dominican Republic .
Within hours , the hotel where they were staying became known as a place where some medical help was available , because another hotel guest happened to be an emergency medical technician .
Jesse got a crash course in treating severe injuries -- broken bones , head wounds and more -- as people desperate for help kept arriving .
Jesse Hagopian , a teacher in Seattle and contributor to SocialistWorker.org , was in Port - au - Prince with his 1 - year - old son to visit his wife when the earthquake hit .
His wife , an aid worker , works until the evening on most days , but by sheer luck , she came to the hotel where they were staying early on Tuesday -- just minutes before the quake struck at 4:53 p.m .
This spared Jesse and his family agonizing hours or days trying to find one another amid the chaos .
CAN YOU describe what you 're seeing in Haiti ?
YESTERDAY , WE drove around downtown Port - au - Prince , and some of the adjoining cities .
It 's hard to describe , because there 's just no reference for it in the rest of my life .
But the first thing you notice is that everyone 's wearing a mask .
People are coming from different cities and different neighborhoods to search for their relatives , and the stench is so bad because there 's so many dead bodies that everyone 's got a mask on .
There are people looking through the rubble , and the rubble is just so expansive .
Huge buildings have collapsed , and everything 's made out of concrete , so it 's just concrete slabs and concrete bricks , just littered all over the ground and all over the street , and countless scenes of people digging through them , looking for loved ones .
Unfortunately , there are a lot of bodies that are n't claimed .
We saw a lot of instances of bulldozers coming and picking up bodies , and throwing them into the backs of trucks .
They 're trying to clear the streets of dead bodies because it becomes a public health issue .
But it 's going to be very challenging for a lot of families who do n't have closure and do n't know what happened to their family members .
One of the things that you also notice when you go through the streets is that everyone 's out there on their own .
There was very little of the government or the UN in the efforts to find these bodies or help the injured .
During our drive , we only saw the UN in front of the place where their headquarters used to be .
It had collapsed , and we saw lots of soldiers guarding that area .
I did n't see anybody distributing aid .
Half of the hotel that I was staying in collapsed -- the half I was n't in , thankfully .
And the half I was in , there were cracks all over the place , so it was dangerous to remain there .
We have our 1 - year - old son with us , so we definitely did n't want to just sleep outside if we could avoid it .
Thankfully , my mom had a friend here , and she had gotten in contact with him right when we got to Haiti , before the earthquake .
He came and found us , knowing which hotel we were staying in .
That was very lucky , or else we'd be sleeping outside .
And he has this phone that we 're talking on now , so without that , we'd have no contact to let our families know what was going on .
What you can do Donations and aid are desperately needed in Haiti .
Here are some organizations with connections to the grassroots movements in the country .
The Haiti Emergency Relief Fund , organized by the solidarity organization Haiti Action , delivers resources directly to grassroots organizations .
It was founded in 2004 after the coup d'etat that forced President Jean - Bertrand Aristide out of office .
For more information , including a telephone contact , go to the Canada Haiti Action Network Web site .
The Zanmi Lasante Medical Center is located in the Central Plateau of Haiti and delivers health care through a network of clinics .
The health center survived the earthquake and delivering aid to the disaster zone .
You can donate to the center through the U.S. non-profit organization Partners in Health .
SOPUDEP is a pioneering school in Petionville .
The resources of the school and its teachers are being mobilized to assist the neighboring population .
You can support the school via the Canadian - based Sawatzky Family Foundation .
I WAS in Gaza last summer , and when I saw the news picture from Haiti , I was struck by how much it looked like Gaza .
Like you 've described - - big piles of concrete and twisted rebar and broken bricks everywhere you looked .
THAT'S IT .
That 's all they build with .
It 's terrible construction in an earthquake because it 's so heavy .
It just crushed people .
Nothing is reinforced enough to withstand a very strong earthquake , so the devastation is so massive .
If the UN mission here was really about helping the people of Haiti , this would be the best place in the world to have an earthquake -- not that you 'd want one anywhere , but you 'd have a huge peacekeeping force that could help with the injured and rebuild the country .
But instead , in the course of a day or two , so many people died needlessly because they did n't get a bandage on their head wound .
My hotel became a makeshift hospital , and so many people were coming there because we had one nurse .
That was all we had -- no supplies and no other help .
If someone had dropped off a box of bandages , it could have saved more people .
I just read that the new estimate by local officials is 200,000 dead .
I had originally read 50,000 .
If people who are still trapped do n't get water , this number is actually conceivable .
I saw so many huge buildings downtown just collapsed , and the quake happened just before 5 p.m. on Tuesday -- so many of those buildings had people in them .
If that number of 200,000 is reached , it will be one of the 10 deadliest natural disasters of all time .
Of course , it 's not simply a natural disaster .
It 's a natural disaster on top of the disaster that U.S. imperialism has imposed on this country for decades , backing one dictator after another in the interest of maintaining a source of cheap labor for U.S. corporations .
WHAT DO you think of the Obama administration 's response so far ?
ON SATURDAY , Hillary Clinton flew into Haiti to oversee the relief effort -- supposedly .
But I think her trip to Haiti tells you all you need to know :
They had to shut down the airport for three hours so she could land , which meant that no actual aid flights could come in .
And this happened at a really critical time , because we 're right at that point where every extra ounce of water matters .
At this point , people who have been without water are facing imminent death .
But they stopped the aid shipments so Clinton could give a canned speech from Haiti about how much the U.S. is doing to help .
And in any case , the U.S. government is sending more boots on the ground and more guns to help with " law and order . "
But this is n't what the Haitian people need .
They need people with shovels , and people to give them water .
And of course , " law and order " is threatened by the lack of aid .
Emphasizing troops over aid creates a self - fulfilling prophecy that will lead to serious bloodshed .
ON SATURDAY , an article about the Haiti crisis in the New York Times said that the historic " neglect " of the Haitian people has at least made them " resilient . "
To quote the Times , " Although protesting is a national custom , so is surviving on little .
That national ethos , the Haitians ' ability to scrounge to find enough to fight their hunger pangs , is being tested in full by the current crisis . "
RIGHT .
IN other words , we 've been screwing them for so long , they should be used to it by now .
It 's such racist garbage .
It 's a little softer than the Rush Limbaugh statement that we 've already helped the Haitian people with our taxpayer dollars , or Pat Robertson 's idea that this is retribution for a pact made with the devil .
But it 's coming from the same racist attitude that these people are used to these kinds of conditions , so they 'll be fine .
But nobody can deal with the horror that I 've seen here .
When I heard that statement from Pat Robertson , after all the stress I 'd been under , that just kind of broke me .
I had to yell .
That this earthquake was payback for kicking out the French during the Haitian Revolution ?
I hope that Pat Robertson can be dropped in one of the neighborhoods here , and let the people have at him .
It 's hard to even respond to that kind of idiocy , but I just got finished reading C.L.R. James '
The Black Jacobins , and it's one of the most inspiring stories I 've ever read about ordinary people taking up arms , liberating themselves and taking control of their own affairs .
And then there 's people like Pat Robertson , who wish Haiti was still a colony , where they could just directly enslave people and make money off them .
In any case , the U.S. needs to tell its soldiers to drop their machine guns and pick up shovels and start digging people out .
I 've seen a lot of stories predicting that violence and looting could break out , and that 's a real possibility , if they do n't get people food .
But it does n't have to be that way .
The way you impose order is n't with machine guns , but by giving people food .
On Friday , they gave out only 8,000 packets of daily food rations , and the UN says that some 8 million are needed this week .
People are drinking water contaminated by the rotting bodies , so there 's a public health disaster looming that could create another wave of deaths among those who survived the quake .
SOME U.S. officials say they fear distributing food because it could create riot conditions .
But what happens if the food is n't distributed ?
WE KNOW what happens .
My wife was here a year ago and had to be evacuated because food prices rose so high that people were eating mud .
That can only go on for so long until people decide to go into stores and take what they need in order for their families to survive .
They need to marshal the world 's wealth to come help - - now .
The idea that the world 's most powerful country -- one hour away by plane -- is being stopped by a clogged airport is asinine .
It 's infuriating .
THE ESTIMATES are that the six largest U.S. banks paid out a total of $ 150 billion in compensation to their employees for 2009 .
So the $ 100 million pledged to Haiti by the U.S. is 0.05 percent of that .
ABSURD .
I also just read that a couple in Arkansas hit the lottery for $ 100 million , but that 's all the Obama administration can find to help Haiti .
Basically , the Obama administration is orchestrating one of the largest catastrophes in world history .
The Haitian government is in collapse -- figuratively and literally .
The presidential palace caved in on itself .
And it 's not like the government was healthy before the quake struck .
In 2004 , George W. Bush deposed then - President Jean - Bertrand Aristide and greatly weakened the connection of people to the resources of the government .
With the local government in collapse and the international players more interested in " law and order " and contracts for their corporations , there just are n't enough people and infrastructure to deliver the aid that people have so generously dug out from their own shallow pockets .
WHAT ROLE has the UN been playing ?
I REALLY did n't see them at all , even though the hotel I was staying became a center where hundreds of people came for relief .
No one , including the UN , brought supplies to us .
The headquarters of the UN itself collapsed , and I believe that the number one and number two UN officials in the country were killed , so they 're definitely dealing with a crisis of their own .
But if they 're here to try to create better conditions for the people of Haiti , it seems like they would have a faster response , not just to their own crisis , but to the broader one .
Seeing so many dead bodies and so many people searching on their own and not seeing any clinics set up or dispersal of aid or medicine of any kind anywhere that we went -- it really seemed like the Haitians were on their own in the midst of one of the largest presence of UN forces in the world .
That just seemed like a huge injustice to me .
GIVEN THE levels of desperation , how is the security situation ?
I THINK the devastation is so dramatic that people are in shock .
At this point , a few days into the crisis , people are still just looking for their loved ones and trying to dig out people from the rubble .
It has n't yet reached the point where the level of desperation has become such that there 's the kind of riots that happened a year ago when food prices jumped so high .
At least it does n't feel that way to me right now .
But how long can you go without proper medical attention ?
There are millions of people who are homeless .
What do you do when you have millions of people homeless ?
You have to have a coordinated effort to address these problems , and you have to start taking care of them in a timely manner , or you know that people will have to take matters into their own hands and use any means necessary to find the water , food and shelter they need .
There 's bound to be some sort of revolt .
And with the sort of political repression that exists in Haiti - - for example , the largest and most popular political party in the country is banned from participating in elections that had been set for later this year -- it seems like that type of tension really could come to a boiling point .
WHAT HAVE you been doing since the earthquake hit ?
OUR MAKESHIFT aid station was featured in the media .
In fact , it was the front page of Yahoo News , so hundreds of people just started coming .
I had a young kid die right in front of me , simply because we had to wait hours before we could get to him -- because there were so many other people in line .
And I do n't have any medical training , you know ?
I should n't be the one to work on him !
It 's just been so crazy that it 's hard to even describe .
I just learned how to do things -- just like anyone would if they had to .
We were lucky that there was this one EMT who had some medical training , and he got totally overwhelmed with the number of cases -- he just started assigning things to us .
My wife and I and a couple other people at the hotel wanted to help out , and so we just tried to attend to people with the worst injuries .
It 's horrible to think about -- beams had fallen on people 's skulls and caused massive bleeding , people lost their eyes and limbs and everything .
I went through the hotel and got all the sheets off the beds and then ripped them into strips , and we used those to stop the bleeding .
We broke up the chairs in the hotel and found whatever sticks we could to use as splints for people 's broken limbs .
We just did whatever with what we had , because no aid was being delivered .
Then I found out that the EMT who headed this whole operation at the hotel got so exhausted that he tripped at night and broke his ankle .
So now he can't continue , and they have no help now .
CAN YOU describe the conditions that people have to contend with ?
In the news coverage I 've seen , it looks like a lot of people are living under a tarp spread between two trees .
YES , THAT'S how most people are living .
Those blue tarps are everywhere .
The people who are lucky have a blue tarp draped over them and are living under it .
The food and water situation is going to become a crisis .
There 's some available at hospitals , but there are long lines for everything , whether it 's gas or water or food .
At one point when we were driving , we thought the street had been blockaded , but it turned out it was just a gas line that was very long .
There 's some water available at different stations like that , but some of the pipes have obviously ruptured , and the infrastructure was very weak to begin with .
People are just scavenging and doing whatever they can to eat at this point .
It all seems so absurd , though .
There 's been an occupation by the UN since 2004 , and they developed no infrastructure ?
Even if there 's a bottleneck at the one major airport , there are coastlines - - you can bring boats in .
And you have the Dominican Republic next door -- you can get aid there and bring it across the border .
This is an hour from Miami , right ?
It 's right next door to our country .
We 've mobilized ridiculous amounts of weapons and supplies and soldiers to the Middle East to invade countries , right ?
I really think they could figure out how to make it happen .
I 'm sure there are difficulties .
Haiti's an extremely poor country , largely because of U.S. imperialism and Western domination , and that presents real challenges for distributing aid .
But I can't accept any excuse given by the media for the U.S. not being able to get more help here , given that the U.S. is able to marshal huge resources around the world when it wants to occupy a country .
IN 2009 , the U.S. spent about $ 12 billion a month on its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and now , they 're pledging $ 100 million in aid to deal with this crisis .
That 's less than 1 percent of what they were spending each month on military occupations .
YES .
THERE are millions of people homeless here , which sounds big .
But when you put it in the context of how much they 're spending on war , how much they 're spending on bank bailouts or bonuses for executives , it just does n't make any sense .
That $ 100 million is n't anywhere near the amount that 's going to be needed to address rebuilding homes for the population that survived , and healing the people who are injured .
It was a natural disaster that hit Haiti and created this awful mess , but it 's really the unnatural disaster of decades of poverty that made the natural disaster so horrible .
Homes made from the cheapest possible materials are going to fall , and they 're going to hurt a lot of people .
The lack of infrastructure to deliver aid is a result of the poverty , and that was n't just an accident , but something that was orchestrated by several different governments over time .
In the 1820s , Haiti had to pay reparations to France because it won its independence , and France lost all its " property , " in the form of slaves .
Today , Haiti owes money to the International Monetary Fund .
The IMF has offered loans to Haiti to deal with this crisis -- so it can be plunged even further into debt .
It 's absurd .
And Barack Obama has selected Bill Clinton and George Bush as the main people who are supposed to solve the problem ?
We saw how well Bush did in New Orleans - - it 's not a serious attempt to help people here .
It seems much more like a publicity stunt to say , " We 're doing what we can , " and meanwhile , millions of people will suffer .
THAT EARLY history of Haiti is remarkable in so many ways .
The U.S. initially supported the Haitian uprising with arms and money , because it saw the rebellion as a way to eject the French .
But once the revolution was successful , the U.S. opposed it , because America was concerned that the revolution would set a very bad example for Black slaves in the southern U.S .
WHAT I love about Toussaint L'Ouverture is how he would make alliances with the British here , and then the French here , and the Americans there , but he always knew that they were interested in maintaining their own advantages and exploiting Haiti however they could .
So he would make alliances when it suited him to beat the other imperialist power , but he never was lulled into thinking that they were actually going to defend Haiti and try to fight for the end of slavery .
I think that the outpouring of support for the people who are suffering here in Haiti is really beautiful , and it shows that people want a better and different kind of world -- and they 're willing to give up things to get there .
But the problem is that a lot of the institutions set up to deliver the aid are n't concerned about building a better world .
They 're more worried about their own institutional security , not upsetting the status quo in Haiti .
In one way or another , their efforts reinforce the grip of the current president , who is himself a servant of U.S. interests .
So you have a situation where all this money can be raised , but if it goes to private contracts for corporations to rebuild Haiti , then it 's really more about them rebuilding their bottom line .
This happened in Iraq , with big contracts to Halliburton , and we saw how well that worked .
Iraqis still do n't have electricity , and meanwhile Halliburton is fabulously wealthy .
A similar kind of thing happened in New Orleans , where huge devastation became a huge opportunity to privatize .
Everything down to the schools are privatized , and unless we collectively demand otherwise , the same dynamic will happen here in Haiti , where U.S. corporations see this as an opportunity to get all the funds that people are donating .
So I hope that we can help shed some light on the devastation that 's happened here , and help be part of the process of raising the money and the medical supplies that are needed here .
But we can't just leave it in the hands of the institutions that have already driven Haiti into poverty .
We have to try to fight for an alternative , where the aid actually goes to people and not just these corporations .

The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Tuesday 15 December 2009
The story below said that 110 heads of state would be attending the Copenhagen summit on climate change .
Rather , the 110 are a mix of heads of state and government .
The Copenhagen climate talks hit trouble tonight as a number of African countries indicated their leaders would refuse to take part in the final summit unless significant progress was made in the next three days .
The showdown between rich and poor countries came as ministers began arriving in Copenhagen to take over negotiations .
However , negotiators failed to reach agreement in key areas such as emission cuts , long - term finance and when poor countries should start to reduce emissions .
More than 110 heads of state , mainly from developing countries , are due to begin arriving on Thursday for an intense 24 hours of final negotiations .
Delegates hope for a deal on Friday that will ensure temperatures do not rise by more than 2C , and that hundreds of billions of pounds is pledged to help poor countries adapt to climate change .
But tonight it appeared that many did not want to risk being pressured into signing an agreement they believe would be against their national interests .
" The industrialised countries want to hammer out a large part of the deal on the last day , when the heads of state arrive , " one senior African negotiator told the Guardian on the condition of anonymity .
" It 's a ploy to slip through provisions that are not amenable to developing country efforts .
It 's playing dirty . "
One added : " It is as serious a situation as it ever has been .
It is more than probable many heads of state will not come if the negotiations are not complete .
Why should a head of state come to sign an agreement that is basically a non-agreement ? "
High level Chinese and Indian representatives indicated they would be in Copenhagen , but they made clear they wanted key points agreed before they arrive .
They also appear desperate to avoid a situation where western leaders jet in and steamroller the main points on the last day of the conference .
Su Wei , China 's top climate negotiator , said he hoped there would be no outstanding issues by the time his country 's premier , Wen Jiabao , arrived .
" I hope the only question we will leave for leaders is how to pronounce Copenhagen . "
Indian representatives also said their prime minister , Manmohan Singh , would come to the summit , but emphasised the urgency of having negotiators produce a text in advance .
Jairam Ramesh , India 's environment minister , said : " We are saying that heads of state should not be negotiating a draft text .
We must have a draft text already finalised .
The heads of state should come to leave their imprint on the deal . "
The UK 's climate secretary , Ed Miliband , conceded there was some way to go before a workable deal was reached .
" We 're now getting close to midnight in this negotiation and we need to act like it .
That means more urgency to solve problems , not just identify them . "
One key point of contention is the US and EU insistence that emerging economies such as India , China and Brazil agree to peak their emissions by 2020 .
Developing countries argue that this would lock them into poverty .
Analysts say such hard driving tactics are typical of negotiations , but they resonate even more at the climate change talks , which are based on the idea that all 192 countries sign off on any agreement .
" This is a consensus process , " said Janos Pastor , who heads Ban Ki-Moon 's climate change team .
" If they are really meaning that they are going to boycott , and if they are going to do that , it 's serious .
It would be a pity if a conflict meant that we do n't reach an agreement . "
Rob Bradley from the World Resource Institute , said : " Nobody wants to have their prime minister arrive and then inform them they did not strike a deal to talk about .
I can certainly imagine that some of those thinking that a deal is going to look bad for them are going to try to persuade their prime ministers from coming . "
The Rise of ' Chimerica ' Two Superpowers Take on the World
The US and China are already the two most powerful countries in the world .
As allies , they would be unstoppable .
Is the era of a double superpower taking shape ?
Thank you , Tim Geithner !
Thank you , Ben Bernanke !
Thank you , Hank Paulson !
Thank you , Larry Summers !
Thank you , Barack Obama !
Thank you , AMERICA , for making this yet another absolutely great year to work on Wall Street !

Gary Coleman posed for the mug shot below after he was arrested this afternoon in Utah , TMZ has learned .
Law enforcement in Santaquin , UT says they were called to Coleman 's house for a domestic disturbance .
They found no crime was committed , but he was was picked up because of a warrant stemming from a prior incident .
The jailer told TMZ the warrant for which Coleman was arrested was for domestic violence incident in 2009 .
Coleman was cited , but never showed up for court , thus the warrant .
He is currently being held on $ 1,725 bail .
We all know health care in the U.S. is too expensive .
But is it really that bad ?
Yes .
This graphic by National Geographic is the best we ’ve seen at summarizing the three facets of the problem : Cost , results , and access .
If you have n’t seen this sort of graph before , some explanation is in order .
On the left are several countries , arranged on an axis showing annual per capita spending on health care .
To the right is average life expectancy .
Thus , the lines between the two axes show a country ’s cost of health care , and the health of its citizens .
Ideally , you ’d like to be sloping up ; sloping down , and you ’re not getting much for your money .
The U.S. ?
We do n’t even fit on the chart .
Meanwhile , the graphic also gets at the problem of health - care access .
The thickness of each line shows how often residents see a doctor .
Japan and Czech Republic , for example , seem to make it easy .
The U.S. , not so much .
Chinese legal experts are proposing a ban on eating dogs and cats in a contentious move to end a culinary tradition dating back thousands of years .
The recommendation will be submitted to higher authorities in April as part of a draft bill to tackle animal abuse .
In ancient times , dog meat was considered a medicinal tonic .
Today , it is commonly available throughout the country , but particularly in the north where dog stew is popular for its supposed warming qualities .
In recent years , however , such traditions are increasingly criticised by an affluent , pet - loving , urban middle class .
Online petitions against dog and cat consumption have attracted tens of thousands of signatures .
Videos showing the maltreatment of farmed dogs have spurred protests at markets where the animals are bought and sold .
But the drafters of the new proposal want far more drastic measures , which would oblige law enforcement authorities to close down thousands of dog restaurants and butchers which supply the meat .
According to the draft , illegal sale or consumption of pets would incur a maximum penalty of 15 days in prison for individuals or a 500,000 yuan fine for businesses .
Public security bureaus would be obliged to respond to hotline calls from the public about violations .
" We are proposing that all dog and cat eating should be banned because it is causing many social problems , " said Chang Jiwen , a law professor at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences who heads the drafting team .
He said recent murders and thefts related to the dog meat trade showed that it had become a source of tension , while the economic impact of a ban would be small because an increasingly affluent population was less dependent on dog and cat meat .
The proposal reflects changing public opinion and international input .
Drafters at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences have been consulting for more than a year with Britain 's Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the US - based International Fund for Animal Welfare .
But the plan for a dog meat ban has stirred up fierce debate between animal welfare groups and defenders of traditional values .
" I support this proposal .
Whether you judge this as a question of food security or emotions , there is absolutely no necessity in China for people to eat dogs and cats , " said Zeng Li , the founder of the Lucky Cats shelter in Beijing .
" We need something more than moral pressure .
Beijing 's dog restaurants get their meat mainly from vagrant and stolen dogs .
In the suburbs , dogs are hung and slaughtered in front of buyers . "
Online critics said it was hypocritical to protect only dogs and cats , and that the government should focus on human welfare before protecting animals .
" This is absurd .
Why only dogs and cats ?
How about pigs , cows and sheep , " wrote a poster going by the name Mummy on the Xhinua news agency website .
" I hope the experts went to see what laid - off workers and people in rural areas have to eat .
They should pay more concern to problems that people really care about , " said another contributor under the name Starfish .
Even before the pet meat ban , the draft bill had already provoked controversy .
Initial plans for a comprehensive animal welfare law had to be dropped in the face of criticism that human living conditions ought to be the priority at this stage in China 's development .
The focus has now been narrowed to prevention of animal abuse , which is defined as inflicting unnecessary pain and brutality .
Even so , it is far from certain that the draft will be adopted by the government or the National People 's Congress .

One of the downsides to many camera monitoring applications available in the same price range as Vitamin D— free !— is that their detection algorithms are too primitive and overly sensitive .
You do n't need a notification image sent to your cellphone every time the wind blows or a squirrel runs across your front lawn .
Vitamin D allows you to specify the size of objects that will trigger events and set up detection windows to only monitor activity in specified areas of the video frame .
Using a simple wizard - style selection process , you can give a set of instructions to Vitamin D , like wanting a door to be monitored for people leaving , or a parking lot to be monitored for vehicles arriving .
Check out the demonstration video below for a closer look :
Vitamin D supports email and cellphone notifications and has a " highlights reel " function to allow you to quickly review the activity triggers from the day .
Vitamin D is free and available for Windows and Mac operating systems .
Have a favorite tool for monitoring activity with your web cam ?
Let 's hear about it in the comments .

So as we career towards a mediocre outcome in Copenhagen , why do roughly half the people in this country not believe in man-made climate change , when the overwhelming majority of scientists do ?
Firstly we have the psychological issues .
We 're predisposed to undervalue adverse outcomes which are a long way off , especially if we might be old or dead soon .
We 're inherently predisposed to find cracks in evidence that suggests we should do something we do n't want to do , hence the enduring appeal of stories about alcohol being good for you .
Suggesting that personal behaviour change will have a big role to play , when we know that telling people to do the right thing is a weak way to change behaviour , is an incomplete story : you need policy changes to make better behaviour easier , and we all understand that fresh fruit on sale at schools is more effective than telling children not to eat sweets .
This is exacerbated because climate science is difficult .
We could discuss everything you needed to know about MMR and autism in an hour .
Climate change will take two days of your life , for a relatively superficial understanding : if you 're interested , I 'd recommend the IPCC website .
On top of that , we do n't trust governments on science , because we know they distort it .
We see that a minister will sack Professor David Nutt , if the evidence on the relative harms of drugs is not to the government 's taste .
We see the government brandish laughable reports to justify DNA retention by the police with flawed figures , suspicious missing data , and bogus arguments .
We know that evidence - based policy is window dressing , so now , when they want us to believe them on climate science , we doubt .
Then , of course , the media privilege foolish contrarian views because they have novelty value , and also because " established " views get confused with " establishment " views , and anyone who comes along to have a pop at those gets David v Goliath swagger .
But the key to all of this is the recurring mischief of criticisms mounted against climate change .
I am very happy to affirm that I am not a giant expert on climate change : I know a bit , and I know that there 's not yet been a giant global conspiracy involving almost every scientist in the world ( although I 'd welcome examples ) .
More than all that , I can spot the same rhetorical themes re-emerging in climate change foolishness that you see in aids denialism , homeopathy , and anti-vaccination conspiracy theorists .
Among all these , reigning supreme , is the " zombie argument " : arguments which survive to be raised again , for eternity , no matter how many times they are shot down .
" Homeopathy worked for me , " and the rest .
Zombie arguments survive , immortal and resistant to all refutation , because they do not live or die by the normal standards of mortal arguments .
There 's a huge list of them at realclimate.org , with refutations .
There are huge lists of them everywhere .
It makes no difference .
" CO 2 is n't an important greenhouse gas " , " Global warming is down to the sun " , " what about the cooling in the 1940s ? " says your party bore .
" Well , " you reply , " since the last time you raised this , I checked , and there were loads of sulphites in the air in the 1940s to block out the sun , made from the slightly different kind of industrial pollution we had then , and the odd volcano , so that 's been answered already , ages ago . "
And they knew that .
And you know they knew you could find out , but they went ahead anyway and wasted your time , and worse than that , you both know they 're going to do it again , to some other poor sap .
And that is rude .
Images from ground telescopes and Hubble show that the white dwarf T Pyxidis is not disrupted by its violent eruptions and soon begins to accumulate more matter from its companion , and repeats the cataclysm some years later .
WASHINGTON — A massive , eruptive white dwarf star in the Milky Way — long overdue for its next periodic eruption — is closer to our solar system than previously thought and could threaten the Earth if it fully explodes millions of years from now .
New observations of the white dwarf and its sun-like stellar companion are giving scientists a better understanding of the star 's precarious position as a possible supernova , astronomers said here today at the 215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society .
The two stars are in a close binary system called T Pyxidis , located in the Southern Hemisphere constellation Pyxis ( " The Compass Box " ) .
Researchers found that the system is only 3,260 light - years from our solar system — far closer than anyone previously thought .
( A light - year is the distance that light travels in one Earth year , or about 6 trillion miles . )
The new findings suggest the white dwarf , considered close to us by cosmic standards , could eventually go supernova .
Gamma radiation emitted by the supernova could threaten the Earth with an energy equivalent to 1,000 simultaneous solar flares .
The production of nitrous oxides in Earth 's atmosphere by the gamma rays could completely destroy the ozone layer , astronomers said .
Demise , if it comes , wo n't be anytime soon , however : Scientists ' calculations suggest that the star will explode in about 10 million years , said Edward Sion , a member of the research team from Villanova University in Villanova , Pa .
" While we can relax , that is very short on astronomical and geological timescales , " Sion told SPACE.com in an e-mail .
The T Pyxidis system is known as a recurrent nova because the massive white dwarf has suffered thermonuclear ( nova ) explosions about every 20 years , with previous recorded nova explosions occurring in 1890 , 1902 , 1920 , 1944 and 1967 .
None of these sorts of explosions threaten Earth .
But the system is long overdue for its next one .
Astronomers do n't know why the star 's explosiveness has been tamped down of late .
The relatively modest nova explosions are triggered by hydrogen - rich gas siphoned off the sun - like companion and onto the white dwarf .
One important question is whether the mass being added to the white dwarf increases despite the nova explosions or if the explosions cause more mass to be ejected from the dwarf than it takes on from its partner .
If the mass does continue to build up , the white dwarf could eventually reach the so - called Chandrasekhar Limit and undergo an instantaneous gravitational collapse resulting in a thermonuclear detonation that completely destroys the star .
This catastrophic event , known as a Type 1a supernova , releases 10 million times more energy than a nova explosion , or the equivalent of 20 billion , billion , billion megatons of TNT .
Astronomers have previously said that any supernova explosion within 100 light - years of Earth would likely be devastating , but beyond 100 light - years , it 's not known for sure what the effects might be .
However , astronomers have also been keeping an eye on Eta Carinae , a potential supernova about 7,500 light - years away .
One factor , astronomers say , is how powerful a given supernova is .
Sion and his colleagues analyzed the far ultraviolet spectrum of the T Pyxidis system and put the observation in computer models of white dwarfs to better pin down the star 's potential to go supernova .
The observations suggest that the white dwarf is very close to reaching the Chandrasekhar Limit in mass .
And observations of the shells of material ejected by the star during its previous smaller nova eruptions also suggest that the star 's mass is increasing with time , suggesting that in about 10 million years , it could have accreted enough mass from its partner to go supernova .
However , if the star is bigger and taking on mass faster than scientists think , it could explode sooner .
Ever wondered why your BlackBerry seems to get different battery life than your fellow smartphone users ' devices ?
How long your BlackBerry smartphone lasts on a single charge depends on a variety of factors .
Your specific device model , size of the battery pack , whether or not your handheld uses 3G networks , if it employs Wi-Fi and / or Bluetooth , and whether or not you 're using it in a strong coverage area are just a few parts of the equation .
BlackBerry Bold Batteries
So how do you ensure that you 're using your BlackBerry battery as effectively as possible ?
The true key to maximizing your BlackBerry battery - life is gaining an understanding of what features and functionality drain battery power when , and why .
Then you need to reduce unnecessary drain .
I published the precursor to this post almost two years ago , and in that piece I offered five basic battery - life tips for BlackBerry users .
I suggest you check out this initial story before moving on to the following tips , as a number of the new , advanced suggestions you 'll find below are based on advice I provided in that older article .
Go ahead , I 'm not going anywhere .
Ready ?
Cooool .
After digesting those earlier tips , you 'll be well - suited to move on to this next , more advanced set of recommendations .
Your BlackBerry battery 's not gaining any juice just sitting there ; let 's go .
1 ) Be Prepared
The Boy Scouts were really onto something with the whole " Be Prepared " thing .
This sentiment sums up the whole practice of maximizing your BlackBerry battery life , because if you 're always prepared from what 's coming next , you 're a hell of a lot more likely to have a charged up BlackBerry battery to accompany you to whatever that task may be .
First on the list of preparations : A BlackBerry travel charger .
I 'd rather leave my home without my AmEx card than my spare BlackBerry charger .
In fact , I have one spare charger in my car , two more at my home and work desks , another in my laptop bag and one more beside my bedside , so my device is always " fresh " when I wake every morning .
Next up : Spare batteries .
I currently own four compatible batteries for my BlackBerry 9700 -- it certainly did n't hurt that the BlackBerry 9700 employs the same battery as the Bold 9000 , my last device .
I carry two fully - charged batteries in my laptop bag , one in my vehicle and another spare is sitting in a home - office desk drawer as I write this .
And two of those batteries are extended power - packs from smartphone - accessory - maker , Seidio .
BlackBerry Bold 9700 in RIM Charge Pod
I also have BlackBerry charge pods on both my desks , which are meant for convenience , but they 've quickly become one of my favorite BlackBerry add - ons .
The charge pods are simple cradles you plug into a wall outlet or USB port on your computer and then just drop in your device whenever it needs power .
The point of all this : I keep a spare battery and a charger in all of the places where I 'm most likely to need them if my current battery runs out .
And you should too .
BlackBerry batteries really are n't expensive , especially if you 're using an older handheld - - neither are chargers .
And the $ 20 or so you 'll need to drop to pick one up will seem well worth it when you actually need a replacement battery .
I usually go to Amazon.com for my BlackBerry battery needs .
It 's also a very good habit to charge your device whenever possible , even if you still have 50 percent or more battery - life left .
I 'm more likely to charge my device while working using one of the above - mentioned pods , because I 've become used to seeing the digital clock that displays once my device is placed in the cradle .
This helps me to remember to charge frequently .

2 ) Avoid Excessive Game Play or Media Consumption
The latest generation of BlackBerry smartphones has impressive multimedia features that let you download , store and listen to and / or view a wide - variety of media types .
You can listen to music on your microSD card ; stream live NBA basketball games via the popular NBA Game Time app ; listen to your favorite artists via a number of different Internet radio offerings ; or play handfuls of games you downloaded from RIM's BlackBerry App World .
Pandora for BlackBerry
But each and every one of those activities drains significant BlackBerry battery - life , and you'd be wise to minimize use of most of them if you 're trying to save power .
That 's not to say you can't brush up on your blackjack skills by playing a card - game app on the flight to Vegas .
Or take advantage of Slacker Radio 's cool song - caching features so you can listen to Internet radio at the same time , without an Internet connection .
But you should be aware that such applications , especially apps that constantly stream data over wireless connections , are very likely eating up battery life like hungry gamblers at a casino buffet .
Many of these apps also require that you keep your display turned on while you use them , so the screen backlight is also draining battery every time you hit or stand in blackjack .
You should use data - or battery - intensive applications wisely , especially if you 're not carrying spare batteries or do n't plan to have access to a charger in the near future .
3 ) Understand and Maximize Your Use of Wireless Connections
I touched on this point in my initial BlackBerry battery life tips story , so I wo n't spend too much time here .
But there are two more advanced suggestions I want to add .
You can easily activate or deactivate your BlackBerry wireless connections by clicking your " Manage Connections " icon and then choosing which options you desire -- Mobile network " on " ; Wi - Fi " off " ; and Bluetooth " on , " for example .
BlackBerry Mobile Network Options Screen
But you can also turn off all data connections while still leaving the voice - capabilities active .
To do so , open the " Manage Connections " options , click the " Services Status " item and then click your BlackBerry Menu key , which is located directly to the left of your trackball / trackpad .
Next , choose Mobile Network Options from the menu , and on the following screen , deactivate Data Services .
Note : Turning off your data services will save battery - life , but it will disable most of your device 's core functionality -- anything that requires an Internet connection -- so beware .
The only core features that will work with data services disabled will be voice calls and SMS messaging .
( I also find this trick helpful during vacations or off - time when I still want to be able to make calls , but do n't want to check my e-mail . )
When you want to turn your data back on , just reverse the above - described process and turn the Data Services .
option back to On .
If you 're using a 3G GSM device , like either BlackBerry Bold , you can also turn off your faster 3G connection for a less battery - intensive 2.5G , or EDGE , connection .
Just click your Manage Connections icon again , hit Mobile Network Options and scroll down to Network Mode .
In the Network Mode menu , choose " 2G . "
But remember , you wo n't be able to access your 3G network until you reactivate that network mode .
4 ) Close Unused Applications -- Even if You Reopen Them Soon
Again , I addressed this point in my initial BlackBerry battery - life tips - post , but I 'm taking it a step further here .
BlackBerry Application Switcher Ribbon
Many BlackBerry applications utilize RIM 's respected " push " technology , which brings messages , notifications and alerts to your device almost instantly after the corresponding service receives them .
That 's all fine and good -- except for the fact that it takes battery life to initiative the transactions and receive new data .
The more apps you have open that use some sort of auto - update process , the more battery life those apps are eating up .
So while my initial related tip was merely to close all " power - hogging " apps when they 're not in use , today I 'm suggesting you close ALL apps when you 're not employing them .
You wo n't receive updates or notifications , but you can always just reopen a specific app if you want to check it .
This also goes for IM applications , like BeeJive or IM + , which many BlackBerry users leaving running constantly .
If you 're a heavy IM user , this tip may not play out for you .
But if you 're like me and rarely use IM via BlackBerry , except to initiate a quick conversation , you 'll be better off leaving your IM apps deactivated until you need them .
A quick way to determine which apps are running at a given time is to open up your BlackBerry Application Switcher ribbon by holding down the BlackBerry Menu key - - directly to the left of your trackball / trackpad - - for a few seconds .
The core BlackBerry phone , browser , messages , BlackBerry Messenger and home screen icon cannot be closed , but anything else that shows up in your app switcher can be shutdown via the application menus .
5 ) Standby Mode is Your Friend
You can quickly and easily put many BlackBerry devices into " Standby Mode " to conserve battery life when not in use , among other things .
Standby Mode is different than the BlackBerry screen / keypad lock in that it not only freezes your device keyboard , but also deactivates your display , saving power .
You activate Standby Mode in different ways depending on your BlackBerry device , but some new devices can be put into standby by simply holding the Mute key on the top right or left of the device .
For example , I put my BlackBerry Bold 9700 into standby every time it goes into my pocket by holding the Mute key on the top - right of the device .
( Check your owner 's manual or search Google if you can't determine how to activate standby on your specific handset .
Note :
As far as I know , the Storm2 does not have a Standby Mode . )
You 'll need to push the Mute key again -- or reenter whatever key combo activates standby -- to turn it off .
So if you find that your device is on but wo n't start up when you press keys , ensure it 's not in standby .
6 ) Disable Your Camera 's Flash
If you employ your BlackBerry 's digital camera frequently , but want to conserve battery life , you can turn off or adjust your camera 's flash .
Using the flash once or twice probably wo n't have too much of an impact on your battery life .
But repeated use is sure to take a toll .
BlackBerry Camera Options Screen
To modify your camera 's flash settings , open the BlackBerry camera app by clicking on the Camera Icon on your BlackBerry home screen .
When the camera view finder is open , click your BlackBerry Menu key , hit Options and change the Default Flash Setting to " No . "
Hit your Escape key to exit out of the Options menu , save your changes , and your flash will be turned off the next time you open the camera .
To turn it back on , simply reverse the process .

Attractive women have higher expectations , the research suggested
Attractive women may have the competitive edge by letting their temper flare more , research suggests .
Researchers found women who rated themselves as pretty displayed a war - like streak when fighting battles to get their own way .
The University of California interviewed 156 female students to gauge their temperament and how they handled conflict .
The findings appear in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
In the study , the women who believed they were good looking were more likely to respond angrily in disputes than those who rated themselves as less attractive .
Attractive women also had higher expectations of what they deserved .
Survival of the fittest
These were strategies that appeared to work because the same women were better at resolving situations in their favour .
When the researchers , led by Dr Aaron Sell , scrutinised the findings further , they found how attractive other people rated the women also tallied .
And so did hair colour - with blondes rated as more attractive than brunettes and redheads .
The researchers believe the findings have an evolutionary basis , ensuring that the " fittest " people mate and have offspring .
In men , they found a similar link but with physical strength rather than attractiveness per se .
Consultant psychologist Ingrid Collins , of The London Medical Centre , said the latest findings were interesting but should be interpreted with caution .
" This is a small study on a very limited sample group so it is not possible to generalise . "
19 January 2010 : This story has been revised after Dr Sell made clear to the BBC that his research had set out to test the link between temperament and attractiveness , rather than hair colour , for which he said the link was weaker .
No-self or Not-self ?
Thanissaro Bhikkhu
One of the first stumbling blocks that Westerners often encounter when they learn about Buddhism is the teaching on anatta , often translated as no-self .
This teaching is a stumbling block for two reasons .
First , the idea of there being no self does n't fit well with other Buddhist teachings , such as the doctrine of kamma and rebirth :
If there 's no self , what experiences the results of kamma and takes rebirth ?
Second , it does n't fit well with our own Judeo - Christian background , which assumes the existence of an eternal soul or self as a basic presupposition :
If there 's no self , what 's the purpose of a spiritual life ?
Many books try to answer these questions , but if you look at the Pali Canon -- the earliest extant record of the Buddha 's teachings -- you wo n't find them addressed at all .
In fact , the one place where the Buddha was asked point - blank whether or not there was a self , he refused to answer .
When later asked why , he said that to hold either that there is a self or that there is no self is to fall into extreme forms of wrong view that make the path of Buddhist practice impossible .
Thus the question should be put aside .
To understand what his silence on this question says about the meaning of anatta , we first have to look at his teachings on how questions should be asked and answered , and how to interpret his answers .
The Buddha divided all questions into four classes : those that deserve a categorical ( straight yes or no ) answer ; those that deserve an analytical answer , defining and qualifying the terms of the question ; those that deserve a counter - question , putting the ball back in the questioner 's court ; and those that deserve to be put aside .
The last class of question consists of those that do n't lead to the end of suffering and stress .
The first duty of a teacher , when asked a question , is to figure out which class the question belongs to , and then to respond in the appropriate way .
You do n't , for example , say yes or no to a question that should be put aside .
If you are the person asking the question and you get an answer , you should then determine how far the answer should be interpreted .
The Buddha said that there are two types of people who misrepresent him : those who draw inferences from statements that should n't have inferences drawn from them , and those who do n't draw inferences from those that should .
These are the basic ground rules for interpreting the Buddha 's teachings , but if we look at the way most writers treat the anatta doctrine , we find these ground rules ignored .
Some writers try to qualify the no-self interpretation by saying that the Buddha denied the existence of an eternal self or a separate self , but this is to give an analytical answer to a question that the Buddha showed should be put aside .
Others try to draw inferences from the few statements in the discourse that seem to imply that there is no self , but it seems safe to assume that if one forces those statements to give an answer to a question that should be put aside , one is drawing inferences where they should n't be drawn .
So , instead of answering " no " to the question of whether or not there is a self -- interconnected or separate , eternal or not -- the Buddha felt that the question was misguided to begin with .
Why ?
No matter how you define the line between " self " and " other , " the notion of self involves an element of self - identification and clinging , and thus suffering and stress .
This holds as much for an interconnected self , which recognizes no " other , " as it does for a separate self .
If one identifies with all of nature , one is pained by every felled tree .
It also holds for an entirely " other " universe , in which the sense of alienation and futility would become so debilitating as to make the quest for happiness -- one 's own or that of others -- impossible .
For these reasons , the Buddha advised paying no attention to such questions as " Do I exist ? " or " Do n't I exist ? " for however you answer them , they lead to suffering and stress .
To avoid the suffering implicit in questions of " self " and " other , " he offered an alternative way of dividing up experience : the four Noble Truths of stress , its cause , its cessation , and the path to its cessation .
Rather than viewing these truths as pertaining to self or other , he said , one should recognize them simply for what they are , in and of themselves , as they are directly experienced , and then perform the duty appropriate to each .
Stress should be comprehended , its cause abandoned , its cessation realized , and the path to its cessation developed .
These duties form the context in which the anatta doctrine is best understood .
If you develop the path of virtue , concentration , and discernment to a state of calm well - being and use that calm state to look at experience in terms of the Noble Truths , the questions that occur to the mind are not " Is there a self ?
What is my self ? " but rather " Am I suffering stress because I 'm holding onto this particular phenomenon ?
Is it really me , myself , or mine ?
If it 's stressful but not really me or mine , why hold on ? "
These last questions merit straightforward answers , as they then help you to comprehend stress and to chip away at the attachment and clinging -- the residual sense of self - identification -- that cause it , until ultimately all traces of self - identification are gone and all that 's left is limitless freedom .
In this sense , the anatta teaching is not a doctrine of no-self , but a not - self strategy for shedding suffering by letting go of its cause , leading to the highest , undying happiness .
At that point , questions of self , no -self , and not - self fall aside .
Once there 's the experience of such total freedom , where would there be any concern about what 's experiencing it , or whether or not it 's a self ?

Hydrogels are novel materials with properties unlike those of normal polymers , but their potential applications have remained limited to small niches .
A team of researchers from Japan aims to change that , and has discovered a new approach to hydrogels that yielded a trifecta of increased mechanical strength , easy preparation , and possible green - tech implications .
Hydrogels , as the name should imply , are mostly water ( as much as 99 percent ) , and have a consistency that is best described as — you guessed it — a gel .
This makes them a great candidate for novel biomedical applications like time - released targeted drug delivery and artificial tissues , because we 're mostly water , too .
However , this makes them less useful for pretty much everything else outside of the body .
They are often vulnerable to solvents and , as you might have noticed , there are n't many items that actively rely on Jell - O as a structural component .
The researchers turned what might be a problem into a solution .
The large , branchy dendritic polymer macromolecule they were working with had a tendency to adhere quite strongly to glass .
So the researchers investigated its interactions with clay , which shares some properties with glass .
Using an additional chemical that disperses clay nanosheets in water , they were able to get their dendritic macromolecule to form a structural framework with the the clay .
The hydrophilic portion of the framework attracts and retains water molecules .
This notably improved mechanical properties over other hydrogels , as it could be molded into shapes that are free - standing and relatively robust and would undergo self - healing when cut .
Less than 0.4 percent of it is petroleum - derived , so improved versions may provide an appealing green alternative to polymers .
The best aspect , however , may be its simplicity : all you need are three ingredients , a beaker of water , and something to stir with .

PALMDALE , Calif . -- Schoolteacher Shana Richey misses the playroom she decorated with Glamour Girl decals for her daughters .
Fireman Jay Fernandez misses the custom putting green he installed in his backyard .
But ever since they quit paying their mortgages and walked away from their homes , they 've discovered that giving up on the American dream has its benefits .
Both now live on the 3100 block of Club Rancho Drive in Palmdale , where a terrible housing market lets them rent luxurious homes -- one with a pool for the kids , the other with a golf - course view -- for a fraction of their former monthly payments .
" It 's just a better life .
It really is , " says Ms. Richey .
Before defaulting on her mortgage , she owed about $ 230,000 more than the home was worth .
People 's increasing willingness to abandon their own piece of America illustrates a paradoxical change wrought by the housing bust :
Even as it tarnishes the near - sacred image of home ownership , it might be clearing the way for an economic recovery .
" I'm a loser , I 'm a loser ,
And I 'm not what I appear to be "
— The Beatles , " I'm A Loser "
Is it just me or are the Democrats a pathetic bunch of losers who are too spineless to stand up forcefully for anything they believe in ?
Well , I know it 's not just me because Jon Stewart did a great piece on them earlier this week in which he pointed out , with much - deserved contempt , that they still have 59 out of 100 seats in the Senate , yet they act as if they 'll now be incapable of doing anything at all because they 've lost their 60 - seat filibuster - proof majority .
To listen to the Democrats ( and the media ) talk , after the loss this week of Ted Kennedy 's old Senate seat in Massachusetts to Republican Scott Brown , there 's almost nothing they can accomplish now .
They 've lost all power and control .
They 've lost their ability to govern .
The Republicans are once more back in charge in Washington .
And just one year into Obama 's mandate too .
Oh my , what on earth are they going to do ?
Well , they could , as the saying goes , grow a pair .
As Stewart so rightly pointed out , the Republicans have n't had a 59 - seat majority in the Senate since the 1920s , yet they have absolutely no problem ramming all sorts of nasty stuff through both houses of Congress whenever they have their man in the White House .
Did Ronald Reagan or George Dubya Bush ever care what the opposition thought as they rammed their agendas through both houses of Congress ?
Hell no !
For the most part , they did just what they pleased .
They forced radical right - wing change on the country and launched all sorts of foreign policy escapades throughout the world .
And , amazingly , while Reagan was in power the Republicans never once controlled both houses of Congress , yet he was still able to force through his " Reagan Revolution " with relative ease .
Not Barack Obama , he can't force through a thing , even though his party does , in fact , enjoy big majorities in both houses of Congress .
The man seems obsessed with bipartisanship and compromise above all else , even if it means accomplishing nothing .
No matter what he does , no matter how far he moves to the right in an attempt to win them over , the Republicans always vote en bloc against him .
But he keeps on dreaming that they 'll come around to the whole idea of compromise .
Well , I think everyone , except Obama and his inner circle , can see that the Republicans have no interest in compromise .
I mean , everyone can see this , right ?
Come on Obama !
I mean , WTF ?
The guy 's way too smart to be this stupid !
The Republicans tell him he has to move to the center and after he compromises and moves closer to their position they all vote against him .
He 's a bit like Charlie Brown and that infamous football .
When will he stop being so naive ?
When will he stop being such a pushover ?
Obama 's First Year
Has his first year been disappointing ?
Disappointing is n't the half of it .
Hope and change my ass !
How about , " Hopefully I can change something if the Republicans agree ? "
The guy promised to close Guantanamo Bay within a year .
Those plans are on hold indefinitely .
He was going to get rid of the military 's homophobic " Do n't Ask , Don't Tell " policy .
No word on whether that 'll ever happen .
He was going to bring back some common sense regulation to Wall Street .
That still has n't been implemented .
Then there was the promise to pass cap and trade legislation to combat climate change .
Still has n't happened .
And , above all else , he was going to bring America into the civilized world by making universal medical coverage a reality .
Instead he 's spent most of his time trying to bring Republicans , or at least some Republicans , on board , and it's been a colossal failure in the sense that the Republicans have wound up controlling the discussion and have convinced a majority of Americans that this whole healthcare reform thing is nothing but a socialist conspiracy .
Sometimes it seems like the guy 's simply too naive to understand that all the Republicans really care about is opposing everything he stands for in order to make him look weak and ineffectual , so that he can be defeated in 2012 .
And , sadly , it 's a plan that seems to be working .
Again — it can't be stated strongly enough — Obama has big Democratic majorities in both houses and he still can't seem to get a thing through .
It 's mindboggling .
Why run on a platform if you 're unwilling to ram it through once you come to power with a clear mandate for change ?
Ever since taking office , Obama has seemed far more focused on appeasing his enemies than trying to satisfy his own supporters , those who had voted for his agenda .
I just do n't get it .
One thing 's for sure :
The Right never suffers from such indecisiveness .
Perhaps he 's just too nice for any of this " ramming things through " business and as a consequence will accomplish nothing while in office .
As the saying goes : Nice guys finish last .
But , come on people , seriously , if you can't get anything passed with a 59 – 41 seat majority , you might as well give up on governing period .
Long Ago and Far Away
It was n't always like this , however .
There was a time when the Democrats believed in what they believed in enough to think it deserved to be rammed though without trying to appease those reactionaries who were never going to back their agenda no matter how many compromises they may have made .
This magical time was n't all that long ago .
We 're talking about the 1930s and the 1960s and leaders like FDR and LBJ .
When Lyndon Johnson wanted to pass civil rights legislation he did n't let the racists and rednecks in the Senate derail his plan by watering it down till it was almost meaningless , the way Obama has allowed his healthcare reform bill to slowly be dismantled .
The same with FDR and the New Deal .
Sure there were compromises , but they truly believed in what they were trying to do and " compromise " and " bipartisanship " were n't the overriding themes in everything they did , like seems to be the case with Obama .
Ron , Brian , and Maggie
None of this weak - kneed , spineless , migraine - inducing , pathetic , liberal indecisiveness is anything new or unique to Obama , of course .
Not by a long shot .
For years now more progressive types have cowered in fear of the Right as the Right has , ever since the 1980s at least , dominated the Western world 's political discourse .
In the U.K. , for instance , Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979 and radically altered the very core of the nation with her right - wing revolution .
And then when Labour finally regained power in 1997 , under Tony Blair , they were , for all intents and purposes , Thatcherites .
That is , they accepted everything she had done to the country and , aside from a couple of little token measures , failed to roll back a thing .
I 'll say it again : Labour had become Thatcherites .
It 's that simple .
Likewise in America , Reagan rammed through whatever he wanted over an 8 - year period in the 1980s .
And when the Democrats finally regained the White House under Bill Clinton in 1992 they left all of the " Reagan Revolution " intact .
Same thing here in Canada .
During the 1980s and early '90s , the Conservatives under Brian Mulroney won two successive majorities and rammed through just about anything they wanted , none of which was overturned by the Liberals once they came back into power in 1993 , under the leadership of Jean Chrétien , even though they commanded a huge majority in the House of Commons .
It 's a simple pattern : the Right comes in and transforms the country with their " vision " of what is needed ; then the Left regains power and simply accepts the right - wing revolution that has taken place and carries on from there , causing less harm certainly , but in no way forcefully legislating any sort of vision of their own .
Visionless
Think about it for a moment ?
What did Reagan , Thatcher , and Mulroney stand for ?
You probably have a very clear idea , right ?
Now think what did Clinton , Blair , and Chrétien stand for ?
And what did they accomplish ( aside from keeping the right - wingers out of power and thus limiting the damage they could do ) ?
Nothing really ?
Exactly !
Sure , the more progressive types of the past couple of decades are a relatively nice bunch , with a warm , compassionate streak .
I mean , who would n't prefer Clinton over Reagan , or Chrétien over Mulroney , or , most obviously , Obama over Dubya ?
But would n't it be great if they actually had a vision and the fortitude — and , yes , the balls — to ram their agenda through ?
Damn , if I 'm not getting all nostalgic for FDR , Clement Attlee , and Pierre Trudeau .
And , you better believe , none of them are real heroes of mine .
But at least they could get things done — which seems like such an incredible ability when you look at those who lead the centre - left these days .

Baculum of a dog's penis ; the arrow shows the urethral sulcus .
The baculum ( also penis bone , penile bone , or os penis , os genitale [ 1 ] or os priapi [ 2 ] ) is a bone found in the penis of many placental mammals .
It is absent in the human penis , but present in the penises of other primates , such as the gorilla and chimpanzee . [ 3] [ 4 ]
The os penis arises from primordial cells within soft tissues of the penis , and its formation is largely under the influence of androgens .
[ 5 ]
The bone is located above the male urethra , [ 6 ] and it aids sexual reproduction by maintaining sufficient stiffness during sexual penetration .
The homologue to the baculum in female mammals is known as the baubellum or os clitoridis , a bone in the clitoris . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ]
Etymology [ edit ]
The word baculum meant " stick " or " staff " in Latin and originated from Greek : βάκλον , baklon " stick " . [ 10 ]
Function [ edit ]
The baculum is used for copulation and varies in size and shape by species .
Its evolution may be influenced by sexual selection , and its characteristics are sometimes used to differentiate between similar species . [ 11 ]
A bone in the penis allows a male to mate for a long time with a female , [ 12 ] [ 13 ] which can be a distinct advantage in some mating strategies . [ 14 ] [ 15 ]
The length of the baculum may be related to the duration of copulation in some species . [ 16 ] [ 17 ]
In carnivorans and primates , the length of the baculum appears to be influenced by postcopulatory sexual selection . [ 18 ]
In some bat species , the baculum can also protect the urethra from compression . [ 19 ]
Presence in mammals [ edit ]
A raccoon baculum
Mammals having a penile bone ( in males ) and a clitoral bone ( in females ) include various eutherians :
It is absent in humans , ungulates ( hoofed mammals ) , [ 32 ] elephants , monotremes ( platypus , echidna ) [ 33 ] , marsupials , [ 34 ] lagomorphs , [ 23 ] hyenas , [ 35 ] binturongs , [ 24 ] sirenians , [ 6 ] and cetaceans ( whales , dolphins , and porpoises ) , [ 6 ] among others .
Evidence suggests that the baculum was independently evolved 9 times and lost in 10 separate lineages . [ 24 ]
The baculum is an exclusive characteristic of placentals and closely related eutherians , being absent in other mammal clades , and it has been speculated to be derived from the epipubic bones more widely spread across mammals , but notoriously absent in placentals . [ 34 ]
Among the primates , marmosets , [ clarification needed ] weighing around 500 grams ( 18 oz ) , have a baculum measuring around 2 millimetres ( 0.079 in ) , while the tiny 63 g ( 2.2 oz ) galago has one around 13 millimetres ( 0.51 in ) long .
The great apes , despite their size , tend to have very small penis bones , and humans are the only ones to have lost them altogether . [ 15 ]
In some mammalian species , such as badgers [ 36 ] [ 37 ] and raccoons ( Procyon lotor ) , the baculum can be used to determine relative age .
If a raccoon 's baculum tip is made up of uncalcified cartilage , has a porous base , is less than 1.2 g ( 0.042 oz ) in mass , and measures less than 90 mm ( 3.5 in ) long , then the baculum belongs to a juvenile . [ 27 ]
Absence in humans [ edit ]
Unlike most other primates , humans lack an os penis or os clitoris , [ 38 ] [ 39 ] but the bone is present , although much reduced , among the great apes .
In many ape species , it is a relatively insignificant 10 – 20 mm ( 0.39 –0.79 in ) structure .
Cases of human penis ossification following trauma have been reported , [ 40 ] and one case was reported of a congenital os penis surgically removed from a 5 - year - old boy , who also had other developmental abnormalities , including a cleft scrotum . [ 41 ] Clellan S. Ford and Frank A. Beach in Patterns of Sexual Behavior ( 1951 ) , p. 30 say , " Both gorillas and chimpanzees possess a penile bone .
In the latter species , the os penis is located in the lower part of the organ and measures approximately three - quarters of an inch in length . " [ 4 ]
In humans , the rigidity of the erection is provided entirely through blood pressure in the corpora cavernosa .
An " artificial baculum " or penile implant is sometimes used to treat erectile dysfunction in humans . [ 42 ]
The loss of the bone in humans , when it is present in our nearest related species the chimpanzee , is thought to be because humans " evolved a mating system in which the male tended to accompany a particular female all the time to try to ensure paternity of her children " [ 15 ] [ citation needed ] which allows for frequent matings of short duration .
Observation suggests that primates with a baculum only infrequently encounter females , but engage in longer periods of copulation that the baculum makes possible , thereby maximizing their chances of fathering the female 's offspring .
Human females exhibit concealed ovulation also known as hidden estrus , meaning it is almost impossible to tell when the female is fertile , so frequent matings would be necessary to ensure paternity .
[ 15 ] [ 43 ] [ clarification needed ]
It has been speculated that the loss of the bone in humans , when it is present in our nearest related species the chimpanzee , is a result of sexual selection by females looking for honest signals of good health in prospective mates [ citation needed ] .
The reliance of the human penis solely on hydraulic means to achieve a rigid state makes it particularly vulnerable to blood pressure variation [ citation needed ] .
Poor erectile function portrays not only physical states such as age , diabetes , and neurological disorders , but also mental states such as stress and depression .
[ 44 ] [ citation needed ]
A third view is that its loss in humans is an example of neoteny during human evolution ; late - stage fetal chimpanzees lack a baculum . [ 45 ]
Cultural significance [ edit ]
Walrus baculum , around 22 inches ( 59 cm ) long
The existence of the baculum is unlikely to have escaped the notice of pastoralist and hunter - gatherer cultures .
It has been argued that the " rib " ( Hebrew צֵלׇע ṣēlā ' , also translated " flank " or " side " ) in the story of Adam and Eve is actually a mistranslation of a Biblical Hebrew euphemism for baculum , and that its removal from Adam in the Book of Genesis is a creation story to explain this absence ( as well as the presence of the perineal raphe– as a resultant " scar " ) in humans . [ 46 ]
In hoodoo , the folk magic of the American South , the raccoon baculum is sometimes worn as an amulet for love or luck . [ 47 ]
Oosik [ edit ]
Oosik is a term used in Native Alaska cultures to describe the bacula of walruses , seals , sea lions and polar bears .
Sometimes as long as 60 cm ( 24 in ) , fossilized bacula are often polished and used as a handle for knives and other tools .
The oosik is a polished and sometimes carved baculum of these large northern carnivores .
Oosiks are also sold as tourist souvenirs .
In 2007 , a 4.5 ft-long ( 1.4 m ) fossilized penis bone from an extinct species of walrus , believed by the seller to be the largest in existence , was sold for $ 8,000 .

Up until very recently , I expected the Thrashers and Ilya Kovalchuk to come to some sort of agreement .
Recently I 've heard some rumbling that make me more doubtful that he will be re-signed .
If Kovalchuk departs most Thrashers fans will be deeply depressed .
I am not one of those people .
Because of his style of play , I 've never thought Ilya Kovalchuk was the sort of guy you could build a Stanley Cup contender around .
As a fan , my number one goal is to see Lord Stanley 's Cup awarded to my team in June before I die .
Seeing Kovalchuk exit stage right could actually speed up the process of getting closer to Lord Stanley .
Whether the Thrashers get closer or further from Lord Stanley largely depends on how the team reacts .
There are many things that are difficult to predict in professional sports .
But one thing that is predictable is that young players improve on average and old players decline .
If the Thrashers react to Kovalchuk 's departure by adding a bunch of over - 32 veterans then I might just give up on this team .
However , the team could leverage Ilya 's departure into a very exciting young team that could contend in a couple of years -- here 's my plan to construct the next the first Thrashers Cup contender .
Step One : Leverage Kovalchuk , Maxim Afinogenov and Colby Armstrong into draft picks and quality players under age 30 .
The ideal situation would be something like this , you trade Kovalchuk and Afinogenov to the LA Kings for Dustin Brown , Jack Johnson and future considerations .
Dustin Brown is a very underrated player .
He consistently leads the NHL in penalties drawn .
He hits people and they retaliate which gives his team more Power Play opportunities .
If Dustin Brown got credit for all the Power Play Goals he brings to his team his stats would look much more flashy .
Jack Johnson is a great skating defenseman who also loves to hit .
With this trade the Thrashers would become a much more physical team ( something needed in playoff hockey ) .
When you think about Evander Kane maturing into a power forward over the next years and the arrival of hard hitting Carl Klingberg - - holy cow !!
Brown , Johnson , Kane and Klingberg are a quartet that could physically intimidate the opposition for the next half decade ... a very exciting thought .
Step Two : Everyone around the NHL knows that the salary cap will remain flat or perhaps even decline slightly .
Everyone in the NHL also knows that the Chicago Blackhawks need to toss overboard $ 9 million in salary just to get under the cap after re-signing their young stars .
Chicago needs to trade Versteeg , Barker and Byfulgien for non-NHL considerations ( prospects and picks ) .
The Thrashers will have loads of cap room -- they need to be the team where this talent lands .
Trade the picks obtained in dealing Afinogenov and Armstrong at the deadline ( and picks for the weak 2011 Draft ) and get this deal done .
Step Three : Todd
White is in the final year of his contract and adds neither scoring nor hitting to the team .
Frankly every game he plays is a waste of ice time that ought to go to a young player who might be part of the next great Thrashers team .
Signing a Todd White to a four year deal that paid him into his late 30s was a bad idea from the start .
Buyout his final year and free up a roster spot to give ice time to a younger player who might be part of the next contending Thrashers squad .
Step Four : Assuming the Thrashers have a team payroll of $ 52 - 54 million ( including all potential bonuses ) , the team will have $ 5 - 7 million to spend on two free agent forwards .
For the sake of filling in that blank spot , I have the team signing UFA Alexander Frolov for $ 5 million .
To be honest I 'm not sure how much Frolov will receive on the UFA market or if he is a good fit a tougher version of the Thrashers .
If not Frolov , my budget leaves a big chunk of salary for a 1st line caliber player to be added to the roster .
Final Roster : The Thrashers have show an increased appreciation for the age curve in recent years .
My hypothetical roster would be a massive step in exploiting the career curve .
The vast majority of the roster would either be in the rising part of the age curve ( 18 - 24 ) or the peak years part of the age curve ( 25 - 30 ) leaving just on player ( Marty Reasoner ) on the decline side of the age curve .
Some people might argue this is too much youth , in which case you can swap out the money I have allocated to Frolov and spend it on a sage veteran type .

Now here 's the real kicker , this Post - Kovalchuk roster would be cheaper than the current Thrashers team that is currently sitting out of a playoff position .
It is a cheaper team and a team with a much greater upside over the next 5 year window .
This is the type of young foundation needed to construct a Cup contender .
Furthermore this $ 52 million roster is well under the cap which leaves open the possibility of adding talent and salary at the trade deadline in they are in contention .
In the long run it also leaves room for pay increases to emerging stars like Bogosian and Kane as the hit their 2nd NHL contracts .
This Post - Kovalchuk team projects to score fewer goals -- but they would only drop from 7th to 11th in offense .
The offense projection is likely going to UNDER estimate the team 's offensive production because on average young players will meet or exceed their career average as they develop and hit their peak years .
It is entirely possible that a young Post - Kovalchuk roster could actually match or exceed the production of the current team that contains Ilya in a year or two as the talent matures .
The gains on defense are much harder to estimate but simply removing Kovalchuk from the lineup would improve the defensive side of things ( harsh but true ) .
Adding in hard - hitting tough - nosed player like Dustin Brown and Jack Johnson would certainly make playing against Atlanta a lot less fun for soft opposition players .
The arrival of Carl Klingberg and physical maturation of Evander Kane will amplify this physical dimension of the team ( which is largely missing from the current version of the Atlanta Thrashers ) .
Conclusion : Trading away Ilya Kovalchuk will be excruciating to many Thrashers , but every low point is also a potential turning point .
Two years ago the Thrashers were one of the oldest teams in the NHL and needed a full - scale rebuild .
If the team can make a few crucial moves they can complete the youth movement and construct the foundation of genuine Cup contender .
Can the team turn lead into gold ?
Can they covert a crisis into a transformational moment ?
This trade is going to hurt many fans -- MAKE IT COUNT !!!

Just in time for TED ’s holiday break , we ’re excited to announce a feature we ’re launching , today , on TED.com .
It ’s called Best of the Web , and just like the rest of TED.com , it involves riveting talks by remarkable people .
But unlike TEDTalks , these talks do n’t come from TED or any of our partner conferences .
These talks come from all over the Web .
We ’ll draw from any source — from lectures at little - known forums to famous speeches that made history — so long as the video is available for free , and so long as the talk meets our most important benchmark : that it ’s an Idea Worth Spreading .
Over the next weeks and months , you ’ll see the Best of the Web collection grow to include a large variety of great talks on technology , entertainment , design and all the other topics you can find on TED.com .
We ’ll actively seek out great talks and performances , but we also want your help !
We hope you ’ll forward us any gem you think we should include in the collection — no matter how obscure or well - known it is .
Simply email contact@ted.com with “ Best of the Web suggestion ” in the subject line , and a link to where the talk can be seen .
You might be wondering why we ’re featuring video from outside TED .
Here are a few of our reasons :
To highlight all ideas worth spreading — whatever their source , wherever they emerge .
To bring exposure to great talks that might not otherwise have found a wide audience .
To create a more comprehensive network of ideas , linked and tagged in a way that allows cross-referencing .
To show how big ideas from the past are still relevant today .
To give our online TED community the chance to participate together in the conversation about these talks .
Every Best of the Web talk will get its own page on TED.com , complete with all the tools that accompany TEDTalks : recommendations for similar or relevant talks , information about the speakers , and ways to quickly share the talk with your social network .
Most importantly , each will have its own commenting section , so you can discuss these talks within the TED community .
Note : The Best of the Web talks will not interrupt or diminish the daily flow of TEDTalks .
We hope you ’ll explore our ( for the moment , tiny ) collection of the very Best of the Web .
And we hope you ’ll bookmark the page and check back soon , as we ’ll be adding more .
Enjoy , and Happy Holidays !

" Never travel without a wire coathanger . "
For some reason that 's the one instruction that stayed in my head after a week 's training in how to survive as a reporter in a war zone .
You fold the hanger so it fits in a shirt pocket and if ever you stray into a Balkan minefield , you have what it takes to scrape away topsoil and expose landmines so that you can slide out on your stomach .
Since the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan this 1990s piece of advice seems to belong to the era of Scoop .
Now not even an MRAP – mine - resistant ambush - protected vehicle – is a guarantee of protection for reporters in Afghanistan .
Two western journalists embedded with US forces there have been killed in separate roadside bombings in the past month .
The deaths cap a horrendous year for the media .
Seventy journalists were killed around the world in 2009 , the highest toll ever recorded by the Committee to Protect Journalists in its nearly 30 - year history .
That fact alone must send a chill through newsrooms .
It was not that long ago that foreign editors and bureau chiefs , including me , would send reporters off to war zones with little more than a press pass and their own wits for protection .
Now , no western news executive would dare dispatch a reporter or TV crew to cover conflict unless they had received " hostile environment " training and been fitted out with high - tech personal protection gear and communications .
In the past decade or so , Britain has become a leader in training journalists and humanitarian workers for deployment in conflict zones .
Private security companies , many employing former SAS members and Royal Marine commandos , train reporters in the UK and their home countries .
The recipients of this lifesaving knowledge tend to be those working for news outlets with deep pockets .
A one - week residential course such as the one I took with the coathanger sapper can cost thousands of pounds .
As we saw in Iraq , when western journalists begin to die , news media rely on local journalists .
Those who are contracted as fixers ( guides , interpreters , field producers etc ) by foreign journalists are increasingly receiving safety training .
But reporters working for small local outlets are often left to their own devices .
For example , Somalia witnessed nine journalists ' deaths last year , among them many from a small band of courageous radio journalists who tried to keep news on the airwaves despite the general mayhem of a civil war and targeted threats from the al - Shabaab Islamist fighters who wanted independent FM stations silenced .
International journalist associations and NGOs also provide free or low - cost training to journalists in developing countries but demand still outstrips supply .
Despite all the safety training and heightened awareness , journalists ' deaths are on the rise .
Some of the reporters who were among the 57 people mown down in a jungle ambush in the southern Philippines in November had received security training .
At least 29 journalists and two media workers were killed that day accompanying a convoy of supporters bound for the provincial capital of Maguindanao to file candidacy papers for a local political leader contesting the provincial governorship .
The journalists deliberately travelled in a large group believing it would improve their security .
They had also telephoned a senior local military commander ahead of time to request security , which was not provided .
These reporters knew they were working in a dangerous place and tried to mitigate the risk .
But the danger for reporters in the Philippines is compounded by the ongoing failure of the state to protect the press by prosecuting those who kill journalists .
CPJ ranks the Philippines as the worst peace - time democracy in the world because of its abysmal record of solving journalists ' murders .
When law enforcement turns a blind eye it encourages those who are the subject of investigative reporting to hire an assassin rather than a libel lawyer .
It 's often cheaper and more effective .
Murder is the surest form of censorship .
For all the unfortunate deaths of prominent journalists in war zones , most reporters are not killed covering combat .
Some 75 % of journalist deaths are targeted murder .
In countries like Mexico , Russia or the Philippines not only are journalists assassinated , their killers are rarely brought to justice .
Journalists are intimidated into avoiding certain stories .
The public , deprived of vital information , is the loser .
In the towns along the US - Mexican border , for example , many media outlets have given up trying to cover organised crime in any depth .
Too many reporters have been abducted , tortured and killed , and their bodies dumped in the public square as a warning to others not to write about drug cartels .
So how do we avoid another year in which 70 journalists die ?
More and better security training is certainly part of the answer .
Reporters are not going to stop going to Afghanistan or the Horn of Africa .
That 's just what they do .
If it gets too dangerous to move among the local population , foreign journalists will embed with the military .
Or , as in the case of Iraq at the height of the fighting between 2004 and 2008 , they will work from guarded compounds and rely on local reporters as their eyes and ears on the street .
It 's essential that the media companies who engage those local journalists provide them with all the training and equipment that they would give to western employees .
Body armour is no guarantee of safety and some local journalists may not want to wear it because it identifies them as working for foreigners .
But they should have the choice .
It 's also vital that individual freelancers , who may not have the requisite awareness of the local security and political landscape , do n't expose local fixers to danger .
Foreign reporters who are detained by militias or security forces for covering conflict are usually released and go home .
Their journalist guides , interpreters and drivers sometimes do n't have that luxury .
The other key component in reducing media deaths is the battle to end the culture of impunity .
It 's daunting when you look at cynicism that lies behind the assassinations of journalists in Russia or Mexico .
But CPJ 's campaign against impunity has begun to notch up a few small successes .
Since we took the campaign to the Philippines two years ago , we have helped win changes of venue in the trials of several suspects accused of involvement in journalists ' murders , allowing witnesses to testify without fear of intimidation .
We also secured a commitment last September from Russian authorities to see investigations into all 17 journalists murders documented in a special report by CPJ , brought to a successful conclusion .
We will be back in Moscow in nine months to hold them to their word .
I know there is a lot of frustration in the blogosphere right now because President Obama has not been kind to liberals and progressives .
And I understand the frustration of it all too well .
I still can't figure out why Axelrod and the President do n't seem to understand how important their base is .
But as C&L and many other sites wrote during the primary , Obama was never a progressive , but a moderate Democratic politician .
I 've been blogging for five years non -stop to move this country away from conservatism that has been the great destroyer of our society .
Chris Hayes at The Nation has a great article up describing the mess that is our political system and what we face as progressives :
System Failure
The corporatism on display in Washington is itself a symptom of a broader social illness that I noted above , a democracy that is pitched precariously on the tipping point of oligarchy .
In an oligarchy , the only way to get change is to convince the oligarchs that it is in their interest -- and increasingly , that 's the only kind of change we can get .
In 1911 the German democratic socialist Robert Michels faced a similar problem , and it was the impetus for his classic book Political Parties .
He was motivated by a simple question : why were parties of the left , those most ideologically committed to democracy and participation , as oligarchical in their functioning as the self - consciously elitist and aristocratic parties of the right ?
Michels 's answer was what he called " The Iron Law of Oligarchy . "
In order for any kind of party or , indeed , any institution with a democratic base to exist , it must have an organization that delegates tasks .
As this bureaucratic structure develops , it invests a small group of people with enough power that they can then subvert the very mechanisms by which they can be held to account : the party press , party conventions and delegate votes .
" It is organization which gives birth to the domination of the elected over the electors , " he wrote , " of the mandataries over the mandators , of the delegates over the delegators .
Who says organization , says oligarchy . "
Michels recognized the challenge his work presented to his comrades on the left and viewed the task of democratic socialists as a kind of noble , endless , Sisyphean endeavor , which he described by invoking a German fable .
In it , a dying peasant tells his sons that he has buried a treasure in their fields .
" After the old man 's death the sons dig everywhere in order to discover the treasure .
They do not find it .
But their indefatigable labor improves the soil and secures for them a comparative well - being . "
" The treasure in the fable may well symbolize democracy , " Michels wrote .
" Democracy is a treasure which no one will ever discover by deliberate search .
But in continuing our search , in laboring indefatigably to discover the undiscoverable , we shall perform a work which will have fertile results in the democratic sense . "
Digby writes :
It 's indisputably true that the political system is run by wealthy plutocrats and much of what passes for democracy is kabuki .
Same as it ever was , I 'm afraid .
But that 's not exactly the point .
It 's still worth participating , doing what you can , containing the damage , stopping the bleeding , fighting the fight --- for its own sake .
After all , history shows that humans have managed , somehow , to actually make progress over time .
You just can't know what will make the difference .
There 's an impulse to say screw it all and not show up anymore because " they 're all the same , " but I can't do that .
For the most part , politicians will let us down because they are ... well , politicians , but they are n't all the same .
There have been plenty of books written about Florida in 2000 .
If ballots had been properly labeled so that voters who wanted Gore instead of Pat Buchanan could have done so , we might have had a more fair election .
And then the Supreme Court would have been left to watch election night like the rest of us and Bush would n't have entered the White House in 2000 .
Think of what that would have meant for the country :
The Bush tax cuts for the wealthy would never have been a reality .
I doubt we would have had the attacks of 9/11 because President Clinton warned that the greatest threat America would face was terrorism and Gore would have not ignored him like Bush did .
But if we did get attacked , then you can bet that Gore would have handled it as an adult .
He would n't sought " revenge " against Saddam Hussein and prioritized control of all that oil .
Gore would n't have let Osama Bin Laden get away and the world would still be sympathetic to us .
Our efforts to put Afghanistan back together would be finished by now , assuming we even would have tried nation - building there .
More troops and people would be alive and we would have exited the Middle East with our heads held high .
America would never have invaded and occupied Iraq and over 4,000 troops and hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians ( if not millions ) would be alive today .
Abu Ghraib would never have happened .
Terrorist recruitment would have stalled .
Torture would not be part of the American lexicon and the likes of Dick Cheney and John Yoo would never have descended upon the offices of the VP and OLC .
John Roberts and Sam Alito would not be on the Supreme Court and the makeup would probably be 6 - 3 against the radical Scalia - conservative agenda .
A ruling on Citizens United is coming soon .
Would the court ever have accepted that case ?
Not a chance and soon corporations will have a stranglehold on our election system much more than they have now .
George Bush would have been back home in Texas leading the state into secession along with his pal Alberto Gonzalez .
Nobody would have ever heard of Terry Schiavo .
A much swifter and more effective response to Hurricane Katrina would have been implemented .
You get my point .
These are but a few things that would have been different if conservatives did n't get their hands on the White House .
Many of us are fighting for liberal and progressive values everyday and will continue to do so .
But when our party fails us , I need to work harder to make sure the party stays on a liberal course , not throw up my hands and dismiss them as all the same .
And in the spirit of that though we need to hold the party establishment accountable .
As Digby says there are a number of great progressive challengers already taking on DLC incumbents and we 're going to send them a message that 's loud and clear .
Blue America PAC is already taking on this challenge .
Digby :
Blue America has helpfully set up an Act Blue page with all the progressive challengers who have announced and we 'll add to it as more come forward .
We 're calling it " Send The Democrats A Message They Can Understand . "
If you want a Democratic scalp , these candidates are out there offering to do the work to get it done .
And you wo n't be giving Adam Nagourney or Cokie Roberts or Glenn Beck what they want in the process .
It 's a win that even the villagers and the party establishment can't spin as good news for Republicans .
We 'll be having on many progressive challengers in the coming months on C&L and they will be explaining why progressives need to be elected if we want things to change for the better .
The new Blue America PAC Act Blue page is called :

This post was originally published on the New Bamboo blog , before New Bamboo joined thoughtbot in London .
Update 23rd March 2010 : Today we ’re announcing Pusher , a new realtime client push service .
Sign up for the beta now .
Here at New Bamboo , we specialize on Ruby On Rails web development .
However , we started talking more and more about exciting things happening around HTML5 and javascript during morning standup ( where we talk about all the cool things we are working / have discovered ) , lunch time and our company hack day .
The latest hot topic is node.js .
Some of us went to Full Frontal Javascript Conference and were very excited by the power and potential of node.js which Simon Willison ( Django core team ) introduced there .
Simon describes node.js as “ A toolkit for writing extremely high performance non-blocking event driven network servers in JavaScript ” .
I highly recommend you to read his blog post , “ Node.js is genuinely exciting ” .
After reading Simon ’s blog , watching Ryan Dahl ’s talk video , and witnessing “ A cambrian explosion of lightweight web frameworks based on top of Node ” ( again quotes from Simon ) , I started thinking what would be an interesting app to write by myself .
Many people either created web framework , or chat apps , but I wanted to create something you would n’t normally do as web app , and this is what I came up with .
I ’ve learned a lot while building this , and would like to share them step by step ( or grab the code if you are impatient to read my entire post . )
In my original idea , I was thinking about making an simple app to tail errorlog and stream the output directly to web real time .
The code is something like this :
var sys = require ( ' sys ' ) ; var filename = process .
ARGV [ 2 ] ; if ( ! filename ) return sys .
puts ( " Usage : node watcher .js filename " ) ; // Look at http://nodejs.org/api.html#_child_processes for detail .
var tail = process .
createChildProcess ( " tail " , [ " -f " , filename ] ) ; sys .
puts ( " start tailing " ) ; tail .
addListener ( " output " , function ( data ) { sys .
puts ( data ) ; } ) ; // From nodejs.org/jsconf.pdf slide 56 var http = require ( " http " ) ; http .
createServer ( function ( req , res ) { res .
sendHeader ( 200 , { " Content - Type " : " text / plain " } ) ; tail .
addListener ( " output " , function ( data ) { res .
sendBody ( data ) ; } ) ; } ) . listen ( 8000 ) ;
I will explain the important bits .
var tail = process .
createChildProcess ( " tail " , [ " -f " , filename ] ) ;
Here , I created a child process to watch the tail command .
This will happen only once when you started node server .
tail .
addListener ( " output " , function ( data ) { sys .
puts ( data ) ; } ) ;
Then , I created a listener to send the output of the tail command to http body as new message is written to errorlog .
This will keep the connection open per http request .
To keep watching a process activity continuously is not an easy thing to do in a normal web app , but it ’s almost effortless thanks to node .js non-blocking architecture , and javascript ’s event driven pattern .
Try running the script by specifying errorlog you want to watch like below :
node tail.js development.log
Open http://localhost:8000 .
It will show you error messages as they are written to the log file .
However , I wanted to do more , like drawing usage graph and stuff .
It does n’t make sense for me to do all drawing at server side and send the image as it comes , so now it ’s time to write some code at client side .
Initially , I tried to do Ajax long polling as you normally do with online chat app , but it did not work as I expected .
( You can check out my failed attempt here if you are curious ) .
I think there are 3 problems applying long polling to a scenario like my app .
Ajax success callback will fire when you receive all the response .
It will not fire off if your response never finishes .
Even if you put timeout every 30 sec , the ajax success callback needs to wait for 30 sec , which is far from real time update .
If you shorten the timeout to 1 sec , you will receive constant result , but it ’s far from real time .
In addition , continuous request will hammer your server , and it wo n’t guarantee that you get result from server every one sec.
if there are network latency , you will lose the data during the latency .
I need some solution to establish connection between client and server and do something as data arrives to client .
Luckily , I had a chance to attend HTML5 communication workshop , and got introduced to one of HTML5 feature called “ Web Sockets ” .
Here is the explanation of HTML5 Websocket from Kaazing , the company which provided the workshop .
The HTML 5 specification introduces the Web Socket interface , which defines a full - duplex communications channel that operates over a single socket and is exposed via a JavaScript interface in HTML 5 compliant browsers .
The bi-directional capabilities of Comet and Ajax , unlike Web Sockets , are not native to the browser , and rely on maintaining two connections - one for upstream and one for downstream – in order to stream data to and from the browser .
Note , that to support streaming over HTTP , Comet requires a long - lived connection , which is often severed by proxies and firewalls .
In addition , few Comet solutions support streaming over HTTP , employing a less performant technique called “ long - polling ” instead .
Web Sockets account for network hazards such as proxies and firewalls , making streaming possible over any connection , and with the ability to support upstream and downstream communications over a single connection , Web Sockets place less burden on your servers , allowing existing machines to support more than twice the number of concurrent connections .
Simple is Better
( What is an HTML5 WebSocket )
I also learnt during the workshop about drastic reduction of network traffic in use of WebSocket .
During making connection with WebSocket , client and server exchange data per frame which is 2 bytes each , compared to 8 kilo bytes of http header when you do continuous polling .
Here is the comparison of 2 scenarios :
Case 1 : 10,000 clients polling every second :
* Network throughput is ( 871 x 10,000 ) = 8,710,000 bytes = 69,680,000 bits per second ( 66 Mbps ) Case 2 : 10,000 frames every second :
* Network throughput is ( 2 x 10,000 ) / 1 = 20,000 bytes = 160,000 bits per second ( 156 Kbps )
Apparently this turned on Google … .
Reducing kilobytes of data to 2 bytes …and reducing latency from 150 ms to 50ms is far more than marginal .
In fact , these two factors alone are enough to make WebSocket seriously interesting to Google .
( From Ian Hickson ( Google , HTML5 spec lead ) )
Within WebSocket supported browser ( at this moment Chromium , and OSX version of Chrome only , but do n’t go away yet .
There is a solution for other browsers , which I will explain later ) , all you have to do is something like this ( the example from Kaazing ’s website ) .
var myWebSocket = new WebSocket ( " ws://www.websocket.org " ) ; myWebSocket .
onopen = function ( evt ) { alert ( " Connection open ... " ) ; } ; myWebSocket .
onmessage = function ( evt ) { alert ( " Received Message : " + evt . data ) ; } ; myWebSocket .
onclose = function ( evt ) { alert ( " Connection closed . " ) ; } ;
I was curious if I can serve WebSocket from node.js and found that Alexander Teinum already did hard work for me :
websocket - server-node.js - A Web Socket server for local use written in JavaScript , using node.js
With this , all you have to do at server side is to define what server returns while the connection is established .
Here is the code example from Alexander ’s blog to echo whatever you sent from browser .
You have to define it under “ resources ” directory .
exports .
handleData = function ( connection , data ) { connection .
send ( ' \ u0000 ' + data + ' \ uffff ' ) ; }
And here are the snippets of what I did for my app .
String .
prototype .
trim = function ( ) { return this .
replace ( /^ \s +| \s +$ /g , " " ) ; } var sys = require ( ' sys ' ) ; var child_process = process .
createChildProcess ( " iostat " , [ " -w 1 " ] ) ; exports .
handleData = function ( connection , data ) { connection .
addListener ( ' eof ' , function ( data ) { child_process .
removeListener ( " output " , output ) } ) var output = function ( output_data ) { sys .
puts ( output_data ) ; var output_array = output_data . trim ( ) . split ( / \s +/ ) ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < output_array .
length ; i ++ ) { output_array [ i ] = parseFloat ( output_array [ i ] ) ; } ; output_hash = { date : new Date ( ) , cpu :{ us : output_array [ 3 ] , sy : output_array [ 4 ] , id : output_array [ 5 ] } } connection .
send ( ' \ u0000 ' + JSON . stringify ( output_hash ) + ' \ uffff ' ) ; } child_process .
addListener ( " output " , output ) ; }
At this snippet , I added child process to watch the result of iostat ( I just changed my mind by that time to show iostat , rather than tail ) .
Then , I added an listener inside “ handleData ” function to parse the result of iodata , construct the result set into hash , then send the response back in JSON format .
One thing worth explaining is this line :
connection .
addListener ( ' eof ' , function ( data ) { child_process .
removeListener ( " output " , output ) } )
I added a logic to close the listener when the client browser closes connection ( by closing the tab , or call “ connection.close ” )
Without this logic , node.js will blow up every time users close their connection with following error message .
[ websocket - server - node.js ( master ) ] $ node server.js ~/work/sample/websocket-server-node.js/resources/loop.js:5 connection.send ( ’ \u 0000 ′ + counter + ‘ \u ffff ’ ) ; ^ Error : Socket is not open for writing at Timer .
( /work/sample/websocket-server-node.js/resources/loop.js:5:15 )
webSocket = new WebSocket ( ' ws://localhost:8000/iostat ' ) ; webSocket .
onopen = function ( ) { out .
html ( ' Connection opened .< br > ' ) ; } ; webSocket .
onmessage = function ( event ) { stats = event .
data ; data = JSON . parse ( stats ) ; //
Adding the pursed result into array .
stats_array .
unshift ( data ) ; stats_array . pop ( ) ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < stats_array .
length ; i ++ ) { if ( stats_array [ i ] ) { var cpu_total = stats_array [ i ]. cpu . sy + stats_array [ i ]. cpu . us $ ( ' # date_ ' + i ) . html ( stats_array [ i ]. date ) ; //
More Logic here to add the data into table continues .
// ... // } ; var total_array = [ ] ; for ( var j = 0 ; j < stats_array .
length ; j ++ ) { if ( stats_array [ j ] ) { total_array [ j ] = [ stats_array [ j ]. cpu . us , stats_array [ j ]. cpu .
sy ] } else { total_array [ j ] = [ 0 , 0 ] } ; } ; // Draw charts .
drawCharts ( total_array . reverse ( ) ) ; } ; } ; webSocket .
onclose = function ( ) { out .
html ( ' Connection closed .< br > ' ) ; } ;
The above client side does not really have anything special .
I added the incoming data into array and injected into result table and draw charts based on the data .
The entire source is here .
In this example , I showed how to stream the output of iostat in real time , but you should be able to stream other stuff , such as XMPP ( Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol , used for Google Talk and Google Wave ) , and STOMP ( Streaming Text Orientated Messaging Protocol , which ActiveMQ uses as protocol ) .
To do them on node.js , you need to implement a logic to handle these protocols on top of TCP .
I have n’t seen any libraries , but hopefully someone implement them …
It ’s actually possible to transfer binary data , such as video and audio , but it may not be practical , as Javascript at client side has to encode them .
Many features of HTML5 ( Canvas , geo location , offline storage , etc ) are already implemented in many of existing browsers , but WebSocket is still a cutting edge .
You need to keep an eye on which browser it will start implementing the feature at somewhere like StackOverflow .
Does this mean you can forget about WebSocket for another few years ?
If you are seriously considering WebSocket in enterprise environment ( but not with node.js ) , you might want to consider Kaazing Open Gateway .
They are doing pretty good job by automatically detecting Websocket support of your browser , and switch to alternative solutions ( Silverlight , Flash Socket and so on ) .
They also support XMPP and STOMP , so if you are interested in displaying real time stock feed , there is already an solution .
In fact , their demo page has some interesting real time stock feed as well as resource monitoring , just like I did .
However , I am probably not enterprise enough for their license , and I am more interested in using it with node.js .
I found some interesting solution by Hiroshi Ichikawa :
web - socket - js - HTML5 Web Socket implementation powered by Flash
He basically wrote a wrapper to convert your HTML5 WebSocket into Flash Socket .
If you include his javascript library like below
< script type= " text/ javascript " src= " ./swfobject.js " ></script > < script type= " text/ javascript " src= " ./ FABridge.js " ></script > < script type= " text/ javascript " src= " ./web_socket.js " ></script > < script > //
This is for websocket - js WebSocket .
__swfLocation = " ./WebSocketMain.swf " ; </ script >
And add flash policy file on your machine , or tweak websocket - server - node.js to return policy file ( alternatively , if you serve both client side and server side code from same domain / port , you do n’t need to worry about cross domain policy at all . ) , you should be able to use WebSocket on other browsers , as long as flash is supported .
function doHandshake ( ) { // some code to do handshake // ... // ... //
Return flash policy file for web - socket - js // http://github.com/gimite/web-socket-js if ( request [ 0 ]. match ( / policy - file - request / ) ) { sys .
puts ( ' requesting flash policy file ' ) ; policy_xml = ' < ?xml version = " 1.0 " ?> ' + ' <!
DOCTYPE cross-domain - policy SYSTEM ' + ' ww.macromedia.com/xml/dtds/cross-domain-policy.dtd " > ' + ' < cross-domain - policy > ' + " < allow - access - from domain= '*' to - ports ='*'/> " + ' </ cross-domain - policy > ' connection .
send ( policy_xml ) ; connection .
close ( ) ; } }
Here is the proof .
There are some other things going on apart from what I covered above .
There are new things coming up almost every day .
The best way to stay tuned to node .
js / websocket is just keep watching twitter search feed
Here is the recap of what I learnt .
It is extremely easy to write streaming logic in node.js
However , you need a solution at client side to handle the incoming data real time .
Websocket enables you to have continous communication in significantly less network overhead compared to existing solution .
Websocket is not available in most browsers yet , but there are workarounds .
I hope I was able to share my experiment well and looking forward to hearing about exciting apps / libraries / projects related to the both topics .
Also , my understanding about them are less than perfect , so welcome any feedback / corrections / suggestions .
NOTE : There is more story about real time web here .

Billy Bragg ’s refusal to pay taxes to fund RBS bonuses is the latest manifestation of the question : what is to be done with Britain ’s biggest bank ?
But as well as bankers yachts , we should also look at the other things RBS - NatWest are paying for with our cash .
According to this report RBS - NatWest are Europe ’s biggest funders of fossil fuel extraction .
This finance is so significant that this more recent report by Cass Business School fellow Nick Silver found that the government could potentially have more impact on global carbon emissions through responsible ownership of RBS - Natwest than through cutting all domestic emissions .
And it ’s not just levels of emissions that we should worry about .
In March last year , RBS - NatWest provided around £ 100 million of , essentially , our money to Irish company Tullow Oil .
Tullow are involved in an extraction project on the war struck border between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda .
In an area that has seen chronic violence , a resource war fueled by RBS loans is a serious prospect .
Similarly , the bank is Britain ’s biggest financier of tar sands extraction in Canada .
This project – which RBS - NatWest have supported with billions of our pounds – has been described as the ‘ most destructive on earth ’ .
It involves stealing the land and poisoning the water of indigenous Canadians , emits vastly more carbon than conventional oil , and is liable to destroy an area of crucial boreal forest the size of England & Wales .
If this project goes ahead , we have no chance of avoiding runaway climate change .
This is why student network People & Planet have teamed up with Platform and The World Development Movement to take the Treasury to court ( as reported on the front page of the FT ) .
In our ongoing legal battle , we are arguing that the Treasury has failed to follow laws on how public money can be spent .
Students at universities across the UK have been pressing the issue .
RBS have been banned from advertising on campus by their local student union – the Edinburgh University ’s Students ’ Association .
Student unions up and down the country – and NUS – have passed similar motions .
Similarly , thousands have taken action online .
The RBS bail - out provided the government with an excellent chance to set a new strategic direction for what was , by assets , the world ’s biggest company , and the chief climate criminal of the European banking world .
So far , they have failed to take this chance .
RBS ’ slogan is ‘ make it happen ’ .
All too often , the ‘ it ’ has been climate change , wars and human rights abuses around the world .
But it ’s not really them ‘ making it happen anymore ’ .
It ’s our taxes .

BERLIN .
Otto Graf Lambsdorff störte es nie , als Neoliberaler bezeichnet zu werden .
" Ludwig Erhard , Wilhelm Röpke und andere waren Neoliberale und haben die Soziale Marktwirtschaft , wie wir sie in Deutschland kennen , entwickelt .
In diese Reihe ordne ich mich gerne ein " , sagte Lambsdorff vor fast genau einem Jahr in einem Interview mit dem Handelsblatt .
Herbert
Wehner habe ihn als " Marktgrafen " bezeichnet .
" Er fand das kritisch , ich habe es als Anerkennung empfunden " , versicherte der frühere Bundeswirtschaftsminister .
Der FDP - Ehrenvorsitzende verstarb am Samstag in einem Krankenhaus in Bonn .
Er sei " von seinen vielfältigen Leiden erlöst worden " , hieß es in einer kurzen Erklärung von Lambsdorffs Büro .
Sein Sohn Nikolaus Graf Lambsdorff erklärte lediglich , sein Vater sei plötzlich und unerwartet gestorben .
Nach einer schweren Operation schien sich Lambsdorff auf dem Weg der Besserung zu befinden .
" Trockener Humor , willensstark "
Drei Gründe waren vor 58 Jahren für Lambsdorff ausschlaggebend , dass er nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg zu den Liberalen ging und nicht in die Partei Konrad Adenauers eintrat .
Lambsdorff vertrat zum einen die Ansicht , die FDP vertrete stabiler und zuverlässiger die Soziale Marktwirtschaft als die CDU mit dem Ahlener Programm .
Zum anderen hielt er die Schulpolitik der NRW - CDU für falsch .
Der Einführung von Konfessionsschulen , getrennt nach katholisch und evangelisch , konnte er nichts abgewinnen .
Den dritten Grund betrachtete er dagegen später als falsch .
Aus dem Befürworter des Zentralismus wurde ein Verfechter des Föderalismus .
Wer mehr über den Menschen Lambsdorff erfahren wollte , war Ende Januar 2007 im Berliner Schloss Charlottenburg am richtigen Ort. 500 Freunde und Gäste feierten mit ihm seinen 80 .
Geburtstag .
Herzlich und rau war der Ton in den Reden , genauso wie es der Mann aus einem baltischen Adelsgeschlecht mochte .
" Trockener Humor , willensstark , aufrecht , einer , der austeilen und einstecken konnte " , beschreiben Weggefährten Lambsdorff , der wie keine Zweiter das marktwirtschaftliche Gewissen der Nation noch bis in die heutige Zeit verkörpert .
Freunde von ihm sagen , Jammern und Zetern sei seine Sache nie gewesen , obwohl er allen Grund dafür gehabt hätte .
Sein unbeirrbares Eintreten für die Freiheit begründete Lambsdorff vielmehr sogar wegen seiner Erlebnisse als junger , kriegsversehrter Mann , der 1945 nichts mehr besessen habe als eine zerschlissene Uniform .
Die Währungsreform , das befreiende Wagnis der Nachkriegszeit , habe neue Wege aufgetan und auch seine Karriere ermöglicht .
Die wichtigsten politischen Stationen Lambsdorffs sind wohlbekannt .
Von 1977 bis 1984 unter den Kanzlern Helmut Schmidt und Helmut Kohl Wirtschaftsminister , danach von 1988 bis 1993 FDP - Vorsitzender .
In dieser Zeit arbeitete er maßgeblich am Wende - Papier mit , das 1982 das Ende der sozialliberalen Koalition auslöste .
This not unreasonable question was asked today by Ralph Atkins on the FT ’s Money Supply Blog :
The economic news from Spain has turned more worrisome .
Eurozone purchasing managersâ€™ indices for manufacturing showed the regionâ€™s recovery humming along nicely ( Decemberâ€™s final index reading at 51.6 , up from 51.2 in November , was in line with the preliminary estimate released last month ) .
But Spain is heading in the opposite direction .
Activity in its manufacturing sector continued to fall , and the pace of contraction in the fourth quarter was faster than in the third quarter , according to Markit , which produces the survey .
Spainâ€™s manufacturers are also reporting far steeper job losses than in other large eurozone economies , according to Chris Williamson , Markitâ€™s chief economist .
Ralph certainly has a point here .
Spain ’s December PMI results are shocking , it posted 45.2 in December , just below the 45.3 posted in November , indicating a still substantial rate of contraction .
Even more to the point this is the third month running where Spain has turned in the worst reading of any of the 26 countries included in JPMorgan ’s Global Manufacturing Survey .
As Andrew Harker , economist at Markit , puts it :
â€ œThe December PMI data completes a dreadful year for the Spanish manufacturing sector .
Output decreased in each month apart from a marginal rise in July , with demand showing very little sign of recovery .
The weakness of demand , amplified by dire labour market conditions in Spain , means that while input costs are rising , firms are forced to continue to offer discounts , further harming margins.â€ 
As Ralph points out , Spain ’s high unemployment could be one reason why Spanish manufacturing output continues to contract – there is less demand for manufactured consumer products .
But this does not explain why Spanish exports are also under - performing the eurozone average .
As he says , to understand this you need to understand the competitiveness issue .
Spain ’s trade deficit has in fact deteriorated rather than improving in recent months , so something somewhere is n’t working .
And meanwhile , according to the latest Bank of Spain data , net external debt rose in the third quarter , to 955 billion euros , or just under 90 % of GDP .
And the government deficit keeps rising and rising .
According to estimates by Julian Callow , Chief European Economist at Barclays Capital , Spain ’s general government borrowing requirement in the third quarter was around 33.96 billion euros ( or an estimated 13.0 % of GDP ) , up from 31.2 billion in the second quarter ( around 11.9 % of GDP ) .
Based on this estimated Callow reckons the fiscal deficit to GDP ratio might come out at an average of around 11.5 % of GDP for 2009 , substantially worse than most estimates ( e.g. the OECDâ€™s mid-November estimate of 9.6 % of GDP ) .
I largely agree , and have been working on a rule of thumb estimate of 12 % of GDP deficit ( partly because I think GDP will finally come in lower than expected , and partly because I fear revenue will fall more than anticipated ) .
And to cap it all ( for today ) October house sales and new mortgages both fell back sharply from September .
Take a good look at the two charts below ( the first is the % drop in new mortages constituted from the peak , the second is a three month moving average of new house sales )
I ’m sure you ’ll agree , they have recovery written all over them .
But to come back to Ralph ’s initial point , I would n’t say that Spain is simply being left behind , it is actually going backwards .
And now the screws are really – slowly but steadily – going to start to tighten .
The first hint came last week with the announcement that the latest one year Euribor “ fixing ” had gone upwards for the first time in a year , due to the slow movement upwards of the Eonia inter bank rate ( as forecast in this post ) .
So mortgage interest rates are now going up , and it will be a long long time before they start to come down again .
Secondly , while almost everyone in the private sector is busy adjusting prices downwards , a whole raft of government and local authority administered prices were raised on 1st January .
And then , next July , VAT will also be raised .
What all of these three moves have in common is that they are going to scoop domestic demand out of the economy .
The first , in the form of interest payments to those who hold Spain ’s external debt , and the other two in order to reduce the government fiscal deficit .
That is , there will be no growth benefit from any of these moves , quite the contrary , which is why I say , Spain is n’t just being left behind , it is actually travelling backwards .
Emergency services have rushed the casualties to hospital
Police say a gunman who stormed a factory in the city of St Louis , Missouri , killing three people and injuring five , has been found dead .
A fire department spokesman named the suspect as Timothy Hendron , an employee who had filed a lawsuit against the company .
Police said the suspected shooter died from an apparently self - inflicted gunshot wound .
Reports say three of the injured are in a critical condition .
The shooting started at 0630 local time ( 1230 GMT ) police said .
Local radio reported that the suspect had opened fire in the car park before storming the factory .
Legal dispute
Police said the suspect was armed with an assault rifle and a handgun .
According to court documents , he was involved in a legal dispute over the firm 's management of employees ' retirement funds .
Mr Hendron and some of his co-workers accused ABB 's pension - review committee of causing their retirement accounts to include investment options with unreasonable and excessive fees and expenses .
Police officers searched the factory room by room .
Forty to 50 workers were estimated to have been on the premises at the time , many of them hiding in offices or awaiting rescue on the roof .
The factory is part of Swiss - based ABB engineering and makes power transformers .
When President Obama spoke at West Point about sending more troops to Afghanistan , there were several instances where he mentioned success .
However , Fox & Friends would have you believe he did n’t :
DOOCY : Interestingly enough , of the 4,581 words in his speech , one word was missing .
That word was “ win . ”
Similarly , The Fox Nation web site states that there was no mention of “ victory . ”
Here ’s a screenshot :
Here are a few examples from Obama ’s speech that prove Steve Doocy and The Fox Nation wrong :
OBAMA : Good evening .
To the United States Corps of Cadets , to the men and women of our Armed Services , and to my fellow Americans : I want to speak to you tonight about our effort in Afghanistan — the nature of our commitment there , the scope of our interests , and the strategy that my administration will pursue to bring this war to a successful conclusion .
It ’s an extraordinary honor for me to do so here at West Point — where so many men and women have prepared to stand up for our security , and to represent what is finest about our country .
[...]
OBAMA : Because this is an international effort , I ’ve asked that our commitment be joined by contributions from our allies .
Some have already provided additional troops , and we ’re confident that there will be further contributions in the days and weeks ahead .
Our friends have fought and bled and died alongside us in Afghanistan .
And now , we must come together to end this war successfully .
For what ’s at stake is not simply a test of NATO ’s credibility — what ’s at stake is the security of our allies , and the common security of the world .
[...]
OBAMA : Third , we will act with the full recognition that our success in Afghanistan is inextricably linked to our partnership with Pakistan .
Obviously Fox News is playing a petty game of semantics .
In the future , perhaps , the President and his speech writers should try and figure out what word Fox News will try to use against him and then whip out the ol ’ thesaurus ( i.e .
Win – v. : finish first , succeed , achieve , be first , be victorious , beat , carry the day , come in first , conquer , edge , finish in front , finish off , gain , gain victory , overcome , overwhelm , prevail , run circles around , shut out , sink , take the prize , triumph , upset , walk away with , walk off with ) .
Or not …
A better idea would be to send a thesaurus to Fox News so they can look up synonyms for “ win , ” or “ victory , ” and not keep making the same idiotic mistakes , like they did with Obama ’s stance on terrorism .

Good baristas always practice their skills by experimenting with different homemade concoctions .
At the shops I ’ve worked at , we often made mystery drinks for each other after the morning rush .
It ’s a fun game and we try to outdo each other with our creativity .
One of my favorite creations came out of this ritual — the Cookie Latte .
Cuppa Cookie
The basis for this drink is a mocha , which of course is a latte with chocolate sauce added to a combination of espresso , steamed milk , and foam .
But I wanted to make a new drink where the chocolate syrup was a little less thick than in the traditional mocha latte .
In a regular mocha , you ’d use about ¾ to 1 ounce of syrup per espresso shot .
The Cookie Latte is different because it uses about ⅓ of the amount of chocolate you ’d normally use .
This is a 12 - ounce drink with 2 shots of espresso , but only ½ ounce of chocolate .
Then I add ¼ ounce of vanilla syrup and ¼ ounce of hazelnut syrup .
Finish if off with a dash of cinnamon , and get ready for a drink that tastes exactly like a chocolate - chip oatmeal cookie !
The Cookie Latte
Ingredients
½ ounce chocolate syrup
¼ ounce vanilla syrup
¼ ounce hazelnut syrup
2 ounces espresso
9 ounces steamed milk and foam
Instructions
The key to this drink is mixing your syrups together first , in the bottom of your empty , pre-heated cup .
Next comes the espresso .
Stir these together and add the steamed milk and foam .
Serve in your favorite mug —

Friday , 10.30 pm , 61 degress South 120 West .
Captain Paul Watson is on the bridge of the Steve Irwin , steaming due west at 17 knots in heavy seas past the ice floes of Wilkes Land in northern Antarctica .
Roughly 100 miles ahead of the former Scottish Environment Protection Agency patrol boat , now painted black and flying the jolly roger , is the bulk of the Japanese whaling fleet – mother ship , four harpoon hunter vessels and a security patrol boat – with a licence to kill 935 minke , 50 fin and 50 humpback whales in the next few weeks .
Behind the Irwin , near the French Antarctic base of Dumont d'Urville , is the Bob Barker , Watson 's second ship .
It in turn is being pursued by a second Japanese security ship .
Meanwhile , at the bottom of the Southern Ocean is the Ady Gil , the third ship in Captain Watson 's anti-whaling navy .
The $ 2.5 m space - age catamaran - style , biofuel - powered , ocean - going speedboat sank on Friday morning after being hit by the Shonan Maru 2 , one of the Japanese whalers .
" Not hit .
Deliberately rammed , " corrects Watson , at 59 still the world 's least compromising and most romantic environmentalist .
On a satellite link he says : " The Gil was almost stationary in the water .
[ The Shonan Maru 2 ] changed course abruptly and steered straight into it .
One crewman broke two ribs .
It was a miracle that no one was killed . "
I had travelled with Watson and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society from Scotland to the Faroe islands in 1999 .
Watson was even then a notorious figure , not unlike Captain Nemo , the Jules Verne character who roamed the depths of the sea in his submarine , the Nautilus .
" Nemo understood that it did not matter what humans thought , because humanity was the problem .
His duty was to save life in the sea from the greed of mankind .
I understand that philosophy and I have lived it every day of my adult life , " he said .
Back in 1999 , his crew of young volunteers were disciplined and clearly in awe of their captain , who accepted no " consensus shit " , " abided no drugs " or " friggin ' in the riggin ' " , and who forbade meat - eating aboard his ship .
Few had been on a boat before , but everyone had complete confidence in his skills as a mariner and his respect for , and command of , international maritime law .
They also expected and hoped for peaceful confrontation and seemed prepared to go to whatever lengths Watson asked of them .
We hunted whalers night and day for a week , but found none .
Instead we were buzzed by the Danish air force , boarded by customs officers and ordered by the police to keep away from the islands .
When I eventually asked to be put ashore to talk to the Faroese , Watson willingly provided an inflatable and dropped me at midnight on a beach .
I was arrested and then imprisoned for illegal entry within minutes .
Sea Shepherd clearly has the power to scare communities by doing nothing at all .
Last week Watson was full of praise for the 77 people from 16 countries , including Japan , who are crewing his three ships this year .
In 30 years of harassing industrial fishers , he has taken 4,000 volunteers to Antarctica , the Pacific and the Atlantic to try to stop whaling , sealing and illegal fishing .
Few have returned anything other than inspired and committed .
The sinking of the Gil was just the latest skirmish in what has become an annual battle between the volunteers for the California - based Sea Shepherd Conservation Society , which Captain Watson founded after leaving Greenpeace in the 1970s , and the Japanese Institute of Cetacean Research , a scientific research body that has effectively become the Japanese government 's whalers .
For the last nine years these two small navies have clashed dramatically in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary , an area of 50 million square kilometres ( 19 million square miles ) in which the International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) has banned all types of commercial whaling .
One year the whaling fleet was chased 3,000 km ( 1,850 miles ) through icebergs ; another , two Sea Shepherd volunteers were captured and tied to the railings of a Japanese ship after they had been invited on board ; three years ago the Japanese allegedly shot at Watson ; there have been water cannon battles , and last year the Japanese escalated the war by throwing concussion grenades on the Sea Shepherd boats .
Sea Shepherd responded by throwing bottles filled with non-toxic but foul - smelling butyric acid on the Japanese .
Each year the accusations have flown and the language has become more colourful : " We are obsessed with stopping the cetacean Death Star , that vicious , cruel killing machine and her fleet of boats armed with explosive harpoons , " says Watson .
But what precisely happened last week is still not clear .
It has been the subject of official protests by both vessels , and will be investigated by the Australian and Japanese governments , and possibly one or more courts .
From videos released by both Watson and the Japanese in the last 48 hours , it appears that the Shonan Maru 2 bore down on the Gil with its water cannon blasting and issuing warnings from its loudspeaker that it had " authority to repel " .
No one disputes that it then sliced through the bow of the Gil , scattering its crew of six .
The Japanese accuse Sea Shepherd of being " hostile eco-terrorists " .
" The Sea Shepherd extremism is becoming more violent .
Their actions are nothing but felonious behaviour .
Aiming directly to the Nisshin Maru crew , the activists have repeatedly fired illegal high - powered laser devices that can produce blindness when irradiated to the naked eye and have fired projectiles containing butyric acid , a substance highly hazardous to the human body including skin and eyes , " said a spokesman for the institute .
Yesterday lawyers working on behalf of Sea Shepherd lodged papers in a Dutch court accusing the Japanese of " piracy and violence " .
They in turn dismissed his statements as lies and accused Sea Shepherd of pollution and using bows and arrows .
But the private war has become more public and visible thanks to the internet , and the " whale wars " now threaten diplomatic relations between Australia and New Zealand and Japan .
Both antipodean countries are officially embarrassed by the incidents taking place , but have a public overwhelmingly on Watson 's side .
This year the Japanese fleet 's position was relayed to Sea Shepherd not unofficially by the Australian navy , as it has been in the past , but first by small boats near Tasmania , and then by outraged holidaymakers aboard the cruise ship Orion , which happened on the whaling fleet as it was refuelling .
Watson is adamant that he is no terrorist .
" In 31 years harassing and confronting whalers , sealers and illegal fishers , we have never injured a single person , never been convicted of a felony , or been sued .
Sea Shepherd does not condone , nor do we practise , violence , " he says .
" We agree with the assessment by Martin Luther King that violence cannot be committed against a non-sentient object .
Sea Shepherd sometimes damages equipment used for illegal activities , but we have an unblemished record . "
" We think [ the Japanese ] are re-enacting the Second World War , " said Watson yesterday .
" They see themselves as against the West and that no one will tell them what to do . "
But he freely admits damaging property .
In a lifetime of confrontations beginning with Canadian sealers , he has used " prop foulers " to sabotage ships , boarded whaling vessels , and sunk several in Iceland and Norway .
" We 're not a protest organisation .
We intervene against illegal activities , and as far as we 're concerned Japanese whalers are poachers .
The oceans are being pillaged and we are the only organisation out on the high seas trying to do something about it , " he says .
He told me he acted by a martial code culled from the methods of ancient eastern and modern western warfare , and that he expected to die for his cause .
He quoted films , read widely , wrote poetry and books , laughed a lot .
Watson claims to have co-founded both Greenpeace and Greenpeace International in the early 1970s ( something that Greenpeace disputes ) , but proved far too much for them .
" He was a great warrior brother , yet in terms of the Greenpeace gestalt he seemed possessed by too powerful a drive , too unrelenting a desire to push himself front and centre , shouldering everyone else aside , " said his friend Robert Hunter , who died four years ago .
He sailed with Greenpeace many times , and skippered one of its boats in 1972 .
But he severed all links with the organisation in 1977 , after being expelled from the Greenpeace board .
What he wrote in his autobiography 16 years ago holds just as true today , he says : " There are many people who say that what we do is futile , that there is no way to stop the rising tide of human - spawned destruction .
There are many who condemn my crew and I for taking the law into our own hands and for taking on the barons of corporate profit .
There are some who would like to see us jailed or even dead , so blinded are they to the conceit and folly of their own anthropomorphism .
" I do n't care .
I do what I do because it is the right thing to do .
I am a warrior and it is the way of the warrior to fight superior odds . "
A life of protests
Nuclear weapons
In 1969 Paul Watson protested against Russian nuclear testing with the Don't Make a Wave committee , which later evolved into Greenpeace .
He then tried to disrupt nuclear tests in the Pacific .
Seals
Watson has opposed the Canadian seal hunt since 1983 .
He blocked the port at St John 's in Newfoundland , and brought the hunt to a near standstill .
The hunt was later banned for 10 years after he took Brigitte Bardot to pose with a baby seal on the ice .
Whaling
Watson has outraged the governments of Japan , Iceland , Norway and Denmark by sinking or ramming whaling ships .
He has chased the Japanese whaling fleets in Antarctica for nine years , claiming to have prevented the deaths of thousands of whales .
Fishing
Since 2000 Watson 's ships have patrolled the Galápagos and Cocos Islands to try to stop illegal fishing , causing consternation among fishing fleets and governments .
ON BOARD THE USS CARL VINSON — Star CNN medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta — a practicing neurosurgeon — performed brain surgery on a 12 - year - old Haitian girl Monday aboard a US military ship .
The girl , whose name was not released , was injured in last week ’s devastating earthquake , and was diagnosed as having a 1.2 - cm ( 0.4 - inch ) chunk of concrete embedded in her skull .

The ship ’s surgeon called for a neurosurgeon , which are in short supply in the region amidst the mammoth and often chaotic rescue and recovery operation .
“ With the help of a CNN producer , we called CNN in Atlanta who then patched us through to Doctor Gupta in Port - au - Prince , ” said the Vinson ’s Deputy Public Affairs Officer Erik Schneider .
“ Someone got a hold of our international desk , ” 40 - year - old Gupta later recalled .
“ They said there was an urgent call from the Carl Vinson .
So I put a call in to them and there was something about a head injury . ”
Assisted by Los Angeles surgeon Henri Ford and the ship ’s surgeon Kathryn Berndt , Gupta pulled off the surgery between his multiple reports for the international news network on the massive quake that hit the Caribbean nation .
Gupta and Ford said they anticipate the girl making a full recovery .

“ I was honoured to help out , ” said Gupta afterward .
“ I have a profound respect for the capabilities of the US Navy and the medical team on board the Carl Vinson , ” he said .
Gupta was considered for the post of President Barack Obama ’s surgeon general but withdrew his name in March last year due to family and career reasons .

That 's not good
Do n't worry , said Microsoft a few days ago : the zero - day vulnerability that Chinese hackers exploited to infiltrate Google 's network only affects Internet Explorer 6 ( released in 2000 ) running on Windows XP ( released in 2001 ) .
The implication being that nobody uses that still , do they ?
Ed Bott , who has forgotten more about Microsoft than many people know , says in a vehement blogpost at ZDNet that :
" Any IT professional who is still allowing IE6 to be used in a corporate setting is guilty of malpractice .
Think that judgment is too harsh ?
Ask the security experts at Google , Adobe , and dozens of other large corporations that are cleaning up the mess from a wave of targeted attacks that allowed source code and confidential data to fall into the hands of well - organized intruders .
The entry point ?
According to Microsoft , it 's IE6 . "
By Bott 's measure , we'd have to conclude that there 's a lot of malpractice going on in UK government .
More than 750,000 workstations in the NHS and 500,000 in the Department of Work and Pensions use exactly that combination .

The DWP installation of IE6 / XP in 2002 / 3 took a total of three years , he suggests .
In fact it is still a requirement of any new web application being deployed in the NHS that it works on IE6 / XP .
You can see the 2008 machine requirements for the Primary Care Trust Prescription services report deployment , for example , which specifies machines that these days you 'd have trouble finding outside eBay :
Client Machine Requirements for Report Deployment :
Windows : Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0 , 5.5 , 6.0 ; Netscape Navigator 4.7 , 6.2 ; Acrobat Reader 3.0 , 4.05 , 5.0 ( If PDF viewing / printing is required )
Mac OS : Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0 , Netscape Navigator 6.2 , Acrobat Reader 3.0 , 4.05 , 5.0 ( If PDF viewing / printing is required )
OS /2 : Netscape Navigator 4.61 , Acrobat Reader 3.0 ( If PDF viewing / printing is required )
Solaris : Netscape Navigator 6.2 , Acrobat Reader 3.0 , 4.0 ( If PDF viewing / printing is required )
A year ago , Microsoft itself posted an NHS advisory recognising the problems around backwards compatibility with IE6 , and noting that virtual machines ( VMs ) could do the job on newer machines , by hosting an instance of IE6 / XP .
Neil Slater , who wrote the note , commented that he knew
" that the [ NHS ] IM&T Tools Project needs to remain focussed on the challenges you are facing today .
One of these challenges is applications that require Internet Explorer 6 ( IE6 ) . "
He continues :
" Incompatibility of applications with Internet Explorer 7 ( and soon 8 ) has been a much discussed problem for NHS Trusts planning upgrades to Windows Vista .
Testing and migrating applications can be time consuming , and meanwhile users are unable to take advantage of the new capabilities and enhancements offered by the new OS .
By delivering applications in a Virtual PC that runs Windows XP and IE6 , IM&T teams can remove the barriers to OS upgrades .
If you have an application that requires IE6 , please get in touch .
Whether it is a widely - deployed national application or a bespoke Trust - specific application , I would like to hear from you . "
It 's organisational inertia like this which is really dangerous .
It 's difficult enough of course to get the vast mass of people to upgrade their browsers ; even more so to change their browsers to a different one .
Yet the indications are that a significant proportion of individuals really do take an interest in what browser they 're using : how else to explain that Firefox now looks like the most popular individual browser ?
Part of the incentive for those upgrades must be personal security : Internet Explorer has had so many well - documented exploits targeting it that eventually the message permeates through to individuals .
The irony is that organisations like the NHS and DWP and all sorts of other government departments control personal information that is truly valuable , connected by systems which have woeful security holes .
It 's very easy to argue ( and I 'm sure that someone will ) that the vast majority of those NHS and DWP workstations are not connected to the internet , and so do n't face the same threats that you and I browsing the web would .
While that 's true , it overlooks the point : it only takes one of those systems to be connected to the net , or to be forwarded an infected attachment over the intranet from someone – perhaps on a completely safe machine – and the entire network is , potentially , compromised .
( A scenario like that is highly likely to have been the modus operandi at Google . )
The key question is , how do you solve that problem ?
How do you ensure that you wo n't be tied to outdated browsers and operating systems ?
Quite simple : write to web standards .
Then all you need to do is upgrade ( or move ) to a browser that supports those standards .
And that 's where the failing was when the NHS specification was written .
In 2000 , there were plenty of web standards around ; IE6 did n't meet all of them .
But because the NHS was a huge project , and the government wanted to use Microsoft , it went with IE6 .
Short - term gain , long - term problem .
Now we have to wonder if our medical records and national insurance data are safe against malware - driven intrusion on computers that use a decade - old browser which was n't built for the hostile environment that the web has become .
Microsoft could make out that IE6 / XP is the only system at risk ( though it is now patching all versions of IE and Windows against the vulnerability - including a warning for the NHS ) .
Unfortunately that " only " system turns out to be rather widely used .
It 's ironic that this has happened in the week of the official launch of data .
gov.uk – which is a browser - and platform - independent approach to using all the ( non- personal ) data that the government has got squirreled away , and is now being encouraged to open up .
Yesterday , the civil servants who 've worked so hard at the launch of that site , who I discussed this issue with , were covering their faces in horror at the thought of it .
But then a ray of light dawned .
" I know ! " said one .
" We 'll replace them all with modern browsers running HTML5 ! "
Well , we can hope .
In the meantime , let 's hope that Chinese hackers just do n't think our health records or pension or national insurance details are that interesting .
Fingers crossed .
Researchers from the School of Computing at the University of Kent have made significant advances in molecular computing .
These include defining the fundamental limits of such ' biological computers ' .
Molecular computing attempts to use components of organisms ( eg genes ) to run calculations inside living cells .
Currently , most of the work in this area is theoretical or concerned with future applications of the technology , such as molecular computers being used to release drugs into the body or enhance our ability to study and learn from biological systems .
In a paper published by the Journal of the Royal Society Interface , the University 's Dr Dominique Chu and his PhD student Radu Zabet have , by defining the fundamental limits that molecular computers are subject to , also addressed the question as to how fast they can perform a computation -- a prerequisite for the design of ' living machines ' .
Dr Chu explained : ' There are a variety of different mechanisms by which living organisms perform computations , and they do so at many different levels .
Examples include the nervous system in higher organisms or even individual proteins .
Understanding what constrains the efficiency and the speed of these computations is not only of practical relevance -- for example , in the context of engineering purpose - built novel life forms ie synthetic biology -- but will most of all provide new insights into the design principles of living systems .
' Our research demonstrates that the speed of bio - molecular computers is fundamentally limited by their metabolic rate or their ability to process energy .
One of our main findings is that a molecular computer has to balance a trade - off between the speed with which a computation is performed and the accuracy of the result .
However , a molecular computer can increase both the speed and reliability of a computation by increasing the energy it invests in the computation .
With molecular computers this energy may be derived from food sources . '
Dr Chu also explained the importance of these findings for computing in general .
' This is one of the first papers deriving fundamental limits on the speed of bio- molecular computers , ' he said .
' Our results are potentially of high theoretical and practical importance .
Much work remains to be done to fully understand its implications for the field of molecular computing but also for our understanding of design principles of the living world . '
The BerliOS home page was replaced following an attack .
In a recent attack on the web server of the BerliOS ( Berlin Open Source ) open source platform intruders replaced the portal 's home page .
The unknown attackers left a message accusing the BerliOS operators of not investing enough time in proper system maintenance – and in protection against attacks .
" Open source mediator " BerliOS , which is part of Fraunhofer Institute ( FOKUS ) , hosts a number of developer projects on its systems .
According to the injected message on the , now restored , home page , the attackers were also able to access the svn.
berlios.de , download.berlios.de and example.sheep.berlios.de servers .
While the intruders said they did n't manipulate any site content , they pointed out possible manipulations by others .
According to the unknown hackers , BerliOS had already had secret visitors in 2005 .
The attackers said this was indicated by the presence of a developer .
php.de.hacker file stored on the web server .
When asked by The H's associates at heise Security , BerliOS confirmed the manipulation .
The operators say that so far , apart from the traces of the intrusion , they have not found any sign of manipulated files .
In a brief reply Jörg Schilling , BerliOS employee and developer of the cdrecord open source software said " Therefore , I currently do n't see a reason to issue a warning " .
Schilling did n't supply any details about the vulnerability the intruders exploited .

Looking Back at Google in 2009
Google is perhaps our decade ’s Xerox PARC with a commercial edge , and the speed at which they released products in 2009 was quite immense .
This shows they do two things well so far : scaling technology ( across different countries and languages , across hundreds of thousands or however many computers ) , and scaling employee count ( nearly twenty - thousand employees and still stuff gets done , from small to big apps ) .
Google is also getting bolder in their attitude ; while their older mission poster used to read that Google should “ Think and act like an underdog ” , a recent Google writing proclaimed a bit of a different angle :
Because of our reach , technical know - how , and lust for big projects , we can take on big challenges that require large investments and lack an obvious , near - term pay - off .
We can photograph the world ’s streets so that you can explore the neighborhood around an apartment you are considering renting from a thousand miles away .
We can scan millions of books and make them widely accessible ( while respecting the rights of publishers and authors ) .
We can create an email system that gives away a gigabyte of storage ( now over 7 gigs ) at a time when all other services allow only a small fraction of that amount .
We can instantly translate web pages from any of 51 languages .
We can process search data to help public health agencies detect flu outbreaks much earlier .
We can build a faster browser ( Chrome ) , a better mobile operating system ( Android ) , and an entirely new communications platform ( Wave ) , and then open them up for the world to build upon , customize , and improve .
We can do these things because they are information problems and we have the computer scientists , technology , and computational power to solve them .
When we do , we make numerous platforms – video , maps , mobile , PCs , voice , enterprise – better , more competitive , and more innovative .
We are often attacked for being too big , but sometimes being bigger allows us to take on the impossible .
While getting more aggressive in their stated attidude , including perhaps worrying statements by their boss and others in regards to privacy , I believe Google still takes karma very seriously , open sourcing quite a bit of their projects , as well as providing transparency when it comes to certain areas evolving around user data .
But indeed just “ certain areas ” , as we need to keep in mind that Google says “ As a matter of policy , we do n’t provide specifics on law enforcement requests to Google . ”
One case in 2009 saw an anonymous blogger being uncovered by Google after an opposing party sued and won .
Technical faults in 2009 led to private data finding its way to the public , like when certain Google Docs cloud document were erronously shared with others .
Google also rolled out behaviorial targeting for ads , and certain search personalization even when you ’re logged out of your account .
On Google - powered Chinese social site Laiba , the following words of warning , originally in Chinese , were printed below the comment box :
After posting , your IP address will be published by Tianya Laiba .
Please note that , following Chinese law , Tianya Laiba is required to store the data of time and IP address of your entry for at least 60 days , and that on legal requests we offer this data to the government organization .
Google also continued to work with and against censorship around the world .
On the one hand , they provide technology which includes censorship in countries like Germany and China .
On the other hand , they ’re providing many tools which increase information flow , and Google includes organizations like Reporters Without Borders in their charity plans .
Now while Google is open - sourcing on the one side , they ’re also very secretive when asked about specifics of their workings with governments of countries like China .
In the card game of revenues , some of Google ’s jokers – their popular but still ad - free sites – were still kept in hand in 2009 .
I do n’t yet see any ads in Google Docs , Google Calendar , Google Talk or Google Translate , for instance .
Other jokers were put on the table , like with the inclusion of advertisements in Google News .
On the Google aquisition side for Google , there were the companies AdMob , Gizmo5 , Teracent , ReCaptcha , AppJet and others .
2009 was also the year in which Google continued to tighten its connection with the US government , as their code entered areas of whitehouse.gov , and they promoted an Obama Time Capsule project on their image search homepage .
( Google ’s CEO Eric Schmidt , who previously had endorsed now US president Barack Obama , was appointed as member of Obama ’s economic adviser team in 2008 . )
Design - wise , Google ’s switch to a minimalist - fade - in homepage was one of their more progressive and interesting moves of recent years .
Not even their favicon remained the same this year .
Result design changed , too , with an expandable options side bar connecting the user to features such as a Wonder Wheel .
The result page is now also restricted to a certain width , and contains more padding than before .
Instead of a plain URL we ’ll now often see the navigational hierarchy .
The results URL itself changed too , at least for some users for some time , using an anchor with dynamic in - page updates .
Google Street View , one of Google ’s most interesting products to play around with , added several countries to its list : Canada , Czech Republic , UK , Netherlands , Portugal , Switzerland , and Taiwan .
It also saw the addition of a more immersive full screen view feature , and navigation options based on 3D shapes overlaying the imagery .
Some countries pose more troubles than others for Google ; in Japan , imagery was required to be reshot using a lower camera angle , and authorities are also continuing to worry in Switzerland .
Google Images in the meanwhile kept growing its options list , and you can now search pictures by color , restrict to a certain width and height , or find Creative Commons licensed content .
In 2009 , Google killed off several products , like Google Catalog , Dodgeball , selling newspaper print ads , or Google Notebook .
The Google SOAP API was finally shut down , following the notice years earlier .
Niniane Wang – once pictured in an advertisement for Google which read “ We ’re privileged to have Niniane at Google , but we need more engineers like her ” – quit Google this year ; her social 3D world Lively was cancelled in 2008 , just months after having been made available .
Google China ’s Kai-Fu Lee quit , too , as did Google Russia ’s chief technology officer .
Designer Doug Bowman , who also quit this year , said :
Yes , it ’s true that a team at Google could n’t decide between two blues , so they ’re testing 41 shades between each blue to see which one performs better .
I had a recent debate over whether a border should be 3 , 4 or 5 pixels wide , and was asked to prove my case .
I ca n’t operate in an environment like that .
I ’ve grown tired of debating such minuscule design decisions .
There are more exciting design problems in this world to tackle .
I ’m not sure Google ’s focus on algorithm can solve these kind of unhappy employees problems .
But Google is trying , as the Wall Street Journal wrote :
[ Google ] recently began crunching data from employee reviews and promotion and pay histories in a mathematical formula Google says can identify which of its 20,000 employees are most likely to quit .
Google officials are reluctant to share details of the formula , which is still being tested .
The inputs include information from surveys and peer reviews , and Google says the algorithm already has identified employees who felt underused , a key complaint among those who contemplate leaving .
And what were some of Google ’s releases and new efforts in 2009 ?
The competition was n’t sleeping , as we can see with Microsoft ’s search contender Bing , or Wolfram Alpha ; the return of the butler to Ask ’s UK site is probably less noteworthy ( and Yahoo continued to put a price tag on private user data , as internal documents revealed ; search for “ Basic subscriber records : approx .
$ 20 for the first ID , $ 10 per ID thereafter ” ) .
Have a look at what Google came up with :
Google in late 2009 is now covering or aiming to cover web apps , the browser that runs the web apps , the OS that runs the browser , and , according to rumors , even the computer that runs the OS .
The ads distribution chain is getting more complete – which is good for Google as long as they ’re not stopped by the legal actions of a government – because in the main part their business consists of selling your attention to advertisers , so that these advertisers can get their ad message to you to sell more products .
Also , Google gets more and more ways to cross -connect their products ; they can push their search in their browser , they can push Docs in Gmail , they can push their browser in their OS , they can push Google Health in web search , and so on .
“ It is harder and harder for me to spot an IT sector in which Google does not offer products and services , ” Mathias Schindler pondered in the forum , “ Can you think of any IT sector where there is no Google product ( yet ) ? ” Competition has a tough time , unless they happen to get bought up by Google , not only because of Google ’s cross-integration power , but also because it would take mindblowing budget to reproduce Google ’s cloud server farm .
Google after all arguably owns the world ’s biggest super computer , one with an AI that becomes better and better with more data .
But the giant is growing taller by the second , and I ’m curious if there will be a couple of instances where we ’ll see him stumble over his own feet in 2010 .
[ Thanks to everyone who got involved here in 2009 ! ]

Capcom was one of the first publishers to reap significant rewards from releasing blockbuster games in the first quarter of the year , when the competition is traditionally sparse .
Since 2005 , the publisher has chosen the first three months of the year as prime launch windows for heavy hitters like Resident Evil 4 , Lost Planet : Extreme Condition , Devil May Cry 4 , Street Fighter IV , and Resident Evil 5 .
Super Street Fighter IV's
Cody will have to cool his heels a little while longer .
While the publisher planned to follow form in 2010 , Capcom of Japan today delayed Lost Planet 2 , Super Street Fighter IV , and international launches of Monster Hunter Tri for the Wii out past March .
The move was made in an attempt to avoid competition with other publishers ' major titles set for the first quarter of the year .
Capcom has n't abandoned the first quarter entirely .
A representative confirmed for GameSpot that two of its announced titles , Dark Void for the PlayStation 3 , Xbox 360 , and PC , and Capcom vs. Tatsunoko for the Wii , are still set for launch January 19 and January 26 , respectively .
Capcom 's trepidation is understandable , as the first three months of 2010 are set to host a parade of highly anticipated titles , many of them delayed from originally planned holiday 2009 launches .
Beyond Dark Void and Tatsunoko , the first quarter will also see releases for Mass Effect 2 , God of War III , Splinter Cell : Conviction , Final Fantasy XIII , Dante 's Inferno , BioShock 2 , Army of Two : The 40th Day , MAG , No More Heroes 2 : Desperate Struggle , Command & Conquer 4 : Tiberian Twilight , and plenty more .
The delays were announced alongside a reduction in Capcom 's forecast for its current fiscal year , ending March 31 , 2010 .
The publisher had been expecting to bring in ¥95 billion ( $ 1.04 billion ) for the full year , but slashed that number 32 percent to ¥ 65 billion ( $ 709 million ) in light of the delays .
Going forward , Capcom said it would spread its new releases throughout the year " to prevent an excessive contribution from new titles in the [ January - March ] quarter . "
Capcom had been expecting to sell more than 4.8 million copies this year among the three games ( 3.7 million for Lost Planet 2 , 1.1 million for Super Street Fighter IV , and 500,000 copies of the international edition of Monster Hunter Tri ) .
The publisher also reduced its expectations for Dark Void by more than half , revising its previous forecast of 1.3 million copies sold through March to just 600,000 .
No reason was given for the lowered expectations for Dark Void .

Danny Ayalon says current British law is harming relations with Israel Israel says it has postponed a visit to the United Kingdom by military officials amid fears of arrest .
Israeli officials complained that the UK government has failed to give it a complete guarantee that its officials will not be arrested on British soil .
They also said the current situation threatens relations with Britain .
In December former foreign minister Tzipi Livni cancelled a visit to London , after a British judge issued an arrest warrant .
" These officials were invited by Great Britain , but they will stay in Israel as long as we do not have a 100 % guarantee that they will not become objects of criminal lawsuits in that country , " said Israel 's Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon .
Mr Ayalon said he will discuss the matter with Britain 's Attorney General , Baroness Scotland of Asthal , who is in Israel on a private visit .
Diplomatic row Late last year a UK court issued a warrant for Tzipi Livni , sparking a diplomatic row .
Ms Livni was foreign minister during Israel 's Gaza campaign last winter .
It was the first time a UK court had issued a warrant for the arrest of a former Israeli minister .
The warrant was revoked after Ms Livni cancelled her trip , but Israeli officials reacted angrily .
Ms Livni said the court had been " abused " by the Palestinian plaintiffs who requested the warrant .
" What needs to be put on trial here is the abuse of the British legal system , " she told the BBC .
Under British law , courts are allowed to issue warrants for alleged war crime suspects around the world .
But Mr Ayalon said that the law is " often misused " .
" It initially targeted Nazi criminals , but terrorist organisations like Hamas are today using it to take democracies hostage .
We have to put an end to this absurdity " he added .
The British government says it is looking into whether the law can be changed , to avoid further diplomatic embarrassment .
But a spokesman for the Palestinian government , speaking to BBC Jerusalem correspondent Tim Franks said it was important to follow new , " creative " ways of using international law against Israel .
Pro-Palestinian campaigners in the UK have tried several times to have Israeli officials arrested under the principle of universal jurisdiction .
This allows domestic courts in countries around the world to try war crimes suspects , even if the crime took place outside the country and the suspect is not a citizen .
Israel denies claims by human rights groups and the UN investigator Richard Goldstone that its forces committed war crimes during the operation , which it said was aimed at ending Palestinian rocket fire at its southern towns .
The Palestinian militant group Hamas has also been accused of committing war crimes during the conflict .

Could you keep a £ 61 billion secret ?
Its not always easy , says Chancellor Alistair Darling in his interview with Mary Riddell for the forthcoming Fabian Review , extracted in today ’s Telegraph .
He was , he says , “ living on the edge for a while .
There were many days when I knew that unless the Bank was making [ covert ] interventions [ such as the secret loans of £ 61.6 billion to HBOS and the Royal Bank of Scotland ] , then literally banks would have had to shut their doors and cash machines would have been switched off .
People should be in no doubt that the world banking system was on the brink of collapse in October 2008 …
It was [ irksome ] to have people sniping at the edges , saying : ‘ You should have done this or that ’ when I could n’t disclose what I was doing .
I could n’t have said : ‘ By the way , the banks are about to collapse , but I ’m doing something about it ’ , because the very act of saying that would have been disastrous .
The interview was conducted just before the pre-budget repot .
The newspaper finds enough significance in a passing comment on ID cards to make a ‘ Darling signals death of ID cards ‘ news story of it .
This is the entirety of Darling ’s discussion of the issue .
Most of the expenditure is on biometric passports which you and I are going to require shortly to get into the US .
Do we need to go further than that ?
Well , probably not .
This would be good news if true .
The Treasury say that did not go beyond restating existing government policy , so I am rather less convinced that it was intended as a particularly significant policy intervention by the Chancellor in the run-up to his PBR .
The comment does seem go with the grain of the recent direction of travel , which we have chronicled from time to time over on Next Left .
Compulsory ID cards for all seem to have been dying a slow and lingering death : one could even stretch a point and trace ebbing support inside government back four years , given Tony McNulty ’s widely reported comments to the Fabians in 2005 , though Home Secretary Blunkett strongly took a strongly different view at that time .
There might have been both good policy reasons and some political sense , a year or two ago , in putting them out of their misery more swiftly .
Perhaps there might still be .
But I expect that would be more likely to be news from AJ than AD .
New reports of massive spying , criminality by US government
By Patrick Martin
13 July 2009
Reports in the American press on Friday and Saturday reveal massive illegality in the US government and intelligence apparatus .
They demonstrate not only routine violations of democratic rights through illegal spying and wiretapping both at home and abroad , but also disregard for legally required reports to Congress .
According to a report Sunday in the New York Times , the CIA kept the House and Senate intelligence committees in the dark for eight years about a “ secret counterterrorism program , ” on the instructions of then Vice President Richard Cheney .
The Times account said that the current CIA Director Leon Panetta , a former Democratic congressman , recently told both the House and Senate intelligence committees about the existence of the program and Cheney ’s role in concealing it .
The Los Angeles Times reported Saturday , citing an internal study by five intelligence agency officials , that the electronic surveillance under the Bush administration “ went beyond the widely publicized warrantless wiretapping program ... encompassing additional secretive activities that created ‘ unprecedented ’ spying powers . ”
This program , conducted by the National Security Agency and separate from the CIA program , “ came to be known in the Bush administration as the ‘ President ’s Surveillance Program ’ , ” the newspaper said .
The study was conducted jointly by the Inspectors General of the Justice Department , Pentagon , CIA , Directorate of National Intelligence and National Security Agency .
The unclassified version of the study , released Friday night , blacked out all details of the expanded surveillance program .
As in the case of the CIA program , the office of the vice president played a central role in enforcing secrecy and cover -up of the NSA operation .
Cheney ’s legal adviser and later chief of staff , David Addington , had to personally approve every government official who was to be “ read in ” to the program by the NSA .
Addington refused to be interviewed by the Inspectors General , as did former CIA director George Tenet , former attorney general John Ashcroft , and John Yoo , the Justice Department lawyer tasked with drafting legal guidelines for the secret surveillance .
The secret CIA counterterrorism program was first made public last Wednesday night , when the House Intelligence Committee released a letter to Panetta .
The letter noted Panetta ’s appearance before a closed - door session of the committee on June 24 , where he announced that he had just discovered the existence of the secret counterterrorism program and was shutting it down , as well as notifying Congress as required by law .
The letter demanded that Panetta retract a statement he issued May 15 , in response to criticism of the CIA by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , denying that the CIA had a policy of misleading Congress .
This was contradicted , they wrote , by his admission that “ top CIA officials have concealed significant actions ... and misled ” members of Congress since 2001 .
The ranking Republican member of the intelligence panel , Congressman Peter Hoekstra , made light of the program , saying , “ It was on - again , off - again and never happened . ”
One committee Democrat , Anna G. Eshoo of California , responded , “ The whole committee was stunned ” by Panetta ’s disclosure .
“ I think this is as serious as it gets . ”
What was the CIA doing ?
The blizzard of press reports and commentaries that have followed Panetta ’s revelation — including the front - page “ exposé ” in Sunday ’s New York Times — seem to be at least in part an exercise in damage control , if not outright disinformation , since they conceal the exact nature of the secret CIA program and downplay its actual significance .
The Times report asserts , “ Intelligence and Congressional officials have said the unidentified program did not involve the CIA interrogation program [ i.e. , torture ] and did not involve domestic intelligence activities . ”
It adds that the program , “ never became fully operational , involving planning and some training that took place off and on from 2001 until this year . ”
The Washington Post cited “ two former agency officials who were familiar with the program ” claiming that it “ did not involve interrogations of detainees or surveillance of U.S. - based communications . ”
An earlier Post article ( July 10 ) cited other unnamed “ officials ” declaring that the program “ was an intelligence - collection activity run by the CIA ’s Counterterrorism Center ...
It was not a covert action , which by law would have required a presidential finding and a report to Congress . ”
The Associated Press , in an interview with former CIA and NSA chief Michael Hayden , quoted another “ former official ” declaring that CIA leaders were “ ‘ very cautious ’ in their handling of the program and that they made decisions to narrow its focus .
The official said that the program fell on a continuum between foreign intelligence collection and covert action . ”
It is not possible , on the basis of reports so far , to determine the exact nature of either the CIA or the NSA programs .
But the close involvement of top officials of the Bush administration , including , in the case of the CIA program , Cheney ’s personal role , suggests that these activities were significant and extensive .
A remark by Representative Hoekstra of Michigan , former chairman of the House intelligence committee and currently the ranking Republican , is suggestive , even chilling .
He told the New York Times that Congress might have approved the secret CIA program immediately following the 9/11 attacks — “ Maybe on September 12 ” — but not later on .
It takes some effort to imagine a counterterrorism program so invasive or extreme that the US Congress would balk .
Congress approved a sweeping war powers resolution in October 2001 , which effectively authorized the US invasion of Afghanistan in advance — a resolution employed by the Bush and Obama administrations as the legal justification for the Guantánamo Bay detention camp .
In November 2001 , Congress approved the USA Patriot Act , with only a single senator voting “ no . ”
In subsequent years , Congress has passed laws ratifying the Bush administration ’s rejection of habeas corpus rights for Guantánamo prisoners , authorizing a system of kangaroo - court military tribunals , legalizing Bush ’s illegal spying operations and immunizing telecommunications companies that helped the US intelligence agencies spy on American citizens , and most recently , barring the release of photos of US torture victims .
( Obama voted in the Senate for the telecom immunity provision and has pledged to issue an executive order if needed to keep the torture photos secret . )
Congressional Democrats and Republicans have rubber - stamped all manner of police - state measures in the name of the “ war on terror . ”
It is therefore worth asking what kind of a program was so atrocious or politically dangerous that it had to be kept secret even from the House and Senate intelligence committees .
A “ state within a state ”
A remarkable aspect of the revelation of the secret CIA program , passed over virtually without comment in the media coverage , is that CIA Director Panetta was not informed of the program for more than four months after he assumed nominal control of the spy agency .
He was sworn in as director on February 19 , but his “ subordinates ” did not bother to tell him of the existence of the program that had been kept secret from Congress until June 23 .
This means that throughout the so - called “ debate ” between President Obama and former Vice President Cheney over the release of Justice Department memos justifying torture , which took place in April , Cheney was in possession of information about secret CIA operations of which the new “ commander - in - chief ” was ignorant .
The military / intelligence apparatus operates according to its own rules , disclosing or withholding information from its supposed civilian superiors only when it is felt politically necessary .
What is being revealed — or rather only hinted at , since the key details are still shrouded in secrecy — is the existence of a “ state within the state , ” a secret government that continues to function regardless of the individual who inhabits the White House .
The congressional Democrats and the Obama administration are active participants in the attack on democratic rights of both the American people and the people of the world .
As political representatives of big business , they rely on this state apparatus to defend their class interests no less than the Republicans and Bush before them .
It has become a truism that there is more similarity than difference between the Bush administration and the Obama administration in relation to the defense of the US intelligence apparatus and its ongoing attacks on democratic rights .
On Wednesday , Obama threatened to veto the intelligence authorization bill if it requires expanded briefings of Congress , beyond the so - called Gang of Eight , the Democratic and Republican leaders of both houses and both intelligence committees .
A White House statement said the veto would be necessary to prevent “ restricting an important established means by which the president protects the most sensitive intelligence activities that are carried out in the national security interests . ”
The congressional Democrats claims of concern are largely play - acting , however .
Senator Dianne Feinstein , chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , deplored the concealment of the program but claimed that it represented no threat to civil liberties .
The struggle to defend democratic rights and to defeat the reactionary conspiracies of the US intelligence agencies must be taken up by the working class .
Working people must raise the demand for the full exposure of all the covert operations of the CIA , NSA and other US intelligence agencies , and for the prosecution of all those officials responsible for authorizing and directing them .
This includes bringing to justice officials like Cheney , Bush and other top government officials who have been directly linked to crimes of spying , torture , kidnapping , and aggressive war .
Blackwater ’s Participation in CIA Raids Raises Critical Questions
Created : December 14 , 2009 08:51 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
The news on Friday that Blackwater Worldwide ( now known as Xe Services ) participated in clandestine CIA operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that included targeted killings , kidnapping and “ extraordinary renditions ” raised more questions than it answered .
After all , we already knew that the U.S. government has relied more on private military contractors in its “ war on terror ” than in any war in the past .
We also knew that private security outfits such as Blackwater were providing heavily armed guards for the U.S. war effort , not just protecting supply lines .
The military ’s reasoning has always been that hiring contractors provides a flexibility that the military does n’t have , and compensates for the lack of full - fledged U.S. soldiers in our nation ’s all - volunteer army .
But are there other reasons that Blackwater and other private security guards have been used for some of the CIA and military ’s highest - risk operations ?
Maybe .
For one thing , private security companies operate in secrecy — a secrecy that ’s guaranteed to the government in their contracts .
What ’s more , while the death of a U.S. soldier is publicly reported and investigated by the U.S. military , the death of a private contractor is not .
The circumstances surrounding deaths of private contractors on the battlefield have remained largely secret .
Unlike in the military , family members are n’t entitled to an investigation that reveals how they died .
And when those family members have sued to get that information , their cases have usually been dismissed — contractors and the government argue that to let the families have their day in court would endanger national security and military secrets .
In the best case scenario for the families , the families ’ case was shunted off to private , confidential arbitration , as happened when four Blackwater guards were torched by Iraqi insurgents and hung from a bridge in Fallujah .
The deaths of private security guards also do n’t get counted as “ U.S. casualties ” , the way the deaths of U.S. soldiers do .
That sort of secrecy is something that the contractors , and the government , in most cases require .
So is the U.S. military relying more heavily on private security guards to do its dirty work in this war because it knows that whatever happens in Afghanistan will stay in Afghanistan ?
Is it a way to keep secret its military operations , and to get around having to acknowledge any resulting U.S. casualties ?
Those are the sorts of questions to be asking now .
I do n't mean one of your stray locks that fell into the butter .
What I want to know is whether amino acids produced from human hair were used to process the flour that went to make that piece of toast you wolfed down on the way to the bus stop .
It sounds unthinkable does n't it ?
But when I became a temporarily became a vegan for Newsnight , I developed a keen interest in what goes into the food I eat and I discovered that a food additive which is sometimes produced from human hair can be used as an additive in some baked goods .
But first , the veganism .
I did not do it out of high principle .
The idea was to test the claim made by a number of people who e-mailed in to insist that becoming a vegan significantly reduces one 's impact on the environment .
I was vegan for one month - January 2007 .
So this did not preclude me eating Ned the Newsnight turkey for Christmas 2006 .
I am happy to report that Ned was as tasty as he was ethical .
My family gnawed our way through his ample carcass over the course of a full week .
We ate Ned roast on the big day , then sandwiched , curried , as a supreme and finally in a tasty soup .
Then , as the last few slices of Ned grew an extravagant mould in the bottom of our fridge , the New Year turned and my diet became completely meat and dairy free .
It was n't easy .
I did not just cut meat and fish out of my diet .
Vegans do n't eat any animal products including milk , eggs and honey .
So did cutting out all animal products reduce my carbon footprint ?
I need a bit of persuading about the bees but cows certainly produce an impressive quantity of greenhouse gases - some 500 litres of methane a day per animal .
When my vegan experiment was just getting under way , the then environment minister David Miliband pointed out at a conference that " the livestock sector generates more greenhouse gas emissions than transport " .
Agriculture is reckoned to account for 7 % of all greenhouse gas emissions , about the same as aviation .
And methane is n't the only issue .
It is claimed that one acre of arable crops can produce enough food for up to 20 people .
Turn that field over to beef production and it will feed just one person .
Not only that , raising animals is a lot more carbon intensive than growing vegetables .
David Pimentel , an ecologist from Cornell University , has calculated that animal protein production requires more than eight times as much fossil - fuel energy than plant protein yet yields proteins only 1.4 times as nutritious for humans .
That 's the average .
When you look at individual sectors the figures are even more startling .
Take beef , for example .
Using US Department of Agriculture figures he found that beef production requires an energy input to protein output of 54:1 ( as well as 100,000 litres of water per kilogram of meat ) .
Vegetarians should n't feel too smug , though .
Milk protein has a ratio of 17:1 .
In fact , rather depressingly the most efficient form of animal production - perhaps not surprisingly - is battery chickens .
Pimentel finds that broiler chickens have a ratio of energy input to protein output of just 4:1 .
My problem has been eradicating all these inefficient animal proteins from my diet .
Take my very first day of vegan living , New Year 's Day .
I had n't prepared very well and had n't got any margarine in .
The local corner shop , a Londis , was open and they stock a good range so I was n't too worried .
But as I worked my way through the eight or so different varieties of margarine I was amazed to find that every single one contained milk or dairy products in some form .
It makes you realise just how common the use of animal products in food is .
Before I became a vegan I would eat animal products in every single meal .
Indeed the Vegan Society points out that some vegans consider tap water unacceptable because it contains chemicals that have been tested on animals .
I am not going that far but I have certainly developed a mania for reading food labels and there are all sorts of unexpected animal additives .
Most people know that gelatine is produced from animal skin and bones and that the rennet used in some cheeses comes from calves ' stomachs .
But did you know that bone char ( from cow bones ) is still occasionally used to whiten some sugars or that some wines and many beers ( particularly real ales ) include isinglass - a substance obtained from the swim bladders of fish ?
Which brings me back to the possibility that human hair may be used in bread .
A vegetarian friend alerted me to the existence of an animal - based flour additive called L - Cysteine .
It is an amino acid which is used as a flour improver .
It is known as E920 and is permitted for use in all biscuits , breads and cakes except those that claim to be wholemeal .
The problem for a would - be vegan is that traditionally L - Cysteine is produced from feathers , pig bristles and sometimes even human hair .
These days L - Cysteine can also be produced synthetically but apparently human hair remains one of the richest sources of this amino acid - it makes up about 14 % of your hair - and there is a small industry in China making the additive from hair clippings .
There 's even a paper on the web written by a Rabbi about whether L - Cysteine from human hair is kosher .
Apparently it is - so long as the hair in question was not harvested from dead bodies .
So how commonly is L - Cysteine used ?
My vegetarian friend claims that the problem with E920 is that - even when it is used - it does n't have to be listed in the ingredients .
She says that 's because it is broken down in the baking process so the manufacturers argue that does n't constitute an ingredient .
That is something the Food Standards Agency flatly denies .
It says that L - Cysteine must always be labelled .
Indeed , the industry says the reason you so rarely see E920 on labels is that these days it is very rarely used ( apparently it was much more common fifteen years ago ) .
The industry also says that the only L - Cysteine their members would use is the synthetic variety .
That is a little odd because according to the Food Standards Agency the European regulation specifies that only L - Cysteine produced from duck and chicken feathers or from pig bristles can be used .
That means that , so long as your daily bread was baked in Europe , it almost certainly does not include human hair .
But it 's a little confusing .
If British bakers are using synthetic L - Cysteine are they breaking EU guidelines ?
It is hard to get a straight answer .
Biscuit makers told me it would be added when the flour is milled - and the millers say it 's something the bakers would add .
So if anyone can put this hairy issue to bed once and for all I 'd be very grateful .
And while I am on the subject , if anyone knows of any other animal - based ( or human - based ) food ingredients a vegan needs to steer clear of , please do tell me .

“ WHAT ’S the deal with fish oil ? ”
If you are someone who catches and eats a lot of fish , as I am , you get adept at answering questions about which fish are safe , which are sustainable and which should be avoided altogether .
But when this fish oil question arrived in my inbox recently , I was stumped .
I knew that concerns about overfishing had prompted many consumers to choose supplements as a guilt - free way of getting their omega - 3 fatty acids , which studies show lower triglycerides and the risk of heart attack .
But I had never looked into the fish behind the oil and whether it was fit , morally or environmentally speaking , to be consumed .
The deal with fish oil , I found out , is that a considerable portion of it comes from a creature upon which the entire Atlantic coastal ecosystem relies , a big - headed , smelly , foot - long member of the herring family called menhaden , which a recent book identifies in its title as “ The Most Important Fish in the Sea . ”
The book ’s author , H. Bruce Franklin , compares menhaden to the passenger pigeon and related to me recently how his research uncovered that populations were once so large that “ the vanguard of the fish ’s annual migration would reach Cape Cod while the rearguard was still in Maine . ”
Menhaden filter - feed nearly exclusively on algae , the most abundant forage in the world , and are prolifically good at converting that algae into omega - 3 fatty acids and other important proteins and oils .
They also form the basis of the Atlantic Coast ’s marine food chain .
Nearly every fish a fish eater likes to eat eats menhaden .
Bluefin tuna , striped bass , redfish and bluefish are just a few of the diners at the menhaden buffet .
All of these fish are high in omega - 3 fatty acids but are unable themselves to synthesize them .
The omega - 3s they have come from menhaden .
I ’d almost be happier if this turned out to be some kind of fake .
But in the meantime , while you may think of it as a badly flawed and unfair pie chart , I prefer to see it as actually just an extreme version of a genuine pie chart .

When you can't change public opinion any other way , you buy it .
That is the message from Huffington Post today in Economists Opposing Fed Audit Have Undisclosed Fed Ties .
As the debate over an audit of the Federal Reserve intensifies in the House , one camp is trotting out eight academics that it calls a " political cross section of prominent economists . "
A review of their backgrounds shows they are anything but .
In a letter to the House Financial Services Committee earlier this month , all eight wrote that they support the type of amendment now being introduced by Rep. Mel Watt ( D - N.C. ) .
Watt 's approach purports to increase
Fed transparency while it actually would tighten restrictions on any audits that could go forward .
But far from a broad cross-section , the " prominent economists " lobbying on behalf of the Watt bill are in fact deeply involved with the Federal Reserve .
Seven of the eight are either currently on the Fed 's payroll or have been in the past .
The Fed connections are not outlined in the letter sent around to committee members on Wednesday , but are publicly discernible through a review of their resumes , which are all posted online .
In September , Huffington Post reported that the Federal Reserve has accomplished a soft form of effective control over the field of monetary economics simply by employing -- and being the means for career advance -- for an overwhelming proportion of the discipline .
Let 's run the traps :
Frederic Mishkin is a former board member , having served from 2006 - 2008 .
His career at the Fed stretches back to 1977 and he currently holds two positions : one as a member of the Center for Latin American Economics at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas , where he 's been since 1996 ; and another as an academic consultant to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , where he 's been since 1997 .
Anil K. Kashyap is currently a consultant with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago , a position he 's held since 1991 .
He 's also on the economic advisory panel of the New York branch and was a consultant there in 2003 .
He was a visiting scholar at the division of monetary affairs at the Board of Governors of in1994 , 2001 and 2005 and at the division of international finance in 1997 .
Pete Klenow was a visiting scholar at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis from 1994 - 1999 , 2003 - 2004 , 2006 and again this year .
From 2000 - 2003 he was also a senior economist at that branch .
He 's currently a visiting scholar at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco , a position he 's held since 2005 .
He was a visiting scholar at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City from 2004 - 2006 .
Ricardo J. Caballero was a visiting scholar at Federal Reserve Bank of Boston from 2004 - 2005 and a visiting scholar at the Federal Reserve Board on multiple occasions .
Robert Hall was a research assistant at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System from 1982 - 1984 and an economist there from 1988 - 1991 .
Thomas Sargent was an adviser to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis from 1981 to 1987 and continues to write frequently for Fed - sponsored journals .
Micheal Woodford is currently on the Monetary Policy Advisory Committee of Federal Reserve Bank of New York , a position he 's held since 2004 .
He 's also listed as a consultant to the research department there dating back to 2005 .
In the past , he 's been a visiting scholar at the Board of Governors and various regional branches in 1987 , 1993 - 1998 and 2000 - present , often at multiple banks in the same year .
The Economist magazine issue of November 29th has an article titled “ Mail - strom – Leaked e-mails do not show climate scientists at their best ” [ subscription required ] which is an example of a media outlet that is seeking to trivialize the importance of the leaked e-mails .
Examples of their failure to understand the importance of these e-mails is given in their text , excerpts of which I present below :
“ IS GLOBAL warming a trick ? ”
“ The result has been a field day for those sceptical of the idea of man-made climate change … ”
“ ….. the scientists are looking tribal and jumpy , and that sceptics have leapt so eagerly on such tiny scraps as proof of a conspiracy . ”
The article fails to recognize that even scientists who accept a major role of humans within the climate system are disparaged by the authors in the e-mails ( e.g .
I was the scientist referred to in the Economist article as a “ prat “ ) , and have been excluded from presenting alternative perspectives on the climate issue ( e.g. , see ) .
Despite the attempt to trivialize by the Economist , the issue which has been exposed by the released e-mails are that there are three distinct fundamentally different perspectives on the role of humans in the climate system .
We have discussed this in our paper
Pielke Sr. , R. , K. Beven , G. Brasseur , J. Calvert , M. Chahine , R. Dickerson , D. Entekhabi , E. Foufoula - Georgiou , H. Gupta , V. Gupta , W. Krajewski , E. Philip Krider , W. K.M. Lau , J. McDonnell , W. Rossow , J. Schaake , J. Smith , S. Sorooshian , and E. Wood , 2009 : Climate change :
The need to consider human forcings besides greenhouse gases .
Eos , Vol. 90 , No. 45 , 10 November 2009 , 413 .
An edited version of this paper was published by AGU .
Copyright ( 2009 ) American Geophysical Union .
The three perspectives are presented in terms of the three hypotheses :
Hypothesis 1 : Human influence on climate variability and change is of minimal importance , and natural causes dominate climate variations and changes on all time scales .
In coming decades , the human influence will continue to be minimal .
Hypothesis 2a : Although the natural causes of climate variations and changes are undoubtedly important , the human influences are significant and involve a diverse range of first - order climate forcings , including , but not limited to , the human input of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) .
Most , if not all , of these human influences on regional and global climate will continue to be of concern during the coming decades .
Hypothesis 2b : Although the natural causes of climate variations and changes are undoubtedly important , the human influences are significant and are dominated by the emissions into the atmosphere of greenhouse gases , the most important of which is CO2 .
The adverse impact of these gases on regional and global climate constitutes the primary climate issue for the coming decades .
Hypothesis 2b is the perspective that the released e-mails are advocating ( which is the IPCC conclusion ) and are deliberately attempting to suppress scientists who present evidence of either of the other two viewpoints .
In our EOS article , we present evidence in the peer - reviewed literature that refutes both hypotheses 1 and 2b , and supports hypothesis 2a as the robust finding .
The Economist has chosen to trivialize this issue with their statement that “ sceptics have leapt so eagerly on such tiny scraps as proof of a conspiracy ” .
Rather than being “ scraps ” , these released e-mails illustrate a coordinated effort to prevent the science with respect to climate change from being properly assessed and communicated to policymakers .
TESTS have revealed that men who drink beer may reduce their chances of developing prostate cancer , say scientists .
Experiments have shown that xanthohumol , a compund derived from the hops in beer , blocks a chemical reaction that can lead to the development of cancer .
The disease is usually treated with drugs that act in a similar way .
Study leader Dr Clarissa Gerhausa , from the German Cancer Research Centre in Heidelberg , said : " We hope that one day we can demonstrate that xanthohumol prevents prostate cancer development , first in animal models and then in humans , but we are just at the beginning . "
Xanthohumol is a powerful antioxidant , known to have anti-cancer properties .
It is also found in fruits and spices .
It was previously suggested that the compound could reduce the chances of females getting breast cancer .
Scientists now believe a similar reaction could affect men .
Further research involving rats results showed that xanthohumol reduced the effects of hormone signalling in prostate tissue .

Another source of risk in software development is the combination of the likelihood that something will have to change and the effort required to make that change .
I use tests to drive the design of my software , which has the nice features of building a comprehensive test suite for the intention of the code and of ensuring that I design my code in a testable way .
That risk may be low , and that 's fine .
Remember , though , that code has a way of sticking around far longer than you anticipate .
If you want to be able to maintain your code later , you have to be able , right now , to look beyond the mechanics of how you tell the computer what to do .
Source code does that , yes , but that 's not its primary purpose .
The primary purpose is communicating what you intend to do to other programmers .
For design in the large , increasing testability usually means improving genericity , writing to well - defined interfaces , and removing coupling between unrelated systems .
Yet if you , as a novice , have to worry on your own about design in the large , something is very wrong with your development process and you have problems beyond which tips for novices can help .
You can manage these risks in the small , too .
The risk of maintenance is twofold .
First , you can write messy code with false trails and vestigial code and unclear logic and poor factoring .
No language prevents this .
You need to develop good taste for organizing , designing , and implementing code .
Second , you can write ill - thought code which crams together clever tricks and side effects and strange idioms but serves to obscure the intent of the code .
The second happens less often than the former , despite so much of the software development culture brandishing pitchforks , torches , and languages with enforced indentation against the latter .
One wonders at their priorities .
In general , less code is better than more code .
I saw some code today which copied arrays around , pushed onto arrays , pulled values from a hash , and then finally inserted a reference to that array into a hash .
The corresponding idiomatic Perl 5 reduced six lines of code into one line of code -- and not a cryptic one - liner , either .
Yes , you have to understand references and dereferencing and autovivification to understand that line of code , but anyone dealing with this code that did n't understand references or dereferences is already in trouble .
In general , you can successfully replace structural code with functional code , with no loss of clarity .
While understanding the mechanics of what Perl should do seems more important to novice programmers , the intent of why that behavior is necessary is more important to maintenance .
In general , you can safely assume that the first question people will ask when maintaining a piece of code ( a function , a module , a class , a program ) is " What does this need to do ? "
Your tests can answer that with regard to details .
How you write the code ( and comments and inline documentation ) answers that with regard to purpose and intent .
In general , there 's no reason to use clever tricks when simpler code will do .
There 's one reason to use a clever trick , and that 's when there 's really no other way to accomplish what you need to accomplish and when you 've abstracted away the clever trick into a well - encapsulated black box with appropriate documentation and warnings and comprehensive tests .
This is less often necessary than you think .
( As a quick example , Moose has obviated almost every need I 've ever had for even knowing how some of these dirty tricks work in Perl 5 , and I 'm glad of it . )
If you want to be able to maintain your software , you have to write maintainable software .
This is a subtle point , bordering on tautology , but it 's a necessary point that novices all too often overlook .
British scientists have failed to find a link between a new kind of retrovirus and chronic fatigue syndrome in a study that contradicts previous findings by American researchers claiming to have found a possible viral cause of the debilitating condition .
The UK scientists could not detect a recently discovered virus called XMRV in any of the blood samples collected from 186 patients with chronic fatigue syndrome , which is also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis ( ME ) .
The researchers believe this demonstrates that XMRV is not implicated in the illness , at least not in Britain .
One scientist involved in the latest research also criticised the previous study , which was published in the peer - reviewed journal Science , saying it was premature and that the journal should have waited until there was stronger , corroborating evidence of such a link .
" When you 've got such a stunning result you want to be absolutely clear that you are 1,000 per cent right and there are things in that [ previous study ] I would not have done .
I would have waited .
I would have stalled a little , " said Professor Myra McClure , a virologist at Imperial College London and a leading member of the British research team .
Chronic fatigue syndrome affects about three in every 1,000 people and results in severe physical and mental exhaustion .
After the release of the apparent link with XMRV , many patients have asked their doctors about being tested for the virus and whether they should be taking antiretroviral drugs .
The earlier study , published last October , was carried out by a team led by Judy Mikovits , director of research at the Whittemore Peterson Institute in Reno , Nevada .
They found the murine leukaemia virus - related virus ( XMRV ) in blood samples of 68 of 101 patients diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome .
Just eight out of 101 healthy " controls " drawn at random from the same parts of the US also tested positive , suggesting that XMRV played a key role in triggering the condition .
Dr Mikovits told The Independent at the time that further blood testing had found the virus in as many as 95 per cent of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome .
She also said that preliminary testing on a batch of blood samples sent from Britain showed that the " same percentages are holding up " .
However , Professor McClure 's study , published in the online journal Plos One , failed to find any evidence of the XMRV 's DNA in blood samples taken from 186 patients who had been diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome for at least four years .
She also failed to find any virus related to XMRV .
" We are confident that our results show there is no link between XMRV and chronic fatigue syndrome , at least in the UK .
The US study had some dramatic results that implied people with the illness could be treated with antiretrovirals .
Our recommendation to people with chronic fatigue syndrome would be not to change their treatment regime , because our results suggest that antiretroviral would not be an effective treatment for the condition , " Professor McClure said .
The British study was carried out under the most rigorous testing conditions that minimised the risk of cross contamination , Professor McClure said .
The testing was also conducted " blind " meaning the scientists involved did not know which samples came from patients and which came from the healthy controls until the end of the experiment .
The DNA test used to detect the presence of XMRV in the blood samples is so sensitive that it would have shown up positive if just one molecule of the virus 's genetic material had been present in the blood samples .
However , the tests were only carried out on blood .
It is possible the XMRV virus integrates its genetic material into other tissues of the body , although this is not supported by the American findings .
Two emergency medical technicians accused of refusing to help a pregnant woman who collapsed in the coffee shop where they were taking a break were suspended Monday .
New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg called their behavior inexcusable .
NEW YORK ( AP ) 
Two emergency medical technicians accused of refusing to help a dying pregnant woman are " inhuman " and should n't have taken those jobs if they were n't willing to get involved , the woman 's mother said Tuesday .
" These are people who are supposed to take a minute to be concerned , " Cynthia Rennix told The Associated Press .
Rennix 's daughter , 25 - year - old Eutisha Revee Rennix , died at a hospital Dec. 9 , shortly after collapsing in the Au Bon Pain shop in Brooklyn where she worked .
Her baby was too premature to survive .
Witnesses said the EMTs were on their break and told employees to call 911 , then left when they were asked to help the woman .
The Fire Department on Monday suspended Jason Green , a six - year member , and Melissa Jackson , a four - year member , without pay .
The department is investigating , as is the state Department of Health , which oversees the emergency medical services system .
A criminal probe is also underway .
Cynthia Rennix said she never could have imagined that an emergency services worker would refuse to help someone .
" You are very inhuman ; you do n't need to have a job like you do , " she said of the two workers .
Fire Department spokesman Steve Ritea said that all FDNY members " take an oath to assist others whenever they 're in need of emergency medical care .
It 's their sworn duty . "
Rennix said she has yet to decide whether she is going to take any legal action in connection with her daughter 's death .
She is taking care of her daughter 's 3 - year - old son .

Five people who stared at the sun in the hope they might be witnessing religious apparitions are being treated for serious eye damage , a top eye surgeon has revealed .
Reports of pilgrims to Knock seeing the sun dance in the sky and changing colour indicate serious eye damage .
And a number of people who attended the recent religious gathering at the Catholic shrine are reporting symptoms of damaged retinas , said Dr Eamonn O'Donoghue , of University College Hospital in Galway .
Dr O'Donoghue revealed he is treating five patients for serious eye injuries caused by staring at the sun at recent gatherings at Knock organised by Dublin " spiritual healers " Joe Coleman and Keith Henderson .
And he has warned those planning to attend a similar gathering this Saturday that they risk damaging their eyes if they stare at the sun for any length of time .
Dr O'Donoghue 's patients were part of the 10,000 - strong crowd that visited the Marian Shrine in October in the hope of seeing an apparition .
They have since suffered a serious condition called solar retinopathy , caused by the sun 's rays burning into the central part of the eye 's retina .
Victims have suffered 50 pc vision loss which seriously impairs basic abilities such as reading and driving .
Dr O'Donoghue said that it was " monstrous " to mislead people into thinking that altered vision and effects , such as seeing the sun dance , were a religious apparition when they were classic symptoms of solar retinopathy .
" If it did not have such monstrous effects you could describe it as a cheap circus trick , " he said .
Dr O'Donoghue , a renowned opthalmic surgeon who also lectures in NUI Galway and works on vision - aid schemes in developing countries , warned that many others could have suffered similar damage to their eyes .
And he fears that children attending the next event will suffer loss of vision as they are particularly vulnerable to sun damage .
He warned pilgrims that they could accumulate further problems if they repeated the practice of staring at the sun at the next gathering .
" Any person who has any sort of eye problem would be well advised to give this a very wide berth , " he said .
While some of those who have damaged their vision may recover some of their sight in the short term , the damage this has done could cause serious sight problems as they age , Dr O'Donoghue said .
He warned that people would be doing " grievous bodily harm " to themselves if they insisted on staring at the sun in the hope of seeing visions .
Although the Catholic Church warned against attending , some 10,000 pilgrims attended a gathering at Knock on October 31 in the hope of seeing a vision of the Blessed Virgin -- the mother of God according to Catholic doctrine .
Mr Coleman , of Ballyfermot , Dublin , has again predicted an apparition for this week .
The Bishop of Killaloe , Dr Willie Walsh , and the Archbishop of Tuam , Dr Michael Neary , have both appealed to Catholics to stay away from the event .
Mr Coleman was unavailable for comment last night .

Remember all that pooh - poohing when the gulf states were talking about their own currency ?
About how silly that would be ?
That it would never happen ?
Yeah well , sort of looks like it might .
True , there is a deep and very comfortable denial in the United States such that the country can spend anything it wants , pump debt to any level it likes , play whatever games it wishes with the way it counts spending , and still enjoy the benefits of a reserve currency indefinitely .
That denial may be just about ready to hit reality :
“ The Gulf monetary union pact has come into effect , ” said Kuwait ’s finance minister , Mustafa al - Shamali , speaking at a Gulf Co-operation Council ( GCC ) summit in Kuwait .
The move will give the hyper - rich club of oil exporters a petro-currency of their own , greatly increasing their influence in the global exchange and capital markets and potentially displacing the US dollar as the pricing currency for oil contracts .
Between them they amount to regional superpower with a GDP of $ 1.2 trillion ( £ 739bn ) , some 40 pc of the world ’s proven oil reserves , and financial clout equal to that of China .
Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Bahrain , and Qatar are to launch the first phase next year , creating a Gulf Monetary Council that will evolve quickly into a full - fledged central bank .
The Emirates are staying out for now – irked that the bank will be located in Riyadh at the insistence of Saudi King Abdullah rather than in Abu Dhabi .
They are expected join later , along with Oman .
The Gulf states remain divided over the wisdom of anchoring their economies to the US dollar .
The Gulf currency – dubbed “ Gulfo ” – is likely to track a global exchange basket and may ultimately float as a regional reserve currency in its own right .
“ The US dollar has failed .
We need to delink , ” said Nahed Taher , chief executive of Bahrain ’s Gulf One Investment Bank .
Sir Fred Goodwin ( left ) at the offices of RMJM in Edinburgh with chief executive Peter Morrison
Royal Bank of Scotland shareholders have criticised the appointment of Sir Fred Goodwin by the architectural firm RMJM in Edinburgh .
The consultancy role will be his first job since leaving RBS after the government bailed it out 15 months ago .
Roger Lawson , from the RBS Shareholder Action Group , said it was " ironic " Sir Fred got a job when others were losing theirs in the recession the banks made .
Independent MSP Margo MacDonald said her reaction was " faint disgust " .
Michael Connarty , Labour MP for Linlithgow and East Falkirk , said it was a " very odd appointment " .
Sir Fred , who was born in Paisley , was in charge at the bank for nine years and steered it from being a bit - part player to one of the top five in the world .
He built up the bank with numerous acquisitions but the problems started when RBS bought the Dutch bank ABN Amro at the height of the boom in 2007 .
ANALYSIS Joe Lynam
BBC business correspondent
" It was an opportunity too good to turn down " - that 's how the world 's 5th largest architecture firm described its appointment of the former RBS boss Sir Fred Goodwin .
RMJM is hiring Britain 's most famous ex banker - a man who many blame for all but destroying one of its largest banks and pocketing an enormous pension upon retiring aged 50 .
RMJM , which is using Sir Fred as an adviser , also said that the blame for the near collapse of RBS could n't be laid at the foot of one man .
Sir Fred is not the first banker - blamed for the near collapse of the system 18 months ago - to get a job .
The former boss of HBOS Andy Hornby runs the privately owned high street chemist chain Boots .
Mr Lawson 's shareholder group is pursuing a legal claim against RBS for its £ 12bn rights issue in May 2008 .
That RBS share sale for 200 p per share was made five months before the near collapse of the bank and its rescue by taxpayers .
The bank is now 83 % controlled by the UK government , with shares having collapsed by 95 % since their high point in 2007 .
Sir Fred retired from RBS in September 2008 , aged 50 , with a controversial pension of £ 700,000 per year - a figure which has been subsequently reduced .
Mr Lawson said : " It 's ironic that he 's managed to get a job when others are being let go - and in a recession which banks are responsible for .
" One must question whether the folks who are hiring him are prudent - given that his reputation will precede him everywhere he goes . "
Sir Fred - dubbed " Fred the Shred " - has been appointed as a senior adviser with architectural practice RMJM , where he began work just before Christmas .
It was involved in designing the controversial Scottish Parliament building , though the current management had no involvement in that project .
Sir Fred will be based in Edinburgh but will spend the vast majority of his time overseas .
He will not be on the RMJM board but will join four or five other members of the senior advisory panel of the business .
Mr Connarty said : " People wonder what he knew about banking and will now wonder what he knows about building . "
Pay package The Labour MP added : " There is a deep irony that one the architects of RBS 's downfall is now working for the architects involved in the Holyrood building fiasco . "
Ms MacDonald said : " One of the things that people objected to , and I think with good reason , was the size of Mr Goodwin 's pension pot .
" It now transpires that he is not really pensioned off at all , he is quite capable of earning money with another company . "
The company would not comment on Sir Fred 's pay package , though said it was in line with that of the existing senior advisers to the business .
A spokesman from Sir Fred 's new employer told the BBC : " We 've known Sir Fred on an informal basis for years and it was an opportunity which was too good to turn down .
" He has an ability that 's proven over 20 years . "
" We 're very impressed with him and he 's impressed with us and the rationale for appointing him will become clear going forward . "

Peter Hallward , one of the foremost experts on Haiti ’s history , spoke to Socialist Worker in the UK .
The earthquake in Haiti caused , and continues to cause , such terrible destruction and loss of life because the country is so poor .
There are three main reasons for that .
Firstly , it is the only place where slavery was overthrown solely by slaves .
But it meant a war that lasted 12 years , killed a third of the population , destroyed virtually every city and town , and gutted every plantation .
The second reason that Haiti is poor is that Haitian people paid a price for resisting “ primitive accumulation ” .
In Britain , across Europe and much of the rest of the world , peasants were driven off the land , and a rural and urban proletariat was created .
That did n’t begin to happen in Haiti until the 1970s , when aggressive neoliberal measures ( backed up by local paramilitary pressure ) forced many small farmers to abandon ship .
Tariffs that allowed Haitian agriculture to compete with imports were removed , public spending slashed and publicly owned assets sold off .
Haitians call this the “ American plan ” – or the “ death plan ” .
It was designed to shift labour away from subsistence farming into more “ profitable ” industries like light assembly or garment manufacture .
Dispossessed farmers began to move en masse into increasingly crowded slums , like Cité Soleil , located next to the factory zone .
Unemployment ensured that wages remained the lowest in the hemisphere , at around $ 2 a day ( roughly a quarter of the level paid in the neighbouring Dominican Republic ) .
The army and paramilitary “ Macoutes ” , meanwhile , took steps to discourage people from forming trade unions or fighting back .
But in the 1980s the army began to lose .
Popular protest grew too powerful for the army to control , and in 1990 Haiti elected a president ( Jean - Bertrand Aristide ) who opposed the army and the American plan .
The backlash this resistance provoked is the third reason why Haiti remains poor – poorer now than it was 20 years ago .
Ever since 1990 , the Haitian elite and its international backers have waged an unrelenting campaign to crush this popular movement and discredit its leaders .
This struggle between the people on the one hand and the elite plus the army on the other has defined Haitian politics for the last 20 years – and it ’s a struggle that ’s still going on .
Ever since 1990 , Haiti ’s little ruling class has been looking for ways to force the Haitian people to accept the neoliberal “ development ” plan , and to find new military means of protecting the “ stability ” of the status quo .
At first it seemed as if the popular movement might gain the upper hand .
In the late 1980s it grew rapidly .
It drew on the inspiration of liberation theology , and from the anti-imperialist tradition in Latin America .
Aristide and others around him , in addition to pushing for social justice , talked openly about class and the disparity of wealth .
They also talked about the need for popular self - defence against the army and the Macoutes – and members of the elite began to panic .
The first time Aristide was elected , with 67 percent of the vote , the army dealt with the popular threat in the usual way – with a violent coup .
Thousands were killed when the army regained direct control , from 1991 to 1994 .
Aristide was obliged to remain in exile in the US until the relentless violence induced him to accept some of the neo-liberal measures he had opposed in his election campaign .
The US and its local Haitian clients put a gun to Aristide ’s head and said you have a choice – this will go on until the popular movement is decimated or you accept compromise versions of the policies we want you to adopt .
Threat
Aristide resisted for a long time before deciding he had no real alternative .
Once he was satisfied that Aristide no longer posed a threat , Bill Clinton agreed to send US troops on a “ humanitarian ” mission to “ restore democracy ” in Haiti in September 1994 .
In fact , US troops remained in Haiti for six years , and tried to turn the country into a docile US protectorate .
Aristide , however , managed to accomplish two important things .
Once back in Haiti , he used the cover of the US army to disband Haiti ’s own army .
He thus eliminated the traditional bulwark of the ruling class .
This was a huge step forward .
At the same time , Aristide helped to create a more disciplined political organisation , one that can win and retain political power .
It became known as Fanmi Lavalas .
It emerged from the wreckage of the popular movement repressed during the first coup .
Given the extreme levels of poverty in Haiti it was immediately beset by opportunists .
It was n’t a perfect organisation .
But it was by far the most progressive experiment in parliamentary democracy in Haiti ’s history .
In 2000 Aristide won the presidential election and Fanmi Lavalas won legislative elections by a huge majority – it had 90 percent of the seats in parliament .
So you now had a popular leader , no army and the real prospect of social change .
And at this point , as you might expect , the Haitian ruling class launched a campaign to discredit Aristide and overthrow his government .
They tried to discredit the 2000 elections , the most credible legislative elections in Haiti ’s history .
They tried to bankrupt the government , by suspending all international aid .
The US even blocked loans from the Intra - American Development Bank that had already been agreed .
The effect was to cut the budget in half , and GDP plummeted .
The economy was absolutely hammered and that ’s a big reason why the government remains so weak .
Since 1990 it ’s been impossible to have any meaningful investment in government institutions that would make it possible to regulate the economy – or intervene in a disaster .
Most of the aid that does get through to Haiti has gone overwhelmingly to NGOs – which have their own agendas .
They ’re not interested in building a strong Haitian state .
A lot of them have reactionary religious agendas .
There ’s been a huge growth of evangelical churches that sprang up from virtually nowhere in late 1970s , largely to counteract liberation theology .
A lot of the NGO funding comes through them .
Some may do useful things but on a very small scale and there ’s no coordination .
A lot of people in Haiti think , with good reason , that these NGOs are parasitic .
They ’ve been there for a long time and had no real discernible impact on the levels of poverty or development .
They feed on Haiti ’s problems .
Haiti needs massive national investment and mobilisation of its own people and resources .
The pressure against Aristide that began in 2000 soon developed into a destabilisation campaign with clear international support .
A paramilitary force joined the assault , and launched an insurgency .
On 28 February 2004 the US kidnapped Aristide in the middle of the night and flew him into exile .
The US managed to topple one of the most popular governments in Latin America in a manner that was n’t widely criticised or even recognised as a coup at all .
The democratic government was replaced by a US puppet , Gérard Latortue .
US troops were quickly replaced by a massive UN “ stabilisation ” force .
The UN ’s main role was to pacify people – and to get them to accept the coup .
This involved a low - level war against Aristide ’s supporters , particularly in poor neighbourhoods .
The popular movement has been criminalised .
Supporters are essentially portrayed as criminals and gang members – people who threaten property , and law and order – and politics gets written out of the equation .
You get media reports that Haiti is a violent place but that ’s really not true .
Crime levels are extremely low .
Haiti ’s rulers tell us that the country faces a semi-permanent “ security ” crisis .
This justifies decisions to delay elections – they say it ’s too much of a security risk .
They say that to restore “ democracy ” you first need security .
It justifies UN occupation and US interference .
Of course there are gangs in a city as poor as Port - au - Prince , and the UN has broken up some .
But they have n’t dealt with the reasons why such gangs form in the first place .
Implicated
And there are crimes that the UN itself is implicated including many cases of rape .
The UN acted very aggressively to “ pacify ” neighbourhoods .
In both 2005 and 2006 the UN went into Cité Soleil , a politicised neighbourhood that has strong Lavalas support .
Hundreds of troops opened fire in a densely packed slum where buildings are made of tin or cardboard and bullets keep going until they hit something .
Both times they killed around 20 to 25 people .
The UN also presides over an electoral process which has blocked Lavalas from standing in the legislative elections originally planned for next month .
This makes a mockery of the democratic process .
The UN has had 9,000 troops and police in Haiti , around 1,000 to 1,500 civilian advisers and a budget of $ 600 million a year , the vast bulk of it spent on military activities .
They spend most of their time patrolling the city in armoured vehicles as if was “ hostile territory ” .
They ’ve done virtually nothing to improve basic infrastructure , to provide running water , invest in hospitals , or do anything about sanitation or rubbish removal .
In the aftermath of the earthquake they ’ve guarded their headquarters and sat on their hands .
The fact that they ’ve failed to develop basic water infrastructure will now have a catastrophic effect .
Of course , in the immediate aftermath of a disaster like this , any country would need all the help it can get .
The US was supposed to offer unrivalled logistic resources .
In fact , the relief effort quickly started to resemble a military invasion .
When the US gained control of the airport , it repeatedly turned humanitarian flights aside in favour of military flights .
It wanted to get its own soldiers in place first before they would conduct search and rescue operations or distribute water , food and medicines .
They ’ve been building up a force of 10,000 troops , while untold numbers of people die in the rubble .
No doubt the US military is glad of this opportunity to rebrand the army as a sort of Florence Nightingale , after the disastrous wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The massive US military presence will have a big impact on the reconstruction process .
Naomi Klein is probably right to say that Haitians should watch out for the “ disaster capitalists ” who have exploited disasters in other parts of the world .
I imagine that privatisation will accelerate and that there will be a lot of ugly wrangling about land ownership .
There ’s already more emphasis on “ security ” and “ stability ” , and I imagine we ’ll soon start to see yet more pressure to re-establish a Haitian army .
Most credible journalists have emphasised the remarkable levels of calm and solidarity in the midst of this catastrophe , but the UN and the US emphasise the dangers of looting and rioting .
They talk about the need to avoid another “ Somalia ” .
Very soon this starts to look like a self - fulfilling prophecy .
And the more desperate things get , the more likely it is that the whole reconstruction effort will unfold as a military operation , with UN officials and American commanders – rather than the Haitian people – in charge .
I imagine that as the reconstruction proceeds there ’ll be more pressure for increased international supervision and a consolidation of power around the industrial zones .
Former US president Bill Clinton ’s main job since he was appointed UN envoy has been to emphasise the
need for further investment in the garment industry – basically more sweatshops .
The real priority should be to facilitate meaningful Haitian self - determination as soon as possible .
The priority should be to remobilise the popular movement , and to limit rather than deepen Haiti ’s current dependence on countries like the US and France .
Unfortunately I think the reconstruction process will more resemble what ’s happened in Iraq .
Haiti ’s national government budget is very small .
A few years ago it was around $ 300 million , and last year foreign aid pushed it up to around $ 900 million .
If billions of dollars is raised that would be a massive amount of money for Haiti .
But will it be spent in a way to empower the Haitian people , or will it go into the pockets of the families and corporations that rule Haiti in alliance with their commercial backers in the US and elsewhere ?
I think that ’s what will happen – unless some kind of popular political mobilisation happens to prevent it .

HUMANS living millions of years ago were endurance runners , but how did they do it without air - cushioned soles ?
The secret might have been to land on the balls of their feet .
Daniel Lieberman at Harvard University and colleagues compared the gait of endurance runners in the US and Kenya and found that more than two - thirds of those who grew up running barefoot or had trained themselves to do so as adults ran on their tiptoes , landing on the balls of the feet first ( Nature , DOI : 10.1038/nature08723 ) .
The trend is unusual : …
Twitter is sitting on an amateur configuration blunder that makes it trivial for attackers to take control of user accounts , a researcher said Friday .
The error resides in an Adobe Flash object hosted on the microblogging site , said Mike Bailey , a senior security analyst with penetration testing firm Foreground Security .
Contrary to Adobe recommendations , the object is free to load files hosted virtually anywhere on the net , including those containing booby - trapped javascript and action script .
" This is not Adobe 's fault , " Bailey told El Reg .
" This is due to the fact that a lot of really bad programmers are coding Flash objects .
I 've seen literally hundreds of these things across the web . "
The list of other offenders making the same goof reads like a who's who of search engines , software companies and news sites .
Bailey shared the names with The Register on the condition they not be published .
He plans to out many of the sites during a talk scheduled for next month at the Black Hat security conference in Washington DC .
Using an XML file hosted on one of his servers , Bailey was able to exploit the weakness to cause a dummy account to tweet : " @mckt_ just pwned my Twitter account .
Neat . "
All that was required was that a link on Bailey 's server be clicked while logged in to Twitter .
( As usual , the NoScript addon for Firefox blocked the exploit . )
Pwn me , please
But the consequences could have been more malicious .
" In reality , I have full access to everything your Twitter account has on the web , " Bailey said .
" I can think of a million ways to use this as an attacker . "
Actions include adding or removing account followers and reading direct messages presumed private .
Reconfiguring an object not to talk to strange files generally takes a matter of minutes , maybe an hour or two at most .
And yet , at time of writing , the flaw was still active more than 24 hours after Bailey reported it .
That does n't give us a warm and fuzzy feeling about the site 's security . ®
Update
Around the same time this article was published , Twitter said it had disabled the misconfigured Flash object " out of an abundance of caution " while the situation is assessed .
It was a beautiful cold and breezy day in Cambridge , after the first ~ 1 ″ snowfall of the year , so I took the pups for a walk down by the river .
I remembered that the Boston Museum of Science had installed a bunch of small wind turbines on their roof , so I headed downstream to take a look .
On the north wing of the building they have installed a Windspire ( a 1.2 kW vertical axis giromill ) and a Skystream ( a 2.4 kW horizontal - axis 3 blade downwind turbine ) .
The central tower sports a Swift ( a ~1 kW 5 blade upwind machine with a hula - hoop at the OD of the rotor and two tails ) and a row of ~5 small machines by Aerovironment ( 1kW , 5 blade machine designed for building parapets ) .
The south end of the building had a big Proven machine ( 3 blade downwind ) .
It was interesting to compare the behavior of the various turbines .
At this point I should mention that I was part of the team that designed the Skystream turbine , so I should not pretend to be entirely objective in the following discussion .
The Windspire was running continuously and cuts a dramatic figure ; it ’s reasonably attractive but the blades are straight and long , and they had a sort of strobing effect as they passed the central axis and flashed in the sun .
As I got closer it appeared as if a short segment of the airfoils was missing – there was an interruption in the airfoil between the bottom and the center , which does not appear in their literature .
The ring around the very top of the rotor was not spinning quite true , which made me wonder whether there had been some kind of mishap .
Between its size and the linear nature of its rotor , the Windspire is more visually imposing than the Skystream , despite sweeping less area and producing only 170kWh / month in a standard site as compared to the Skystream ’s 400k Wh / month ( mfg specs in both cases ) .
The Aerovironment machines were spinning most of the time , though a good bit of the time it appeared as if they were n’t spinning fast enough to generate power , and they were yawing around more than the larger turbines – even in such an exposed site , the flow directly above a building parapet must be fairly turbulent , and the central tower behind the turbines could n’t have helped .
One gets the feeling from the pricing ( over $ 10 / watt ) and the product literature ( which does not specify energy production or offer a power curve ) that these are sculpture , not renewable energy equipment .
The Swift was the least impressive ; it was turning some of the time but never appeared to attain sufficient speed to come out of stall and begin producing energy .
Perhaps it was turned off ( or maybe burned out ) .
These machines are also in the sculpural category ; online articles put the installed cost at $ 10 - 12 k , which is about the same as a Skystream , which has 3 times the swept area .
Off by itself at the far end of the building , the big Proven ran continuously and smo0thly ; of all the machines it nodded the least to artistic notions , but projected a reliable , stoutly engineered aura , with large , dense bolt patterns visible at the blade and hub attachments .
These machines are also not cheap , with a 2.5 kW model running around $ 18,000 as best I can tell online .
All in all , my impression was that the Skystream and Proven machines were cranking solidly , the Mariah was big for its output and looked a little beat up , and the other machines were probably not delivering much ( or any ) energy .
Probably not coincidentally , this rank order is the same as the heights of the towers the machines were mounted on – the Skystream and Proven machines were on substantial pole towers , while the bottom of the Mariah machine was only ~ 10 ′ off the roof , and the other turbines were n’t even visually delineated from the structure .
Elsewhere in the urban wind department , I ’ve noticed that there are two big machines on a parking garage over in Alston across the river from Harvard ; they appear to be Bergey 10 kW units , though they ’ve got an aftermarket Harvard paint job .

A recent article in the faith section of the Tribune attempted to support the so - called wall of separation between church and state .
The writer used his free speech rights granted by Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution to defend this view .
However , before Article 1 granted freedom of speech , freedom of the press , and the right of the people to assemble peaceably , it granted the most preeminent right to Americans .
It states , “ Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . ”
Freedom of worship and free exercise of religion was guaranteed protection from an abusive and controlling government .
Our Founding Fathers came from different branches of Christianity , and had experienced the difficulties of state - run religion .
However , they were united in a common faith , and wanted to nurture Christian faith at a national level .
This law and Thomas Jefferson ’s subsequent letter to the Danbury Baptist Association which mentioned the “ wall of separation ” supported this fact .
During this era the Continental Congress ordered and paid for 20,000 Bibles for the American people .
Thomas Jefferson chaired the District of Columbia school board ( which used the Bible and the Isaac Watts Hymnal as curriculum ) .
He also chaired the American Bible Society .
Dr. Benjamin Rush , signer of the Declaration of Independence , organized America ’s first public schools and used the Bible as their curriculum .
Benjamin Franklin who has been characterized as notoriously agnostic and liberal proposed the use of Moses and the Israelites crossing the Red Sea on the great seal of the United States as our emblem of God ’s guidance upon our nation .
From Patrick Henry to George Washington , their letters , speeches and Bibles tell the story of their Christian faith which they put into practice in government .
Although the United States never had a national church , we have had a national faith .
This faith in Almighty God and Jesus Christ is well - documented in the writings of history .
The Smithsonian states that the U.S. was more than 90 percent protestant Christian from it ’s founding through the Civil War era .
Benjamin Franklin stated that atheists and infidels ( those of non-Christian religions ) were rare .
The nation ’s best seminaries at Princeton , Yale and Harvard sent their brightest and best leaders ( some were ministers ) to become governmental leaders , judges , governors and civil servants .
Today the socially liberal tell us that religion and church have their place .
However , they tell us that place is not in the realms of government or the public arena .
They attempt to push Christianity into the church and the home alone .
Yet , Article 1 of the Constitution still stands .
The free exercise of religion is both guaranteed and needed for government to thrive .
It ’s time for the Christians to stand up and serve God and country by bringing their faith to the courthouse , the capitol , the school board , the city office , and the ballot box .
Faith and state do mix , and we have more than 300 years of history which prove it .
What 's growing faster than the number of medical marijuana dispensaries in Colorado ?
The number of proposals to regulate them .
But while it now looks like competing concepts will collide at the Colorado Statehouse when it convenes the second week in January , Denver 's keeping its steady pace toward regulation , with the first reading of a bill slated for January 4 , and a public hearing and vote scheduled for January 11 , sealing a deal that councilman Charlie Brown started working on just two months ago .
" The L.A. city council has been working for two years , and they 've been unable to come up with any kind of model , " Brown said after a fact - finding mission to Los Angeles last month .
" There are more than a thousand dispensaries there , more than there are Starbucks .
It 's just ridiculous .
We do n't want to become another L.A. "
And how .
Ten days ago , the L.A. city council finally passed a measure to restrict medical marijuana clinics -- grandfathering in those that had originally registered with the city , although restricting where they could be located .
Councilmembers thought that under these new rules , the number of clinics would top out at 137 .
But as Los Angeles officials revealed last week , the measure would eliminate all but five clinics in the city .
Five .
So now L.A. 's city council has pushed back consideration of the proposal until January 13 , when members will explore other options .
By then , if Denver 's councilmembers stay the course , this city will have already adopted a reasonable set of regulations .
" We do n't want to become another L.A. , " Brown said .
And he can say that again .
Setting the tech world abuzz , Apple has filed a patent that would let consumers buy its products on a low - or no-cost monthly plan — as long as buyers sign up for an operating system requiring them to interact with ads .
The proposed " enforcement routine " technology would freeze users '
iPhones or computers if they fail to click a button or answer a test question to prove they 've obediently heeded the advertising .
Rotten idea ?
" Enforcement " will alienate Mac fans : Everything about this technology seems so " antithetical " to Apple 's user - friendly philosophy , says Randall Stross at The New York Times ' Digital Domain blog , that it's hard to believe co-founder Steve Jobs even knew about it .
Yet , there 's his name , listed first on the patent .
" Apple Would n't Risk Its Cool Over an Ad Gimmick , Would It ? "
Obligatory ads might be tolerable on an iPhone : " I 'm not interested in a Mac with this ' feature ' under any conditions , " says Jeff Porten at PC World , " but offer me an iPhone with a free monthly plan ?
Maybe .
Just maybe . "
" Apple Applies for Patent on OS With Embedded Advertising "
If this patent becomes reality , hackers will happily destroy it : Apple is known for its bulletproof security , but enforcement routine software " would encourage serious under - the - hood chicanery , " says Chris Dannen at Fast Company .
The " holy grail " of hackers everywhere is a " subsidized but ad - free Mac " – and they 'll be a step closer if this technology is rolled out .
" Apple Tries to Patent Ad- Supported , Subsidized Mac OS "
Apple must make the benefits outweigh the irritation : Such an advertising approach might just work in time , says Christian Zibreg at Geek.com , if Apple can follow Google 's success in making advertisements relevant and useful .
We already rely on ads to keep Facebook , Gmail , and other online services free : " If such an ad- supported business model makes the Internet tick , it might work with desktop software , right ? "

It 's all over but the shouting .
The Iraq occupation is winding down .
The countdown for American withdrawal from Afghanistan has begun .
The trumpets of war are playing Taps .
And George W. Bush and his nest of hawks have flown the coop .
Or have they ?
As the second decade of a broken century limps into view , some in the United States and abroad are doing the math and demanding an accounting .
They reject the argument that the horrific 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington excuse the shredding of the rule of law that came with the " war on terror . "
They say the legitimization of torture , the trampling of civil liberties , the violation of international law , and a dubious declaration of war that claimed more than 4,000 American and 100,000 Iraqi lives are not just miscalculations but crimes .
War crimes , in fact .
" This administration did more than commit crimes , " argues Scott Horton , an expert on international law and contributing editor of Harper 's magazine .
" It waged war against the law itself . "
Those who believe decision - makers in the Bush administration should be investigated , and potentially brought to trial , were heartened by the victory in 2008 of Barack Obama , a candidate who campaigned on renewal and change .
But with the U.S. weathering an economic earthquake , and the political landscape jaggedly polarized , Obama has shown little appetite for pursuing former administration members .
Bush - era strategists such as former vice - president Dick Cheney spend more time on the podium – pulling vast sums as celebrity guests – than on the witness stand .
Some legal advisors and intelligence officials may fear a reckoning , but not those who held command responsibility .
So the dilemma remains : can a country that has allowed the rule of law to be flouted continue as a credible democracy , setting an example to ordinary citizens and claiming the moral high ground in the international community ?
" The fact that a huge slough of people were engaged in torture and conspiracy to torture , with impunity , says something about the rule of law in this country , " laments Michael Ratner of the Center for Constitutional Rights .
" If we think we need to torture someone for any reason we 'll do that .
What does that say to any police precinct ? "
Or to America : " I 'm very pessimistic on what I considered an emerging sense of fundamental rights , " he says .
" In some ways civilization has been set back at least 100 years . "
" In Syria . . . the cell was like a grave .
It was three feet wide , six feet deep and seven feet high .
There was a small opening in the ceiling , about one foot by two feet with iron bars . . . there were cats and rats up there and from time to time the cats urinated through the opening into the cell . "
– Testimony of Arar to U.S. Congress hearings
THE ARGUMENT IS that the Bush Administration 's " war on terror " prompted skewing of intelligence that led to war in Iraq , an operation that cost not only blood but treasure , draining an estimated $ 3 trillion in U.S. taxpayer dollars ; that it also created homeland surveillance programs not seen since the witch - hunts of the anti-communist McCarthy era ; and that the administration enabled " rendition " flights of terrorism suspects like Canadian Maher Arar to countries where they could be tortured , and that it created secret " black sites " where suspects were held and interrogated .
Those suspected of terrorist links could be seized and brought before military tribunals , their constitutional rights suspended .
Of these excesses , torture has had the most traction in legal circles , and seems most likely to bring scrutiny , if not justice , to some members of the Bush administration .
British international lawyer Philippe Sands , author of Torture Team : Uncovering War Crimes in the Land of the Free , spent months interviewing those he says created a regime of abusive interrogation .
He concluded the lawyers who advised Bush , Cheney , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and others , were guilty of giving the unsound advice that terrorism suspects had no right to protection under international law , a view that the U.S. Supreme Court overruled in 2006 .
By that time , Sands contends , a " torture team " had made abuses systematic , eliminating the constraints of the Geneva Conventions , the 1984 treaties prohibiting torture , and even the army 's own Field Manual .
The administration lawyers have made outraged denials of Sands ' claims , calling them " misrepresentations " and even deliberate lies , although they were drawn from taped encounters .
Sands ' investigation did not reach the top echelons of power , nor did it launch prosecutions in the U.S.
But other countries have been quicker off the mark .
Last spring , a Spanish court began a criminal investigation of six former Bush officials on suspicion of aiding and abetting torture .
Italy has convicted 23 Americans , mainly CIA operatives , in absentia , for kidnapping a Muslim cleric from Milan in 2003 and sending him to allegedly be torture in Egypt .
" They beat me with a shredded electrical cable about 2 inches in diameter .
One of the men beating me said that he could not believe the United States would send someone innocent here .
Then . . .
I was taken to a waiting room from where I could hear other prisoners being tortured and screaming .
The women 's screams haunt me most . "
– Testimony of Arar to U.S. Congress hearings
BACK IN THE U.S. , the pace of enquiry lags .
" It 's clear the Obama administration would prefer to move on and not have to deal with accountability issues at all , " says Horton .
" But not every door is closed . "
Obama , who campaigned on a ticket of reconciliation , has shied away from pointing fingers at his predecessor 's office , even on matters as grave as torture .
And , he hints , ending practices that " ran counter to American values " is more important than digging up dirt .
" I'm a strong believer that it 's important to look forward and not backwards , and to remind ourselves that we do have very real security threats out there , " he told CNN .
But the possibility of investigation , if not prosecution , still exists , even if it goes only a small way up the ladder of responsibility .
Attorney - General Eric Holder appointed a special prosecutor , John Durham , also investigating the CIA 's destruction of interrogation videotapes , to probe whether CIA officials or contractors should be criminally investigated for alleged torture of terrorism detainees .
Since Durham 's appointment last August , little has emerged .
The backlash has been fierce , with rights groups angered that only low - level operatives would be scrutinized , and conservatives insisting it could chill the security establishment 's efforts to protect the U.S .
The furor is a small hint of the bitterness that would follow an attempt to target those in command .
" In a perfect world there would be significant trials of people at the top , " says John Graham , an outspoken former American diplomat and head of the Giraffe Heroes Project for promoting community change , who found himself on a no - fly list during Bush 's presidency .

" But if that happened all hell would break loose , and in my view it just is n't worth it . "
Graham 's view is n't unique .
Many who defend the rule of law shudder at the thought of a new round of bare - knuckle political battles , at a time when the country 's economy is battered , and its place in the world shaky .
The tribulations , they worry , may be worse than the trials .
" Public life in America has never been gracious or rational , " said The New Republic 's Leon Wieseltier in The New York Times .
" But sometime around 2003 we entered a new era of volatility and virulence . "
It was fuelled , she says , by leadership that put itself above the law , and divided the world into those " with us or with the terrorists . "
" To those who scare peace - loving people with phantoms of lost liberty , my message is this , " then Attorney - General John Ashcroft told Congress .
" Your tactics only aid terrorists – for they erode our national unity and diminish our resolve .
They give ammunition to America 's enemies . "
But there are other reasons why the Obama administration may want to limit investigation of Bush officials .
" The Democratic Party has never acknowledged the mistakes ( President Bill ) Clinton made that led to 9/11 , " says Roy Gutman , foreign editor of McClatchy newspapers , and author of How We Missed the Story .
" They have never come to terms with that , and Obama has n't forced them to . "
Nor , he adds , did the party stand up to Bush on the invasion of Iraq or the mishandling of Guantanamo Bay : " we 've had a feckless opposition , and it 's now in government . ''
Some say high crimes go back much farther in history , raising questions that few have the nerve , strength or means to tackle .
" My fundamental view is that this country went very wrong many years ago , " says Lawrence Velvel , dean of Massachusetts School of Law , and a founder of a steering committee for prosecution of high level Bush officials .
" There are some who would carry it back to the Indian removal . "
In the 21st century , however , punishing war crimes is the exception rather than the rule , in spite of high profile international prosecutions and growing recognition that perpetrators can be called to account .
" Exposure is the next best thing , " says Gutman .
" We in the media have a much greater role than is generally assumed .
If we do it properly , we can spotlight violations as they are occurring , with maximum documentation , in the hope that eventually governments will take up the case . "
Since Bush left office , shelves of books have been published , with damning accounts of acts that could lay the foundation for prosecution , however distant .
Ratner and the Center for Constitutional Rights presents its case in The Trial of Donald Rumsfeld : A Prosecution by Book , published before Obama 's election .
If no action is taken against alleged war criminals who have advocated torture , it suggests , readers – and history – must be the judge .
But the overarching principle remains : " we must hold those responsible for torture accountable .
We can not put the genie back in the bottle .
Perhaps we can deter future conduct if we send a message to the world that torturers , like the pirates of old , are enemies of all humankind and will be brought to justice no matter what their power or high office . "
Sands is convinced that could happen in the U.S. Eventually .
And he points out , Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet was indicted a decade after leaving office .
" At some point the dam will break , the wall of impunity will be breached , and someone will be investigated , " he argues .
" Whether it 's the lawyers or the ultimate decision - makers I do n't know .
But history teaches that these things do n't go away . "
For those at the sharp end of torture , that is a given .
" These past few years have been a nightmare for me .
I have lived in constant psychological pain .
I now understand how fragile our human rights and freedoms are , and how easily they can be taken away from us by the very same governments and institutions that have sworn to protect us . "
I also know that the only way I will ever be able to move on in my life and have a future is if I can find out why this happened to me , and prevent it from happening to others .

Footage on local television station , WALB , showed a large black doll hanging over the sign , which is located above a shop on the main street in the rural town .
Residents who saw it thought the effigy must have put in place during the night , WALB reports .
One Plains resident said the Secret Service had already interviewed local people .
" We wish it had n't happened .
It 's not the kind of publicity the town of Plains likes , " Jan Williams , who runs a hotel , was quoted as saying by The Atlanta Journal - Constitution .
She described Plains , which has a population of fewer than 700 people , as a " nice , quiet town " .

Advertisement Rising from the bowels of the earth are giant trucks laden with coal .
One after another they lumber past .
Just the wheels of each truck are double the height of a man .
The engines roar as these massive machines grind up the road that climbs up from the bottom of the Pingshou open cast coal mine .
We 're in China 's northern Shanxi province , the heartland of its huge coal industry .
A bitterly cold wind whips through the air .
The enormous mine they 're digging here must be one of the biggest man-made holes in the planet .
The mine is big enough to fit a small town into .
All around diggers claw at the earth , giant trucks growl to and fro .
If you want to know where many of today 's carbon emissions come from , this is one place to look .
Energy use soaring China 's massive use of coal is what makes it the world 's biggest emitter of carbon .
Coal supplies over two thirds of China 's energy needs .
Some 40 % of the coal mined on the planet is dug out of the ground in China .
" We have enough coal here to last 90 years , " Mr Huang , a supervisor at the mine tells me as we bump along the rough road cut into the side of the pit .
CLIMATE CHANGE GLOSSARY
Glossary in full
And that 's the real question .
What will happen to China 's coal industry in the next 20 to 30 years , because China 's use of coal could double or even triple .
If that 's the case , then what every other nation does about climate change may not matter if China does n't clean up its act .
The nearby power station burns 20,000 tonnes of coal a day .
It was built from a Czech design dating back to the 1970s .
China has pledged to produce power more efficiently , saying it will reduce carbon intensity by 40 % from 2005 to 2020 .
But that does n't really change the path China is already taking , and in the coming years its carbon emissions will continue to rise substantially .
The reason is that as China gets richer energy use is soaring .
Jeff and Ada Qian both work as IT specialist for international firms in Shanghai .
At home in their flat they and their 10 - month - old son Tim enjoy many of the comforts of modern life .
They have air conditioning , a car , a fridge , a washing machine and two televisions .
Our emissions must continue to go up ... we should be allowed to emit more than the rich world
Pan Jiahu
Adviser to the Chinese Government
Copenhagen in graphics " I feel so far our life is good , " Jeff tells me , " but I think people always have ambitions , you always want to have more .
If I have more money I want to have a better car , a bigger apartment . "
Today perhaps one third of China 's 1.4 billion people live like this , and many of the rest aspire to .
" I think many of China 's people would like a lifestyle like us , " says Ada .
" I do n't think that means we should copy the lifestyle of the West .
Maybe we can find cleaner sources of energy . "
' Need to develop '
But in its megacities , such as Shanghai , China is copying the West , urbanising on an incredible scale .
In the coming 30 years China is planning for 450 million more people to move from the countryside to the cities .
In places like Shanghai and Beijing , carbon emissions per head already rival the West's .
And if China 's emissions keep rising on current trends , every single Chinese person may be emitting more on average than every European by around 2030 .
Pan Jiahua is an adviser to the Chinese government on climate change .
He says China 's emissions must be allowed to rise above the developed world 's on a per capita basis .
Mr Jiahua says the rich world has built the infrastructure it needs and must now make major cuts to emissions .
But as long as China is still developing it 's emissions need to keep going up .
" We need to develop so we need lots of energy .
Our emissions must continue to go up .
Developed countries must bring their emissions down , perhaps even to zero .
So we should be allowed to emit more than the rich world , " he says .
" Eventually CO2 emissions will stabilise and all countries will emit about the same per person . "
Green energy China is searching for clean energy .
It wants to lead the world in green technologies .
In the vast , flat Gobi desert in China 's far west it 's busy building the world 's biggest wind farms .
The scale dwarfs anything in Europe or America .
The scale of China 's challenge
We watched as a giant rotor was lifted by a huge crane and fixed into place high above the ground on one of the turbines .
Teams of men pulled on ropes to ease the vast blades into position .
Abdul Ali is leading the crew who are installing the wind farms .
They are putting up two new turbines every three days .
Eventually a massive area of desert will be peppered with them .
The wind farms being built here in western Gansu province will produce as much electricity as 16 coal - fired power stations .
" This is the Three Gorges Dam of wind power , " Abdul Ali says proudly .
But when the winds drop , the turbines slow to a stop .
Even here in what is one of China 's windiest places , it 's clear wind can't be relied on to power China 's needs the way coal can .
So if China continues to rely on coal , and if more than one billion Chinese end up emitting more carbon per head than Europeans , the future for tackling climate change could be bleak .

Mere hours before bidding was scheduled to end on the infamous DUI La- Z - Boy - Mobile , the motorized recliner suddenly vanished from the auction -- and TMZ has learned it 's all because of a battle over its name .
With the price at $ 43,100 and rising , eBay received a demand letter from the most unlikely of parties -- the La - Z - Boy corporation itself .
We 're told La - Z - Boy played the trademark card due to the title of the auction " La - Z - Boy DWI Chair " and eBay was forced to pull the auction .
Here 's the worst part : the chair was being auctioned off by the Proctor Minnesota Police Department and all profits were to benefit the taxpayers .
We 're told La - Z - Boy " felt bad " about stopping the auction -- but hey , business is business .
Fear not motorized chair enthusiasts -- we 've learned the cops plan on re-listing the chair in just a few hours .
( WIRED ) -- Apple 's got a lot planned for its Wednesday press event .
While the invitation -- " come see our latest creation " -- is broad and vague , it 's fairly obvious that the biggest news will be the widely anticipated tablet .
It 's about time .
Tech observers have been anticipating an Apple tablet for several years , churning out report after report of rumors and speculation .
And Apple has been considering tablet designs since at least 1983 .
Now , perfectionist CEO Steve Jobs finally seems satisfied enough with the product to show it off in public .
Are you excited about the Apple tablet ?
But that 's not the only thing the company is likely to announce .
Updates to the MacBook line and the iPhone OS are also likely to be on the ticket .
Here 's our guide to what you can realistically expect .
And if you do n't care to read our predictions , just stay tuned for the January 27 event .
We 'll be providing live blog and news coverage here on Gadget Lab and on Twitter : follow @bxchen and @GadgetLab for real - time news nuggets .
The Apple tablet
Multiple independent reports have described the tablet 's appearance as a 10 - to 11 - inch iPhone or iPod Touch .
( AppleInsider 's sources describe the tablet as " a first - generation iPhone that 's met its match with a rolling pin . " )
The tablet , many have reported , will serve as a slate - like substitute for magazines , newspapers and books , while also offering the general - purpose functions seen in the iPhone , such as gaming , viewing photos , Web surfing and using apps .
A recent report from The Wall Street Journal said Apple will market the tablet to be shared among multiple people at home or in classrooms , thanks to its bigger screen .
A few reports have claimed the tablet will sport a 10 - inch OLED touchscreen , which would be great for reading books .
But there are n't many of these displays on the market , and they would also cost Apple about $ 400 apiece .
A 10 - inch LCD touchscreen , on the other hand , would cost Apple $ 60 , much more in line with the expected $ 1,000 price tag .
The true mystery about the tablet lies in its software and user interface .
Simply expanding the iPhone OS to fit a larger screen can't be the whole story .
We expect a tablet interface that strives to appeal to everyone , like the iPhone OS does with its 3.5 - inch screen , SpringBoard user interface and fingertip - sized icons .
The ergonomics of text entry will especially be challenging on a device that size .
People briefed on the product say it will incorporate a virtual keyboard .
But if the tablet is going to serve as an alternative to a notebook or netbook , an ordinary virtual QWERTY is n't going to cut it .
We 're predicting Apple will incorporate new multitouch gestures , and maybe even the accelerometer , to trigger functions of the traditional QWERTY keyboard .
Imagine if pressing two fingers down anywhere triggered the Shift key , for example .
And to add a wild guess , we think Apple will expand on the voice - recognition feature seen in the iPhone 3GS , to augment text entry .
Still , no one outside Apple 's tablet team has a solid idea of what the tablet 's interface will be like .
The only minuscule clue is a quote from a recently departed Apple employee who told New York Times ' Nick Bilton , " You will be very surprised how you interact with the new tablet . "
If it 's taken Apple this long to figure it out , I 'm sure we will be .
But we do expect the tablet 's operating system to share some of the same DNA as the iPhone OS .
Indeed , the iPhone reportedly contains some elements of an older , shelved Apple tablet project .
What could it be called ?
Internet sleuths at MacRumors.com have found evidence suggesting Apple is interested in the names iSlate , MagicSlate , iGuide and iPad .
Apple has apparently filed for trademarks for each of those names .
Apple not only filed for the iSlate trademark ; the company also procured ownership of the domain iSlate.com , making this the most likely candidate .
As for when the tablet will ship , WSJ published the most credible report to date claiming Apple has plans to ship the device in March .
Price tag ?
All we 've heard are guesses from analysts , some who claim the tablet will cost as much as $ 1,000 including carrier subsidy .
We estimate the tablet should cost between $ 700 and $ 1,000 , placing it somewhere in between an iPhone and a MacBook .
There are a few scant rumors claiming the tablet will be carried by Verizon , but none seems substantive enough to bet money on .
There 's too little information out there about the carrier to make any reasonable predictions .
In summary :
A 10 - to 11 - inch tablet
Somewhat resembling the iPhone hardware
Substantially expanded version of the iPhone OS
Probably called iSlate
With a new interface
Possibly two versions : LCD and OLED
With Wi-Fi and 3G data connections
i Phone OS 4.0 , iLife 2010
Fox News ' Clayton Morris had a scoop citing anonymous Apple employees who claim iPhone OS 4.0 and iLife 2010 will be announced at the event .
I 'm a believer .
The tablet will likely have a beefed - up version of the iPhone OS with all the newest features .
So given the logic that the tablet OS is ready to be announced , iPhone OS 4.0 should be ready for a preview as well .
But a preview would probably be it , just so Apple can begin seeding betas to developers to prepare their iPhone apps for 4.0 .
As for iLife 2010 , Apple has announced almost all of its iLife suites during January of years past .
I believe we 'll see an iLife launch only because it would be consistent .
Jobs likes to pepper up press events with small announcements leading up to the major " One more thing , " so iLife and iPhone OS 4.0 will probably be the first to be announced .
MacBook Pro upgrades -- maybe
An Intel contest promoted by e-mail appeared to leak upcoming MacBook Pros equipped with the newest Intel chips .
Intel had sent e-mails to members of its Intel Retail Edge program , promoting a chance to win two MacBook Pros equipped with Intel 's new Core i5 processors during January , according to a report by MacRumors .
However , Intel soon after retracted the promotion , saying it was a mistake and that HP notebooks would be given away for the contest instead .
I found this move suspicious , because the promotion had been sent in multiple languages to members in the United States , the United Kingdom and Spain .
Seems odd that it would have gotten so far if the product were n't even real .
Plus , MacBook
Pros are due for a refresh .
Apple last upgraded the MacBook Pro in June 2009 , and typically the company refreshes notebooks every six or seven months .
Therefore , my gut tells me Intel realized it accidentally leaked the MacBook Pros and then moved to undo the slip .
I believe there 's a good chance MacBook Pros will be announced at next week 's event .
iTunes Upgrade
I have n't seen any rumors of Apple introducing a new version of iTunes , but I assume it would have to , in order to launch the tablet .
That 's because the tablet alone wo n't be compelling unless it creates avenues for new content that can be used on the tablet , such as e-books , newspapers and magazines .
Expect Apple to preview a new version of iTunes , perhaps 9.1 , that would add new content sections to the iTunes Store .
We 'll most realistically see a new e-book section demonstrated in iTunes , as Apple has reportedly been in talks with HarperCollins Publishers to make e-books for the tablet .

Cheer up !
At least it 's not 1947 - the winter of power cuts , no TV or baths and children sent to bed without dinner because there was n't enough food
On Thursday , January 23 , snow began to fall in the South East .
It was the start of Britain 's most severe and protracted spell of bad weather during the 20th century .
Housewife Florence Speed was one of millions who shivered .
' I was frozen today , ' she noted in her diary .
' Gas is on at such low pressure .
Worked with scarf over my head , mittens on , and a rug round my legs . '
Two women delivering milk in Northampton by sledge during the harsh winter of 1947
The big freeze continued to tighten its grip .
By the 29th , the coldest day for more than 50 years , poor Florence was borrowing a balaclava to wear in bed .
She was not the only one to feel the cold .
The lights went out all over the country ; electricity was off for long spells ; gas in most big cities was at about a quarter of its normal pressure ; and amid huge snow drifts , transport virtually ground to a halt .
' Wearing my snow boots and fur - lined coat I was not once warm , ' grumbled architectural historian James Lees - Milne .
' All my pipes are frozen , so a bath or a wash is out of the question .
WC at the office frozen likewise .
And we live in the 20th century .
Even the basic elements of civilisation are denied us . '
A visitor to London at this miserable time was the author of Goodbye To Berlin , Christopher Isherwood , over from America for the first time since before the war .
A London bus that had to be dug out of a snowdrift in 1947
He felt that Londoners themselves ' did n't seem depressed or sullen ' - though ' their faces were still wartime faces , lined and tired ' , while ' many of them stared longingly at my new overcoat ' - and his only criticism of their prevailing stoicism was that ' perhaps the English had become a little too docile in their attitude toward official regulation ' .
By contrast , he found London 's physical shabbiness ' powerfully and continuously depressing ' .
As for the snow , he said , 'it soon assumed the aspect of an invading enemy .
' The newspapers spoke of it in quasi-military language : " Scotland Isolated " , " England Cut in Half " ... everybody in England was shivering .
I remember how the actors played to nearly empty houses , heroically stripped down to their indoor clothes , while the audience huddled together , muffled to the chins in overcoats , sweaters and scarves .
' Two or three of my friends said to me : " Believe us , this is worse than the war ! "
By which I understood them to mean that the situation could n't by any stretch of the imagination be viewed as a challenge to self - sacrifice or an inspiration to patriotism ; it was merely hell . '
Such were Isherwood 's recollections , published some nine years later .
At the time , his visit made a considerable impact upon his friends .
' We realised we had become rather careless of appearances in our battered surroundings , ' recalled his host , the writer John Lehmann : ' The adrenaline [ of war ] was no longer being pumped into our veins .

' We endured with misery and loathing the continual fuel cuts , the rooms private and public in which we shivered in our exhausted overcoats , while the snow blizzards swept through the country again and yet again .
' Were there to be no fruits of victory ?
The rationing coupons that still had to be presented for everything from eggs to pieces of scraggy Argentine meat , from petrol to bed linen and " economy " suits , seemed far more squalid and unjust than during the war .
' Worse , still , to my increasingly disillusioned eye , was the kind of mean puritanism that the newly triumphant Labour MPs and their officials appeared to have decided was the proper wear of the day .
Too many of them seemed to think there was a virtue in austerity and shabbiness , in controls and restrictions . '
The snow continued .
On February 3 , there was a heavy fall in the north and Midlands .
Retired teacher Mary King noted in Birmingham : ' Tonight , 17,000 employees will be idle at the Longbridge Austin Motor Works through lack of fuel .
Many other firms are in the same plight .
It is a dreadful thing to face . '
Two days later , her anxiety deepened : ' One thinks of the shortage of fuel , and home comforts , such as blankets & sheets - the scarcity of food - and the unemployment of thousands of workers in factories due to lack of coal materials .
Never in my lifetime have I known such a period of history . '

With supplies of coal failing to reach London , the Midlands and the North - West , he announced that from the following Monday not only would electricity supplies to industry in these regions be suspended , but householders there would have to make do without electricity daily for five hours .
' Somebody has been short - sighted somewhere , sometime , ' was Mary King 's eaction , and over the weekend much wrath , public and private , was directed at Shinwell .
The pro-Tory Glasgow patternmaker Colin Ferguson castigated Shinwell 's ' crass ignorance ' and saw the crisis as conclusive evidence that Clement Attlee 's government was ' the silliest set of sneering gas - bags we 've ever been cursed with in this country ' .
On Sunday it did start to thaw in London .
But on Monday , 'it froze again very hard , so that ' , in Lees - Milne 's words , ' the slush is like slippery brick ' .
The next 12 days or so were the height of the crisis , with the weather unremittingly grim and unemployment rising to over 1.75 million ( compared to just over 400,000 in mid-January ) .
Government - imposed restrictions were intensified : no electricity for five hours a day across the nation 's households ; television ; major cuts in radio transmission times ; newspapers severely cut down in size ; most forms of external lighting forbidden ; and no electricity to be used in relation to activities such as greyhound racing .
Inevitably , the miners in these weeks came under acute pressure to raise production levels .
The biggest freeze ?
Cars and buses struggle to negotiate Trafalgar Square in January of 1947
On Sunday the 16th , ' Coal Sunday ' , many miners in Wales voluntarily worked a full shift , winning praise for the ' Dunkirk spirit ' .
Few people enjoyed these mid-February days and nights .
At Oxford , ' CHRIST IT'S BLEEDING COLD ' was how the undergraduate writer Kingsley Amis put it to his friend the poet Philip Larkin in the university newspaper .
' Life here is quite impossible , ' Evelyn Baring of the merchant bank Barings reported to a fellowbanker , ' and really no one would have believed it if they had read it in a novel .
From 9 to 12 and 2 to 4 we work in the dim glow of candlelight or nightlight . '
Diary entries from the time reveal the scale of the privations - and growing frustration - of the ordinary public : Rose Uttin writes : ' February .
No soap to be bought anywhere , & I feel ready to drop with fatigue by 2 pm .
Lily sent me 2lb potatoes through the post ; I am saving them for Sunday 's dinner . '
And Florence Speed records .
' Penalty now for using current during restricted times , the situation being " dangerously critical " , is now a fine of £ 100 or three months ' jail .
Yet despite this a woman in a queue in Brixton declared defiantly , " Well anyway , I 'm going to switch on the iron ; do my ironing as soon as I get home . "
It 's because so many have n't played fair - the worst offenders are shopkeepers - that the penalties have been imposed . '
A coalman in Croydon spoke with particular personal experience .
' It 's like everything else , the people with a lot of money get all they want , ' he explained .
' I delivered half a ton this morning to a house in Purley , their fair ration mind you , but they 've already got a stock of about a ton and a half and a couple of tons of coke besides .
Now you can't get any coke , but those fellers can , they 've got the money see . '
Wrong type of snow : Tunnels to front door of a house covered by snow in the Peak District , Derbyshirein 1947
In terms of obeying the restrictions on the use of power it is clear that not everyone played the game .
Nevertheless , in the weeks beginning February 10 and February 17 , there were rates of saving of 29 per cent and 28 per cent , ie by comparison with the level of coal consumption immediately before the cuts .
For one child , this winter the big freeze was a mixed blessing , for another it was an unmitigated disaster .
Future Labour politician Roy Hattersley , growing up in Sheffield , every day after school went sledging - ' tearing downhill on toboggans as we used the public highways as our Cresta Run ' , for at that time ' there were few motor cars in Wadsley ' .
But at night he would leap into bed , still with the socks on that had protected him from ' the freezing linoleum ' and huddle under an 'immense weight of sheet , threadbare blankets , eiderdown and coats carried up from the wardrobe at the bottom of the stairs ' .
For the future Rolling Stone Bill Wyman , growing up in Penge , South London , the atrocious weather meant that his bricklayer father was laid off work and no money came in .
' There was n't enough food to go round , so he'd hit a couple of us , send us to bed without any dinner , ' one of Bill 's brothers recalled .
' " Get to bed , do n't argue ! "
Then you 'd get hit , kicked up the stairs - vroom , that was it .
And in the house we lived in , you did n't want to go to bed .
It was freezing , really nasty , with ice on the inside of the windows . '
The weather remained bitterly cold until well into March , but industry gradually got its power back and almost all the temporarily unemployed returned to work .
The restrictions on domestic use of electricity , however , remained in force until the end of April ; though the clear evidence was of a rising trend from late February in covert consumption , suggestive of a general unwillingness to continue making peacetime sacrifices .
Eventually , the weather did turn .
' The thaw is here ! ' exalted Gladys Langford on the 10th , and within a week it had spread from the south of England to elsewhere .
But widespread floods , caused by heavy rain accompanying the thaw , affected as many as 31 counties south of the River Ouse , destroying 70,000 acres of wheat and 80,000 tons of potatoes .

January 26 , 2010 -- During the dubious Honduran election process leading up to voting day on November 27 , 2009 , the people would chant “ Santos [ 1 ] de santo no tiene nada .
Lobo de lobo lo tiene todo ” [ " ( Elvin ) Santos gets nothing from the saints ; Lobo ’s taken it all from the wolf . ” ]
On January 27 new puppets will take centre stage in the puppetry act Tegucigalpa , Honduras .
Elected " president " Pepe Lobo ( no doubt called " wolf , or little wolf " by his gringo controllers at the US embassy ) will accept the strings of attachment to the invisible government and state power that continue to rule in Honduras .
This obscure and menacing group is an unelected corps of representatives of the army high command and of the ten ruling oligarchic families .
They meet under the informal moderation of the US ambassador of the day , and with the blessing of the ranking cleric of the Roman Catholic Church .
Lobo has agreed to offer a " safe conduct " visa to ousted President Mel Zelaya , who is still exiled in the Brazilian embassy along with supporters .
The January 26 edition of the Tegucigalpa daily El Heraldo reported that Arturo Valenzuela ( US Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs ) and US ambassador Hugo Llorens , accompanied by a Canadian government diploflunky , will meet with outgoing ( and ousted ) President Mel Zelaya in the afternoon at the Brazilian embassy ( see http://www.elheraldo.hn/Ediciones/2010/01/26/Noticias/Funcionarios-de-EE-UU-afinan-salida-de-Zelaya ) .
The photos that will certainly be taken of the encounter , and Zelaya ’s subsequent helicopter trip to Toncontín airport , will offer a somewhat sublime ( or obscene , depending on viewpoint ) symbol of how this scene began , and how the curtain dropped .
Zelaya was kidnapped by armed soldier - thugs on June 28 , 2009 , and hustled out of the country to Costa Rica , with a brief stopover at the US - controlled Soto Cano ( Palmerola ) airforce base near the capital .
Costa Rica 's president Oscar Arias , who was later to play a back - stabbing role in the San José talks between coup leaders and President Zelaya 's representatives , knew President Mel had been kidnapped prior to his arrival in the Costa Rican capital , clad only in his pyjamas .
Arias ’ perfidious role in helping to disguise and camouflage Washington 's role in the coup , and later to legitimise and consolidate the coup regime , was foretold the day of the flight from Soto Cano to Costa Rica .
Defeat ?
Some sectors on the international and Latin American left have expressed a sense of despair or fatalism with respect to what has been , in many circles , been interpreted as a defeat for Latin American independence from the overwhelming power of Washington and the weighty US military - industrial - communications complex .
Obama , after all , it seems , pulled one over on the Organization of American States ' ( OAS ) majority that had vowed never to accept the coup .
He managed to entice the servile and discredited Oscar Arias to broker a negotiations process whose only purpose was to confuse and disorient the resistance forces in Honduras , the international solidarity movement , and to buy urgently needed time to bring the coup regime into a smooth , uneventful landing , safe and out of harm ’s way .
This maneuvre succeeded , despite warnings from grassroots leaders in Honduras and wise counsel from international revolutionary leaders including Cuba 's Fidel Castro and Venezuela 's Hugo Chávez .
But , did the San José maneuvre and the survival of Roberto Micheletti's coup regime until the end of the constitutional period of the deposed president bring about a clear , certain and stable victory for the Honduran ruling class and its imperial backers in Washington ?
That question has already been answered on the streets and university grounds of the country , in the factories and workplaces , in the public employees ' sector , in the rural fields and agricultural work centers , and in the ports and transport industries .
The mass national resistance movement against the June 28 coup remains a viable and significant political force .
It was not disoriented either by Oscar Arias or by the electoral sham on November 27 .
Despite disagreements over how to respond to both challenges and obstacles , the movement remains strong and united .
This resistance is without precedent in Indo - Latin America and the Caribbean .
Never has such a prolonged resistance to a military coup held its ground and outlasted formal political stalemate .
Mass movement
This movement has united and educated forces across the traditional barriers of class , race , ethnicity , language , gender , age , rural - urban differences , culture , regionalisms and educational backgrounds .
It has demonstrated political sophistication , not just here and there , or at the most critical moments , but consistently .
It has resisted , and continues to resist , provocative efforts of the secret police and CIA agents to entice its younger elements into violent and criminal acts in order to create public support for even harsher repressive measures .
It has evaded efforts to promote provocations against the police and rank - and - file soldiers in order to keep the largely poor and rural soldier ranks isolated from the mass protests and propaganda in favour of democratic rights and the constitution of the republic .
It has risen over and over again to the challenge of uniting very diverse class and political tendencies and forces into a fist of defiance , without falling into the temptation of silencing the ranks in order to lend an appearance of more solid support for leadership decisions .
By maintaining openness and ample space for the voices of the grassroots , the resistance has demonstrated over and over again that an essentially harmonious relationship prevailed between different levels and sectors of the movement .
Differences were and are treated as a normal eventuality in any genuine mass upsurge involving forces barely acquainted with working together , especially under conditions of fierce , violent repression and the silencing of opposition media .
Part of the " miracle " of the movement 's unity , in my view , stemmed from the fact that the entire movement held firm and intransigent around the key demands of the resistance -- rejection of the unconstitutional de facto regime and the restoration of the constitutional presidency ; an end to all repression and for the return of the army to its barracks ; restoration of press freedom and re-opening of banned TV and radio stations ; release of all political prisoners ; no impunity for those who carried out the coup , nor for military and police personnel involved in crimes against the population , including assassinations , torture , disappearances , beatings and rape .
Finally , the key demand that ties all this together into a perspective for democratising the Honduran state is the call for a constituent assembly -- a political process leading up to an assembly empowered to change the country 's constitution , and to set in motion democratic and fair political processes that must form the basis of a responsible and credible electoral and political exercise for deciding which political forces will form the national government .
This is an ongoing struggle .
It " ain´t over ' til it ’s over " as the US baseball saying has it .
The final innings in this fight lie ahead , not behind the Honduran and Central American people .
Much at stake in the region
Much is at stake , not just in Honduras , but across the region .
One immediate impact of the coup was to give courage and sustenance to reactionary forces in Panama and Costa Rica to finally come out into the open in their opposition to the process of Central American unity .
Its most advanced recent expression was the SICA ( Central American Integration System ) and the C - 4 Accord ( through which citizens of Nicaragua , Honduras , El Salvador and Guatemala can travel between the four countries without a passport or visa -- an important step towards establishing a common labour market , something prized by local capitalists ) .
Costa Rica 's president Oscar Arias has made it clear that his country , if he has his way , will turn away from the SICA and join Panama and Colombia in a different sort of alliance , whether formal or informal .
That tripartite arrangement is a direct threat not only to Venezuela and Ecuador , which border on the Colombian narco - state ( and Washington 's South American " Israel " ) but also against Nicaragua , which has significant border disputes with both Colombia ( maritime ) and with Costa Rica ( territorial disputes over the Rio San Juan and environmental issues stemming from the contamination of Costa Rica 's feeder rivers with heavy metals and other poisons ) .
Looking at the geopolitics of the Honduran coup from an even higher vantage point , it is clear that the coup was part of Washington 's strategy to re-militarise its relations with South and Central America , and with the Caribbean countries .
The coup was followed by the agreement to install military bases in Colombia , and later in Panama ; and by the decision to take the US Fourth Fleet out of mothballs and redeploy it to the southwest Caribbean theatre -- offshore from Venezuela , Colombia , Panama , Costa Rica , Nicaragua and Honduras .
Hence , Obama has demonstrated not only his skills at what Eva Gollinger described as " smart diplomacy " , but also his readiness to use the big stick , even if he has to go through denial acts and blame Hillary Clinton , his secretary of state , for the more crude moves in this warfare .
We like to remind ourselves in Nicaragua that " Sandino vive , la lucha sigue " ( Sandino lives on , the struggle goes on ) .
It does .
Francisco Morazán lives on in the mass resistance movement that has changed politics and governing in Honduras forever .

Note
[ 1 ] Elvin Santos was the candidate of the Liberal Party , while Porfirio Lobo won the presidency for the Partido Nacional .
The two parties are both traditional and conservative , and play the same tweedledum , tweedledee role in Hondura 's electoral charades as the Democrats and Republicans in the USA .
Coup leader Roberto Micheletti is also a leading Liberal Party member , as was ousted legitimate president Mel Zelaya .
Massive demonstration as Lobo takes power
In a futuristic society , some people are selected at birth to become soldiers , and trained in such a manner that they become inhuman killing machines .
One of the most succesfull and older of these soldiers ( Russell ) is pitted against a new breed of soldiers , and after the confrontation is believed to be dead .
His body is left behind in a semi- abandoned colonial planet , where everything is peaceful , and he is taught about the other aspects of life .
But eventually he has to fight the new breed of soldiers again , this time to defend his new home ...

The Pentagon is addressing climate change for the first time in its sweeping review of military strategy .
The Pentagon is set to release the Quadrennial Defense Review ( QDR ) on Monday , along with the 2011 budget request .
ADVERTISEMENT
In the review , Pentagon officials conclude that climate change will act as an “ accelerant of instability and conflict , ” ultimately placing a burden on civilian institutions and militaries around the world .
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman( D - Mass. ) , a key architect of Senate climate plans , was the first to draw attention to the significance of climate change in the QDR .
Kerry said last week that the QDR will list climate change as a security problem that could claim U.S. lives .
“ I will tell you that the defense review of the United States Pentagon next week is going to come out and list climate change for the first time as an instability factor that affects our troops and may in fact wind up costing us lives down the road , ” Kerry said at a forum hosted by labor , business , veteran and other groups backing climate legislation .
The Department of Defense ( DoD ) must complete climate change assessments at all military installations in an effort to prevent degradation of operational readiness , according to a draft of the QDR widely circulated in defense circles .
InsideDefense.com was the first to publish the QDR draft document .
The final copy of the QDR , obtained by Congress Daily Jan. 29 , revealed no significant changes to the climate change assessments .
Operational readiness hinges on the military ’s continued access to land , air , and sea training and test space .
More than 30 U.S. bases are already at elevated levels of risk from sea level rise , the document said quoting data from National Intelligence Council .
Apart from the rising sea level , the Pentagon also has to assess the potential increase of severe heat waves or fire conditions could have on ground combat training .
The Defense Department also acknowledges in the draft QDR that climate change will affect the military ’s operating environment , roles and missions .
Climate - related changes include heavy downpours ; rising temperature and sea level ; rapidly retreating glaciers ; thawing permafrost ; and lengthening ice - free seasons in oceans , lakes or rivers .
Assessments conducted by the intelligence community indicate that climate change will have significant geopolitical impacts around the world , contributing to poverty , environmental degradation and weakening of fragile governments , according to the draft QDR document .
The Pentagon ’s review emphasizes the need for proactive engagement with countries whose military is the only institution with the capacity to respond to a large - scale natural disaster .
“ DoD ’s environmental security cooperative initiatives with foreign militaries represent a non-threatening way of building trust , sharing best practices on installations management and operating practices and developing response capacity , ” according to the draft document .
Congress required in the 2008 National Defense Authorization
Act that the Department of Defense consider the effects of climate change on all of its “ facilities , capabilities and missions , ” and called for the Department to incorporate such concerns into the QDR .
In order to comply with the law , the Office of the Secretary of Defense , the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the military services have all had to designate officials to study climate change , which has effectively created a new , nascent intellectual infrastructure of military and civilian officials who are well informed about the security consequences of climate change , according to a paper published in January by the Center for New American Security ( CNAS ) .
“ This intellectual infrastructure may well ensure that the study of the implications of climate change is institutionalized , keeping climate change fresh in the minds of DOD senior leadership , ” said Christine Parthemore and Will Rogers in the CNAS paper .
In general , the Pentagon has focused more on energy security , as it presented a more pressing concern amid two major military operations and escalating fuel costs , according to CNAS .
Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Michèle Flournoy , who leads the QDR process , is one of the founders of CNAS .
The QDR climate change issue also drew attention in Wired 's Danger Room blog ( http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/01/the-greening-of-the-pentagons-ma... ) , which points out that Flournoy has an article on the official QDR website that outlines a vision of the “ contested commons ” in sea , air , space and cyberspace .
Military services have already invested in non-carbon power sources , such as solar wind , geothermal , and biomass at domestic installations , as well as alternative vehicle fuels , including hybrid , electric , hydrogen and compressed national gas , according to the QDR draft .

Infectious proteins that cause brain - wasting diseases such as BSE can evolve , even though they contain no genetic information , researchers say .
Prions are proteins that cause brain - wasting diseases such as Creutzfeld - Jakob Disease ( CJD ) and mad cow disease , also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy or BSE .
Scientists at the Scripps Research Institute in Florida found that prions can undergo mutations in their protein structure and those mutations can lead to changes in the disease , such as drug resistance .
Drug resistance is an evolutionary adaptation previously only seen in bacteria and viruses , organisms that carry genetic information in DNA or a similar nucleic acid molecule , RNA .
" On the face of it , you have exactly the same process of mutation and adaptive change in prions as you see in viruses , " said Charles Weissmann , head of Scripps Florida 's department of infectology , in a statement .
" In viruses , mutation is linked to changes in nucleic acid sequence that leads to resistance .
Now … it 's clear that you do not need nucleic acid for the process of evolution , " Weissman said .
Prions are proteins that occur naturally in the cells of mammals .
Infectious prions are abnormal , misshapen versions of this protein that cause neurodegenerative diseases such as Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease and BSE , also known as mad cow disease .
Prions " reproduce " by coming into contact with normal proteins and changing their shape to match their own , eventually forming long chains of abnormal proteins , leading to damage to the cells and tissues .
" It was generally thought that once cellular prion protein was converted into the abnormal form , there was no further change , " Weissmann said .
" Now we know that the abnormal prions replicate and create variants . "
Natural selection
In their research , Scripps researcher Jiali Li and her colleagues found that natural selection would cause the more aggressive variants of the protein to take over the population .
In their experiment , the researchers transferred populations of prions from the brains of infected lab animals to cultures of cells .
The prions adapted to their new environment , showing classic Darwinian evolution , and could out - compete prions adapted to the brain environment .
The scientists then introduced a drug to the cultures that has been found to inhibit certain prion strains .
The number of infected cells fell dramatically , to seven per cent from 35 per cent .
They found that a drug - resistant variant of the prions became predominant in the cell culture , and the number of infected cells climbed to 25 per cent .
When the drug was removed , the prion strain that was susceptible to the drug made a comeback and dominated the population again .
The evolution of drug resistance in prion diseases is an important finding for scientists searching for a treatment for these fatal illnesses .
The research was published online in the journal Science on Dec. 31 .
Yuan Weimin was the toast of China ’s sporting scene from the early 1980s , when he coached the women ’s gold medal volleyball team , to 2001 , when as head of the Chinese Olympic Committee , he helped bring home the biggest prize of all -- Beijing ’s selection as host city for the 2008 Summer Games .
Now the 70 - year - old retired cadre is being denounced by some as a liar and a traitor , accused of spilling state secrets and disrupting Chinese harmony .
The offense lies between the covers of his memoir , “ Yuan Weimin : Winds and Clouds of the World of Sports , ” published this month in Beijing .
In the book , so far only available in Chinese , Yuan writes about a deal he says was cut during a cloak - and - dagger meeting in a Geneva hotel room eight years ago in which China promised to support the candidacy of Belgian Jacques Rogge as head of the International Olympic Committee in return for his support of Beijing ’s Olympic bid .
It was all kept hush - hush because Rogge , as a European representative , could n’t publicly endorse Beijing when two European cities -- Paris and Istanbul -- were also contenders , Yuan writes .

“ We had a mutual understanding that we all understood clearly , even if it was not in writing , ” says Yuan , who credited ancient Chinese military strategies for shaping the tactics .
Yuan drops other tidbits from the backroom discussions of China ’s Olympics bid , including how the nation sought to deflect criticism of its human rights record .
He also writes of fears during the 2000 Sydney Olympics that Chinese athletes ( no names here ) would be disqualified for doping , and of a women ’s volleyball coach arranging for the Chinese team to lose a match in the 2002 world championships to avoid facing a tougher opponent .
It is fairly mild stuff by the standards of tell - all - memoirs : no sex , no shoe boxes stuffed with cash .
But it is making a splash in China just the same because it is so unusual for anybody from the inner sanctum of the Chinese sporting world to break the code of silence that usually prevails over sensitive subjects .
“ I have n’t seen many tell - all books come out after the Olympics , not in any country , much less in China , ” said David Wallechinsky , the author of several books about the Games .

Although the Chinese government has not taken action against Yuan or the publisher , a nongovernmental organization , the Chinese Assn. for the Promotion of Olympic Culture said last week it would file a civil lawsuit against Yuan ’s publisher , Beijing Fonghong Media Co. , to prevent publication of any copies beyond the 200,000 in print in China .
“ The book contains content which is far from the truth and . . . its publication can be considered as leaking of state secrets , ” the association said in a statement last week .
The association ’s head , He Zhenliang , a Chinese member of the International Olympic Committee , is accused by Yuan of having nearly scuttled Beijing ’s Olympic bid by supporting a South Korean candidate , Kim Un-yong , to head the IOC instead of Rogge .
The Swiss - based International Olympic Committee also rejects Yuan ’s allegations .
Advertisement
“ Any insinuation that deals would have been made is absolutely false , ” the IOC said in a statement released last week .
The book ’s publication has stung many Chinese sports fans , one of whom wrote plaintively on a sports Internet bulletin board : “ Even if some of the things he said were true , did he have to reveal them ? ”
But the influential Southern Metropolis Daily and several other major Chinese newspapers have applauded Yuan ’s candor .
“ This is the first time that somebody in the high ranks told the inside story of the Chinese sports world , ” said Xu Jicheng , a prominent basketball commentator who was deputy director of media operations for Beijing Olympics organizing committee .
“ I think he picked the right time .
Since the Olympics , Chinese people are more confident and I think we are ready to listen with an open mind . ”

Yuan declined an interview request , saying through his publisher that he preferred to maintain a low profile .
At a news conference this month in his hometown of Nanjing , Yuan told Chinese reporters he did n’t want to cause controversy .
“ The purpose of this book is to tell the truth .
It ’s just about the truth and nothing more , ” he said .
Yuan ’s revelations cover only the bidding process for the Olympics because he was not around for the Games themselves .
He was sacked as sports minister at the end of 2004 in the midst of an audit into his financial dealings -- perhaps one reason for a streak of animus that runs through the book -- and replaced by a Communist Party apparatchik with no sporting experience .
In the memoir , Yuan writes that he differed with other Chinese officials about how to handle critics who said the Olympics should not be hosted by a one - party nation .
Advertisement
Many Chinese officials , he says , wanted to use overseas Chinese groups as proxies to counterattack , while Yuan thought the Olympic committee needed to tackle the issue directly .
“ My opinion was that we should talk about human rights ourselves , ” he writes .
“ Even if only a few simple words , it would show we have the courage to talk about it and not avoid the facts . ”
Wallechinsky , the author , said he is disappointed that Yuan ’s memoir does not go farther in spilling secrets of China ’s winning Olympic bid .
For example , he wonders whether the officials who submitted the winning bid to host the 2008 Games had been sincere in their representations during the bidding process that China would improve its human rights situation .

“ After Beijing was selected , as soon as the ink on the contract was dry , the International Olympic Committee ceded control of the Games to the Communist Party of China , ” said Wallechinsky .
Wallechinsky noted , however , that if Yuan divulged how that happened , “ he would have to leave China immediately . ”

Now journalists have their feet on the ground in Haiti we get heartbreaking coverage .
It 's the photographers who really shine on today 's front pages , with some incredible images of dust , destruction and death .
It 's really worth clicking on the papers below to enlarge them — the tabloids in particular have run enormous , fantastic pictures that do more to demonstrate what it's like when a country collapses ( literally and metaphorically ) than any number of interviews with survivors .
Other stuff also happened in the world :
Finance chiefs were ' grilled ' in DC .
Which means they were mildly uncomfortable for a few hours , then went back to their nice lives with no consequences .
The battle for Ted Kennedy 's Senate seat hots up .
And everyone loves Nikola Tesla .
Disclosure : I freelance write and report for newspapers that are included in this roundup .
Where there is a direct conflict of interest I will make it clear .
The New York Times : Simon Romero , the Caracas bureau chief , really covers some ground for this piece and this piece in Haiti .
Star photographer Damon Winter has also , apparently , been flown out , so expect some more great images .
There 's an update on the Google and China story , Andrew Ross Sorkin weighs in on the grilling of finance chiefs yesterday , and the battle for Ted Kennedy 's Massachusetts Senate seat is hotting up .
Meanwhile , 8 - year - olds are now on the TSA watch list .
The Washington Post : has apparently sent reporters to Haiti , but not photographers .
Luckily the AP is doing a sterling job with images like this .
They also look at local DC Haitians , and the US response .
The paper also updates the Google in China story , alleging a wider campaign of hacking by the government , and reports on the commission interviews of finance chiefs yesterday .
The LA Times : another paper , another amazing picture ( by a staff photographer ) and two stories , here and here , on the Haiti crisis .
Decades and worlds away , but next to these reports , is feature -y analysis of the day Nixon and Elvis met , in 1970 .
They also cover a new Democrat plan to fund healthcare , and the finding that morphine can ease PTSD .
The Wall Street Journal : has the big three stories too - Haiti beats the bankers getting grilled , and China and Google , despite the latter two being potential leads , one would imagine .
There 's also a piece on the resurgence of Nikola Tesla as an iconic figure .
The New York Post : has the same image as sister paper the Wall Street Journal .
Maybe they got a bulk use discount ?
The Daily News : may have won the heartbreak award with this picture .
The Daily Times ( Haiti ) : does n't provide a front - page image .
But has some cellphone and snapshot pictures of the destruction that you wo n't see anywhere else .
Haiti United Press : the same is true of this French language publication .
A Canadian woman trapped under rubble after the recent earthquake in Haiti managed to send out a text message to the Foreign Affairs Department in Ottawa , a place nearly 3,000 miles away .
And it saved her life .
Advertisement
Once received , the text message was " relayed to Canadian diplomats back in Haiti " who then provided aid in the search for the woman .
There 's not much more information beyond that , but it 's simply good to hear even the tiniest bit of encouraging and happy news in regards to this devastating event — particularly when it shows that a gadget and solid communication between diplomats can save a life .
Also , we 've mentioned it before , but a reminder does n't hurt :
If you 'd like to donate to an organization that can help in this situation , here are some ways to do so :

• MSF / Doctors Without Borders
• The American Red Cross International Response Fund
• Texting " HAITI " to 90999 to donate $ 10 to the American Red Cross International Response FUnd
• Online tech store SmallDog , who is matching any MSF / DWB donations up to $ 200

Not only racist but freaky !
" Colored kids make a costume vastly more attractive " Can somebody explain this to me ?
Is this supposed to be cheeky or something ?
And why does the girl look like a 50 year old pervert ??!
Notfrom our readers :
The ad is using wordplay .
In this case that means it is blending two different meanings for certain words : " colored " and " kids " .
The problem is it does n't make sense to us today unless we understand the old meaning of the words as they used them back then ...
We all know about the old meaning of " colored " meaning blacks ( and other non-white races ) but it also meant ( and still means ) dyed a custom and / or non-natural color .
The word " kids " was old slang for kidskin boots .
Kind of like today we sometimes say " kicks " meaning shoes .
Knowing this its easy to see that the ad is just selling lady 's boots made of soft goatskin that has been dyed .
The wordplay then is blending the real meaning ( dyed kidskin boots ) with the other meaning ( little black children ) to try and make the ad seem clever .
Finally , in those days the word " costume " did not just mean like Halloween costume but also was often used when talking about a fancy dress ensemble .
There is no wordplay here , its just a use of the word that was common then but not now .
So when the ad says " Colored kids make a costume vastly more attractive " you just translate that to mean " Dyed kidskin boots make your fancy outfit look great " .

" I 'll have to do it , " he said .
" I know the people of Dubai , they are interested in seeing me climb the skyscraper , " he added .
Bad news for pale girls like me : red is hot .
Not only do studies find that men are more attracted to women in red , now we find that men prefer women who are red .
Their cheeks , that is ….
In a new study , evolutionary psychologist Ian Stephen and his colleagues at the Face Perception Lab recruited volunteers of various races and asked them to digitally adjust the color tone on more than 50 faces to make them look as healthy and attractive as possible .
Volunteers consistently added more red coloring to the cheeks — whether the face was Caucasian , Asian , or Black .
The redder the face , the more suggestive it is of oxygen - rich blood reaching the skin .
The more oxygen - rich blood , the more suggestive it is of the person ’s general health and youth .
An old person , a sick person , a person with hypertension or bad circulation … will not get rosy - cheeked .
And not only is a flush suggestive of good health and fitness ….
but high sex hormones as well .
In women in particular , high levels of estrogen may cause an expansion of tiny blood vessels under the skin .
Hence , rosy cheeks .
As in monkeys , female facial redness may be associated with fertility and reproductive quality .
As Stephen points out , the human eye has evolved to pick up on fine variations on the color red .
“ People are sensitive to the subtle color difference between oxygenated and deoxygenated blood ( oxygenated blood is a bright red colour , deoxygenated blood has a slightly bluish red colour , and we interpret this difference in skin blood oxygenation colour as a cue to the health status of individuals . ” )
But why did the researchers find that volunteers preferred women over men with rosy cheeks ?
One reason may be the sex hormones , which show up more obviously in flushed female faces .
But it may also be due to the fact that men already have ruddier faces than women do — they have higher levels of hemoglobin and arterial oxygen content in their blood .
As a result , the male blush is not as obvious a cue of good health and high sex hormones .
There are surely other reasons why a maidenly blush is attractive , as I describe in BLONDES .
For one , a flash of color to a woman ’s cheeks may suggest youth , modesty , embarrassment , excitement …all of which , depending on context , may appeal to red- blooded men .

The young couple flew into Wichita bearing , in the lovely swell of the wife 's belly , a burden of grief .
They came from a religious tradition where large families are celebrated and they wanted this baby , and it was very late in her pregnancy .
But the doctors recommended abortion .
They said that with her complications , there were only two men skilled enough to pull it off .
One was George Tiller , a Wichita doctor who specialised in late abortions .
They arrived on Sunday , 31 May last year .
As they drove to their hotel , a Holiday Inn just two blocks from the Reformation Lutheran Church , they saw television cameras .
They wondered what was going on , a passing curiosity quickly forgotten .
But when they got to their room , the phone was ringing .
Her father was on the line .
" There was some doctor who was shot who does abortions , " he said .
They turned on CNN .
Dr Tiller had just been killed , shot in the head as he passed out church leaflets .
Now there is only one doctor left .
After the first two doors of bulletproof glass , a sign at Dr Warren Hern 's Boulder Abortion Clinic warns that mobile phones and cameras will be confiscated .
The receptionist hits the buzzer that opens the third bulletproof door .
In the waiting room , a sad woman with a tight perm waits for her daughter .
The receptionist lets you through a fourth bulletproof door and leads you down a green hall decorated with lovely pictures of nature , leaving you in a small room stocked with tissues and free condoms .
Twenty minutes later , the abortionist enters .
Dr Hern is a tall man in green surgical scrubs , remarkably vigorous at 70 , emphatic in speech and impatient in manner .
He has a long face and no lips , which gives him a severe look .
He apologises for having very little time .
This is the day he sees patients for the first of three visits , giving them the seaweed Laminaria , which slowly dilates the cervix , and his normal caseload has been doubled by Dr Tiller 's patients – including two with catastrophic foetal abnormalities and a 15 - year - old who was raped , all in the second trimester , all traumatised by the assassin who calls himself pro-life , a phrase he cannot utter without air quotes and contempt .
" They hate freedom , " he says .
He says it again .
He warns me not to use anyone 's name or it will put them at risk .
Walking out , he leaves the door open .
You hear voices drifting down the hall .
" The worst picture of an abortion doctor ever , " someone says .
" Is that Fox ? " " Yes , Bill O'Reilly . "
" Supposedly they were there to protect us . "
You see a nurse you cannot name leading a middle - aged Indian woman to an examining room .
" You 'll need to undress from the waist down . "
You hear one of the receptionists you cannot name speaking in the carefully modulated voice the doctor prescribed in his first book , Abortion Practice , a classic in the field .
Steps come down the hall .
" I'm Dr Hern .
Where are you from ?
Lie down now .
Put your hand on your chest . "
The phone rings .
" Did you have an ultrasound ?
And they referred you here ? "
Yesterday , the man arrested for Tiller 's murder warned that more killings were on the way .
All last week , the anti-abortion groups put out statements denouncing the murder and praising the result .
One called the killer a hero .
As a result , a squad of US marshals rushed out here last week on orders from the attorney general .
One of them paces the hall .
The second receptionist you cannot name asks him , " Did you see that guy out there smoking a cigarette ? "
" Yeah , I saw him . "
The first receptionist keeps talking .
" If you can fax us the amnio .
We do n't know , we 'll have to wait to see what your body tells us .
Do you want us to run your Amex now ? "
Another phone rings and the second receptionist answers .
" It 's basically a three - day process .
We require that you stay here in Colorado . "
The voices begin to overlap .
" Are you on any medication ? " " Have you had surgery in the last year ? "
" No , we do n't have any genetics counsellors to interpret that for you . "
" We do n't get a lot of protesters .
It 's a liberal and tolerant community . "
" If that changes , we will contact you . "
" No , you 'll get up and get in your car and drive home .
And , if you have a change of heart , please call us – our schedule is completely full and you 'll be taking someone else 's place . "
After another silence , a soft voice gets softer : " I also want you to know , we do n't care what your reasons are .
We 're not going to judge you . "
In the kitchen at the clinic , Dr Hern bolts down two microwave tamales .
He talks fast and does n't smile .
" It is my view that we are dealing with a fascist movement .
It 's a terrorist , violent terrorist movement , and they have a fascist ideology … "
Dr Hern goes on like that for some time .
Long before the first doctor got shot back in 1993 , he was warning that it would happen .
He was getting hate mail and death threats way back in 1970 , just for working in family planning .
They started up again in 1973 , two weeks after he helped start the first non-profit abortion clinic in Boulder .
" I started sleeping with a rifle by my bed .
I expected to get shot . "
In 1985 , someone threw a brick through his window during a protest by the quote unquote Pro-Life Action League .
He put up a sign that said THIS WINDOW WAS BROKEN BY THOSE WHO HATE FREEDOM .
In 1988 , somebody fired five bullets through his window .
In 1995 , the American Coalition of quote unquote Life Activists put out a hit list with his ( and Tiller 's ) name on it .
The feds gave them protection for about six months , then left them on their own .
" People do n't get it , " he says .
" After eight murders , 17 attempted murders , 406 death threats , 179 assaults , and four kidnappings , people are still in denial .
They say , ' Well , this was just some wingnut guy who just decided to go blow up somebody . '
Wrong .
This was a cold - blooded , brutal , political assassination that is the logical consequence of 35 years of hate speech and incitement to violence by people from the highest levels of American society , including but in no way limited to George Bush , Ronald Reagan , Jesse Helms , Bill O'Reilly , Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson .
Reagan may not have been a fascist , but he was a tool of the fascists .
Bush was most certainly a tool of the fascists .
They use this issue to get power .
They seem civilised , but underneath you have this seething mass of rabid anger and hatred of freedom that is really frightening , and they support people like the guy who shot George – they 're all pretending to be upset , issuing statements about how much they deplore violence , but it 's just bullshit .
This is exactly what they wanted to happen . "
He goes on about TV host Bill O'Reilly for a while .
Over the course of 29 shows , O'Reilly accused " Tiller the Baby Killer " of performing a late abortion for any reason at all , even so that a girl could attend a rock concert – a charge that is blatantly untrue .
" O'Reilly is a disgrace to American society , " he says .
But O'Reilly says he 's just exercising his right to engage in vigorous debate , you point out .
" He 's full of shit .
This is not a debate , it 's a civil war .
And the other people are using bullets and bombs .
I think O'Reilly is a fascist . "
It 's odd , you say , trying to be agreeable .
They always go after the doctors , never the mums .
His eyes snap up .
" What mums ?
The patients ?
They 're not mums until they have a baby . "
Late that night , Dr Hern calls you at your hotel .
You are reading one of his many scientific publications .
This one argues that man is a " malignant ecotumour " laying waste to the planet .
A cancerous growth resists regulation .
A cancer cell is a cell that reproduces without limits .
He 's sorry , he says , but he must turn down your request to ride in his car to the Tiller memorial in Denver .
He has to go with four US marshals in an armoured car .
Even his wife can't ride with him .
Same with dinner in a restaurant .
" I will never be safe , " Dr Hern says .
" I 'm always looking over my shoulder . "
You use the term " partial - birth abortion " and he bristles .
" It 's a barbaric term for a procedure that was described at National Abortion Federation meetings in the early 90s by two doctors who did n't take the deadliness of the psychological warfare seriously . "
And then the Republicans took it up " and it became this obscene anti-abortion pornography " .
And when he tried to tell his colleagues , No , this is not the safest way to perform a delayed abortion , they accused him of working with the anti-abortion people and basically rode him out on a rail .
" The whole thing turned into a tortured witch hunt – an incredibly painful experience . "
Nothing pains him more than the disdain of other doctors .
Sometimes the young ones ask to come in for an afternoon so they can learn to make a little money while their careers get started – they think it 's as simple as changing a tyre .
" There 's no sense that this is an important operation that has to be done well , that a person 's life depends on it . "
But let 's face it , abortion is the lowest - status activity in medicine .
That 's why they always call their clinics Family Planning Centres or Women 's Wellness Facilities , or some crap like that .
Not his place : it 's had the same name since 1975 .
" Because I felt that performing abortions was the most important thing I could do in medicine . "
The patients can be upsetting , too .
They 're under terrible stress , of course , but sometimes they come in very angry .
One had conjoined twins and would have died giving birth , but she exploded when told she could n't smoke in the office .
Some treat him with contempt : usually those who have been directly involved in anti-abortion activities .
They hate all abortion except for their special case .
One even said they should all be killed .
Only 14 , she came with her mother .
" What brings you here ? " Dr Hern asked .
" I have to have an abortion . " " Why ? "
" I 'm not old enough to have a baby . "
" But you told the counsellor we should all be killed ? "
" Yes , you should all be killed . "
" Why ? " " Because you do abortions . "
" Me too ? " " Yes , you should be killed , too . "
" Do you want me killed before or after I do your abortion ? " " Before . "
He told her to leave .
Her mother was very upset .
But he is n't an abortion - dispensing machine .
He 's a physician .
He 's a person .
When Dr Hern takes his family home , he 's escorted by the US marshals .
When you come in , his mother is sitting in an easy chair surrounded by her family .
She is 92 , but she still has a girlish smile and twinkling eyes that summon gingham skirts and radio serials .
You bend down to shake her grandson 's hand .
" So you want to be a pirate ? "
He nods and adds in a shy voice : " Or maybe a doctor . "
The phone rings and Dr Hern goes to answer .
He speaks in a heated voice .
Hanging up , he 's visibly agitated .
" That guy got your number off the internet .
He 's a reporter .
You have to change your number . "
Dr Hern 's mother explains that her number has n't been listed for almost 40 years , because the anti-abortion people used to make nasty calls at two in the morning .
Then there was a mix - up and it appeared in the phone book .
Now she does n't tell him about most of the calls .
He 's got enough to worry about .
As a boy ?
Always helpful .
When he was just three , she 'd give him a rag and let him dust .
He sang in the choir .
They got involved in church activities .
But politically , they were always on the liberal side .
He loved to go camping and fishing , and played the clarinet .
His father was a carpenter , so they did n't have much money and could n't afford to travel .
But they always had exchange students from all over the world – Germany , Brazil , Italy , France , Pakistan , Japan , 13 countries in all .
That was a way the kids could learn how other people lived .
And he won second prize in Kodak 's national contest for high school photography .
One thing that 's probably important , she says , she had terrible migraines from as far back as she could remember .
She 'd get up in the morning and feel like her head was gonna roll down the hall .
And one day she asked Warren what he wanted to be and he said , I really want to be a doctor , Mother .
" He thought he'd be a neuro brain surgeon and maybe he could figure out what to do about my headaches . "
That same year , he read a book about Albert Schweitzer healing the sick in Africa and announced , Mother , I 'm going to go to Africa before I go to medical school .
And he did , raising money so he could be a community ambassador with the Experiment in International Living .
At college , he worked three jobs to pay his tuition .
He learned ancient Greek and studied the Bible in the original .
Then he sat her down and said , " I do n't believe in this stuff any more . "
She said , " Well , you do n't have to believe in it .
Maybe I do n't believe in all of it either . "
In medical school , he saw his first botched abortions .
Then he spent two years as a doctor for the Peace Corps in a Brazilian town so desperately poor , it was n't unusual to see a dead baby on a rubbish heap .
After that , he worked as a family - planning chief for the Nixon administration and spent some time in Appalachia , where he saw unintended pregnancies dragging families deeper and deeper into poverty .
But even after all that , there are still some family members who can't accept what he does .
And other doctors , too .
It really hurts him terribly , she says .
" In his mind , he 's trying to help women who desperately need help .
And why can't these doctors , of all people … "
In his mother 's opinion , he needs to retire .
The shooting ?
He called her as soon as it happened .
He was trying to stay calm , but it was all he could do to keep from losing it .
" I could hear the terror in his voice . "
Has she ever tried to get him to stop ?
Especially now that he 's kind of making himself a target .
" I know that , " she answers .
" But that would n't do any good .
He 's got a mind of his own . "
The rims of her eyes are getting red .
She moves her glasses and dabs at them .
Warren
Hern 's wife likes good coffee , so you meet at an espresso bar .
She has a strong Roman nose and black hair that breaks against her cheeks in an ebony wave .
In a charming mixture of English and Spanish , she tells you about growing up in Cuba , happy , sun-filled days and good medical training , until she started ducking the weekly " discussion " meetings and they told her she was n't a good communist .
Later , working in a hospital , she saw women who tried to induce their own miscarriages bleed to death .
Then she got pregnant .
At 18 weeks , she went to her gynaecologist for the blood test .
" They said , ' The baby 's no good .
You have a real problem . ' "
She went to a geneticist and a specialist in prenatal diagnosis .
The geneticist suggested an abortion , " but the prenatal diagnoser , he said , ' What do you think about the baby ? '
And I said , ' I think he is good .
I feel it in my soul , and I want to take him . '
He said , ' Go and take your baby . ' "
Labour lasted 36 hours , intensive care a month .
The specialists told her the baby might have lifelong seizures or learning disabilities .
To lighten her workload , she moved to Barcelona and took a job in an abortion clinic .
She sees no contradiction in this .
" I know that many women do n't feel anything when they 're pregnant and many women feel sad , feel angry .
In this situation , you never can judge who 's God .
You need to respect women . "
All that led to the man who would become her husband .
She was at a medical conference in 2003 when Dr Hern came up to her and said , You are so beautiful .
He was 64 , she was 37 .
She was struck by his confidence .
They began to send letters across the ocean and talk for hours on the phone .
And he always showed her his fears and the loneliness of a life under siege by fanatics .
She could relate : " When I was aborting in Spain , I finished the abortion of a young woman , first trimester .
When I finished this procedure , she sat on the table , and said , ' Oh , doctor , you are really nice , you are such an angel , how do you kill babies ? '
I said , ' I 'm sorry , I do n't kill babies .
I aspirate gestational sacs .
You kill your baby . ' "
But most important , Dr Hern always asked about her son .
Other men did not do that .
In the summer of 2006 , they were married .
But that was not their happy ending .
At the end of May , when they were just back from a rafting trip in Utah , the phone rang .
Warren took the call in his office , " and he did n't have any colour in his face .
I said , ' What happened ? '
He said , ' A shooter shot George Tiller . '
I thought it was crazy people , and he said , ' No Amor , these people killed him . ' "
Since that day , he has not relaxed one second .
Dr Hern barely has time to eat .
Reporters come and go , the phone rings constantly , he disappears to the hidden rooms where no outsider is allowed to go .
Every so often he snatches a minute or two to drop into the counselling room .
You squeeze in a question .
This idea about mankind being a " malignant eco-tumour " .
Does n't it just invite the hate ?
" I 'm not inviting people to do anything .
I 'd like them to think .
I do think that helping people control their fertility is highly consistent with helping people be responsible citizens of the planet .
If somebody misunderstands it or tries to distort it , I do n't give a shit .
I 'm sorry , I 'm living in this country because I can say what I think . "
But you 're 70 .
You have ideas for a dozen books .
Why not retire ?
" I have important work to do here . "
You want to cosy up to the next question , but there 's no time , you blurt it out :
What are your limits ?
When would you tell a woman no ?
" There 's no specific answer to that .
I'm in the process of turning down somebody who 's going to be 34 , 35 weeks , with an important reason for doing abortion .
I 'm not going to do it . "
The phone rings .
" OK .
I 'll be right there , " and he 's gone .
Hours pass .
You 've been moved to the nurses ' office , where a soft felt sunflower weaves through the metal in - box .
You are staring at a flyer advertising the clinic 's services : " Specialising in late abortion for foetal disorders .
Outpatient abortion over 26 menstrual weeks for selected patients with documented foetal anomaly , foetal demise , or medical indications . "
The opponents of legal abortion often use the phrase " abortion on demand " , implying there are no restrictions at all .
This characterisation is untrue .
It has always been illegal in the US to perform abortions after viability without a compelling medical reason .
In Kansas , for example , where Dr Tiller practised medicine , the law for any abortion after 22 weeks requires two doctors to agree that failure to abort would put the mother at risk of " substantial and irreversible harm " .
But Dr Hern 's long list of foetal abnormalities that have led women to his clinic ranges from anencephaly to dwarfism , and you know a few dwarfs .
You like to think you'd be happy with a dwarf child .
He comes in , remembers that the US marshals do n't like him to use this room because the window is too exposed , and walks right back out .
You follow , asking about the patients who were supposed to see Dr Tiller .
" The patient I just finished was very unhappy to see me .
I think they are very anti-abortion .
She had a foetal abnormality , and she and her husband are just devastated .
Stuff like that . "
What kind of foetal abnormalities are we talking about ?
" One was Down 's syndrome , another was a lethal brain abnormality along with a lethal heart abnormality .
Another one had a catastrophic … we 're not talking about cleft lip , we are talking about cleft face .
There was no face . "
He goes home , riding in the bulletproof car with three US marshals .
You follow in a separate car .
At home , there 's a beautiful Bösendorfer piano with Beethoven on the stand and a primitive bow and arrow from the Amazon rainforest , where Dr Hern has cured diseases and conducted ethnographic studies for over 40 years .
There are books everywhere , and many of the nature photographs he has published in environmental books and magazines .
Then he leads you to his office .
He sits down to bang out a letter to President Obama .
" As you know , Dr Tiller was unarmed , vulnerable , and acting as an usher for his fellow worshippers . "
It 's four in the afternoon and he still has n't eaten his miserable microwave tamales .
Is he the abstemious type ?
" I enjoy food when I have a chance .
I love to cook .
Grown men lie down on the floor and cry with ecstasy over my paella . "
What do the women do ?
" They watch the men . "
It 's the first light thing you 've heard him say .
So you try to reach the emotional core everyone keeps telling you about .
This woman you refused to treat , what was her reason ?
" She was raped .
I 'm sympathetic , but I can't risk my medical licence for someone who just did n't get around to doing anything about it .
I 've done some cases over 36 weeks , but very few . "
For what cause ?
" Catastrophic problems – anencephaly or lack of kidneys , you know .
Lack of a brain . "
The anti-abortionists say that in those cases , the woman should just give birth naturally and let God take the baby .
The sharp tone comes back .
" Having a delivery is not a benign procedure .
When you are trying to keep the baby alive , that increases the risk for the woman .
And Reagan put in a bunch of rules about requiring to keep babies alive no matter how hopeless it is .
You have people going to Europe to get away from that . "
You mean the hospital requires them to save the baby ?
" The hospital requires full resuscitation measures , no matter what . "
Also , his seaweed procedure is very slow and gentle on the cervix .
The tissue dehydrates , the collagen starts to pull apart , the uterus gets softer .
If you do a forceful dilation , you 're going to tear the cervix .
All around , his way is safer .
Safer for the mum ?
" Not for the mum , " he snaps , " for the woman .
Till she 's had a baby , she 's not a mum . "
While you wait , you try to chat up his staff .
Most do n't want to talk on the record , but one says she 's been working here for 13 years .
Dr
Hern is very caring with all of them , she says .
He pays them well .
He gives them insurance and a retirement savings plan , which is not routine in the abortion trade .
Once , he took them all rafting down the Green River .
So what brings out his emotions ?
" Well , I think it is difficult for him when women are experiencing pain and he 's not able to control that for them . "
Have you ever seen him cry ?
" That 's a question for Dr Hern . "
Does it bother him when the patients show disgust ?
" That 's a question for Dr Hern . "
He is on the phone , talking with the editor of a scientific journal .
" Well , I went to George 's funeral in Wichita , and I was probably the most heavily protected son of a bitch in the state .
I was surrounded by rings of marshals and they might 've been able to get me with a shoulder - mounted rocket or something .
But the grief of this situation was pretty hard . "
The phone rings again .
This time it 's the president of the National Society of Genetic Counsellors , Steven Keiles .
Dr Hern wants him to issue a statement denouncing the murder , the sooner the better .
" I 'm sorry , this is not very complicated .
You make a statement and you issue it to the press , a one - page statement condemning the brutal assassination of a conscientious and dedicated doctor who helped tens of thousands of women . "
He slams down the receiver .
" That guy is a fucking clerk .
I have no patience for this kind of bullshit .
George gave them so much money and so much help . "
He starts ranting about the time the militant anti-abortion activist Randall Terry prayed for his death on national Christian radio .
" These guys are just despicable .
If anyone wants hope for the human species , do n't talk to me . "
A receptionist comes to close the door so the patients do n't hear him .
Later , he says , " You can never get used to this .
I think we 're hardwired , biologically , to protect small , vulnerable creatures , especially babies .
The foetuses may not be babies , but some of them are pretty close . "
He suggests you read an essay called What About Us ? Staff Reactions to D&E ( Dilation and Evacuation ) .
" The anti-abortion people quote the shit out of it .
It 's kind of anti-abortion porn for them .
But the pro-choice people do n't like it either .
They do n't like it when you talk about how it really feels to do this work . "
His voice is somewhere between bitter and proud .
So why did he write it ?
And what about this theory that man is a cancer ?
" I wrote it because , A , I 'm a human being , and B , I 'm a writer , and C and D , I 'm a physician and I 'm trying to understand what we 're doing here . "
You read the paper .
He describes the reactions members of his staff have when they see residue of late abortions , which include " shock , dismay , amazement , disgust , fear and sadness " .
The later the pregnancy , the harder it is to accept .
One assistant resented the patients for putting them through such a horrible experience .
Two others described dreams where they vomited foetuses .
Common coping mechanisms were denial , projection and rationalisation .
The paper ends with the passage the anti-abortionists love to quote , always out of context ; words so honest they are almost as painful to read as they must have been to write : " We have reached a point in this particular technology where there is no possibility of denying an act of destruction .
It is before one 's eyes .
The sensations of dismemberment flow through the forceps like an electric current .
It is the crucible of a raging controversy , the confrontation of a modern existential dilemma .
The more we seem to solve the problem , the more intractable it becomes . "
Dr Hern is in the basement doing an abortion .
Today is Thursday , operating day .
It 's just after 8 am , and very quiet .
The waiting room is empty .
So are the examining rooms .
A receptionist tells you he just got done with a patient and should be back shortly .
A woman comes to the door .
" Is it OK if I go outside for a minute ? " " Sure .
Knock on the door if you 're starting to feel bad . "
The phone keeps ringing .
" If you have tissue samples , " says the receptionist you cannot name , " That makes it logistically easier .
Can I put you on hold one second ? "
She opens the door for the sad woman and her daughter .
" Thank you , " the daughter says in an emphatic tone that suggests she 's not just talking about the door .
A few minutes pass and the phone rings again .
" Good morning , Dr Hern 's office .
OK , did you get any measurements from the ultrasound ?
OK .
And where was this done ?
OK . "
When the calls slow down , the receptionist tells you about the time a pro-life reporter pretended to be looking for information and then quoted her by name .
" They do these things to scare you . "
The US marshals keep walking up and down the hall , carrying black bags that look ominously tactical .
The receptionist opens the door again .
It 's a woman in an ankle - length Amish dress .
" You 've seen her before , " she tells Dr Hern .
" She was with another woman in the same kind of dress . "
While you wait , you read another one of the doctor 's essays .
" It has been my practice to rupture membranes with ring forceps , " it says .
At 11:30 , the doctor comes up in a cheerful mood .
" I have to go check the level of molecular degeneration in my tamales . "
It 's the second lighthearted thing you 've heard him say .
And when he comes back from the kitchen , he says another .
" I identified a new species in my tamales .
But I think with a gastroenterologist standing by … "
The receptionist smiles .
" It 's your risk . "
The Amish women leave .
He walks them to the door and says , " Give my regards to Dr H – "
In the nurses ' office , the soft felt sunflower weaves through the metal in - box .
A young woman wearing a 1920s flapper scarf comes up the stairs alone .
At that very moment , you are reading page 83 of Abortion Practice , the section called Isolation : " One of the loneliest persons in the world is the woman who has not told anyone she is pregnant or considering an abortion .
Some women have no one to whom they can turn ; others insist on suffering alone as a form of self - punishment .
The individual abortion counsellor may , and frequently does , fill that gap for both kinds of patients . "
The woman in the flapper scarf stops at the receptionist 's office .
" Thank you so much , " she says .
" You 're so helpful .
You 're wonderful ladies . "
Another woman stops at the desk .
She 's a Latina , here for her sister .
" Can I wait ?
I want to say goodbye to everyone . "
The phone rings .
" Well , have you had an ultrasound ?
OK .
If it 's between 19 weeks and 24 weeks , it 'll be between $ 5,000 and $ 7,500 . "
Five minutes later , it rings again .
" No , we need to know what the measurements are before you travel .
It 's a measurement in millimetres and centimetres .
Fax it to us .
Everything is based on the measurement . "
Now it 's 1:47 , and you 're sitting down in the counselling room with the young couple who arrived in Wichita just in time to see the news cameras that surrounded the Reformation Lutheran Church .
The woman has light brown hair and wears conservative glasses .
She is calm , sombre and depleted .
As gently as you can , you ask her to tell you why she chose abortion .
" We had found out something was wrong at 28 weeks , seriously wrong .
And they found out that it was going to put me , my health , perhaps in danger if I carried through to the end . "
And it was a planned pregnancy ?
" Oh yes .
Absolutely . "
And when you arrived in Wichita ?
" We were caught between grieving about going through this and this awful situation . "
You could n't find a doctor closer to home ?
" They do these kinds of procedures in Canada , where we come from , but because I was a very complicated case , and because I did n't feel comfortable with the way they wanted to do it , it was very high risk , I wanted to come to someone who is an expert . "
Do you mind explaining why it was so complicated ?
" The child had severe abnormalities . "
You change the subject , asking what was wrong with the Canadian doctors .
" They do it very fast .
They do n't use the seaweed , they do n't take their time , and it puts the woman at risk .
And you 're at risk of losing your uterus .
I would like to have children , so I did n't want to have that risk . "
And how did it go , the surgery ?
" Well , Dr Tiller said that … "
Hern .
" Oh , sorry , sorry , sorry .
Dr Hern said I was a very complicated case .
He said it went well , but it was n't an easy thing to do .
It was painful physically and mentally . "
You ask if there 's anything else they want to say .
The husband answers .
" It 's important that people have a choice .
At the end of the day , when things go bad , you know ?
I mean , God forbid something happens to Dr Hern , where are we going to go next ?
Australia ? China ? "
Five minutes later , you catch Dr Hern in the nurses ' office .
Did their procedure take long ?
" Yeah , it was 45 minutes .
The average is five minutes .
She was very far along .
It was the position of the uterus , and she had a previous C- section , poor dilation , it was very difficult .
I think any other procedure would have been very , very dangerous for her . "
She was in danger of her life ?
" Oh yeah .
She would have risked having a ruptured uterus in an induction procedure . "
In surgery , or in birth ?
" Well , she 's at risk , at this point , no matter what she decides to do .
That 's why I 'm quite sure this was the safest option for her . "
Later that evening , you will drive with Dr Hern 's wife and son to the Temple Emanuel in Denver .
He 'll choke up when he ascends to the dais to say that George Tiller was " gentle , considerate and compassionate " , then recover and roll into the refuge of his annealing anger : " This brutal , cold - blooded , premeditated political assassination is the inevitable and predictable result of over 35 years of rabid anti-abortion harassment , hate rhetoric , violence ... "
When he comes off the stage to embrace the wife , he will break down in racking sobs .
His son will stroke his shoulder .
You will be standing right next to them , close enough to hear him say , " Amor , Amor , Amor , " close enough to hear members of the audience – who came by word of mouth , because the rabbi considered it too dangerous to advertise publicly – whisper their gratitude .
" Thank you for your courage . "
One woman squeezes his hand .
" It 's because of people like you that my relatives survived the 1940s . "
Three weeks later , the woman from Canada calls you .
She has some things she wants to tell you .
It was the most tragic and terrible experience of my life , she begins .
She has a son almost ready to start kindergarten , she was afraid she would n't survive to raise him , and she wants to have a big family , and the situation was so crazy with the marshals and the bulletproof glass and the constant fear of a mad killer with a gun .
Dr Hern was under so much pressure .
She could see the stress in his face .
" Now I 'm still recovering , and still sad and still mourning , and I realise how grateful I am that Dr Hern was able to take me under such quick and terrible circumstances .
That 's what gets me so upset .
He 's a doctor who is trying to help people .
It 's shocking that people want to hurt him . "
Without Dr Hern , she says , she does n't know what she would have done .
It 's crazy he 's the only one left .
She is grateful , so grateful that she will be here to raise her son .
And as the words tumble you hear , in the urgency unleashed by her deliverance , a love too sad for sermons , too personal for headlines , a private benediction , the abortionist 's reward , the love song of Warren Martin Hern , MD . ★

The framework for climate change legislation already makes clear that the climate debate will expand into new realms .
New groups join climate lobby fray
The next round of the battle over climate change policy on Capitol Hill will involve more than the usual suspects — way more .
Watch soup makers face off against steel companies .
Witness the folks who pump gas from the ground fight back against those who dig up rock .
And watch the venture capitalists who have money riding on new technology try to gain advantage in a game that so far has been deftly controlled by the old machine .
An analysis of the latest federal records by the Center for Public Integrity shows that the overall number of businesses and groups lobbying on climate legislation has essentially held steady at about 1,160 , thanks in part to a variety of interests that have left the fray .
But a close look at the 140 or so interests that jumped into the debate for the first time in the third quarter shows a marked trend : Companies and organizations that feel they ’ve been overlooked are fighting for a place at the table .

The amount of money involved quite likely rose as well .
Although amounts spent on lobbying by issue are not disclosed , if the groups involved spent just 10 percent of their lobbying budgets on climate issues , they shelled out $ 30.5 million in the third quarter — up nearly 13 percent over the previous quarter .
Of course , the framework for climate change legislation developed by a trio of senators — Massachusetts Democrat John Kerry , South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham and Connecticut independent Joe Lieberman — already makes clear that the climate debate will expand into new realms .
Incentives for nuclear power construction and more offshore oil and gas production are key proposals they ’ve floated for gaining Republican and moderate Democratic votes for a climate change package .
But beyond what are sure to be high - profile battles over those issues , the lobbying records also reveal that a host of smaller battles are brewing — sure to greatly complicate the already immense challenge of writing a successful bill .
It ’s one of the reasons that — despite the pledge by President Barack Obama and other world leaders to exhibit “ strong political will ” on climate — it most likely will be months before the Senate moves on a measure to curb fossil fuel emissions .
Campbell Soup and Kellogg
Take the concerns raised by the world ’s largest maker of soup , Camden , N.J. - based Campbell Soup Co. , one of a slew of grocery producers ( including Kellogg , Del Monte Foods and the Alliance of Food Associations ) that registered to lobby on climate change for the first time in the July - September quarter .
“ It was n’t until we analyzed what was going on in the House that we thought , ‘ Oh , gosh , we are being affected by this , ’ ” Kelly Johnston , Campbell Soup ’s vice president for public affairs , said in an interview .
At issue are the free “ allowances , ” or carbon dioxide pollution permits , that the House - passed climate bill would give to manufacturers that use a lot of energy to produce internationally traded products such as steel and aluminum .
Those energy - intensive industries fighting international competitors successfully lobbied for protection from loss of jobs to China and other cheap - energy countries if the United States unilaterally enacted a carbon reduction program that would make coal burning more expensive here .
But the House bill ’s approach means manufacturers that do n’t use as much energy — like Campbell — would have to bid at auction for carbon emission allowances from the federal government .
Johnston argues that Campbell should either be exempt from that process or be provided some freebies , too .
“ I think it ’s clear from our view that we 're not being treated as fairly as carbon - intensive industries , ” Johnston said .
“ There needs to be some recognition of the role the food industry plays in our economy . ”
The Natural Gas Lobby
Also sure to shake up the climate debate are companies that produce or sell natural gas — the fuel that produces that blue flame on the stovetop , heats half the homes in America and can generate electricity with 40 percent less carbon emissions than coal .
“ The gas companies really missed out on influencing [ the House bill ] , ” said lobbyist C. Kyle Simpson , who was an Energy Department official in the Clinton administration .
Among his 14 climate change clients is the Gas Technology Institute , a research organization , and several natural - gas - related firms that have recently begun to weigh in more heavily on climate change legislation , including DCP Midstream of Denver and Denbury Resources of Plano , Texas .
Because natural gas is the least carbon - intensive fossil fuel that can be burned to produce electricity , companies that produce it stand to gain significant share in the power generation business if Congress passes legislation that makes coal — its competitor — more expensive .
In theory , climate legislation would do that , but lawmakers have been lobbied by the coal industry to endorse a ramp - up of the program slow enough to discourage such fuel switching .
The natural gas industry is diverse , so it had trouble organizing as a politically cohesive force to urge a quicker transition from coal power to protect the climate .
Many natural gas players are first and foremost oil companies that produced natural gas “ conventionally ” as a byproduct of oil — a sector that has n’t been at the forefront of calling for greenhouse gas regulation .
But recent technological advances have allowed companies to produce huge amounts of natural gas all by itself , “ unconventionally , ” by breaking up underground shale formations with horizontal drilling and high - pressure water fracturing .
Just days before the House voted on the climate bill last June , a widely watched industry group announced a 35 percent increase in U.S. gas reserves — the largest jump in its 44 - year history of supply tracking .
Abundance and relatively low prices already have some electric power producers switching from coal to natural gas .
In one of the largest such moves , Raleigh , N.C. ’s Progress Energy this month announced it would shut down 11 aging coal plants and replace them with natural gas generation .
That trend surely would continue under the climate change bill passed in the House , said Simpson , but natural gas companies might win an even larger share of the U.S. electricity market with an all - out push in the Senate .
“ If they would say there should be a price on carbon , the fundamental change could be extraordinary , ” Simpson said .
He could see , for example , a scenario in which utilities were given a kind of Cash for Coal Clunkers credit in the carbon market for making the switch to natural gas .
Venture Capitalists and Clean Tech
Until now , the push for a slower phase - in and more modest carbon emission reduction has been apparent in the Senate machinations on the bill .
The original legislation authored by Kerry and California Democrat Barbara Boxer , and passed last month by the Environment and Public Works Committee she chairs , would have called for a 20 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2020 , but that bill failed to garner a single Republican vote on the panel .
The Kerry - Graham - Lieberman framework ratchets back the goal to a 17 percent cut — the House bill ’s target — one that 's “ reasonable and achievable ” — which is also the figure that Obama touted during the U.N. climate conference in Copenhagen .
But the latest figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration show that the nation already has made significant progress toward that benchmark , thanks to the economic slowdown and the switching from coal to natural gas .
Energy - related carbon emissions , which account for the bulk of greenhouse gases by far , are expected to fall 6 percent this year , after a nearly 3 percent drop in 2008 .
So among those who will be pushing the Senate to reach for more ambitious goals earlier : would - be investors in clean energy solutions , who have been waiting for a signal that there will be a market for new technologies .
“ We ’d like to see a price on carbon that escalates at a reasonable rate in the early years , not just the later years , ” said Will Coleman , a partner with Mohr Davidow Ventures of Menlo Park , Calif .
A venture capital firm with $ 2 billion under management that invests in early - stage business development , the company registered to lobby on climate change for the first time in the third quarter , joining about a dozen investment and private equity firms weighing in on the issue on Capitol Hill .
Investors want to see returns in five - to - 10 - year cycles , said Coleman .
Therefore , clean tech investors — much like the natural gas industry — would like to see a climate bill that makes coal more expensive in a shorter time frame .
That would allow alternatives like solar energy — currently expensive but perhaps cheaper in the future if mass - produced — to be more competitive earlier and to deliver returns to investors sooner .
But the House bill , for example , would have the effect of keeping the pollution price added to coal relatively low for 15 years , because it would not begin phasing out many of the free carbon allowances that the government distributes until 2026 .
Mohr Davidow is already investing in new technologies to reduce carbon emissions — like solar power that uses a thinner , and therefore cheaper , layer of photovoltaic material ; biomass fuel ; and new ways to extract the lithium needed for advanced batteries .
But Coleman said that there would be a much wider range of venture opportunities if investors were surer that companies could gain an early competitive foothold against coal .
“ My biggest concern is that if we are less aggressive in carbon targets and carbon pricing , we may incur more costs in the future , because we ’ll drive less investment into the space , ” Coleman said .
But he admitted that it ’s been a rather subtle argument for Washington policymakers more accustomed to lobbyists for businesses that want clearer , nearer - term issues addressed .
“ They sort of say , ‘ What do you want ? ’ ” Coleman said .
What the venture capitalists want is n’t a handout or carve - out , as traditionally seen on Capitol Hill , but a regulatory environment that creates a more favorable playing field for new tech investments .
“ Our effort was to talk to as many people on the Hill and in [ the Department of Energy ] and White House as we could about the way the innovation economy could work , ” he said .
Of course , put the 60 or so venture and investment firm lobbyists together with the 170 alternative energy lobbyists and 160 environmental lobbyists , and they are still outnumbered 5 - to - 1 by the approximately 2,000 representatives of major sectors that are looking for a slowdown or handout — traditional manufacturers , power companies , oil and gas , transportation and agriculture .
The total number of climate lobbyists working for all those interest groups , new and old , stands at about 2,780 — five for every member of Congress .
That ’s 400 percent more than when lawmakers first considered a nationwide greenhouse gas reduction program six years ago .
If they all want a place at the Senate ’s table , there had better be plenty of chairs .

The roof is the most important part of a home .
It serves to protect everything inside .
This is why when you ’re installing a new roof on your home you need to take your time and make sure you are getting the very best for your money .
There are many different types of roofs , as well as many different types of materials that you can build your roof out of .
You should take all the factors that you need to consider .
These factors include appearance , durability , cost , warranty , and the maintenance .
The roofing material that is required when installing a new roof is very important .
Keep in mind that there is quite a bit that goes into building and installing a new roof .
You need 2X4s , nails , brackets and shingles or tiles .
When it comes to tiles Mediterranean roof tiles are waterproof , fire proof , and mold proof so they take very little maintenance on your part .
So , it is not always the best choice to purchase the least expensive roofing material .
Sometimes if you spend a little more , you get better quality roofing material that will last you longer .
There are other types of roofing materials that you can purchase like shingles , sheet metal roofing , plastic or rubber roofing materials , tar and rolled roofing material .
You can even mix the materials to give it a unique look .
Using Mediterranean tiles and Terra cotta roofing material makes a great combination .
The question that roofing contractors hear the most is “ which roofing material is the best ” .
It really depends on a lot of factors .
The pitches of your roof , your budget , the type of weather that your roof has to withstand are all factors that will determine the best roofing material for your home .
So , when your ready to install your new roof a consultation with an experienced roofing contractor is the best choice you could make .
Roof installation is actually requires to know basic civil engineering principles and isolation techniques .
Do not forget the fact that roofs are isolating the inside of building from outside and keep the families safe for drastic climate conditions .
Additionally , roofing material selection depends on the climatic conditions where the constructions built .
This selection should n't alter the overall static design of the structures as well .
Revising all the factors which are good or bad , many people prefer to install metal roofs in comparison to conventional roofing materials .
The most common metal roofs are steel , aluminum , and copper .
All metal roofing materials will generally last longer than any asphalt shingles .
They handle high winds far better than asphalt shingles as well , and often hold up better than any tile roofs in hurricanes .
Metal is noted , also , for reflecting heat better than asphalt .
Steel is the cheapest metal roofing material , but remember that steel rusts .
It will often last as long as aluminum but much more maintainence is required .
Aluminum is a good choice considering the small amount of extra cost compared to steel .
It also requires little maintainence .
Copper is , by far , thought of as a much more prestigious looking roof .
It is also much more expensive .
There have been reports of copper roofing lasting over 100yrs .
with very little maintainence .
If you can afford the expense , copper is the most worry free and one of the longest lasting roofs you can put on your home .
Despite their ability to fly , tropical birds waited until the formation of the land bridge between North and South America to move northward , according to a University of British Columbia study published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( Early Edition ) .
" While many North American birds simply flew across the marine barriers that once separated the continents , tropical birds , especially those in Amazon forest regions , began colonization of North America almost entirely after the completion of the land bridge , " says lead author Jason Weir , who conducted the study as part of his PhD at UBC .
" This study is the most extensive evidence to date that shows the land bridge playing a key role in the interchange of bird species between North and South America and the abundant biodiversity in the tropical regions , " says Weir , now a post - doctoral fellow at the University of Chicago .
The Isthmus of Panamaland bridge was completed between three and four million years ago , and today consists of the country of Panama .
It is believed to have initiated the Great American Biotic Interchange , bringing mammals that evolved uniquely in South America during its " island isolation " -- the armadillo , opossum and porcupine -- to North America .
Fossil records have shown that mammalian species also travelled across the land bridge from North to South America , increasing biodiversity in the tropical regions .
" But a lack of bird fossils has made it difficult to determine if the land bridge was equally instrumental in the interchange of avian species , " says Weir .
By analyzing the DNA of 457 bird species on either side of the land bridge , Weir and colleagues at UBC and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama were able to reconstruct a " family tree " of species closely related to one another and revealed a " hidden chapter " in the impact of the land bridge to biodiversity .
They found a dramatic increase in the rates of interchange after the land bridge completion .
" This is a bit surprising , " says co-author Dolph Schluter , UBC zoology professor and Canada Research Chair in Evolutionary Biology .
" Could n't the birds have flown across the gap ?
Some did , but most tropical birds waited for the land crossing . "
The researchers believe the inability of many tropical birds to fly long distances across open water -- some are reluctant even to cross rivers as narrow as 200 metres -- may have contributed to the few north - bound movements prior to the land bridge completion .

Fifty Dangerous Things ( You Should Let Your Children Do )
In the wake of the grinding health care fight , Obama ’s campaign pledge of bipartisanship now seems hollow , either hopelessly naïve or deeply cynical .
Middle ground shrinks in debate
As Barack Obama huddled with Senate Democrats in the walnut - paneled Mansfield Room in the Capitol this month , the man he beat for the presidency held court at a bank of television cameras outside to taunt his former foe .
“ A year ago , the president of the United States ... [ said ] that when we get into health care reform , there will be Republicans in the room , Democrats in the room ... C- SPAN cameras , ” Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) told the clutch of journalists , reveling in the notion of catching Obama in the act of retreating on his promise .

McCain even directed the C - SPAN cameraman to “ go right over to the meeting there because that was the commitment made . ”
After nearly a year , this is what ’s become of the health care debate : Democrats hunkered behind closed doors on a bill struggling to gain public support , Republicans lobbing one partisan grenade after the next .
In the wake of this grinding fight , Obama ’s campaign pledge now seems hollow , either hopelessly naïve or deeply cynical .
Far from being a show of bipartisan goodwill , the health care debate has proved to be just the opposite , with the most polarized , party - line votes on a sweeping social - reform bill in the modern era .
No Republicans voted for the Senate bill Thursday .
A single one backed the House version last month .
In the end , the political stakes proved to be too high — and the philosophical differences too great — for Obama to live up to his lofty rhetoric .
In the face of steadfast GOP resistance to his plan , the president retreated from his gauzy campaign vision , eventually abandoning any notion that he ’d undertake the sort of shirtsleeve cajoling and compromise he ’d need to get Republicans on board .
Finally , Obama simply did n't need the Republicans - or C - Span cameras - to remake the health care system .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) were able to corral enough Democrats to make them irrelevant .
So the trio passed health care without them - betting the advantage gained from a political victory now would more than blot out any damage from abandoning Obama 's old applause line .
Republican leaders , in turn , put an increasingly high value on blocking any hope of compromise — so much so that they never truly offered a comprehensive alternative plan until the very end .
Digging in could rouse their dispirited base by defeating the liberal president on his signature issue , with the built - in rallying cry of facing down a “ big government ” health plan that defied conservative principles .
Fighting health care was a chance at rejuvenating the party , whose leaders were confident the country was as alarmed by Obama ’s activist tendencies as they were , and comforted by polls that suggested that was the case .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky. ) told POLITICO that he embarked on a “ very systematic and persistent ” campaign since Memorial Day to undermine support for the president ’s reform push , arguing that it would raise taxes , hike premiums and erduce Medicare .
McConnell delivered more than 83 speeches on the Senate floor against reform .
And as Obama and the Republicans lapsed into these depressingly familiar roles , a political class that relies on these fights for its survival sprang into place to enable them .
Advocates left and right amplified the talking points .
Fundraisers breathlessly piggybacked on the cause .
Twenty - four hour cable TV and websites cast a storyline in terms of the raw politics — who ’s up and who ’s down .
In the end , it ’s not surprising that Obama and the Republicans could n’t rise above decades of partisanship .
It ’s more surprising that anyone harbored the notion they might .
" The bipartisanship that went on for 30 years was abnormal , and what you 're seeing now is more normal , " said former House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt , a Democrat from Missouri .
" You 've got to always remember that politics is a substitute for violence .
...
If I disagree with you , it becomes very easy to not like you . "
" Both parties have come to the view that to win elections , you need to deprive the other side of legislative victories , ” Gephardt said .
“ If that 's your political strategy , then that 's your legislative strategy . "
" It Deserved Bipartisan Defeat "
Of course , each side blames the other .
The White House says the Republicans could n’t be trusted after they slapped away Obama ’s pleas for help on the stimulus back in January and were never serious about helping the president on health care .
From the early stages , Obama signaled to aides he was prepared to go it alone if necessary on health reform and that getting Republican votes to expand health care to 30 million Americans would n’t be the mark of whether it succeeded or failed .
Instead , the White House came to argue that as long as Republican ideas were included in the bill , that would meet Obama ’s test of bipartisanship — whether they voted for it in the end or not .
“ I do n’t think we ever had thoughts that there would be significant Republican support for health care , ” said one senior administration official , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
If Obama has at least kept a flicker of bipartisanship alive — courting Sen. Olympia Snowe ( R - Maine ) to this day — the GOP leaders in the House and Senate made a decision in the spring to wage an all - out battle against Obama over health reform , aides and lawmakers said .
“ For the public to understand there was a genuine debate about policy here , it was important for it not to become ‘ bipartisan , ’ ” McConnell said .
“ On the merits , this was a proposal that did n’t deserve , in my view , bipartisan support . ”
“ It deserved bipartisan defeat , ” McConnell said .
“ Their goal was to defeat the bill . ”
Republican leadership avoided getting pinned down on its own ideas for reform — even discouraging one effort by House Republicans to craft a consensus alternative , a decision that frustrated a number of members because it forced them to wage the debate on Democratic terms .
“ By deciding we were not going to produce our own product , we were deciding we were going to fight on their ground .
We gave that ground to them , ” said Rep. John Shadegg ( R - Ariz . ) .
Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - Calif. ) , the House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman who was a principal author of the House bill , criticized the GOP strategy .
“ We wanted to cover all Americans , and we wanted to hold down health care costs , " Waxman said .
" Those two objectives could have been achieved in lots of different ways , but the Republicans did n’t engage us . "
“ They made it very clear from the very beginning , as in everything we do and everything we have tried to do , that they do n’t want to do this , ” added Sen. Jay Rockefeller ( D - W.Va . ) , a Finance Committee member .
“ I do n’t know why people run for public office if that ’s what they 've got to offer . ”
The risks of a one - party bill are considerable — and already some Republicans say revoking health reform will be a talking point for their candidates in the 2010 and 2012 elections .
That ’s the fear of many advocates , who say a health reform plan without broad bipartisan support might not survive .
“ This issue is historic , ” said Snowe , who voted for the bill in the Senate Finance Committee but voted no on the floor .
“ I mean , that would be the first time in a half a century that a historic piece of legislation could potentially be enacted along party lines .
So hopefully we do n’t make history in another way — that such an initiative passes along party - line votes .
I think that would be a sad commentary on the political process . ”
The White House does n’t see it that way .
Obama ’s aides quickly became convinced that Republicans were n't willing to work with Obama — pointing to talk of “ death panels ” during the summer , a call to turn health care into Obama ’s “ Waterloo , ” and the lack of a unified Republican alternative .
Republicans knew the same thing Democrats did — that , if Obama were to pass health care , it would be a presidential achievement on the level of Lyndon B. Johnson ’s Great Society .
And if he failed — if the Republicans could beat him — the consequences for Obama would be devastating .
" The Republican leaders were not on the level at any point here .
Their goal was to defeat the bill , " White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer said .
But the White House view is also that voters are more interested in the final results than in the details of whether the parties came together to make it happen .
" Passing health reform will be the greatest domestic legislative achievement since LBJ sat in the Oval Office , " Pfeiffer said .
" I am confident that in the short and long term this will be a huge momentum - building victory for the president , no matter how many Republicans vote for the bill . "
Not the norm
Congress rarely passes landmark legislation along party lines .
The House voted to enact Social Security in 1935 with 69 Republican votes .
Thirty years later , 70 Republicans sided with the majority party to establish Medicare .
Senate Republicans were similarly supportive of both historic bills .
Both debates were excruciatingly partisan , but the final votes were n’t .
Today , the nation looks at Washington and sees little more than dysfunction and disputes , an erosion of political comity that seems the collective result of a piling up of political grievances for one side or the other — Vietnam , Watergate , the Monica Lewinsky scandal , the disputed Florida election of George W. Bush .
Obama ’s agenda quickly drew GOP opposition as well .
It seemed as though all those ill feelings collided on the Senate floor this week .
Angry , exhausted senators traded accusations of corruption and obstruction .
And a series of last - minute deals by Reid to win support from his final holdouts only fed the perception — pushed by Republicans for months — that the legislation can't stand on its own merits .
In some ways , health reform ’s partisan path was laid down mere days after Obama took office , when House Republicans rebuffed him , offering Obama not a single vote on his stimulus plan even after he paid them a visit to seek their votes .
Only three senators backed the plan .
Both sides came away from the vote feeling burned — which colored the health reform talks from the start .
“ Mutually Justified Suspicion ”
Still , the White House made early overtures to the GOP .
White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel , the architect of the Democrats ’ takeover of Congress in 2006 , met with a dozen or so moderate Republicans on the patio outside his West Wing office .
Obama stopped by for 20 or so minutes to hear their ideas .
Emanuel even provided sandwich wraps .
But that was the last such session .
On the Hill , Democrats met with Republicans in small groups and one - on - one .
“ I actually thought early on , they were making all the right moves , ” said Michigan Rep .
Dave Camp , the ranking Republican on the Ways and Means panel .
“ But things changed . ”
By June , it was clear Democrats were heading in a fundamentally different direction from what all but a handful of Republicans could accept — with a government - run health insurance plan that Republicans saw as an end - run to create a system of single - payer government - run health care on par with countries in Europe .
“ It was mutually justified suspicion , ” said Rep. Rob Andrews ( D - N.J. ) , the chairman of a key subcommittee who held numerous meetings with rank - and - file Republicans .
“ Stop Right There ”
One meeting that captured the sense of impasse between the parties came in June , when Obama ’s health czar , Nancy - Ann DeParle , was dispatched to the Hill to meet with GOP leaders .
In a session with Virginia Rep. Eric Cantor , the Republican whip , DeParle tried to gauge his support for the public option .
Sitting in his third - floor Capitol office with a bowl of M&Ms between them , she explained the need for reform and started to lay out reasons why a public option would be the most effective tool to lower costs and increase competition , before Cantor cut her off .
“ Stop right there , ” Cantor said .
“ I ’m not convinced . ”
The Virginia Republican said he wanted to work with the White House to revamp the health care system but believed that government agencies are inherently less efficient than the private sector .
The conversation , while cordial , fell flat from that point on , Cantor recently recounted .
The meeting proved to be their last .
Republicans offered an alternative the week before the House vote that was widely panned because it only covered 3 million uninsured Americans — a far cry from the 36 million that Democrats covered in the House bill .
A Senate effort at bipartisanship on the Senate Finance Committee foundered in the heat of August , when angry crowds swarmed town hall meetings across the country .
Sen. Chuck Grassley ( R - Iowa ) was talking to Democrats but at one point seemed to embrace GOP talk of “ death panels ” — without using the term — infuriating the White House .
Grassley insists the White House and Democratic leadership “ got impatient and they shoved us aside . ”
And he said he personally asked Obama at the White House to take the public option off the table as a way to foster bipartisan support , but Obama “ never answered . ”
Democrats have since dropped the public option from the bill to stave off opposition from Democratic moderates .
High - wire act
The partisan impasse holds political peril for both parties .
Republicans have staked their political success on the Democrats ' failure to enact legislation after an upcoming House - Senate conference committee — or the failure of that legislation once it ’s enacted .
Democrats could gain big if health reform proves popular — or suffer for years at the ballot box if the programs falter .
Most experts see the far greater peril for Obama .
" Obama and the Democrats have no choice at this point — they must pass something , ” said James Thurber , founder of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University .
“ However , it is a high - risk strategy not to have the Republicans at the table from the beginning of this process . ”
Republicans are more confident than ever that the party will reap significant rewards in the 2010 elections , with polls down on health reform and a quartet of red-state House Democrats calling it quits .
First - year Rep. Parker Griffith recently announced he ’s switching parties to become a Republican , citing the Democrats ’ health care bill as a big reason why .
Snowe sees it differently .
“ There 's plenty of responsibility and blame to go around — no question about that , ” Snowe said .
“ It 's unfortunate because I think the American people would expect rightfully that on a question of this order that we could do better , and we could have . ”

Lake Co. sheriff candidate sued four times for civil rights violations
County spent $ 260,000 to settles cases
Lake County Sheriff candidate John Krempotic said the decision to settle instead of defend four civil rights lawsuits filed against him when he worked as a deputy was made because his former boss wanted him fired .
During a Daily Herald endorsement interview , Krempotic said former Sheriff Gary Del Re told Lake County prosecutors to settle the four lawsuits without going to trial because he wanted Krempotic forced out of the sheriff 's office .
Del Re did not return repeated calls asking for comment .
But Lake County State 's Attorney Michael Waller said the county settled the lawsuits filed in 2003 and 2004 because there was no defense for Krempotic 's actions .
" The decision to defend the lawsuit is made by the state 's attorney , not the sheriff , " Waller said .
" And , the reason the case was settled is because there was no defense for the actions of John Krempotic .
Had the cases gone to trial , there would have been much larger verdicts against the county because of his behavior . "
Krempotic is running against Waukegan defense attorney Douglas Roberts in the Feb. 2 Democratic primary .
The winner will take on incumbent Republican Mark Curran of Vernon Hills in the November general election .
Krempotic was sued for civil rights violations four times by six people while working as a Lake County Sheriff 's deputy in 2003 and 2004 .
The total payout by the county to settle the lawsuits in 2005 was $ 260,000 .
Three people filed two of the lawsuits against Krempotic in 2003 after he allegedly helped a friend file a false police report .
Then , in 2004 , three other people filed two additional lawsuits after Krempotic allegedly broke into a home to administer a field sobriety test to two girls he claimed looked intoxicated and underage .
The first two lawsuits were settled out of court for a total of $ 180,000 .
The second two were settled for a total of $ 80,000 .
Krempotic said he left the department in 2005 after the last lawsuit was settled , opting to accept disability until his retirement started in 2007 .
Krempotic said he believes the lawsuits could have been defended by the sheriff 's office and the Lake County state 's attorney 's office .
He charged Del Re used the lawsuits as retaliation to get him fired after unionized sheriff deputies voted against supporting Del Re during the 2002 election .
" I felt all along I was the target of retribution by former Sheriff Gary Del Re , " Krempotic told Daily Herald editorial board members .
" Cases like that are very defendable when you have evidence in plain view .
...
But the state 's attorney 's office followed what the sheriff wanted to do , and would n't prosecute , thereby leaving me open for civil action . "
Krempotic added he could not discuss details about the lawsuits due to a nondisclosure agreement he signed .
When contacted Wednesday and told of Waller 's statements , Krempotic said Waller was n't present during the incidents .
" I stand behind the decisions I made while serving as a deputy ( with the Lake County Sheriff 's Office ) , " he said .

Last generation , Level - 5 ’s Dark Cloud series stood among the best of the dozens of RPGs that were released .
Now that Level - 5 has concentrated on their brand new IP , White Knight Chronicles , fans of old have wondered if the Dark Cloud series was gone for good .
Although White Knight Chronicles 2 is already in development , there is still a chance that Level - 5 will bring back this outstanding RPG series that few have forgotten .
On top of the official announcement for the release date of White Knight Chronicles International Edition was the news that the International Edition would include the Georama gameplay elements that were seen in the Dark Cloud series .
In response to that , a Dark Cloud fan stated the following :
Georama ?
Wait , WHAT !?
Is this game like Dark Cloud !?
Oh , please say it is !
I ’ve been waiting for a new Dark Cloud game since I beat the second one … like ten times !
In reply to the fan comment , Level - 5 ’s Associate Product Manager , Christian Cardona , replied with the following :
You ’ll be seeing some stuff real soon on that and I think you ’ll be pretty happy about it =)
It seems that the team over at Level - 5 have n’t forgotten about the thousands of Dark Cloud fans across the globe .
The question is , will Level - 5 unveil a brand - new next - generation Dark Cloud title , or will they release a collection of Dark Cloud 1 & Dark Cloud 2 similar to what Santa Monica Studios did with the God of War Collection ?
Hopefully Level - 5 will announce something soon , as this falls short of official but is indeed promising .
Boston cops are using the Massachusetts electronic surveillance laws to arrest and prosecute citizens who use their cellular phones to record abusive arrests .
Though they have n't been successful in prosecuting the acts , it has n't stopped the arrests — presumably the point is n't to secure convictions , but rather to chill the recording of illegal police activity .
However , police have convicted citizens who secretly recorded their own abusive arrests , charging them with illegal wiretapping .
Simon Glik , a lawyer , was walking down Tremont Street in Boston when he saw three police officers struggling to extract a plastic bag from a teenager 's mouth .
Thinking their force seemed excessive for a drug arrest , Glik pulled out his cellphone and began recording .
Within minutes , Glik said , he was in handcuffs .
" One of the officers asked me whether my phone had audio recording capabilities , " Glik , 33 , said recently of the incident , which took place in October 2007 .
Glik acknowledged that it did , and then , he said , " my phone was seized , and I was arrested . "
The charge ?
Illegal electronic surveillance .
It was certainly an interesting year for the World Wrestling Entertainment .
The WWE was full of interesting stories , great matches , and some of most controversial angles in years .
Rather than look back myself at the WWE in 2009 , I am joined by a collection of pro wrestling writers from CamelClutchBlog.com .
We all do n’t see it the same , although there seems to be one unanimous agreement from all of us .
Sit back and relive the WWE 2009 through the words of the writers at CamelClutchBlog.com .
WWE Superstar of the Year
Eric Gargiulo – Randy Orton .
By no means is Randy Orton my favorite wrestler , nor do I particular enjoy watching him wrestle .
However , you cannot deny the year that Randy Orton had in the WWE .
Orton was the top dog on RAW for most of the year .
He wrestled in the main - event at the 25th WrestleMania .
He had three world championship title reigns , beating John Cena twice and winning the title in the six - man tag team match at WWE Backlash .
I am actually starting to enjoy him more now that he is scaled back a bit on RAW and is n’t all over the show .
He may not have had any Match of the Year candidates , but he certainly never stunk up the joint .
I am not a big fan , but I have to give props to Randy Orton for the WWE 2009 Wrestler of the Year .
Without a shadow of a doubt , The Undertaker is one of the most popular WWE Superstars of this decade , and in my frank opinion , the WWE Superstar Of The Year 2009 !
Despite getting older and closer to retirement , Undertaker had several classic matches this year , most notably his match against Shawn Michaels at WrestleMania 25 .
The victor of that historical bout over 10 years in the making , was Undertaker , keeping his WrestleMania undefeated streak thriving , at least for one more year .
After feuding with C.M.
Punk for quite some time , Taker finally beat punk to capture his World Heavyweight Championship , at WWE ’s Hell In A Cell PPV , in an official Hell In A Cell match .
As I said , Undertaker still holds onto his belt , most recently defeating Batista to retain it , at WWE ’s latest PPV , TLC .
With all of this considered , I do not even think twice , about awarding The Undertaker as the WWE Superstar Of The Year !
Chris Behringer – CM Punk .
A lot of people love him .
A lot of people hate him .
2009 is the year CM Punk needed .
A heel turn into his straight edge holier than thou persona & a feud with Jeff Hardy has given
Punk a chance to shine as one of WWE ’s top heels .
It ’s going to be very hard for CM Punk to have a 2010 as good as his 2009 was unless he can capture his first WWE Title .
Since coming to WWE , he has added the ECW , Intercontinental , World Tag Team , & World Heavyweight championships to his resume .
Capturing WWE ’s top title may make
Punk the best star to grace a WWE ring in the past few years .
Congrats . to Punk on a big year .
Brock Koller – Chris Jericho .
John Cena may have won the Slammy for Superstar of the Year , but Chris Jericho rightfully deserves the moniker of Wrestler of the Year .
There are two areas in professional wrestling that a performer needs to excel in to become wrestler of the year – in ring skills and mic skills .
As with most years , Jericho was one of the top athletes in WWE .
He had many blockbuster matches with Rey Mysterio in 2009 and made the tag team division as interesting as it possibly could be .
As for his mic skills ?
They were stellar .
In fact , if I were still in high school , I would have watched Jericho promos to study for the SATs vocabulary section !
How many times have you heard gelatinous parasitic tapeworms in an interview ?
Do n’t lie .
What are you a sycophant and a hypocrite ?
Chris Jericho for 2009 was , indeed , the best at what he does .
WWE Guest Host of the Year
Eric Gargiulo – Jesse Ventura .
This was a tougher one to call than any of the previous awards here at the Camel Clutch Blog .
As much as I loved Shaquille O’Neal , Jesse edged him out as my favorite Guest Host this year .
For one thing , Jesse was just awesome on his promos in the ring .
He really got it and still gets it even years after his pro wrestling career has ended .
He seemed like he wanted to be there and put 100 % into the gig .
If you think about it , it was Jesse that really got Sheamus over as a big time star .
Without Jesse ’s promo and introduction it is arguable that Sheamus would not have gotten over as well as he did in the pre-match with Cena .
Jesse ’s contribution is often overlooked .
The icing on the cake was the reunion of Jesse and McMahon on commentary .
They sounded great and it brought me back to my childhood .
For that reason alone Jesse “ the Body ” Ventura is the WWE Guest Host of the Year .
Todd Frizzell – Dennis Miller !
Just Kidding !
Did You Actually Think I was Being Serious ?
Let me put it this way …I ’m being about as serious as Dennis Miller ’s jokes on RAW !
Does that answer any and all potential questions ?
Anyway , The REAL Winner Is …
Bob Barker !
As I ’m sure we can all agree upon , the majority of WWE RAW Guest Hosts have been pretty bad , with the exception of Bob Barker and a few others .
Barker was the guest host on the September 7th addition of RAW , and he really did deliver .
He was funny , entertaining knew what he was doing , and at least acted like he was genuinely having a swell time .
Basically , he did everything that Dennis Miller did n’t , and if you did n’t see Dennis Miller on RAW , trust me , that ’s a good thing !
Barker ’s presence was particularly enjoyable , when he brought out “ The Price Is RAW ” , punked out Chris Jericho , and literally punched out Chavo Guerrero !
All in all , he was a very entertaining addition of the show , and therefore deserves , more than any other guest host bar none , the WWE RAW Guest Host Of The Year Award !
Congratulations Mr. Barker !
Chris Behringer – Bob Barker .
The Price is Raw was easily the most entertaining episode of Raw WWE has had since this whole inception of a weekly guest host started .
Barker easily made up for hosts who have gotten over like a fart in church ( ZZ Top , Cedric the Entertainer , & Al Sharpton all come to mind ) through his humor & quick wit and really seemed to connect with everyone who was watching .
Let ’s face it ; who did n’t love “ The Price is Right ” when Barker was hosting ?
Brock Koller – Bob Barker .
Had to be Bob Barker .
Nobody knew how to hold their own like Mr. Barker .
He was relaxed , professional , witty , smart , and not cringe - inducing like so many others .
Was there need for him or any of the others ?
Absolutely not .
But if I had to choose the best , I would put all my money on Bob because the price is right .
WWE Match Of The Year
Eric Gargiulo – Shawn Michaels vs. The Undertaker from WrestleMania 25 .
Shawn Michaels and Undertaker had what will go down as a 31 minute WrestleMania classic .
These two had n’t missed a beat since their exciting series of matches over ten years ago .
The match was just simply great and had 70,000 plus going nuts from entrance to finish .
The old dogs showed the current class of wrestlers what stealing the show at WrestleMania is all about .
I ca n’t think of another match that even touched this one as a Match of the Year .
Although , I ’d like to thrown an honorable mention for Degeneration - X vs. Undertaker and John Cena vs. JeriShow .
I thought this was a very underrated match that could have given WrestleMania 25 a run for the money if it went a little longer .
Todd Frizzell – Shawn Michaels VS .
The Undertaker From WrestleMania 25 !
This is by far the easiest catagory of them all , for The Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels from Wrestlemania 25 , is not only the best match of the year , but the best WWE match I have seen in years !
To me , this could very possibly be the WWE match of the entire decade !
Hell , the match of the century !
This match was incredible , from an athletic standpoint , to a psychological standpoint .
This match featured some of the most intense 30 plus minutes , in the entire storied history of the WWE !
There were more false finished than I count , more holy you know what moments than Dennis Miller has bad joked , and the atmosphere was nothing short of electric !
Early in the contest , The Undertaker went for his patented super dive over the top to the outside , by caught his legs on the top rope , plummeting head first to the floor .
I seriously remember thinking that his neck was broken , but thankfully he turned out to be fine , and unbelievably , finished the match , and had a classic one at that !
I commend the Undertaker for his passion and desired he portrays !
Again , to reiterate , this was , in my opinion , a five star match , and defiantly the WWE Match Of The Year !
Chris Behringer – The Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels , WrestleMania 25 .
Words simply cannot do the match justice .
For 45 minutes , 2 WWE legends had those attending the event & watching at home eating out of the palms of their hands .
The match had a great pace , utilized ring psychology , false finishes , & most importantly , told a good story .
If you ’re going to watch any match from WWE this year , this is it .
Brock Koller – Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels WrestleMania 25 .
No question about .
It ’s a match I have been craving for since January 1998 and when it finally occurred , it far exceeded my expectations .
Match of the Year was Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels at Wrestlemania 25 .
The buildup to the match could have been better executed , forgoing the JBL and Vladimir Kozlov plot points , but the ends certainly justified the means .
The two sure to be Hall - of - Famers and WWE veterans put on a show that should be displayed in a frame in a museum ( a frame that reads Blu- rays ) .
If you are ever put on trial to defend wrestling as entertaining – this should be the only evidence you ’ll need .
This was not only the match of the year , it was Match of the Decade .
WWE Angle / Storyline Of The Year
Eric Gargiulo – Shawn Michaels vs. The Undertaker .
I was torn between this and Trump and originally I gave it to Trump .
Then I started writing and while you have HBK - Undertaker going into 2010 , the Trump angle only lasted a week .
In fairness to the Trump angle , it got the WWE more mainstream publicity than anything since the last Trump angle .
However , the angle between Shawh Michaels and the Undertaker was something we could all sink our teeth into .
As much credit as they get for the match , I think the angle / story really turned this one into an all - time classic .
The fact that the angle is continuing today and looks to be building towards a WrestleMania rematch seals the deal for me .
Todd Frizzell – The John Cena VS .
Randy Orton Saga !
In one of the longest running feuds in WWE history , literally lasting over two years , the Randy Orton vs. John Cena feud was an emotional thrill ride .
In my opinion , this feud has been very underestimated throughout the WWE fan base .
Although I ’ll readily admit that it probably lasted a bit long , there was a lot of solid stuff that came out of it .
A few memorable matches these two men had in 2009 , just to name a few , was their I - Quit match at Breaking Point , there Hell In A Cell matchup at Hell In A Cell , as well as their outstanding sixty minute iron man match at Bragging Rights .
The thing I personally enjoy about Cena / Orton matches , is not necessarily the actual physical action taking place , but the magnificent ring psychology and drama that both men bring to the table .
It is truly an art form , and often unappreciated nowadays .
Anyway , as I have stated , this was a lengthy , but at times very productive feud over the WWE Championship , and deserves to be referred to as the WWE Angle Of The Year !
Chris Behringer – ECW .
My award for this one actually goes to the ECW brand .
As the summer rolled around , many people knew that Tommy Dreamer ’s contract was going to expire .
WWE decided to put Dreamer in a main event storyline on ECW & have him chase the ECW Title ; the added stipulation being if Dreamer did n’t win the belt , he would retire .
Dreamer went into Extreme Rules portraying the underdog & captured his second ECW Title by defeating Christian & Jack Swagger in a hardcore Triple Threat hardcore rules match at the Extreme Rules PPV .
WWE definitely pulled one over on even the smartest fans .
Everyone , myself included , thought that match was going to be Dreamer ’s swan song .
It ’s nice to be proven wrong every now & then .
Brock Koller – Donald Trump buys Raw .
I could not think of any angle that led to matches that I would consider angle of the year .
Orton-HHH ? Cena -Orton ?
Punk - Hardy ?
Meh .
The most memorable angle to me was Donald Trump buying Raw .
The angle only lasted two weeks , but its effects lasted throughout the rest of the year with the guest host project .
Numerous news outlets were fooled by this faux exchange of ownership which was only the start of the mainstream publicity WWE would garner from this angle , i.e. every sports guest host shown on SportsCenter .
While they could have prolonged this angle further , the shortness of the execution is largely overshadowed by the magnitude of the ripple effects .
WWE Story Of The Year
I am sorry but there is no bigger story in my mind than this one .
The incident at Survivor Series 97 has been the catalyst for over a decade worth of business .
Without that angle , we may have never had the Mr. McMahon character which led to the Austin - McMahon angle , which turned around business .
The fact that Bret Hart has never appeared on WWE RAW since the incident , is absolutely huge in my mind .
Personally I always thought it would happen , but I never thought it would take this long .
I ca n’t think of a bigger story for my website alone from the wrestling world than this one .
This is huge and the angle beginning next week could be the start of the 2010 WWE Angle of the Year .
Todd Frizzell – The Death Of Former WWE Superstar Eddie “ Umaga ” Fatu .
Although very , very sad , the news of former WWE Superstar , Eddie “ Umaga ” Fatu ’s death , was shocking enough to be considered the WWE Story Of The Year .
Umaga passed away on December 4 , 2009 at the young age of only 36 years old , as a result of multiple heart attacks , in his Houston , Texas home .
After no reaction after efforts by medical personnel at a local intensive care unit , Umaga ’s family made the decision to take him off of life support .
This story , was and still is , being talked about throughout the entire professional wrestling community .
Therefore , this break out story , which shoot the very foundations of the professional wrestling world , will consequently be awarded with the WWE Story Of The Year Award .
Chris Behringer – Bret Hart .
This is a tough one .
You ’d think that the deaths of former stars or Jeff Hardy ’s epic fail by being busted in a drug raid would be the winner .
But as 2009 comes to a close , one story has gotten a lot of buzz .
The story being that Bret Hart , after a 12 year absence from WWE , has signed a short term contract that lasts up through WrestleMania .
After Survivor Series 1997 , NOBODY thought they would ever see Bret Hart in a WWE ring again .
But as we ’ve learned time again , never say never in the wrestling business .
Brock Koller – Bret Hart .
Wow .
This choice would have been drastically different if I did n’t procrastinate until the final days of the year to write this .
Without a shadow of a doubt , the story of the year is 12 years in the making and while it is the story of the year , it is certainly in the top 5 stories of the decade list – the return of Bret Hart .
While the actual return wo n’t start until the new year ( new decade ) , the announcement of said return is bigger than anything else that happened this year .
My original choice for story of the year would have been Shane McMahon resigning from WWE , which also does n’t go into effect until next year .
The departure of Shane is monumental just for it bringing the future of WWE in question .
But if the return of the Excellence of Execution is any indication , the future of WWE is looking a bit brighter .
The impact ( no pun intended ) of Hart remains to be seen and will be heavily critiqued in 2010 , but the announcement itself is momentous in its own right .
No other return could bring the shockwaves this one did .
And it came just at the right time , too , it seems .
This story is the best there is , the best there was , and the best there ever will be in the year 2009 .

Apparently , the $ 10.75 million contract that Bills running back Marshawn Lynch signed in 2007 is n't enough .
The running back made news Saturday when the wife of a Buffalo police sergeant filed a complaint with Hamburg , NY police stating Lynch stole $ 20 from her at a T.G.I. Fridays restaurant in December .
According to the Buffalo News , Lynch stole the $ 20 from the woman , who was using it to pay her bill after dining with a friend .
" He takes the $ 20 out of her hand , and my wife says " What are you doing ? '
And Lynch says ' Do n't worry . '
When my wife 's girlfriend came back to the table , she told her about it , " woman 's husband stated .
" The girlfriend approached Lynch and said , ' Give my friend her money back , ' and Lynch threatened her saying ' Do you know who I am ?
There 's going to be consequences . ' "
Lynch is currently on three years ' probation for a misdemeanor gun possession charge in Los Angeles .
the running back is also facing a lawsuit for his highly publicized hit - and - run accident in downtown Buffalo in 2008 .
But the Jews of the Russian empire spurned both of his gifts — Hillelism and Esperanto .
As the Jewish Chronicle of London put it in 1907 , “ The sect which Dr. Zamenhof sought to establish has never been represented by more than one person — himself . ”
By the time Hilelismo appeared in 1901 , the First Zionist Congress of 1897 had already convinced many Jews of Eastern Europe that a political solution to the Jewish question was close at hand .
It is not that Zamenhof was out of step with developments ; on the contrary , Hilelismo was a rebuke to political Zionism , and he was not the only Jew to write one .
So did Ahad Haam , the religious conscience of the early Zionists , who derided Herzl for his “ idolatrous ” failure to root nationalism in Jewish ethics .
As for the Jews and Esperanto , some were drawn to it from the start .
In the earliest Esperanto adresaro ( directory ) , there are nearly 200 Jewish names among the 900 - odd Esperantists living under the Czar .
But most Russian Jews , as Jeffrey Veidlinger has recently shown , were consumed with endless debates on the relative merits of Yiddish and Hebrew , and would continue to be for decades .
While Zamenhof smarted from the failure of Hillelism , the neutral , artificial language he had offered the Jews had taken on a life of its own .
As Esperanto , his “ beloved child , ” became a cranky adolescent , journeying from provincial Eastern Europe to worldly Paris , the Jewish father with his prophetic talk of justice and brotherhood became an embarrassment .
Zamenhof ’s hope for the first World Congress of Esperantists in 1905 , to take place in Boulogne - Sur - Mer , was that the Congress would be “ a heart - warming religious center . ”
He addressed these words in a letter to the organizer , the eminent French attorney Henri Michaux , who alerted the other French members of the committee to his concerns about Zamenhof ’s “ mysticism . ”
When the poem Zamenhof intended to read at the opening ceremony ( his own composition , called “ Prayer under the Green Standard ” ) was read aloud to the Committee , the result was explosive .
In Michaux ’s words , “ one could hardly grasp the wonderment and scandal of these French intellectuals , with their Cartesian … spirit , these representatives of lay universities and supporters of secular government , accustomed to and identified with freethinking and atheism , when they heard this flaming prayer to ‘ the high moral Power . ’ …
‘ But he ’s a Jewish prophet , ’ cried [ Carlo ] Bourlet , and [ Theophile ]
Cart for his part : ‘ That Slav !
Michaux will never be able to control this crazy man ! ’
And [ General Hippolyte ]
Sebert lamented : ‘ We ’ll be ruined and a laughingstock . ’”
In the end , Zamenhof recited his prayer , minus the final stanza , which began : “ Together brothers , join hands , / Forward with peaceful armour !/
Christians , Jews or Mahometans , / We are all children of God . ”
After reading it , Zamenhof received an ovation so long and ardent that it startled him .
Still , the French organizers of the 1905 Congress went to great lengths to obscure Zamenhof ’s Jewishness , and the result was noted — with evident pride — by Zamenhof ’s close Jewish associate , the oculist Emile Javal : “ Of 700 articles in the press , only one mentioned Zamenhof ’s Jewishness . ”
But the bloody events of the revolutionary year 1905 renewed Zamenhof ’s determination to inculcate Esperantists with the values of Hillelism .
In January 1906 , a fictitious “ Circle of Hillelists ” issued “ The Dogmas of Hillelism , ” a twelve - point credo treating religion , language , morals , and customs .
It was clear that he was no longer addressing it to Jews ; all Hillelists were entitled to their chosen or inherited religions — entitled also to their various “ family languages ” at home — but each would vow to reject those elements that failed to meet the severe ethical standards of Hillelism : nationalistic ideals ; national , racial and religious chauvinism ; and doctrines offensive to reason .
In short , it was to be a sort of ethical quality - control on religion , transacted in Esperanto , with a few key social institutions attached .
( Think , your neighborhood JCC : Hillelists would someday convene in Hillelist temples with Hillelist religious schools and Hillelist programs for the elderly . )
The goal , to form a new people , had not changed , but the strategy had .
It was to be a quiet , gradual transformation , conscience by conscience , “ unremarked and without any disruption . ”
Before the year was out , Zamenhof lightly revised the declaration , changing the name from Hillelismo to Homaranismo ( Humanitarianism ) .
He was de-Judaizing a movement grounded in Jewish ethics , presenting it anew to the Esperantists as a “ philosophically pure monotheism . ”
But his intention to present Homaranismo at the Second World Congress in 1906 evidently met with a fierce backdraft from the movement ’s leaders .
In the months leading up to the Geneva congress , as Christer Kiselman has shown , Zamenhof began backpedaling on Homaranismo .
It would have trouble gaining adherents , he wrote , if it required the adoption of a new language ; if it were perceived as a religious dogma rather than a “ neutral bridge ” among religions ; if it sounded too utopian .
A mere three weeks before the opening of the Congress , his confidence low , he wrote to Javal , “ According to your advice , I threw out of my congress speech the last part touching on Homaranismo — and speak only of the interna ideo — the internal idea — of Esperantism .
I am leaving each person to clarify for himself the essence of the idea , as he wishes . ”
There is pathos in his concealment of Homaranismo at the behest of the movement ’s most prestigious , mainly French , leaders ; in this encoding of his most dearly held belief as the interna ideo .
Pathos , but heroism too , since Zamenhof was in fact trusting the Esperantists themselves to understand the interna ideo as the mandate for a modern , ethical community .
They do n't call him " Terrible Ted " for nothing .
American hard - rocker Ted Nugent — famous for his conservative political views and defense of the right to bear arms and kill animals and / or trespassers with them — lashed out with both barrels at supporters of PETA ( People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ) in a recent interview with Royal Flush magazine .
The 61 - year - old singer - guitarist — who sold millions of albums in the ' 70s and had a major hit with 1977's " Cat Scratch Fever " — kicked off the chat by blasting some of PETA 's higher - profile members :
“ My name is Ted Nugent and because of Pam Anderson and because of Bill Maher and because of Paul McCartney , all the members of PETA , whenever I hear the word ” ˜animal ’ or ” ˜rights ’ in the same paragraph , I ’m killing an extra hundred of something this year .
“ I have unlimited deer tags in Michigan and Texas , " continued Nugent , " and I do n’t even need to kill them really , but I ’m going to for Bill Maher .
I ’m not just killing them I ’m fucking slaughtering them and I ’m going to gut them and skin them , quarter them and butcher them and feed them to the soup kitchen and homeless shelters of America .
Not because I need to , because it will cause Bill Maher to shit blood .
That ’s my goal in life . ”
Nugent recently abandoned his home state of Michigan to take up residence in Crawford , Texas , not far from his hero George W. Bush .
That way , he said , he can keep a machine gun in the front seat of his vehicle .
" Mess with me and I will fill you full of lead and then dance on your remains and keep the shit from your carcass in the cleats of my boots while I feed my dog your remains , " Nugent told Royal Flush , adding : " You can feel the love , ca n't you ? "
Not surprisingly , Nugent also took the opportunity to dump on Bush 's successor , U.S. president Barack Obama .
" I think that Barack Hussein Obama should be put in jail , " he ranted .
" It is clear that Barack Hussein Obama is a communist .
Mao Tse Tung lives and his name is Barack Hussein Obama .
This country should be ashamed .
I wanna throw up . "

By Jonathan H
I see urban exploration as the hobby of appreciating things which , decades after their creation , still manage to make us open our jaws agape at the ingenuity of the human soul .
Often , however , such ingenuity is misplaced in hubris .
Vandenberg was a logical step at illustrating such schizophrenia of the technocratic imagination – for it was at Vandenberg that our love of all things Nuclear and Ballistic began to take its true Frankenstonian shape .
In January of 2008 , soon after my first trip to Neverland , the planning phase for a new , riskier operation was already being laid .
In the months that followed January of ’08 , Scott and I would make numerous forays into Neverland , but – as it often is with our trips – we invariably tried to find things to do while waiting for the sun to drop below the horizon .
After all , a trip to Neverland during the day would have been significantly more risky , given the amount of gardeners and caretakers that circulated on the property .
On the other hand , gallivanting around an active military base , we figured , would probably best be done during the day .
It just so happened , Vandenberg Air Force Base ( a mere 30 minutes away from Neverland ) was a popular haunt for the rare Snowy Plover ( a cause célèbre for all well - informed ornithologists ) .
And the Snowy Plover would make the perfect alibi for the Urbex Desperadoes we had become .
On our second trip to Neverland , we added a brief foray out to Vandenberg to our itinerary ( really just to “ scope ” the situation ) .
Although the base itself is closed to the public , certain portions on the far South and Northeastern side are accessible .
On the South side , a sleepy rail station of Surf serves as a bucolic , publicly accessible beach – albeit closely monitored by Vandenberg Security Forces .
In the case of the Northeast side of the base , the Marshalia Ranch golf course is sometimes – though not always – available for public use .
My frequent drives out to the edges of Marshalia Ranch confirmed that it , too , is a popular hangout for the 30th Security Forces Squadron .
I knew that the consequences of exploring Vandenberg at night could be dire ; the “ SF , ” as the security forces of Vandenberg are known , are n’t your typical slovenly security guards .
These protectors of Freedom carry M4 assault rifles and – as you can see in the photo above – can easily crush people like me between their fingers .
However , I had strong reason to consider risking it – stupid , maybe , but certainly an alluring prospect .
Why , you ask ?
Vandenberg , for those of you who do n’t know , is a proverbial Disneyland for Cold War era missile defense sites .
Atlas D , Atlas E , Atlas F , Titan I , Titan II , Minuteman , Peacekeeper , Thor — you name it and Vandenberg had it .
It ’s a massive base , 250 square miles in all .
But in the vast 3,537,441 square miles that make up the United States land area , it is quite literally a crumb of the total cake .
Soon , it had become an executive decision : Vandenberg was my next step in a longer journey and goal ( but an increasingly spectral and dangerous journey ) .
If Vandenberg as a whole is the Disneyland of Missile Defense , then the Northern side of the base would be the equivalent of Frontierland – the place where all of it was born during the Missile Gold Rush of 1959 .
Most compelling to explorers of missile defense sites such as myself , Vandenberg North was also where the early missile programs died by the late 1960s .
In the 1970s Vandenberg North has been abandoned in place of Vandenberg South .
Today , the bones of the past at Vandenberg North are ripe for exploration .
The old sites had four decades to decay and , in the interim , they had become something of a beautiful sight of their own merit .
But getting inside the perimeter of Vandenberg North is n’t as easy as it seems .
Though we had our alibi ( we had developed a new - found interest in bird watching ) , we still did n’t have a way in .
All the roads inside of the base ( and thus to the front door of our underground missile sites ) were completely sealed off by sentry stations and road blocks .
Security forces regularly patrolled the roads .
The sky was filled with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles ( UAVs ) equipped with infrared cameras .
Admittedly , part of what appealed to me was the risk .
Some of my recent successful forays had given me a brazen confidence .
As part of the MacGyver Generation , I also reveled in the potential of being part of an elite few who had managed to infiltrate an active base undetected .
Stupid , yes , but certainly alluring .
The decision started relatively inauspiciously .
It began as a terse exchange via email on January 15 of 2008 , soon after the three of us had infiltrated and photographed the Sutter Buttes Titan I complex at Beale AFB :
STEPHEN : Are there any underground missile bases other than Titan and Atlas that are abandoned ?
Are there any Atlas silos that are available to explore [ in California ] ?
I heard the Lincoln Titan site is filled with water , anybody have confirmation ?
SCOTT : I think the Atlas sites are mostly in the Midwest .
There are always the Titan IIs , but those are definitely far , far away .
There must be some Nikes around , though …
ME : The first Titan test silos are in the Vandy base , but those are on an active base , as you know .
I still believe they ’re accessible , but the risk would be significant .
STEPHEN : Yeah , I might be crazy , but I ’m not stupid .
Invading an active base is beyond stupid .
There might be the chance of ‘ official ’ access to Vandenberg .
Jon , you ’re a student at a reputable university who could make a request for access that might actually be listened to .
Or we could just go to the museum , but I hate museums .
Was the minuteman missile stored in a silo ?
ME : Well the thing about Vandy is that it ’s separated into two sectors — the active part , and the semi-abandoned part .
The semi-abandoned part is apparently a popular haunt of bird - watchers , and parts ( but not the missile base parts ) are open to the public …
STEPHEN : Hey guys , I ’m also a devoted bird watcher intent on seeing the silo parakeet in its natural habitat !
Let ’s go ‘ bird - watching ’ on Vandy and track the rarely seen species into its underground lair !
Jon , I know you ’ve been looking at Vandy .
We ’ll have to talk about this on our drive down to Jacko ’s place ( Neverland ) .
What ’s our schedule by the way ?
I need to start planning .
By February 29th , we found ourselves in an overflow parking lot near the Marshalia Ranch golf course .
Air Force brass teed off within a few hundred feet of us .
Stephen , in his Jeep , turned off the road and towards a pre-designated parking space .
We began walking towards our target – the defunct Operational Systems Test Facility , which was the first underground missile base in the United States .
Our “ scoping ” trip soon turned into a pact to give it a go if we felt safe to do so .
We walked within the perimeter of the base and found ourselves within 100 yards of the OSTF .
The three of us knew the smell of an abandoned Titan base well .
The smell of Titan decay lingers in the surrounding air and – for me – it had slowly become something of an evocative and irresistible scent ( what can I say , I ’m weird ) .
As we ducked under the bushes in broad daylight we conferred over the final plans for the last leg towards the silo .
That ’s when we saw a white sedan barreling down the road .
Sure enough , it was an SF patrol , and he seemed to have known we were there .
We saw the SF pull on to a dirt road that led to our trail .
Immediately , we turned around and started running back toward Stephen ’s Jeep .
Apparently , Vandenberg was teeming with patrols during the day , and a day trip would be impossible .
Any passing car could easily evince us from the road that was directly in the path towards the OSTF .
We breathed a sigh of relief when we arrived at the Jeep .
It was then that we decided any future trip would need to be done at night .
We also knew , should we be caught at night , the consequences would be exponentially more severe .
At night , we could n’t pose as avid ornithologists .
If caught at night , we would become potential terrorist suspects .
Stephen did n’t show for the second trip to Vandenberg , but we found an able stand - in for him in Aaron .
We arrived at Marshalia Ranch around dusk and parked in the overflow lot .
The three of us hopped out of the truck and began the hump over to the OSTF – just as we had on our first trip .
All of us agreed to keep our flashlights off until we were inside the missile facility .
The moon had served as an excellent source of low - level illumination – and , together , we discussed what the protocol would be , should another SF be hot on our trail .
Then it came – this time as a white SUV speeding down the paved road that separated us from the OSTF .
Aaron , Scott , and I watched the headlights approach our crossing point .
We barely had enough time to drop to the ground and lay low .
The car passed , and we continued across the paved road , looking like nimble roadrunners on a desert stretch of asphalt at night .
Once across the road , we were separated from the OSTF only by a few hundred feet and a rusty chain - link fence .
We squeezed through what seemed like a miniscule hole in the fence and began poking around the remnants of the silo , which had gone through its own travails to become what it was when we saw it .
On Saturday evening , 3 December 1960 , a full rehearsal short of actual launch was being conducted by Robert Rhodus , the Martin Company OSTF test conductor .
It was the ninth attempt – all of the other attempts had failed due to minor equipment malfunctions .
The missile was loaded with liquid oxygen , it was raised to the surface from the silo , and the countdown began .
The test was a success , and everyone involved was relieved of their duties .
The missile began to be lowered back into the silo , where the propellant probe crew was tasked with reconnecting the hose to offload the oxidizer , but something went horribly wrong .
According to the account of retired USAF CMSGT Les Lawson , relayed to me via email , the elevator was lowered using the “ down fast circuit , ” instead of the “ down slow ” mode ( which was required for a fully fueled missile ) .
Upon realizing he had done this , the operator quickly switched the mode to down slow and the system responded by braking suddenly .
“ The sudden forces on the platform caused the entire support structure to lurch , ” Said Lawson , “ The hydraulic reservoir located on the upper side of the silo tilted enough to spill hydraulic fluid onto the braking system . ”
From there , the entire braking system was compromised and the missile began an uncontrollable descent to the bottom of the silo , where LOX and RP1 mixed , causing a massive explosion .
Rhodus watched the entire event transpire from a television screen , about 1/4 - mile away , and he “ realized with some trepidation that , unlike the buried operational control centers , the room he was in had only 12 inches of dirt on top , not much protection from the tons of concrete that were raining down all around .
He also realized it was far too late to run . ”
Nearby airmen were watching the events on television too – and the SLTF crew , not more than 1,200 feet directly west of the OSTF , saw the “ entire elevator assembly , known as the crib , and missile launcher , a total of 160 tons of structural steel , come out of the silo , tumbling up out of the searchlight beams ‘ in slow motion . ’”
In the years that followed , enormous chunks of concrete could be seen on the hills near the Titan I facility , and a complete reference system gyro was found on the Marshalia Ranch Golf Course , more than a mile away from the blast site .
Scott , Aaron , and I stood hundreds of feet above the old superstructure of the silo , and looked deep down into the abyss of the disaster area .
Over the years , the exploded cylinder had filled with water – and that water had taken on an almost radioactive - looking green appearance , likely from algae that blossomed prodigiously within the stagnant pool .
Dead animals were floating in the water .
Across the silo , the equipment and fueling terminals stood .
Their reinforced capstones made the gigantic , exposed cylinders look like the rooks of medieval castles .
It was the most incredible man-made structure I had ever seen in my life .
I never had a true sense of the massive scale of a Titan silo until I saw it as I did that night – fully exposed from the outside , maimed by a massive explosion , and slowly returning to the nature it had once usurped .
The three of us squeezed through the window of an above - ground , derelict building .
We found old technical specs and blueprints related to the OSTF program .
In a back corner of the building , a cavernous passageway led to rooms that went underground .
Scott and I fumbled across holes in the floor that once held data cables .
We found an old HVAC system and continued through a T - junction to corrugated steel tube that resembled the Titan tunnels at the Sutter Butte site in Northern California ( which we had explored just months earlier ) .
The air in that tunnel was filled with the electricity of discovery and our hearts were racing in anticipation .
We pushed aside a blast door and looked down towards an antenna silo – fully intact and carrying a pristine and authentic Titan 1 radome antenna , complete with a canvas inflatable sphere .
This was what the writer of “ Titan 1 Epitaph , ” whom I ’ve interviewed in the past , calls “ a very complex system indeed … a radio - inertial missile guidance and tracking package representing , at the time , some of the very latest in technology and miniaturization in solid state electronics . ”
It was the full system designed by Bell Laboratories and a priceless relic that played a pivotal role in American history .
The Western Electric Missile Guidance system ( known as an AN / GRW - 5 by technocrats ) was so important that Titan bases contained two of them for redundancy – one of which could not be raised above - ground unless the other was lowered below - ground .
Scott and I looked at each other .
We had become so accustomed to whispering , that – at first – we hesitated to let out a sound .
Then , in a burst of excitement , we hollered in ecstatic glory .
A chest bump later , and a few words of congratulation was all it took .
We had just seen what few civilians had been privileged to see , and it was sitting there for us to photograph and share with the world .
We immediately broke out our camera packs and began a methodical documentation of the two underground antenna silos .
The night eventually came to an end , and by dawn we were walking on the public road to our vehicle .
We drove 15 miles to an abandoned diatomite mine and I laid my sleeping bag down to rest in the powdery mine tailings .
The trip was a success , but Scott and I both knew that it would n’t be our last trip to Vandenberg …
It did n’t take long for us to return to Vandenberg – and this time it was decided that we would spend the entire weekend on the base – dwelling during the day underground , and returning topside at night to explore complexes and traverse to other sites .
Our first destination was the Atlas F , which is similar to a Titan II base in layout and configuration .
Upon exploring the Atlas F , we would head south to a grouping of various Atlas D and E pads , both of which had very little in the way of underground space but plenty of interesting accoutrements and panels to shoot .
Our visit to the Atlas F was a hurried attempt with a set time limit .
Our entire route was comprised entirely of overland walking , across miles and miles of scrub , ice plant , and sandy dunes .
Both of us were well aware of the impending sunrise ; if we were to find ourselves out of range of a sufficient place of cover by daylight , then we could potentially be seen by patrolling SF .
This was compounded by the fact that very little shrubbery existed for such a purpose – so the abandoned missile complexes themselves were our only hope of hiding .
The nearest Atlas E was over a mile - and - a - half away and it was 4 A.M. by the time we exited the Atlas F blast door .
About a 1/2 - mile away from the Atlas F , on our way to a place of cover , Scott looked over at me and his eyes widened .
“ Where is your tripod ? , ” he queried .
I looked down and noticed it was gone .
I left it at the Atlas F .
It was 4:30 , and I would lose about 30 minutes going back to get it .
Scott laid down in the sand in exasperation , and I began my jog back to retrieve the tripod .
I returned about 30 minutes later .
Morning birds began making their sounds and the early signs of dawn appeared far across the Casmalia Mountains in the horizon .
Our time was running short , and in hushed whispers of urgency we both soon became out of breath .
The next hour was a true race against time .
On the route to our next stop , there were numerous active buildings that dotted the Vandenberg landscape .
The fact was : Vandenberg North was not truly “ abandoned . ”
Parts of the North are occupied by active Minuteman complexes , and Reagan had instituted a rail - based , garrison missile defense system in the 80s known as the Peacekeeper program .
These nuclear warheads were partly based in Vandenberg , and later became active at Mountain Home AFB in Wyoming .
Peacekeepers were underground missiles , much like Titans … but on steroids .
Each of these solid - fuel missiles could carry 10 REVs ( re-entry vehicles ) , and each REV was capable of carrying a MK 21 nuclear payload .
Vandenberg North was pockmarked with underground bunkers that protected the Peacekeeper missiles on rail cars .
When the boxcars were not being used , they were stored in the super - hardened bunkers .
Buildings with electricity on Vandenberg North were likely related to this program – even though the Peacekeeper program was fully deactivated by 2003 .
Whether or not these buildings contained anything of strategic importance , Scott , nor I would never truly know .
Looking at the siren - like warning lights on the building , we knew that we did n’t wish to find out , so we avoided these buildings as much as possible ( unavoidably getting as close as 100 feet away in a few instances ) .
Our pace was quickening and the corona of the sun was appearing over the tips of the mountains in the distance .
We were running out of time .
A truck drove up to one of the active buildings behind us ; if he had looked in our direction , it was certain he would have seen us .
Partly to hide from the truck , Scott and I found an old , overgrown road , which I soon recognized from my mental map of the base .
We were close to our destination , and a few minutes later we found ourselves crawling under a rusty fence ( one of many rusty fences in this epic journey ) .
We would lay low for a few hours while exploring the Atlas E , take a quick nap , and then continue to the most harrowing leg of the hike .
Sleeping at the Atlas E site was a welcome reprieve .
When one is running on adrenaline , one ’s bodily functions are in overdrive .
The heart rate stays at a steady high .
Sweating is more frequent , and body movements are twitchy and unpredictable .
Scott and I had been continuously operating on adrenaline all night .
When we reached the hard asphalt floor of the well - hidden Atlas E complex , it could have just as well been a billowing bed , filled with perfectly fluffed down pillows .
I lay down and was asleep within seconds ; I happened to choose a location that was almost directly under what would have once been an 82.5 - foot Atlas E Intercontinental Ballistic Missile .
I can honestly say , now , that the best nap I ’ve ever had was directly below the domain of a nuclear missile – and it ’s strange to say this , but I felt safe .
I awoke to the sound of a Blackhawk helicopter that was fanning the base in patrol .
Scott was taking a picture of me splayed on the floor with his cell phone .
We got to our feet and began the portion of the trip that would be most challenging .
Vandenberg North is cut off from Vandenberg South by an impenetrable blanket of vegetation that follows the windy course of San Antonio Creek .
There is no possible route across the water other than two dangerous and highly visible crossings .
On our way in , we chose the railroad crossing to reach the historic 576th Strategic Missile Squadron – an area rife with both Titan II and Atlas D missile complexes .
This required walking a frequently traveled Amtrak railroad trestle hundreds of feet above the canyon .
We would return to our vehicle through a different route ( which I ’ll describe later ) .
After crossing the trestle with little trouble ( but a mere minutes before another Amtrak train had careened across the canyon ) , Scott and I set our sights on our first Titan II .
We hopped another rusty fence ( see a theme here ? ) and surveyed the topside conditions for a good entry route .
Scott found an emergency exit and began climbing down .
“ Oh Shit !!!! ”
Scott whispered loudly .
Immediately after I heard him , a bat swirled around his head , coming from deep within the emergency exit .
It flew around Scott ’s face and exited the ladder - way .
Scott dropped a small rock down the tube to ensure that any bats made their way out and then headed down the ladder .
The space of the ladder , approximately 24 inches in diameter , was much too small for me to wear my backpack , so I strapped it in front of me and slowly descended about 100 feet to the bottom of the underground Titan II Control Dome .
With a full respirator attached to my face , I felt like an astronaut , boldly stepping into the domain of an extraterrestrial spaceship .
The view was incredible .
Control panels and ceiling panels were haphazardly strewn across the floor .
Rust mixed with benzene – colors that are so unnatural , they make the environment seem more artificial than anything I ’d seen in my life .
Surely everything in the Titan II control domain was artificial , but one could see constant evidence of the intrusion of nature all around :
Bats roosting in a place you could n’t think anything living could survive in , water seeping , cave crickets searching for anything to dine on .
It was beyond surreal .
It was unreal .
The latest graffiti in the tunnel , potentially from other military men who had spent their R&R time on the base in the best way possible , dated back to the 1970s .
Graffiti , overall , was relatively sparse – a welcome surprise , because all of the past silos I had explored in Colorado and Northern California came littered with a liberal smattering of monikers from multiple generations of explorers .
Like we had done in the other complexes , Scott and I busted out our equipment and began the tough work of illuminating our scenes .
We snapped a few photos in the access tunnel and walked towards the acoustically designed Titan II silo .
Seeing the interior of a Titan II silo is a rare gift .
Under the terms of the Strategic Arms Limitations Talks ( SALT ) with the U.S.S.R. , most Titan II silos were deliberately destroyed in the mid-1980s .
Of the 54 Titan II bases built in the U.S. , only a few silos remain unmolested .
As far as I know , there is only one original Titan II silo that has its launch doors completely open to the elements – and we were at it .
This provided an unprecedented opportunity to photograph the silo illuminated by natural moonlight – both from the inside and outside .
We were hesitant to leave , but we knew that our time was running short , so we walked another 1/2 - mile to our final site and the most historically compelling :
The 576th SMS Atlas D trio .
The 576th Squadron of Atlas D’s comprises three fully intact bases , filled to the brim with original equipment , cables , and artifacts .
There was so much to see that we decided on only one complex in the interest of time .
We selected the only Atlas D site on the base with its original Gantry , which was easy to spot in the midnight sky .
Much like the irresistible scent of a Titan missile , this symbol of our desire had become its own navigation beacon .
With our eyes pointed towards the gantry , we walked in a beeline from 395 - B ( the Titan II that had just de-virginized us ) .
During this walk , I had to stop to really look .
The 576th Squadron is on a bluff overlooking the entire Northern Portion of the base .
I used a brief break in our walk to look out towards the moonlit landscape , and to take note of our accomplishments .
From my vantage , I saw it all – the Atlas F was more than five miles as the crow flies .
With the full moon at its zenith , things that were miles away from that bluff were eerily easy to see – the blinking green status lights of the active Peacekeeper buildings , the shadowy form of the Atlas E with its diagonally descending personnel tunnel , the distant lights of active Minuteman bases .
All of it seemed like a ghostly dream – much like those dreams you wake from , only to remember the most prosaic of details .
And yet , seeing it all – even while actively involved in the process of exploration – immediately made me miss the trip .
I knew that we had about 8 hours until it was completely over , and I soon regretted the notion of leaving this strange post - atomic , no - man ’s land .
“ Ready to move ? ” Scott chimed in .
He had just finished a granola bar , while I polished off my final orange .
Even if I wanted to stay an extra day , I knew it meant going without food or water – a prospect that did n’t seem worth the extra time on base after the first bout of hunger set in .
We arrived at the Atlas D , and it was everything we had hoped it would be : Launch consoles ; tanks of liquid nitrogen ; lines connecting rocket fuel through snakelike arrangements underground ; vast , lengthy tunnels that carried communication and power cables across the complex .
It was a beautiful capstone to a trip steeped in visual splendor – and a sobering monument to the military industrial complex – something that even Mercury could even look down upon from the skies of the Roman gods and admire from afar .
Despite how much I bungled and bombasted my way through barriers and sentries in subsequent explorations , nothing could quite match the experience I had with Scott during those fidgety 36 hours .
Neverland was only the first notch on a long - lasting relationship with pushing the limits ; Vandenberg was a chunk .
Soon , I would find myself in an abandoned skyscraper worth $ 118 million .
My ethos would evolve even further when I found myself in a steel factory in Detroit , which was purportedly protected by a shotgun wielding wacko ( who actually turned out to be a nice guy ) .
But Vandenberg topped them all .
Scott and I nearly lost each other , deep in the base at 3 A.M. that night .
Our phones were n’t working and we had separated somewhere along an overland shortcut to the bridge that crossed San Carlos Creek .
For 20 minutes , I frantically tried dialing until my phone ’s battery was near death .
I rolled through chaparral and descried El Rancho Road ( our escape route home ) from the top of the bluff .
Down at a turnoff on the side of the road I saw Scott ’s dark , pensive frame .
We met at the bottom of the bluff and planned the final and most dangerous portion of our epic trip .
SF vehicles were rolling back and forth across the bridge .
The bridge itself , which was a skyway traversing the entire San Carlos Creek wetland , was much longer than we had imagined while looking at the satellite images .
Considering the frequency with which patrol cars traveled back and forth across the bridge , I indicated to Scott that we could probably make it about halfway across the 300 - yard bridge before an SF vehicle would arrive – upon which we would have no place to hide .
Scott concurred .
The pinch was in , and we had no way out .
We briefly considered going back to the railroad trestle , but that would have meant two more days of overland hiking – without food or water .
We decided it prudent to at least walk to the bridge to see if there was a possible way across by going under it .
“ Look , ” I whispered , pointing to the utility pipes hidden behind the cement guardrails on each side of the bridge .
“ I think we can bail over the side and lay low until the car passes . ”
We tested the load carrying capacity of the pipes by going on them together .
They held our weight .
We had to start soon .
It was almost dawn , so we both grabbed our gear and began running across the gray , cement skyway .
We were lucky , at least until the final 100 yards .
It was then that Scott saw the headlights of a distant SF .
We swiftly hopped over the side barrier and lay on the utility pipes .
The SF passed and we returned to the Skyway , on to our freedom .
We arrived at the Marshalia Ranch Golf Course a full 36 hours after we began our trip .
We had traversed twice over chasms ; we had seen the entire nuclear smorgasbord of Cold War America ; we had evaded a half - dozen SF patrol cars ; and every bone in our body ached from 16 miles of hiking on adrenaline .
It was finally over .
I shook Scott ’s hand in congratulations and started my long drive home .
Halfway up Highway - 101 ( the road that had so often been my thoroughfare of adventure ) I realized that the jacket pocket in which I had stashed my memory card had a hole in it .
Every photo was lost .
The trip , however , was not entirely lost .
I wrote about it because I wanted to remind myself that those pictures are n’t the only thing that matter .
If a picture is worth a thousand words – well , then – this particular collection of words is worth at least four .
Perhaps I look at it all so optimistically because of the events that transpired immediately after my return .
Often , the biggest blessings come after a difficult journey .
I arrived home that evening to discover that my father had a subarachnoid brain hemorrhage .
I thought the very worst and threw on a new pair of clothes to fly up to Portland , Oregon .
That week I spent in a hospital waiting room was the worst week of my life ; by the time I left the hospital , however , it had become the best .
My father had fully recovered from something that originally gave him a 10 % chance of surviving .
It seemed fitting that I emerged from a landscape of Cold , deathly war only to have it conclude in a true story of survival and miracles .

Complete coordinates and details of all abandoned Vandenberg facilities
WSWS , 13 November 2009
Yesterday the New York Times reported the Norwegian financial newspaper Dagens Naeringsliv�s revelations that Peter Galbraith , a former US diplomat and advisor to the Kurdish regional government in northern Iraq , stands to make hundreds of millions of dollars in profit from Iraqi oil revenues .
Galbraith�s profits would result from his cashing in on his links to the Kurdish regional leadership , and his role in drafting Iraq�s Constitution , shortly after the 2003 US invasion of Iraq .
In 2004 , Galbraith helped the Kurds arrange deals with Norwegian oil firm DNO and prepare for negotiations on the Iraqi Constitution , including controversial provisions on how to divide Iraq�s oil revenues .
During the 2005 negotiations , the Times noted , Galbraith worked to ensure the draft included " clauses that he maintains will give the Kurds virtually complete control over all new oil finds on their territory . "
Galbraith stood to benefit enormously from these clauses , Dagens Naeringsliv revealed last month .
On June 30 , 2004 �the day after the successful conclusion of the Kurd - DNO negotiations �the Kurdish regional leadership had given Galbraith a major stake in undiscovered oil fields on its territory .
Oil analysts quoted by the Times estimate his five - percent stake in the newly - discovered Tawke oilfield alone would be worth at least $ 115 million .
There are indications , moreover , that Galbraith may make even larger sums from the affair .
After a falling - out with Galbraith in 2008 , DNO sold a stake in the oil fields to the Kurdish regional government , apparently trying to cut Galbraith and a Yemeni business partner out of the deal .
Galbraith and his partner sued DNO for compensation , which Dagens Naeringsliv estimates at $ 525 million .
A ruling is expected early next year .
DNO attempted to recoup the money by charging it as " operating expenses " to the Kurds , who tried to pass the expense on to Baghdad .
The Iraqi central government in Baghdad refuses to recognize all the oil contracts signed by the Kurdish government prior to the ratification of the Constitution , maintaining they are illegal .
Baghdad is therefore refusing to pay Galbraith , and insisting that the Kurds find the money from the 17 percent of Iraqi oil revenues allotted to them under Iraq�s current revenue - sharing agreement .
The Iraqi Parliament�s failure to pass an Iraqi oil law has made it impossible to settle this disagreement between Baghdad and the Kurdish authorities .
Galbraith�s attempt to extort hundreds of millions of dollars from Iraq is unanswerable evidence of the neocolonial character of the US occupation of that unfortunate country .
Far from being a war against al - Qaeda terrorists or Iraqi weapons of mass destruction �which were crude inventions of a US government determined to justify a war to a skeptical and hostile public �the 2003 invasion was an imperialist adventure offering well - connected operators the chance to make fortunes .
Moreover , it is ever clearer that a central element of the occupation was the theft of Iraq�s oil resources .
The Times� article on Galbraith comes only one week after the revelation that southern Iraq�s huge West Qurna oil field has been divided between Exxon - Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell .
The New York Times itself described the Galbraith story�s potential to " inflame " Iraqi public opinion .
In a comment that demonstrates its own political complicity with the theft of Iraq�s oil , it crudely described Iraqi sentiment that " the true reason for the American invasion of the country was to take its oil " as " a conspiracy theory . "
This is in the middle of a story describing the looting of hundreds of millions of dollars in Iraqi oil revenue !
The participation of Galbraith , a prominent former diplomat with Democratic sympathies , in the plundering of Iraq testifies to American liberalism�s complicity in the crimes of US imperialism �which finds perhaps its most finished expression in the Obama administration�s continued occupation of Iraq .
Peter Galbraith , the son of prominent liberal economist John Kenneth Galbraith , was a professional staffer for the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations from 1979 to 1993 .
In the late 1980s , during the Iran - Iraq war , he documented the massacre of Iraqi Kurds by Saddam Hussein , then a US ally .
From 1993 to 1995 , during the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia , he served as US envoy to Croatia .
He communicated to Croatian leader Franjo Tudjman the Clinton administration�s approval for Operation Storm , Croatia�s 1995 ethnic cleansing campaign that drove 200,000 Serbs from the Krajina area .
Appearing last year before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) , Galbraith stated that the US had an " understanding attitude " towards the operation .
He claimed that he would not have asked Washington " to give it the green light " if he had believed Tudjman intended to remove Serbs .
However , he had previously admitted that Tudjman and his associates were known to want an " ethnically clean country . "
After a stint at the National War College and working for the UN in East Timor , he resigned from US government service , going into business in the Middle East .
He was also appointed �at the Obama administration�s request �to the United Nations mission in Afghanistan , leading a campaign to denounce Afghan president Hamid Karzai�s reelection as fraudulent and criticizing UN official Kai Eide .
A prominent aspect of Galbraith�s work in the Middle East was his sympathy for Kurdish separatism , acquired during his work on Iraq as a Senate staffer .
Contacted by the New York Times , Galbraith confirmed that he had an " ongoing business relationship " with DNO during Iraq�s constitutional negotiations .
He added : " I undertook business activities that were entirely consistent with my long - held policy views .
I believe my work with DNO ( and other companies ) helped create the Kurdistan oil industry which helps provide Kurdistan an economic base for the autonomy its people almost unanimously desire . "
In fact , Galbraith�s own actions are the clearest demonstration that the Kurdish separatists � alleged " autonomy " is nothing of the sort .
Wedged between two larger , hostile powers �Turkey to the north , and the rest of Iraq to the south �they are generally at the mercy of shifts in broader regional politics , and their oil industry in particular is the target of unscrupulous operators like Galbraith .
Galbraith�s views played a significant role in the Democratic Party�s fraudulent attempts to portray itself as a representative of popular antiwar sentiment , while it planned to continue occupying Iraq after the departure of President George W. Bush .
Galbraith specialized in giving a moralistic , pseudo - democratic veneer to Democratic plans to reduce US troop commitments in Iraq by imposing a ruthless , Yugoslav - style ethnic partition on the country .
On this basis , he became a prominent advisor on foreign policy questions to Democratic politicians , including Senator ( now Vice President ) Joe Biden and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , John Kerry .
Thus , in a November 2005 Washington Post column titled " What Are We Holding Together , " he wrote : " As a moral matter , Iraq�s Kurds are no less entitled to independence than are Lithuanians , Croatians , or Palestinians ...
The United States should focus now not on preserving the unity of Iraq but on avoiding a spreading civil war . "
He concluded : " Iraq�s political settlement can pave the way for a coalition exit " by US and allied forces from Iraq .
Ultimately , however , the Bush administration opted for a massive military rampage through Iraq , the so - called " surge , " in an attempt to crush opposition to the central government .
It preferred not to risk inflaming the broader regional tensions that an ethno- religious partition and civil war threatened to trigger .
In this regard , the Times� timing in publishing this story �which has been circulating in the Scandinavian press for a month �is significant .
It comes as the US attempts to manage growing ethnic tensions in northern Iraq , as politicians debate the status of ethnic minorities in key oil - rich regions such as Kirkuk in the run-up to January �s national elections .
US officials , including Vice President Biden , have reportedly pressured Kurdish politicians to allow more Arab and Turkmen residents onto the lists of approved voters .
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York , during its $ 180 billion bailout of American International Group , Inc. , instructed AIG to omit details of its purchase of certain toxic assets from a December 24 , 2008 , Securities and Exchange Commission filing , according to e-mails between the company and the Fed released Thursday .
Using bailout money provided by the Fed , AIG paid a number of banks 100 percent of the face value of credit - default swaps , contracts tied to subprime home loans , at a time when other institutions were negotiating deep discounts for the paper .
The names of the banks were also omitted from the SEC filing .
The information was finally disclosed in March 2009 after the SEC challenged AIG ’s filing , prompting lawmakers and analysts to call the transactions a “ backdoor bailout ” of the banks .
Topping the list of banks which benefited from the backdoor bailout of their toxic paper were Goldman Sachs and Societe Generale SA .
The e-mails , released Thursday by Rep. Darrell Issa ( R - Calif . ) , ranking member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , show the Fed wanted a number of other details about the AIG bailout withheld or their disclosures delayed .
The coverage from Bloomberg News has all the gory details , including a non-denial denial that Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , who was then chairman of the New York Fed , had anything to do with the cover-up .
Rep. Barney Frank ( D - Mass . ) has called the disclosure “ troubling ” and plans to hold hearings on the issue , though he publicly maintains full confidence in Geithner .
“ The new details revealed today regarding AIG ’s bailout in 2008 come as no surprise to those of us who believe that the American people deserve full transparency from the Federal Reserve , ” Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) said in a statement .
“ My strong suspicion is that secret arrangements between cronies like this are not an anomaly , but the norm . ”
The Fed , as you ’ll recall , fought disclosure of the information , claiming that it would erode market confidence .
No such thing happened , of course .
If dollar investors are n’t already spooked enough to run like hell , it ’s hard to see what would convince them that the dollar is n’t nearly as safe as they seem to think .
“ The status quo has made it entirely too easy and too tempting to behave recklessly with public funds in total secrecy , ” Paul said .
“ The system needs radical change , but we should start with honesty , transparency and accountability to the American people about how their money is being handled . ”
Update : The New York Times reported Friday that the Treasury department explicitly denied Geithner had anything to do with it .
The Times quoted Treasury spokeswoman Meg Reilly as saying Geithner “ played no role in these decisions and indeed , by Nov. 24 , he was recused from working on issues involving specific companies , including A.I.G . ”
A woman who made a false rape allegation that led to an innocent man being arrested has been jailed .
Rosanne England , 21 , cut and then tore her underwear and scratched her own face before telling police a masked stranger had entered her house .
Derek Cummings , 59 , who had never met England , was arrested because he fitted the description and had no alibi .
England , of Holbury near Southampton , admitted perverting the course of justice and was jailed for 18 months .
Winchester Crown Court heard England told officers the man had asked to use her phone and toilet because his car had broken down .
She said after entering her home he donned a joke dog mask and attacked her in May last year .
I do not want to see a 21 - year - old woman jailed but she knew I had been arrested and I was totally innocent
Derek Cummings
The businesswoman gave Hampshire police a detailed description and officers launched a manhunt and produced an e-fit .
Mr Cummings , a married father of two teenage daughters who was at a sport and social club nearby , fitted the description and could not offer an alibi because he had been walking his dog in nearby woods alone .
He was arrested and held for 28 hours while samples were taken before being released on police bail .
However , the Forensic Science Service discovered that England 's clothing had been cut before being torn and 24 days later she finally admitted to police the allegation was completely untrue .
Mr Cummings , who had suffered abuse from the public , was exonerated .
The court heard that England suffered from mental health problems and was receiving psychiatric help .
Affects ' real ' victims Mark Florida - James , prosecuting , said : " This allegation of a stranger attack was taken very seriously .
" The cul - de- sac where Miss England lived was cordoned off and the force aircraft was used to search the area .
" It is unfortunate he ( Mr Cummings ) was in the wrong place at the wrong time and bore a resemblance to the description .
" But at no point was there any evidence that Mr Cummings was involved .
" It was completely made up and fabricated and he was totally innocent . "
Sentencing England , the Recorder of Winchester , Judge Keith Cutler , said that such an allegation could have left Mr Cummings facing a jail term of at least eight years .
He said : " There is a real effect of all this for women who are genuine victims of this horrendous crime of rape .
If people make false claims it impacts on genuine claims and how they are treated . "
Mr Cummings said he still had trouble from people close to where he lives in Fawley , Hampshire , who wrongly believe " there is no smoke without fire " and he can not go into certain pubs .
" My family has been through hell , " he said .
" I do not want to see a 21 - year - old woman jailed but she knew I had been arrested and I was totally innocent .
I have mixed feelings about her . "

This is the lead to an article in the Daily Mail , sent in by Chris W. , about the small victories accomplished in 2009 by one “ fifty - something ” Linda Kelsey .
In addition to letting a man see her naked , she lists putting together home - assembly furniture and singing happy birthday in tune :
But back to the stripping .
The message she is trying to send is that she feels happy that she ’s become more comfortable with her body .
She writes :
My fifty - something body , I believed , just was n’t up to naked scrutiny .
And if I could n’t take my clothes off , that meant sex was also off the agenda .
But then she met someone she liked and yadda yadda yadda .
This is all fine and good , but the image they used to illustrate this particular victory is this :
So the image they used to illustrate her comfort with her body and the fact that “ sex is about how we connect , not what we look like ” suggests just the opposite .
The picture includes two mostly naked models ( who are models because they have ideal bodies already ) ; there ’s no bodily connection at all and the man ’s pose does n’t suggest emotional connection either .
So women are being told how liberating it is to take their clothes off for men ( how convenient for the dudes ) and that they should feel comfortable with their bodies , like those young , thin , white , properly - gendered , able - bodied models do .
Now , if good ol ’ “ fifty - something ” Linda Kelsey had posed displaying her newfound body comfort , like she does with her cardboard boxes , it would have sent the message she intended .
Instead , it makes us feel bad for feeling icky about our bodies AND reminds us that they are ( probably ) icky indeed .
P.S. : I just have to say , do you see that picture of her ?!
She looks fine !
What fifty - something woman would n’t be pleased with that body ?!
What woman of any age should n’t be pleased with that body ?
What kind of message does it send when she trashes herbody .
She must think most of the population is hideous .
We all need to stop trashing our bodies in front of one another , there ’s just - about - always someone who ends up feeling worse because they compare their own body to the self - trasher and feel like they do n’t measure up even to the body being disparaged .
Enough .
A young designer from Strate College Julien Anglade presented his graduation project – a cruise ship concept Ikkar .
The main aim of the work is to fill missing link between yachts and megaships .
The yacht is ecofriendly and has the ability to change shape according to the location as well as comfort of the passengers .
Ikkar will accommodate 50 passengers in extreme comfort and luxury and 60 crew members .
Each suite faces the sea and has a large terrace which rotates depending on the wind and brightness .
With a length of 150 meters , the ship ’s purpose is not to achieve high speeds on the water but to be energy - efficient .
The hull of the vessel has a streamlined shape to reduce energy consumption .
The main sail of the yacht is finished in rigid photovoltaic cells that other than harnessing the solar energy also sails the boat in positive wind conditions .
The main deck is enclosed by translucent railings , this lets passengers unite with the sea and the nature .
When the vessel is at low speed , it drops the sides of the hull flat into the water , allowing the passengers to float with the waves and feel themselves walking on water .
There is also an idea to transform the “ ground floor ” of the Ikkar for temporary exhibitions in the city where the vessel is located .

ATLANTA  Regulatory failure , not low interest rates , was responsible for the housing bubble and subsequent financial crisis of the last decade , Ben S. Bernanke , the Federal Reserve chairman , said in a speech on Sunday .
Mr. Bernanke ’s remarks , perhaps his strongest language yet assessing the roots of the financial crisis , came as he awaited confirmation for a second term as Fed chairman and as he sought greater regulatory authority from Congress .
“ Stronger regulation and supervision aimed at problems with underwriting practices and lenders ’ risk management would have been a more effective and surgical approach to constraining the housing bubble than a general increase in interest rates , ” Mr. Bernanke said in remarks to the American Economic Association .
Mr. Bernanke , addressing accusations that the Fed contributed to the financial crisis , argued in his speech that the interest rates set by the central bank from 2002 to 2006 were appropriately low .
He was a member of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve system for most of that period .
" I started panicking about a month ago , " says Jason Rosenfeld , the founder of Scenic Labs .
The company makes Blu-ray 1080 p " ambient discs " that include titles like " The Classic Fireplace , " " Coral Reef Aquarium , " and " Journey Through Space , " and Rosenfeld was trying to figure out how to enable Blu-ray 's forthcoming " managed copy " feature for his discs .
As one of the first companies to turn out discs with the " managed copy " logo on the back , though , Rosenfeld soon learned the pitfalls of being an early adopter — especially when no test hardware exists .
We asked him about the experience of supporting a spec that 's still in the " blueprint " phase .
Managed copy means that Blu-ray players will soon be able to contact authorization servers , look up the copying rules for a particular title , and offer consumers the ability to make DRMed copies of the movie in question .
Each studio can set different limits on the number of copies allowed and the price charged for these copies .
Fire ... as shot by a RED 4 k camera .
But can you make a backup ?
Studios are supposed to be supporting managed copy now by authoring discs that can take advantage of it , but managed copy required player hardware support before such a copy can be made .
That support wo n't arrive widely until the middle of next year , so Rosenfeld was unable to test his discs .
He began having nightmares of customers showing up at his virtual doorstep in 2010 , complaining that managed copy did n't work with their players .
But it costs money to make changes to a master and ship it off to a disc replicator , and Rosenfeld wanted to be careful .
His team contacted others in the business and even went straight to AACS - LA , the licensing consortium that handles the AACS DRM on Blu-ray titles .
Definitive answers were tough to come by , but Scenic Labs eventually concluded that it had to make only two changes .
First , its discs needed to include a unique ISAN number ( a bit like a serial number , but there 's only one per title , not a unique number for each physical disc ) , and Scenic Labs secured its number from the primary North American ISAN registrar , Secure Path .
Second , Blu-ray discs contain a manifest.xml file that needed to include one additional line with a URI pointing to an authorization server .
Those servers will eventually be run either by movie studios or directly by AACS - LA , but none are currently operational .
Rosenfeld 's small company had no desire to set up and administer a conforming server of their own , so they include a link to the AACS - LA server pool .
Then they authored the discs as usual .
If that sounds a bit confusing , you 're not alone ; even those in the industry are n't clear on how managed copy will play out .
That 's because all the key details , such as how the servers process business rules and what copy options are available , are n't even known yet .
At this point , managed copy consists of little more than a serial number and a website ; in 2010 , AACS will then allow companies to fill out forms describing their copy rules and pricing schemes .
How will the feature be activated ?
There 's also been confusion on this , but Rosenfeld says that the latest word he received was that managed copy would appear as a disc option ( rather than a player option ) — but only on players that support the feature .
How will payment details be handled ?
Who knows !
As one of the first people to adopt managed copy , Rosenfeld certainly hopes his company did the job right ; he can't verify that without hardware , but he has no desire to pay additional fees to a disc replicator in order to send over new masters if a mistake was made .
He 's not opposed to the system and understands why studios care so much about DRM , but Rosenfeld has a different perspective on his own business .
Piracy is going to happen — that 's one of his axioms , and if it 's correct , it means " you 're only ever hurting the people who pay for the product . "
In other words , you 're inconveniencing your own customers .
Leaving AACS off his discs was not an option unless Scenic Labs burned them to BD - Rs in its own facility — an option that was neither cheap nor fast .
Another option for making copies simple would be to allow an " always copy " flag but again , this only works on BD - Rs , not commercial discs .
So Scenic Labs plans to make its managed copy rules as lax as possible .
If there was some error in implementing managed copy , Rosenfeld does n't plan on fixing his discs but instead on making a free Internet download available .
" Take a picture of the disc with your cell phone " and Scenic Labs will send a link to a file — that 's the backup plan .

Guests celebrating new year at the highest pub in England had a longer than expected stay , after heavy snow left them stranded for three days .
About 30 people arrived at the Tan Hill Inn in North Yorkshire on New Year 's Eve to welcome in 2010 .
But the wintry weather conditions meant the residents were snowed in for a further two nights .
Resident DJ Peter Richardson said : " We 've kept our spirits up .
It 's actually been quite heart - warming . "
The Tan Hill Inn stands 1,700 feet ( 520 m ) above sea level in the Yorkshire Dales .

Mr Richardson , from Richmond , North Yorkshire , said there had been a strong sense of camaraderie among the guests , who had come from across the UK .
" People have been helping peel veg for the dinner and pitching in , " he said .
" We 've also held quizzes . "
Guest Paul Manson , who lives near Alnwick in Northumberland , said : " Everyone 's been chipping in by doing the washing up , peeling potatoes , getting cars out of the snow and keeping the generator going . "
A manager at the pub said morale had remained high .
" It snowed heavily throughout the night on New Year 's Eve , but no - one gave it a second thought until the morning when they could n't move their cars , " he said .
Guests began making their way home on Sunday , after gritters and snow ploughs arrived and cleared the roads .
All right , so what is " BDSM " ?
" BDSM " is an acronym of " B&D " ( Bondage & Discipline ) , " D&S " ( Dominance & Submission ) , and " S& M " ( sadomasochism ) .
" BDSM " refers to any or all of these things , and a lot of stuff besides .
Tying up your lover is BDSM ; so is flogging that person , or bossing that person around , or any of a thousand other things .
BDSM is highly erotic , usually ( though not always ) involves sex or sexual tension ; and is highly psychologically charged .
One person ( the " submissive " ) agrees to submit to another person ( the " dominant " ) ; or , alternately , one person agrees to receive some sort of sensation , such as spanking , from another .
Some people like to be submissive all the time , some people like to be dominant all the time ; some people like to switch , being submissive one day and dominant the next .
Many people practice some element of BDSM in their sexual lives without even being aware of it .
They may think of " S&M " as " That sick stuff that people do with whips and cattle prods and stuff , " yet still blindfold one another from time to time , or tie one another down and break out the whipped cream ...
All of these things are " BDSM . "
BDSM is not necessarily hardcore sadomasochism ; it can be remarkably subtle and sensual and soft .
Pinning your partner to the bed and running silk or ice cubes or rabbit fur over your lover 's body qualifies as " BDSM " ( specifically , of a variety called " sensation play " ) .
BDSM does n't have to involve all of these .
There are many people involved in BDSM who enjoy tying others up , or being tied up themselves , but who do not enjoy S&M - - that is , they are n't interested in inflicting or receiving pain .
Sometimes , one partner just ties up the other , as a form of foreplay .
Similarly , there are many people who may like the psychological control they get from ordering their lovers to do things , but do not care for being physically restrained or tied , or for tying up their lovers .
BDSM is as varied as the people who do it .
I 've met many people who engage in BDSM activities , such as bondage or spanking , but who insist they are " not into that BDSM stuff . "
Usually , it 's because they have an idea in their heads about what BDSM is , like " BDSM means wearing a leather mask and being chained to a wall and whipped , and I do n't like that , so I 'm not into BDSM . "
But BDSM des n't necessarily mean wearing a hood and being chained to the wall .
If you like being lightly spanked , or light bondage excites you , then you 're into BDSM .
Some people , myself included , love the aesthetic of an elaborate rope harness , or an elaborate form of bondage ; others simply are n't interested in the bondage elements at all .
The key to all these different forms of BDSM , though , is the exchange of power or sensation .
One person ( the " bottom " or " submissive " ) is choosing to allow the other person ( the " top " or " dominant " ) to have control over him or her in some way , or to inflict sensation in some way .
Perhaps it means allowing the other person to tie him up , perhaps it means allowing the other person to spank her , whatever .
In particular , BDSM is NOT abuse !
People who are practicing BDSM in any of its trillions of forms are doing it voluntarily , for fun .
It 's a way to explore .
Everything that happens in a BDSM relationship is consensual ; and believe it or not , it 's not just about the dominant getting what he or she wants -- it 's more about the submissive getting what he or she wants .
An abuser has no regard for the feelings , needs , or limits of the victim .
A BDSM dominant is concerned above all else with the needs and desires of the submissive .
The dominant in a BDSM setting will also look after the psychological well - being of the submissive during and after an activity , for example by providing emotional or physical support in the form of aftercare .
Pretty straightforward , really .
BDSM is n't what you see in porn flicks .
The image of BDSM that is portrayed in many materials of this sort has about as much to do with BDSM as the child 's tale " Jack and the Magic Beanstalk " has to do with agriculture .
These materials show little more than women being used in various unoriginal ways for men's enjoyment , often by force .
The reality is that there are at least as many , and perhaps more , male submissives than female submissives ; and that BDSM is a mutual activity that is driven as much by the needs of the submissive than by the needs of the dominant .
Uh-huh .
Sure .
The needs of the submissive .
Right .
The dominant is the one bossing the other person around ; you 'd have to be some kind of jerk to want to do that .
While that may seem like it makes sense on the surface , the truth is just the opposite .
People who are good at dominating or inflicting pain are , in general , LESS likely than many other people to be jerks or assholes .
Why ?
Because in order to be good at doing it , you need to be highly in - tune with your submissive .
People who are self - centered generally make poor dominants , because they lack the empathy required to be able to read and judge their partner 's reactions , and bring their partner where that person wants to go .
Assholes quickly find that nobody wants to play with them ; and people who are empathic tend not to be assholes .
All of the real top - notch dominants I 've ever met , without exception , are incredibly cool people .
In tune with your submissive ?
The dominant is the one calling the shots .
What does the dominant care about the submissive ?
Believe it or not , the dynamics of a BDSM relationship are often driven by the submissive , not by the dominant .
The submissive sets the limits ; the submissive decides what places can and can not be explored ; the submissive has the ability to call a halt to the scene .
The dominant , in many ways , is simply a facilitator .
It 's the dominant 's job to create a setting where the people involved can explore the submissive 's fantasies .
( As an aside , it 's important to note that these limits can change over time .
It may be that something that used to sound like it would n't be fun or interesting might in the future tickle your fancy ; and that things you enjoy now , you may not necessarily enjoy in the future .
People change over time .
It 's important , when you explore BDSM , to remember that , and to make a habit of talking to your partner about things you like and do n't like as those things change . )
Dominating your partners does not mean that you do n't want to please them .
It is not always , or even usually , true that a dominant is interested in his own gratification rather than his submissive's .
In fact , many dominants are driven as much by their desire to please their partner as by anything else ; the psychology of a healthy BDSM relationship is driven by the submissive as well as by the dominant , and a dominant can take pleasure from gratifying the needs of the submissive just as easily as the submissive can take pleasure from gratifying the needs of the dominant .
This kind of thing is not one - directional .
It 's all for the submissive 's benefit ?
Yeah , right .
The submissive is the one being bossed around or spanked or whatever .
How can you say that is n't abuse ?
Simple .
Two reasons :
1 . In a BDSM relationship , the submissive sets the limits .
A victim of abuse does n't get a vote ; the victim can't tell the abuser what to do , or how much to do it .
A submissive sets all the limits -- what kinds of things can be ( and ca n't be ! ) done , how much , and for how long .
And while we 're on the subject of limits , there is more than one kind of limit in a BDSM relationship .
Everybody has " hard " limits -- things that they absolutely will not do , and will not even consider .
Some people , for example , like to be tied up but do n't like the idea of being whipped ; if they wo n't allow themselves to be whipped , ever , that 's a hard limit .
There are also " soft " limits -- things that someone wo n't do under ordinary circumstances , but will allow to be " forced " on him or her in the context of a particular scenario that 's being acted out .
Between soft limits and hard limits lies an interesting psychological territory to explore .
2 . A submissive gets a way to opt out .
This may be a code word , or a sign of some sort ; if the submissive uses it , he or she has had enough and the scene is over .
An abuse victim does n't tell the abuser when to stop .
So do n't you have to be kind of sick or messed up to do that stuff ?
No .
C'mon , really .
I mean , tying people up ... whipping them .
Is n't that demented ?
No .
For the most part , people who are into this kind of thing are remarkably well - adjusted .
People involved in BDSM generally are neither abusive nor come from backgrounds where they were abused , because people with that kind of backgrounds are n't likely to be sexually turned on by giving someone else power over them .
That does n't mean that no BDSM relationship is abusive -- since people are what they are , no form of human interaction is immune to abuse .
But it does mean that the people you 'll find in the BDSM community are , for the most part , very stable .
( In fact , if you 're going to get involved in this kind of stuff , it helps to have a cast - iron ego and a strong sense of self , particularly if you 're a submissive . )
Some people think anyone interested in BDSM is suffering from some kind of past abuse .
I think that the " BDSM interest=past abuse " assertion is most frequently made by people who do n't understand what BDSM is .
They see someone being flogged , they say " Oh !
People in a BDSM relationship get hit ; people in an abusive relationship get hit ; ergo , BDSM is like an abusive relationship .
QED . "
But the fact is , the psychology of a BDSM power exchange is vastly different from the psychology of abuse ; and in a BDSM relationship , the psychology is frequently driven by the limitations of the submissive , not the dominant .
Typically , it is the submissive who says " This far and no farther " -- which is entirely contradictory to the psychology of abuse .
Now I 'm not saying that people into BDSM are never victims of abuse , of course .
If you survey any arbitrary group of people -- all lawyers , all redheads , all Toyota Camry owners , all BDSM participants -- you 'll find that some people in that group are abuse survivors .
But that does n't imply a direct connection between abuse and the practice of law , or hair color , or choice of transportation ... or BDSM .
The psychiatric profession agrees ,
In fact , according to the DSM - IV , the standard diagnostic reference text " Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders " published by the American Psychiatric Association ,
The fantasies , sexual urges , or behaviors must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social , occupational , or other important areas of functioning in order for sexual sadism or masochism to be considered a disorder .
BDSM is not what it looks like from the outside .
It 's not just tying people up and having sex , and it's not just arbitrarily whipping people .
That 's very crude , and kind of boring .
What it is is a sort of role - playing , where the people involved are acting out a fantasy that involves taking or giving up power .
Sex is often involved , but not always .
Role - playing ?
Fantasy ?
You make it sound like it 's all some kind of game .
It is .
You 're exercising your imagination , and you 're playing a game with the other person .
You get to be the dominant ; your partner is the submissive ; you 're playing the role of the mad scientist who 's just kidnapped someone and is going to use this poor innocent person for evil experiments .
Or whatever .
( There are people who do this all the time -- one always the dominant , one always the submissive -- who will tell you it is n't a game , but that 's part of the game . )
At the same time , however , it is very serious .
You 're creating a framework that allows you to have fun and explore some very powerfully charged areas of human psychology , and push your boundaries at the same time .
In this way , BDSM can be a powerful tool for self - discovery and exploration .
You can also explore fantasies by roleplaying scenarios that are highly charged psychologically .
One such type of exploration is a form of BDSM called " resistance play , " in which one person ( the dominant ) takes another person ( the submissive ) by force , and the submissive is expected and encouraged to resist by force .
This kind of play is not everyone 's cup of tea , of course , but it can be a safe and fun way to explore some of the darker fantasies that are very common in a surprising number of people .
This also can lead you into some highly volatile psychological territory .
Even if it seems like something you really want to experiment with , it 's possible that it can hit some psychological triggers that produce a reaction you did n't expect .
So it pays to go carefully .
Many of the standard rules of BDSM apply doubly or triply to this kind of scenario .
For example , using a " safeword " - - a code word that means " Stop ! " -- is absolutely vital when you 're experimenting with resistance play ; one of the tenants of resistance play is that " no " does not mean " no , " so you need a word that does
It also pays to negotiate the basic parameters in which you 'll operate beforehand .
Different people have different idea of what constitutes " force " or how rough " rough " is .
If everyone involved is n't on the same page , someone may get hurt in a way that is n't so fun .
Whoa , wait a minute .
Force ?
Whipping ?
That 's supposed to be FUN ??
It is fun , if that 's your sort of thing .
The experience of being flogged is nothing like what you imagine it would be like .
For the most part , it 's more stimulating than painful .
Ditto for the experience of acting out , say , a resistance - play fantasy .
Quite honestly , there was a time when I drew the line at the whipping thing .
I was absolutely certain I 'd never , ever , under any circumstances , allow someone to flog me .
Not me , no sir .
But then I tried it ( long story ) , and it was absolutely nothing like what I thought it'd be like .
Ever have a really deep massage ?
The kind that hurts , but still feels good ?
Same thing , only more so .
Besides , when you 're sexually aroused , all kind of stimulation can be fun .
Ever had a lover who left gouges in your back during sex ?
Or one who bites ?
It 's very passionate and intense .
If you 're in the right frame of mind , even a flogging that leaves welts is n't really painful , precisely -- not like stubbing your toe , or running into the edge of the bathroom wall at two o'clock in the morning because you did n't turn the light on .
It 's more like the lover who claws your back when she gets off thing .
But hey , if it 's not for you , do n't do it .
Damn straight !
I would never do that ; I respect my lover too much .
Experimenting with intense things like resistance play and pain play do not mean you do not respect your lover .
Quite the contrary ; respect for your lover is absolutely paramount if you wish to do these things safely .
Respect for your lover is not just in behaving according to some ideal about the way " men are supposed to treat women " or whatever .
Respect for your lover lies in exploring with your lover , creating with your lover , doing with your lover those things that you and your lover wish to do , sharing yourself on a very deep level with your lover ...
It 's reflected in everything you say , do , express , feel , and think with your lover .
Different people want , need , and value different things .
Respect recognizes those differences .
And above all else , respect is an integral part of the mutual process of self - exploration and self discovery .
Now hold on a minute , kink - boy .
We 're talking about kinky S&M here , not Buddhism .
What do you mean , " self exploration ? "
Just that .
BDSM is a very broad term that encompasses many wildly different practices , and many wildly different beliefs .
But central to all these things is the idea of challenging boundaries and testing limits -- and that 's precisely what self - exploration is all about .
You cannot know your limits if you never test them and never explore them .
You may know some general things , but you can't truly know yourself if you have never explored and never experimented .
As Francis Bacon wrote ,
Your true self can be known only by systematic experimentation , and controlled only by being known .
BDSM provides a context and a set of tools for exploring your own personal boundaries in a safe , fun , enjoyable , and mutually reciprocal way .
It provides a vehicle by which you can get to know yourself and your lover much more deeply and intimately than you might have thought possible .
And hey , you often find along the way that you can be surprised !
You probably have turn - ons that you do n't even know you have , and you will never discover without exploration .
And that , my friend , can truly enrich your life and the life of your lover .
When it comes right down to it , if your goal is self - knowledge and personal enlightenment , I put six months in a BDSM relationship up there with three years in a Tibetan monastery any day .
But where do you draw the line ?
How much is too much ?
You draw the line wherever you want to .
There is n't one way to " do " BDSM , and not everybody is in to the same things .
If you like being tied up , but you do n't want to be whipped , then do n't be whipped !
Every person is unique ; not everybody has the same turn - ons ; if you do n't like something , do n't do it .
Most people who practice BDSM believe in " safe , sane , and consensual . "
That means :
Do n't do anything blatantly unsafe ; do n't try anything that 's likely to get you killed or injured if you screw up , and do n't do something if you are n't sure how .
Be reasonable and rational .
Know the difference between fantasy and reality .
Make sure you 're both into it before you do it .
Do that , and you 'll probably be okay .
It 's like anything else ; exploring an interest in fine cuisine does n't mean you have to like fish eggs !
If it is n't for you , then that 's where you draw the line .
Once you get involved in this sort of thing , do n't you keep going further and further ?
Can you ever stop ?
Some people are afraid to start exploring new things in bed because they are worried that if they start doing " kinky stuff , " they wo n't ever be able to go back to " normal " sex , and ordinary non -kinky sex wo n't be fun any more .
That 's absolutely not the case at all .
Eating pie does n't mean you do n't like cake any more ; having one kind of sex does n't mean you do n't like any other kind of sex any more .
And you might find all kinds of new things that are fun !
People are very , very complex creatures , and it 's unrealistic to think that you know the whole truth about every aspect of yourself without ever having experimented with the things that turn you on .
There are many things that I thought would never appeal to me that experimentation has proven are huge turn - ons for me , and I suspect the same is true of most people .
Not even " most people who are into BDSM " -- most people .
Nobody is completely static , and nobody can be expected to know absolutely everything about himself or herself from the get - go .
So when you start experimenting , you may find that there are things that turn you on that you never thought would turn you on .
But then again , unless you are hopelessly shallow , as you go through life you 'll probably discover new things that turn you on even if you do n't get involved with BDSM !
And of course you can stop .
Just because you learn something new about yourself , that does n't mean you 're changing into some kind of raving , uncontrolled lunatic !
It just means you 've discovered something new , that 's all .
But how do I know if it is for me ?
How do I know if I 'm a dominant or a submissive ?
How do I know if I like any of this stuff ?
That depends on you .
It 's not like there 's only one kind of person who 's into BDSM ; and it's not like only men are dominant or only women are submissive .
( In fact , the deck seems to be tilted in favor of men who are submissives . )
And you do n't necessarily even have to be dominant or submissive !
Maybe you like experimenting with being tied up , or tying up your lover , but all that bossing - about stuff does nothing for you .
So , the terms " dominant " or " submissive " may not apply to you , even though you do want to experiment with some aspects of BDSM .
Do n't get hung up on the terminology .
It 's really not that important .
Are you into any of this at all ?
Well , that depends .
Have you ever had fantasies about being tied up and helpless while unspeakable things are done to your body ?
Have you ever wanted to be able to tell your lover exactly what to do ( " Get on your knees and bark like a dog ! " ) ?
You might enjoy experimenting with this sort of thing .
Hey , there are worse things in the world than having an interesting and varied sex life -- and if you experiment and decide it is n't for you , so be it !
So ... why ?
What 's the point of tying people up ?
Why would someone agree to any of this ?
That 's a complicated question .
The short answer is : Because it 's fun , it 's highly arousing , and it 's tremendously powerful .
It 's a great vehicle for exploring a number of different kinds of fantasies in a way that 's exhilarating .
People are dominant or submissive for different reasons .
Being submissive in a BDSM scene can be tremendously liberating , particularly for people who are n't comfortable exploring their sexuality or their personal boundaries .
When you agree to act as a submissive , you give up responsibility for what 's going on ; you sit back and let things happen .
Provided you trust the person who 's being the dominant , you can mentally relax and concentrate on the role that 's being created for you .
As a dominant , the pleasure comes from constructing a scenario and acting it out .
You can , at least within reason , determine the submissive 's fate ; you 're the scriptwriter , director , and producer of the entire show ; you construct the fantasy world and make it real .
Being a good dominant is a lot of work .
You have to be creative ; you must be able to improvise ; and you have to pay attention to your submissive , to maintain the illusion you 're creating and make sure your submissive is getting what he or she wants from the scenario .
In many ways , the dominant person is a facilitator ; the dominant 's job is to make a fantasy that takes the submissive wherever he or she wants to go , and bring that fantasy to life .
For many people , BDSM is an intensely personal and meaningful experience , from either side .
I am both dominant and submissive - - a switch .
I am into BDSM because I want more .
I want more experience , I want more intensity ; I want to feel more , think more , experience more , be more .
I want to live life in immoderation , not moderation ; I want to experience intensity because I want to live intensely .
I surrender to another because I want to be taken to that place where reason and thought disappears , where the world folds up flat and spins away into its own corner and there 's nothing left but what I 'm feeling .
I take control of another because I want to take them to that place -- because when I become the orchestrator and the director of their world , when I can set the stage and write the script and make them , for a little while , become someone else , somewhere else , then I can feel what it is to wake the sleeping lion -- and that is heady stuff indeed .
On top of that , it 's very romantic .
What ?
Romantic ?
You 've got to be joking .
Nope .
See , that 's one of the things about BDSM that is n't obvious to someone on the outside .
When a dominant is creating a BDSM scenario , the dominant needs to focus his or her attention entirely on the submissive .
A good dominant pays very close attention to the submissive -- how the submissive is reacting , what 's going on around the submissive , what the submissive is feeling -- everything .
Having somebody pay that close attention to you does n't suck .
It 's very romantic .
So you 've got someone tied to the bed .
So what ?
It 's more than just tying someone to the bed .
The good stuff is n't in tying the knots ; it 's in what you are while you 're tying the knots .
Think of it as a game that 's two parts acting , two parts roleplaying , three parts sex , and two parts psychology .
Or , if you want , think of this :
There she ( or he , depending on who you are ) is , lying helpless beneath you , restrained hand and foot , blindfolded , and you have a feather in your hand ... and she 's very ticklish ... and she does n't ... know ...when...you're...going...to ...
Uh ...wait .
Blindfolded ?
Yeah !
That way , the submissive ( a ) can't tell what 's about to happen ( anticipation can be half the fun ) and ( b ) is made to focus more closely on what she 's ( or he 's ) feeling .
So , anyway , there she is , restrained hand and foot , and you get out the clothespins , and ...
Clothespins ?
Yes .
You use them to ... well , maybe we 'll get into that in the " How " section .
The point is : Just tying somebody up is boring .
The fun is in the stuff that goes with it .
When you 're restrained , you have this delicious feeling of helplessness , your lover free to do anything to your vulnerable body ... it 's fun !
( Incidentally , there 's more than one way to tie somebody up .
When most people think about bondage , they think of tying someone spreadeagle to the bed .
That 's a simple form of " restraint bondage " -- tying somebody to keep that person from moving .
Another form of bondage is " stimulation bondage " -- tying somebody up , not to keep that person from moving , but in a way that stimulates that person sexually .
For example , there is a form of rope harness called a " karada " which is typically tied around a woman in such a way that the ropes pass across her breasts , around her back , and up between her legs .
This form of bondage does not restrict motion at all - - in fact , you can wear it to work under your clothes !-- but every time she moves , the ropes shift across her breasts and between her legs , constantly stimulating her and reminding her that they are there . )
The same kind of fun can be had in bossing your lover around .
The fun part is n't that you can give orders ; anybody can be pushy .
The fun part is in the fact that your lover is compelled , within the limits of the game , to obey .
She must submit as you tell her to slowly - - no , more slowly - - peel off her clothes , and caress her own body as she tells you , Maestro , that she 'll do anything to make you happy ; then , as you direct , pick up the vibrator and ...
You get the idea .
These are some very tame scenarios , but they illustrate that there 's more going on than just tying somebody to your bed or bossing somebody around .
There 's an entire interaction here that 's highly sensual and very intense .
Okay , okay , so , what do you actually DO , anyway ?
Ah , now that 's the fun part .
That bit has been moved to its own page .
I ’m a big fan of Threadless and the seemingly infinite stream of hilarious t- shirts designs that are constantly being created by its dedicated community .
However , I have n’t been able to find many shirts designed specifically for photographers on the service .
Yesterday I tweeted a request for links to photography related t- shirt designs , and received quite a large number of interesting responses .
After looking through all the links tweeted in response , here are my favorites ( click the shirts to go to where they ’re sold ) :
# 1 : I Ca n’t Draw
One of the few photography - related t- shirts I was able to find on Threadless .
# 2 : Spray and Pray
Who cares what or how you shoot if you can put it through Photoshop it afterwards ?
# 3 : Beware of the Photographer
If you ’re not careful around me , you might get shot ( or Photoshopped ) .
# 4 : Camera Display Panel
A great shirt to confuse non-photogs .
See if you can trick people into believing they ’re all math symbols .
# 5 : Smile Baby
# 6 : Instant Pool Party
Threadless shirts are always top - notch .
# 7 : Flasher
Hmmm …
# 8 : Aperture
Another minimalistic design .
Maybe it ’s saying “ Shoot from ( or at ) the hip ” ?
# 9 : 18 % Grey
Amazing !
A shirt that doubles as a gray card …
# 10 : photographer ’s friend
Give this to your assistant and have him or her simply stand in for a picture .
# 11 : Photographer Grrl
# 12 : I Like To Flash People

I will design
May 13 , 2012
I 've been thinking , and for now my design philosophy will rest on " Designing things that you want in your closet , now . "
I mean conceptual stuff are pretty ( especially if the illustration is gorgeous ) , but that does n't always translate into nice irl , and sometimes these " normal " ready to wear designs do n't necessarily get a lot of attention , but I 'm going to keep in that direction and not waver .
More than just a dress that people would go " that would be so awesome for prom ! " or some special event things , I really want to design pieces that are versatile , that you see as a staple ( even though it 's not really a staple ) in your closet , that take
( CNN ) --
Any kid can dream up a roller coaster .
But those who visit a new exhibit at Walt Disney World 's Epcot theme park can actually take a ride on their fantasy creations .
An artist 's rendering of the " Sum of All Thrills " interactive ride , opening Wednesday at Disney World .
Epcot on Wednesday opened a new attraction called " Sum of All Thrills , " which lets kids use computer tablets to design a virtual roller coaster , bobsled track or plane ride .
After inputting their designs , kids climb into a robotic carriage that uses virtual - reality technology to help them experience the ride they 've created .
" This is really the next generation -- where there 's a lot more personalization involved " in the amusement - park experience , said Eric Goodman , Disney 's lead project manager on the ride .
This make - your - own - ride approach appears to be a growing trend in the world of amusement parks and museums .
Taking cues from the video game industry , park and ride designers have realized that people -- especially young ones -- want to interact with and even design their own thrill rides .
In addition to the new Epcot ride in Orlando , Florida , two Disney theme parks feature a ride called " Toy Story Mania , " which lets riders shoot at targets as they roll down the track and , in doing so , shape their own ride experience .
Another Disney attraction , CyberSpace Mountain , caters to adults and kids by letting them customize their own virtual ride from a menu of drops , loops and other features .
Universal Studios in Florida opened a roller coaster in August called the " Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit , " which lets people create their own personal musical soundtrack for their ride .
Interactive rides are in the " baby stages " so far , since roller coasters and theme - park attractions are so expensive to build , but interaction and personalization promise to be running themes in the industry , said Bob McTyre , president of Apogee Attractions , which has has helped design rides for Disney , Universal Studios and others .
McTyre was not involved in the new ride at Epcot .
He said theme park designers frequently bring up ideas such as roller coasters with three possible endings , allowing riders to choose which path to take .
But those big ideas quickly hit a roadblock : the high costs of implementing such a project , he said .
Shawn McCoy , vice - president of marketing and business development at Jack Rouse Associates , another amusement - park design firm , said this desire for interactivity in amusement parks takes its cues from video games .
" There 's also a definite need to compete with video games or the gaming industry -- where [ players ] have control over all of the elements , from the environment to the players ' movement , " he said , noting that museums and zoos also are taking notice of the trend .
The " Sum of All Thrills " ride at Epcot employs a robotic arm -- more commonly seen assembling cars at an auto plant -- to let kids experience their roller coaster creations .
Sitting in a carriage with their legs and arms outside the ride , kids watch a video version of their ride while the arm moves them from side to side and up and down to simulate the feeling of a real roller coaster .
Fans blow air at the riders at various speeds to give people the sensation that they 're moving forward .
Goodman , the Disney designer , said the robotic arm and carriage come " pretty darn close " to replicating the real roller coaster experience .
Kids design their experience on touch - screen computers , using a digital ruler and pre-selected track options to construct their rides .
If a person tries to build something physically impossible -- a hill that 's too steep for the cars to climb , for example -- then they 're asked to retool their ideas .
Disney hopes the interactive nature of the Epcot ride also helps kids learn that math and science can be fun .
" I think it 's really empowering for the kids to realize that the math does n't control them .
They get to control the math , " Goodman said .
The Raytheon Company , a maker of weapons and defense systems , said it sponsored the exhibit as a way to get middle - school aged kids more interested in careers in math and engineering .

How to Avoid Rape : An Article to Read & Pass On to Every Woman You Know
by www.SixWise.com
Someone is sexually assaulted in the U.S. every 2.5 minutes , according to the Rape , Abuse and Incest National Network ( RAINN ) .
And close to one in six women is raped at some point in her life , according to the U.S. Justice Department .
Knowing how to avoid becoming a victim , along with what to do if you are faced with the situation , is , sadly , something every woman needs to know .
Nearly one in six women is raped at some point in her life .
Please share the important preventive information in this article with your friends and loved ones !
If a woman feels threatened , only she can decide what is the best course of action to take in that moment , but research has identified certain strategies that seem to work better than others .
How to Avoid Becoming a Victim Anyone can become a victim of sexual assault or rape , but girls in their teens are particularly at risk -- with the age of 14 marking the peak risk age , according to the FBI .
Experts advise always staying in well - lit areas and being aware of your surroundings to discourage potential attackers .
Further : While You 're Out Don't leave your beverage unattended at a bar or party .
Do n't accept a drink from an open container .
Watch out for your friends if you 're at a party , and be sure to arrive and leave in a group .
Do n't go to an isolated area with someone you do n't know or trust .
When walking outside , walk facing traffic so a car cannot approach you unnoticed from behind .
Do n't take shortcuts you 're not familiar with or that are routed through dim , unpopulated areas .
If a motorist stops to ask you a question , keep walking and stay on the sidewalk .
Do n't approach the car .
Avoid areas that are filled with bushes , trees or shadows .
Stay out in the open , in well - lit , busy areas .
While Driving Keep your car doors locked and your windows rolled up when after dark .
When you approach your car in a parking lot , keep your keys in your hand , check to be sure no one is hiding inside the car , then lock the doors as soon as you get in .
Do n't pick up hitchhikers or stranded motorists .
If you 're in a traffic accident , do n't get out of your car or open the window to talk to the other motorist .
Stay inside and wait for the police to arrive .
Some rapists have impersonated police officers pulling over vehicles .
If you are pulled over by an unmarked car at night while you 're alone , only pull over in a well - lit area where other people are present .
A real police officer will understand your concern .
At Work Avoid stairwells and rarely used hallways .
Do n't get into an elevator alone with anyone who seems suspicious .
Trust your instincts on this .
When on an elevator , stand near the control panel so you can push the alarm button in an emergency .
When waiting for an elevator , stand away from the door so you can't be pulled on .
Call someone at home to let him or her know when you 're leaving work at night , and when to expect you home .
If after dark , ask a security guard or colleague to walk with you to your car / public transportation .
On Public Transportation
Always stay alert ; do n't sleep or drift off on the bus or subway .
Take a seat close to the driver .
If someone seems suspicious , move away from the person to a seat closer to the driver or to another car .
Choose subway cars that are full of people .
Arrange for someone to meet you at your destination to walk or drive you home .
Crimes of this nature can also take place at a residence , and , among women victims of rape and sexual assault , 70 percent of the crimes were committed by intimates , relatives , friends or acquaintances , according to the U.S. Justice Department .
" There 's strong evidence that fighting , screaming and trying to flee are effective , " says Sarah Ullman , Ph.D. , an associate professor of criminal justice at the University of Illinois at Chicago .
What to do if You are Raped No matter how cautious you are , a rape or sexual assault can still happen .
Again , a woman who is faced with this crisis is the only one who can decide what is the best action to take , but the following strategies may be effective .
If you are attacked , yell , scream , hit and kick , and otherwise do anything you can to get away .
Doing so may startle the attacker and may cause him to loosen his grip so you can run away .
" There 's strong evidence that fighting , screaming and trying to flee are effective , " says Sarah Ullman , Ph.D. , an associate professor of criminal justice at the University of Illinois at Chicago .
Fight back if the attacker does n't let go .
In 2003 , the Justice Department reported that weapons were present in rapes and sexual assaults only 11 percent of the time .
If the attacker does have a weapon , you will have to decide what is the best approach to save your life .
Pleading with the attacker may not be the best choice , however .
" Research shows that pleading and reasoning lead to an even higher probability of rape , " says Ullman .
Many rapists thrive on feeling powerful , and a victim 's pleading can feed this need .
What you can do is scream for help , yell " NO " and , if you can get away , run to a well - lit , populated area .
If a Rape has Taken Place According to the Justice Department , rapes go unreported at varying levels , depending on who the attacker is .
An eight - year study found that when an attacker is : A current or former husband or boyfriend , rapes go unreported to the police 77 percent of the time .
A friend or acquaintance , rapes go unreported 61 percent of the time .
A stranger , rapes go unreported 54 percent of the time .
Though you may feel embarrassed , reporting the rape and seeking medical attention are very important .
Once you are in a safe place , call a friend , family member or spouse for support .
Then :
Do not bathe , brush your teeth or wash in any way .
This could remove evidence that 's needed to find the attacker .
Seek medical attention immediately .
Call the police to report the crime .
You may wish to write down details of the attacker 's appearance and what took place during the attack so you do n't forget .
Remember that the crime was not your fault .
Talk to a counselor , rape crisis center or social services agency in your area .
Emotions from this type of crisis can remain for months or many years , so do n't hesitate to seek help even if a lot of time has passed since the crime .
RAINN operates a National Sexual Assault Hotline that can be called 24 hours a day at 1-800 - 656 - HOPE ( 4673 ) .
You can also search online for a counseling center near you .

Late last year I had to pleasure of interviewing Danny , Marieke and Erwin of Experimental Jetset .
Founded in 1997 and based in Amsterdam , Experimental Jetset is one of the most exciting and highly regarded studios working today .
They create exceptionally beautiful work ; immediately recognizable for its top notch quality and unique remixing of modernist principles and stylings .
Their global renown continues to soar– most recently thanks to their part in Helvetica and the extreme popularity of their ( now re-released ) John &Paul & Ringo & George shirts .
A quick perusal of their website can easily turn into hours as you browse through their catalog of work and read their comprehensive descriptions of each project .
In these descriptions , and especially in interviews , the depth of their reflection is astounding .
They take great care to consider every perspective — whether it be a report of one of their own projects , or an answer to a seemingly basic interview prompt — their ability to discuss Design and work is as remarkable as it is fascinating .
What follows is our discussion from November 2009 .
Enjoy !
I have always loved your name , Experimental Jetset .
I know the origin to be a Sonic Youth album , but I ’m curious how your opinions and conception of the name may have evolved over the last 11 years .
It ’s funny , when you choose a name , as a studio , you have no idea you ’ll be stuck with that name for the rest of your career .
And while you are evolving , as a studio , the name remains the same .
So yeah , it ’s an interesting question .
Indeed , the relationship between a studio and its name is a constantly shifting one .
First you love your name , then you hate it , and then you realize you better embrace it .
Then there are times that your name seems to exist completely independent from yourself : whenever we read the name ‘ Experimental Jetset ’ , it usually takes us a while to realize people are actually writing about us .
It sometimes feels like a completely different entity , something that exists almost separately from us .
Sonic
Youth has always been one of our favourite bands , so we ’re still very happy that our name specifically refers to them .
At the same time , we realize that the ‘ Jetset ’ - part in our name might come across as a bit tacky , in a sort of ‘ lounge lizard ’ way .
But then again , there is something to be said for tacky , silly names .
Think of the name ‘ the Beatles ’ : an extremely silly wordplay , in no way describing what the band later grew into .
Or ‘ the Beach Boys ’ : great name for a mediocre surfband , but not really fitting for Brian Wilson ’s brilliance .
But at the same time , these names are excellent , exactly because they reveal the beginnings of these bands .
It ties these bands to their roots , which is great , we think .
Likewise , the name ‘ Experimental Jetset ’ says something about our own beginnings , whether we like it or not .
What are some of your favorite names of other companies ( within the field or not ) ?
Given your answers , what do you think it is that makes for a good name ?
Well , ‘ Total Design ’ is the first name that springs to mind .
In many ways , it ’s the ultimate studio name , is n’t it ?
It ’s so brutal , so merciless …
It would be impossible to pull off a name like that in this current era .
In general , people have become a bit too squeamish to handle such an absolute , authoritarian gesture , we guess .
As for contemporary names , we really like ‘ A Practice for Everyday Life ’ .
It ’s so smart to use your studio name as a semantic bridge between the ideas of Michel de Certeau and the practice of graphic design .
What we also really like is the fact that the acronym is a word in itself : APFEL , which is German for apple .
And what ’s cooler than an apple ?
Some of our former students just started a studio called ‘ Our Polite Society ’ , which we think is a very good name as well .
And we recently came across a studio called ‘ The Luxury of Protest ’ , which is also quite cool .
There are actually loads of very interesting names .
‘ The Designers Republic ’ , ‘ Graphic Thought Facility ’ , ‘ Life of the Mind ’ …
It ’s impossible to mention them all .
It ’s actually a very good subject you brought up .
In ‘ The Arcades Project ’ , Walter Benjamin wrote that “ through its street names , the city is a linguistic cosmos ” .
So maybe we can regard graphic design as a sort of cityscape as well , as a linguistic cosmos of studio names .
We very much like this idea .
Khoi
Vinh wrote an article not too long ago about the state of honest criticism in design .
At one point in the article he asks , “ are we really having the kinds of meaningful , constructive , critical discourses that we really should be having ? ”
I ’m curious to hear your thoughts on this issue .
Do you find there is a dearth of honest and effective design critique happening in the field ?
How does your studio approach criticism when it comes to your own projects ?
This theme , of criticism and graphic design , is a subject that we find very interesting .
Although , we have to admit , the way we approach it is quite different from the approach you suggest in your question .
We ’re much more interested graphic design AS criticism : the idea that a piece of graphic design is a manifestation of a certain way of thinking , a certain way of ordering the world , and that , by functioning in that way , that piece of graphic design is effectively critiquing the dominant way of thinking , the existing way of ordering the world .
Or , in a similar way , we also very much like the fact that two different posters , hanging next to each other in the street , are in fact critiques of each other .
To refer again to ‘ The Arcades Project ’ : at a certain point , Walter Benjamin describes the flaneur , walking around in Paris , being confronted by the posters , signs and slogans in the streets of the city : “ Under these conditions , even a sentence ( to say nothing of the single word ) puts on a face , and this face resembles that of the sentence standing next to it .
In this way , every truth points manifestly to its opposite .
Truth becomes something living ; it lives solely in the rhythm by which statement and counter - statement displace each other in order to think each other ” .
So that is the sort of critical discourse that we find most interesting : the dialectical exchange that exists between designed objects .
We ’re much less interested in this whole sphere of graphic designers publicly criticizing and attacking each other on weblogs and forums .
In a way , we even think that this brand of online peer - to - peer criticizing might be hurtful to what we see as the true critical potential of graphic design .
In our view , aesthetic languages should contrast as sharply as possible .
Two posters , hanging next to each other in the street , should be as different from each other as possible : the viewer should resolve the tension between these two posters him - or herself .
The tension should not be prematurely resolved in online forums , in discussions between designers ; it should be resolved in the head of the viewer , by a ‘ third party ’ , so to speak .
Only then , to speak with Benjamin , “ truth becomes something living ” .
We understand this probably sounds pretty abstract ; it ’s hard for us to explain it in a better way .
But we can give a very personal example .
We grew up in Dutch cities like Amsterdam and Rotterdam .
We can still vividly remember the contrasting aesthetic languages that were surrounding us towards the end of the 70s , in our pre-teenage years .
On the one hand , buildings were carrying signs designed by typical ‘ late - modernist ’ design groups such a Total Design .
Those same buildings also carried punk graffiti , band names , anarchist signs .
Precisely because these two languages contrasted so sharply , they collapsed in our heads , and we were able to formulate a ‘ third position ’ , a sort of synthesis of two opposing languages .
And it is this synthesis that became the foundation of our own graphic language today .
Now , imagine that the ‘ late - modernist ’ designers , and the anarcho - punks , would have resolved that tension already for us , in some kind of premature discussion …
Where would that leave us ?
There would have been no tension for us to solve , no synthesis to strive for .
There would have been no room for movement at all .
We think this kind of online peer - to - peer criticism is counterproductive on a very practical level as well .
In our view , what this whole subculture of small , independent studios really needs is a sense of solidarity .
It could do with less bickering , less backstabbing .
We think this whole international scene of small studios is really special , and we should try to protect it as much as possible .
The independent studio is pretty much a threatened species .
The catastrophic influence from branding - , marketing - and PR - people becomes more and more visible every day .
Large advertising conglomerates are taking over the kind of territory that was usually covered by smaller , more cultural studios .
The world has gone mad , and even the smallest client suddenly wants to work with pitches and competitions , because they believe this is the way it should be .
We really think that , in the middle of all madness , we should stick together .
We should use our combined energy to defend this whole subculture of small studios .
We should n’t be putting energy in complaining about each others work .
“ I would have kerned this logo in a completely different way ” … well , of course you would have kerned it in a completely different way .
But what ’s the point moaning about that in public ?
We all have different graphic languages ; that ’s the beauty of it .
Why spend so much energy on what are basically small stylistic differences ?
We did enjoy Khoi Vinh ’s article a lot though .
It ’s interesting to notice how people perceive things in completely different ways .
At a certain point , he writes that “ it ’s not hard , in design , to reside in a frictionless environment ” .
We could n’t disagree more .
In our own day - to - day practice , design pretty much equals friction .
As a studio , you constantly have to expose your work , protect it , defend it , alter it , repair it .
You have to deal with clients , curators , editors , printers , etc. , and on top of that , you have to deal with a design industry that can be quite hostile towards smaller studios .
It ’s pretty much an uphill battle .
So the last thing you need are your peers , attacking you from behind .
It ’s also interesting how Khoi Vinh , elsewhere in his essay , makes the connection between criticism and honesty .
While , in our personal experience , there is a really strong link between criticism and dishonesty .
A lot of the people who have publicly attacked us ( calling us lazy , cynical , false , nihilistic , whatnot ) , have later contacted us , to ask us if we wanted to contribute to their design book or little art project , or if they could drop by at our studio , to visit us .
In their mails , some even described themselves as “ big admirers ” of our work .
This phenomenon has always struck us as very bizarre .
Publicly they attack you , but privately they admire you .
To us , it shows that criticism is often a pose , a facade .
It ’s certainly not always honest .
The above remarks refer pretty much to peer - to - peer criticism .
The professional critics , well , that ’s a whole other can of worms .
Do n’t get us started on that .
For now , it might be enough to quote Brecht , who described critics brilliantly : “ They are , to put it bluntly , enemies of production .
Production makes them uncomfortable ( …)
They want to play the apparatchik , and exercise control over other people .
Every one of their criticisms contains a threat ” .
Visitors to your portfolio are immediately confronted by not only a massive amount of work , but also in - depth descriptions about each project .
What was the rationale behind this , as you say , “ neurotic description of everything ” ?
Personally I am all for it , but I wonder if you could elaborate on your opinion of this style of description - driven portfolio .
You know how people sometimes say that “ the work should speak for itself ” ?
We never really bought that phrase .
The point is , we are quite traditional , old - school graphic designers .
We design objects to function within very specific contexts .
So the moment you present those objects within a totally different context , as flat digital images on a website , it ’s only logical that you need some words to at least sketch the original context .
Added to that , we really enjoy ‘ background information ’ .
We love reading about artists and their methods , watching documentaries about the making of movies , listening to writers being interviewed on the radio .
We like the idea that behind every artifact , behind every designed object or piece of art , there is a complete universe of ideas , references , stories .
So we like to add to this ‘ background genre ’ by creating , on the internet , a small hidden gateway to our own micro-universe .
We are not saying that everybody should read it , or like it ; on the contrary , we really created our archive for the small group of people really interested in it .
We were recently reading ‘ Tropical Truth ‘ , the autobiography of Brazilian singer / songwriter Caetano Veloso .
At a certain point , he explains a couple of his songs .
Now , these are songs that we already loved , even though we could n’t understand the Portuguese lyrics .
These songs were already ‘ speaking for themselves ’ , as it were .
But in his book , Caetano explains these songs , line by line , and shows all the references , all the symbolism , all the hidden meanings .
And we love that .
It shows that things that are already speaking for themselves , can still contain all these references , all these ideas .
And even though you ca n’t understand them , you can still sense them .
It ’s pretty much like a meal .
Even though you sometimes can’t really recognize the exact ingredients , you can still taste them .
After the meal , you can choose to read the recipe , or not .
But either way , the meal ‘ spoke for itself ’ .
( Semi-related to above ) How would you regard image bookmarking sites like FFFOUND or Dropular , where any semblance of illuminating description or backstory or is completely absent ?
In what way are these sites valuable and / or harmful to the profession ?
We actually love sites such as FFFFound and Dropular .
We consider the way in which we show our own designs , on our own website , as just one out of many possible ways .
We also find it quite interesting to see those designs completely decontextualized , almost disembodied , as part of a long string of unexpected associations , as happens on FFFFound .
We once read an interview in which Thurston Moore ( of Sonic Youth ) described the sensation of being featured in heavy metal magazines : “ it feels like being shot into a pinball machine ” .
That ’s also pretty much the feeling we have , being featured on sites such as FFFFound .
Now that we think of it , maybe a website such as FFFFound , by staging such an ongoing , dialectical exchange between opposing aesthetic languages , has a larger critical potential than all those weblogs and forums where designers are complaining about each other ’s work together .
What was one of the most valuable lessons you learned at Gerrit Rietveld ?
What advice might you have for current students looking to get the most out of their design program ?
It ’s not really a tactic or strategy , just an observation : a lot of the things we learned at the Gerrit Rietveld Academy only made sense after we graduated .
We were late - bloomers , we guess .
It took a while to let it all sink in .
Also , in retrospect we have to admit that we were pretty mediocre students .
It was only after graduation that everything clicked , that it all made sense .
Apart from being students , we also have been teachers at the Rietveld Academy , between 2000 and 2009 .
As teachers , we have seen all kinds of students .
Mediocre students , who turned out to be late - bloomers , and became brilliant designers long after graduation .
But also brilliant students , who just peaked too early , and burned out even before graduation .
It ’s not a general rule or something : we have also seen brilliant students who turned into brilliant designers .
But the point that we are trying to make is that every person develops in a different way .
The way a person is as a student does n’t necessarily predicts the sort of designer he / she will be after school .
So let ’s hear it for the late - bloomers !
How often do you travel ?
Any locations that are currently most appealing and / or inspiring to you ?
Last year , we travelled quite a lot .
Peru , New Zealand , Ireland .
And we visited the US a couple of times : Miami , Minneapolis , New York , etc .
All these trips were related to either lectures or workshops .
While , as a matter of fact , we are not really good public speakers at all .
We feel really uncertain about doing lectures .
So it ’s a weird trade - off : you go through one hour of pure hell , and in exchange you get to travel , you visit exotic places , and meet friendly people .
People ask us to do lectures quite a lot , and in most cases we have to turn down those requests .
It just takes up so much energy , to write and prepare a lecture .
We are extremely nervous weeks before the lecture , and we feel very embarrassed weeks after the lecture .
It also takes up too much time ; we cannot afford to spend all our time travelling , while we actually should be in the studio , working .
It can be also quite expensive : obviously , your flight and hotel are being paid for , but there are always lots of other expenses , especially if you want to stay a couple of days longer , which we usually do .
So yeah , in general we turn down a lot of requests .
But sometimes people approach us at just the right time , and in those cases we accept the invitation .
There is n’t really a logic to it : sometimes we accept the invitation , sometimes not .
It ’s all a matter of timing and luck , actually .
A recent lecture we did in Minneapolis , at the fabulous Walker Art Center , can actually be seen online .
( As you might notice , we were incomplete during this lecture .
This movie shows only two - third of Experimental Jetset .
Erwin managed to escape ) .
Anyway , to get back to your question .
We really like Los Angeles .
Driving around in the hills , looking at the bizarre houses , listening to KXLU on the radio , looking at record sleeves at Amoeba , browsing through zines and books at Ooga Booga and Family , eating incredible good vegetarian food , seeing bands at The Smell , not to mention the beautiful weather .
It ’s relaxing just to think about it .

This post is exactly what the title says .
All the early Actions without Superman on the cover .
The later ones have him in the inset , but do n't feature him .
These are both awesome and kind of weird , because Superman turned out to be such a big deal and they did n't initially realize what kind of a phenomenon they had on their hands .

The mini ice age starts here
The bitter winter afflicting much of the Northern Hemisphere is only the start of a global trend towards cooler weather that is likely to last for 20 or 30 years , say some of the world ’s most eminent climate scientists .
Their predictions – based on an analysis of natural cycles in water temperatures in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans – challenge some of the global warming orthodoxy ’s most deeply cherished beliefs , such as the claim that the North Pole will be free of ice in
summer by 2013 .
According to the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre in Colorado , Arctic summer sea ice has increased by 409,000 square miles , or 26 per cent , since 2007 – and even the most committed global warming activists do not dispute this .
The scientists ’ predictions also undermine the standard climate computer models , which assert that the warming of the Earth since 1900 has been driven solely by man-made greenhouse gas emissions and will continue as long as carbon dioxide levels rise .
They say that their research shows that much of the warming was caused by oceanic cycles when they were in a ‘ warm mode ’ as opposed to the present ‘ cold mode ’ .
This challenge to the widespread view that the planet is on the brink of an irreversible catastrophe is all the greater because the scientists could never be described as global warming ‘ deniers ’ or sceptics .
However , both main British political parties continue to insist that the world is facing imminent disaster without drastic cuts in CO2 .
This image of the UK taken from NASA 's multi-national Terra satellite on Thursday shows the extent of the freezing weather
Last week , as Britain froze , Climate Change Secretary Ed Miliband maintained in a parliamentary answer that the science of global warming was ‘ settled ’ .
Among the most prominent of the scientists is Professor Mojib Latif , a leading member of the UN ’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , which has been pushing the issue of man-made global warming on to the international political agenda since it was formed 22 years ago .
Prof Latif , who leads a research team at the renowned Leibniz Institute at Germany ’s Kiel University , has developed new methods for measuring ocean temperatures 3,000ft beneath the surface , where the cooling and warming cycles start .
He and his colleagues predicted the new cooling trend in a paper published in 2008 and warned of it again at an IPCC conference in Geneva last September .
Last night he told The Mail on Sunday : ‘ A significant share of the warming we saw from 1980 to 2000 and at earlier periods in the 20th Century was due to these cycles – perhaps as much as 50 per cent .
' They have now gone into reverse , so winters like this one will become much more likely .
Summers will also probably be cooler , and all this may well last two decades or longer .
‘ The extreme retreats that we have seen in glaciers and sea ice will come to a halt .
For the time being , global warming has paused , and there may well be some cooling . ’
As Europe , Asia and North America froze last week , conventional wisdom insisted that this was merely a ‘ blip ’ of no long - term significance .
Though record lows were experienced as far south as Cuba , where the daily maximum on beaches normally used for winter bathing was just 4.5C , the BBC assured viewers that the big chill was merely short - term ‘ weather ’ that had nothing to do with ‘ climate ’ , which was still warming .
The work of Prof Latif and the other scientists refutes that view .
On the one hand , it is true that the current freeze is the product of the ‘ Arctic oscillation ’ – a weather pattern that sees the development of huge ‘ blocking ’ areas of high pressure in northern latitudes , driving polar winds far to the south .
Meteorologists say that this is at its strongest for at least 60 years .
As a result , the jetstream – the high - altitude wind that circles the globe from west to east and normally pushes a series of wet but mild Atlantic lows across Britain – is currently running not over the English Channel but the Strait of Gibraltar .

However , according to Prof Latif and his colleagues , this in turn relates to much longer - term shifts – what are known as the Pacific and Atlantic ‘ multi- decadal oscillations ’ ( MDOs ) .
For Europe , the crucial factor here is the temperature of the water in the middle of the North Atlantic , now several degrees below its average when the world was still warming .
But the effects are not confined to the Northern Hemisphere .
Prof Anastasios Tsonis , head of the University of Wisconsin Atmospheric Sciences Group , has recently shown that these MDOs move together in a synchronised way across the globe , abruptly flipping the world ’s climate from a ‘ warm mode ’ to a ‘ cold mode ’ and back again in 20 to 30 - year cycles .
' They amount to massive rearrangements in the dominant patterns of the weather , ’ he said yesterday , ‘ and their shifts explain all the major changes in world temperatures during the 20th and 21st Centuries .
' We have such a change now and can therefore expect 20 or 30 years of cooler temperatures . ’
Prof Tsonis said that the period from 1915 to 1940 saw a strong warm mode , reflected in rising temperatures .
Pictures of the snow in Tiananmen Square in Beijing , China , last week show the city is the coldest it has been since 1970
But from 1940 until the late Seventies , the last MDO cold - mode era , the world cooled , despite the fact that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere continued to rise .
Many of the consequences of the recent warm mode were also observed 90 years ago .
For example , in 1922 , the Washington Post reported that Greenland ’s glaciers were fast disappearing , while Arctic seals were ‘ finding the water too hot ’ .
It interviewed a Captain Martin Ingebrigsten , who had been sailing the eastern Arctic for 54 years :
‘ He says that he first noted warmer conditions in 1918 , and since that time it has gotten steadily warmer .
' Where formerly great masses of ice were found , there are now moraines , accumulations of earth and stones .
At many points where glaciers formerly extended into the sea they have entirely disappeared . ’
As a result , the shoals of fish that used to live in these waters had vanished , while the sea ice beyond the north coast of Spitsbergen in the Arctic Ocean had melted .
Warm Gulf Stream water was still detectable within a few hundred miles of the Pole .
In contrast , Prof Tsonis said , last week 56 per cent of the surface of the United States was covered by snow .
‘ That has n’t happened for several decades , ’ he pointed out .
‘ It just is n’t true to say this is a blip .
We can expect colder winters for quite a while . ’
He recalled that towards the end of the last cold mode , the world ’s media were preoccupied by fears of freezing .
For example , in 1974 , a Time magazine cover story predicted ‘ Another Ice Age ’ , saying : ‘ Man may be somewhat responsible – as a result of farming and fuel burning [ which is ] blocking more and more sunlight from reaching and heating the Earth . ’
Prof Tsonis said : ‘ Perhaps we will see talk of an ice age again by the early 2030s , just as the MDOs shift once more and temperatures begin to rise . ’
Like Prof Latif , Prof Tsonis is not a climate change ‘ denier ’ .
There is , he said , a measure of additional ‘ background ’ warming due to human activity and greenhouse gases that runs across the MDO cycles .
' This is n't just a blip .
We can expect colder winters for quite a while '
But he added : ‘ I do not believe in catastrophe theories .
Man -made warming is balanced by the natural cycles , and I do not trust the computer models which state that if CO2 reaches a particular level then temperatures and sea levels will rise by a given amount .
' These models can not be trusted to predict the weather for a week , yet they are running them to give readings for 100 years . ’
Prof Tsonis said that when he published his work in the highly respected journal Geophysical Research Letters , he was deluged with ‘ hate emails ’ .
He added : ‘ People were accusing me of wanting to destroy the climate , yet all I ’m interested in is the truth . ’
He said he also received hate mail from climate change sceptics , accusing him of not going far enough to attack the theory of man-made warming .
The work of Profs Latif , Tsonis and their teams raises a crucial question :
If some of the late 20th Century warming was caused not by carbon dioxide but by MDOs , then how much ?
Tsonis did not give a figure ; Latif suggested it could be anything between ten and 50 per cent .
Other critics of the warming orthodoxy say the role played by MDOs is even greater .
William Gray , emeritus Professor of Atmospheric Sciences at Colorado State University , said that while he believed there had been some background rise caused by greenhouse gases , the computer models used by advocates of man-made warming had hugely exaggerated their effect .
Dr David Viner stands by his claim that snow will become an ' increasingly rare event '
According to Prof Gray , these distort the way the atmosphere works .
‘ Most of the rise in temperature from the Seventies to the Nineties was natural , ’ he said .
‘ Very little was down to CO2 – in my view , as little as five to ten per cent . ’
But last week , die - hard warming advocates were refusing to admit that MDOs were having any impact .
In March 2000 , Dr David Viner , then a member of the University of East Anglia Climatic Research Unit , the body now being investigated over the notorious ‘ Warmergate ’ leaked emails , said that within a few years snowfall would become ‘ a very rare and exciting event ’ in Britain , and that ‘ children just are n’t going to know what snow is ’ .
Now the head of a British Council programme with an annual £ 10 million budget that raises awareness of global warming among young people abroad , Dr Viner last week said he still stood by that prediction : ‘ We ’ve had three weeks of relatively cold weather , and that does n’t change anything .
' This winter is just a little cooler than average , and I still think that snow will become an increasingly rare event . ’
The longer the cold spell lasts , the harder it may be to persuade the public of that assertion .
Grant Desme hit 31 home runs and stole 40 bases in Class A last season , and as an encore , he was named most valuable player of the Arizona Fall League .
The Oakland Athletics had plans to invite Desme , a 23 - year - old outfielder , to spring training next month .
But Desme retired Friday to become a Roman Catholic priest .
In a conference call with reporters , he said he would join St. Michael ’s Abbey in Silverado , Calif. , this August .
“ I love the game , but I ’m going to aspire to higher things , ” Desme said .
“ I know I have no regrets . ”
Desme , a second - round pick in the 2007 draft , told Oakland General Manager Billy Beane of his decision Friday and said Beane was supportive .
Desme said his breakout season in 2009 had left him unfulfilled and confirmed his uneasy feelings about continuing with baseball .
Long - term variations in volcanism help explain the birth , evolution and death of striking geological features called oceanic core complexes on the ocean floor , says geologist Dr Bram Murton of the National Oceanography Centre , Southampton .
Oceanic core complexes are associated with faults along slow - spreading mid-ocean ridges .
They are large elevated massifs with flat or gently curved upper surfaces and prominent corrugations called ' megamullions ' .
Uplifting during their formation causes exposure of lower crust and mantle rocks on the seafloor .
Murton was member of a scientific team that in 2007 sailed to the mid Atlantic Ridge aboard the royal research ship RRS James Cook to study the Earth 's crust below the ocean .
" We wanted to know why some faults develop into core complexes , whereas others do n't , " he says .
" It had been suggested that core complexes form during periods of reduced magma supply from volcanism , but exactly how this would interact with the tectonic forces that deform the Earth 's crust was unclear . "
Using the deep - towed vehicle TOBI equipped with sophisticated sonar equipment for profiling the deep seafloor , Murton and his colleagues discovered three domed and corrugated massifs , from which they dredged and drilled rock samples .
" These massifs turned out to be oceanic core complexes at different stages of a common life cycle , " says Murton .
" By comparing them we are able to get a much better understanding of the birth , evolution and death of these fascinating geological features . "
It turns out that there is indeed a close link between core complex formation and long - term variations in magma supply .
" Core complex development may take a million years or so and is associated with suppressed or absent volcanism , " says Murton .
Faults that initiate core complex formation start off pretty much like normal faults around them .
But in the absence of sufficient magma , the two sides of the fault continue to slip , and this slippage is further lubricated by seawater penetration and talc formation along the fault zones , leading to deep and large off - set faulting .
However , renewed volcanism can increase the supply of magma , overwhelming the fault .
" We believe that renewed or increased volcanism is what eventually terminates the process of core complex formation . " says Murton .
The researchers are Chris MacLeod ( Cardiff University ) , Roger Searle ( Durham University ) , Bramley Murton ( NOCS ) , John Casey ( University of Houston ) , Chris Mallows ( Durham University ) , Samantha Unsworth ( NOCS ) , Kay Achenbach ( Durham University ) and Michelle Harris ( NOCS ) .
Attempting to make good on his pledge to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in the U.S. and other nations ’ defense postures , and eventually eliminate them , President Barack Obama seems on the verge of reaching a new strategic arms reduction agreement with Russia .
If such an accord is reached , Obama is to be commended .
But more needs to be done .
After the Cold War ended , the public largely forgot about the only " existential threat " – a threat to the nation ’s very existence – that the United States has ever faced in its history .
Not even a victory by the Nazis in Europe and / or the Imperial Japanese in Asia during World War II would have threatened an America protected from the world ’s major flashpoints by two vast oceanic moats .
And although the young and weak United States , under President James Madison , foolishly declared war on the British naval superpower and had its capital city burned , America probably would have survived even the loss of this pointless war .
After all , Washington was n’t as important to a then - decentralized country as it is now , and the British did not have enough forces to occupy and control all of the vast American territory .
Nowadays , American governments do worry about unfriendly , poor countries – such as Iran and North Korea – getting a few nuclear weapons .
Even if these nations had effective missile systems that could deliver a small number of warheads to the faraway United States and somehow were not deterred from launching such an attack by the overwhelmingly superior U.S. nuclear arsenal , the results would be horrendous to the U.S. targets struck but would not be a threat to the existence of America .
Similarly , if those countries gave or sold a nuclear device to a terror group , or if the terrorists were able to steal or build one , the use of it in any of these scenarios would not result in existential destruction .
Despite its recession from the headlines , the Soviet Union and now Russia has been and still is the only country to have enough nuclear warheads to pose such a cataclysmic threat to the U.S. homeland .
To his credit , despite only a minimal chance of making political hay from working on a problem that American and world public opinion think has been solved , Obama is on the verge of signing a replacement for the just - expired Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty of 1991 that would cut U.S. and Russian deployed strategic nuclear arsenals by about a quarter from 2,200 to 1,600 warheads apiece .
The new treaty would also limit each side ’s strategic bombers and sea- and land - based missiles to 800 , a reduction from the current ceiling of 1,600 .
And if he can nail down this agreement , Obama wants to try to cut warhead totals to 1,000 on each side .
Of course , if Russia and the United States could successfully negotiate cuts down to this level , they then would need to bring in the lesser nuclear powers of Britain , France , and China to go farther .
Smaller strategic arsenals would be easier to protect and thus provide fewer opportunities for terrorist groups to steal warheads – making a low - probability event even lower .
A reduced U.S. stockpile of nuclear warheads would also obviate the need to build a new generation of nuclear warheads .
Instead , current warhead designs could be refurbished and reused .
Finally , the United States could scrap at least one leg of the bomber and air - and sea - based missile " triad , " which has long been nuclear overkill after the Cold War ended .
The U.S. could start by eliminating the ever vulnerable land - based intercontinental ballistic missiles and warheads in ground silos .
Finally , all such cuts of warheads and delivery systems would cut the cost of storage , personnel , operations , and maintenance – money that could be used to reduce the $ 1 trillion deficits that the Bush and Obama administrations have given us .
In short , if a new START agreement is reached , Obama should be given credit for toiling in the shadows on an issue that is no longer glamorous but still has the potential to catastrophically affect America and the world .
Caracas , January 26th 2010 ( FOCUS News Agency ) – President Hugo Chavez on Monday said that Petrocaribe , Venezuela 's cut -rate regional energy alliance , will forgive quake - stricken Haiti 's debt , AFP reported .
Haiti's debt with Venezuela is USD 295 million , about one - third of its global foreign debt of USD 1 billion , according to International Monetary Fund figures .
" Haiti has no debt with Venezuela -- on the contrary , it is Venezuela that has a historic debt with Haiti , " Chavez said as he made the announcement .
Chavez was referring to the support that Haiti -- which obtained its independence from France in 1804 -- gave Venezuelan independence leader Simon Bolivar in 1815 and 1816 in his quest to free his country from Spanish colonial rule .
Chavez made the announcement at the closing ceremony of a meeting of foreign ministers from leftist countries with the ALBA trade alliance , a Cuba and Venezuela - supported regional common market founded in 2004 .
Petrocaribe provides preferential oil pricing for its Caribbean members , with Venezuela picking up 40 % of the cost if oil is selling over USD 50 a barrel .
When oil prices are above USD 50 , member states will have up to 25 years to pay the bulk of the debt at a one percent interest rate , with two years grace .
Haiti , struggling to recover from the January 12 devastating 7.0 earthquake , received in the past days 225,000 barrels of Petrocaribe oil sent through the neighboring Dominican Republic .
Both Haiti and the Dominican Republic are Petrocaribe members .
Other Petrocaribe members include Antigua and Barbuda , Barbados , Bahamas , Belize , Cuba , Dominica , El Salvador , Grenada , Guatemala , Guyana , Honduras , Jamaica , Nicaragua , St Kitts - Nevis , Saint Lucia , St Vincent and the Grenadines , Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago , as well as founding member Venezuela .
Separately , ALBA foreign ministers approved an aid package for Haiti that includes sanitary , energy , financial and educational assistance .
The ministers also expressed their concern over the " excessive foreign military presence " in the Caribbean nation , with no clear parameters over its " authority , purpose , role and length of stay . "
Their presence " threatens to further complicate conditions on the ground and ... international cooperation " for Haitian reconstruction , the ministers said .
They called on United Nations to take a central role in coordinating emergency efforts , and emphasized that the Haitians must take the lead in their country 's reconstruction .

The dust is still settling from Copenhagen , and the reactions that I ’ve seen so far have been muted .
But the consensus is that it was something between a disaster and a face - saving attempt to achieve the smallest measure of progress possible .
One item that has begun to be reported , but not gotten much attention is how in a dramatic gesture , President Obama himself salvaged what of the agreement there is by breaking into a secret meeting organized by China with a few emerging countries to develop their own local non-binding goals instead of working with the world community .
Some environmental activists havetried to spread out the blame around – as Rick Patel of Avaaz wrote in an email :
Big polluters like China and the US wanted a weak deal , and potential champions like Europe , Brazil and South Africa did n’t fight hard enough to stop them .
Interestingly , this breakdown conforms almost exactly to what critics of the Copenhagen summit such as Charles Krauthammer would predict – as they see these efforts to combat global warming as a giant socialist conspiracy to “ raid [ … ] the Western treasuries ” by imposing “ taxes on hardworking citizens of the democracies to fill the treasuries of Third World kleptocracies ” with “ a dose of post - colonial reparations thrown in . ”
But the opposing sides were n’t the simplistic ones outlined by either Krauthammer or Patel .
The principles at stake were n’t simply big polluters versus small polluters or the proponents of global socialism versus its opponents .
Instead , Copenhagen was about whether or not there could be collective action and global governance in the face of a global crisis – or whether each nation would act on its own .
When Obama along with most other world leaders arrived at the end of the conference , the final details were supposed to come together quickly as the principals gathered in the same rooms and made the deals they needed to .
Which is why despite grumbling before the conference about America ’s inability to pass legislation to combat climate change * and the concerns of poorer countries about being restrained from development , the blame has settled on China for scuttling the talks .
As the Guardian reported :
The Chinese prime minister , Wen Jiabao , walked out of the conference at one point , and sent a lowly protocol officer to negotiate with Barack Obama .
After the snub and with China refusing to back down from any attempts to bind itself to meeting targets , Obama spoke to the conference .
David Corn , writing in the Atlantic explained the impact :
Not hiding his anger and frustration , [ Obama ] said , “ I think our ability to take collective action is in doubt . ”
… Obama played it simple and hard .
He maintained the United States was calling for three basic principles : mitigation , transparency , and financing .
But he noted that it was absolutely necessary to verify the reductions commitments of the major emitters .
Obama ’s speech left the gathered leaders and activists stunned as he seemed to be signalling the collapse of any possible agreement – of even some small measure of progress .
Following this speech , Obama , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , and America ’s negotiators attempted to salvage some agreement meeting with various world leaders ( pressing China to come as a key player ) .
But China ’s negotiation team refused , secretly meeting with leaders from India , Brazil , and South Africa to negotiate on a non-binding agreement they could announce independent of the global community .
The situation grew tense as world leaders realized no agreement could be reached without China ’s participation .
But in a dramatic moment , Obama salvaged some small measure of a deal , as John M. Broder reported the drama in the New York Times :
The deal eventually came together after a dramatic moment in which Mr. Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton burst into a meeting of the Chinese , Indian and Brazilian leaders , according to senior administration officials .
Mr. Obama said he did not want them negotiating in secret .
The intrusion led to new talks that cemented central terms of the deal , American officials said .
The deal was less than was expected going in , but it signified some small measure of progress :
Expected to be included in this agreement is a commitment by developed nations to reduce greenhouse - gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050 , to create a finance mechanism to handle any agreement , to set a climate “ mitigation target ” of 2 degrees Celsius , to create a high - level panel to monitor carbon emissions , and to push for increased transparency in how they are being dealt with .
Like much of Obama ’s presidency thus far , this deal is both a disappointment and the most significant effort to date to deal with an intractable policy and political problem .
* John M. Broder of the Times had a good piece on the obstacles the Senate was posing to climate change legislation as well as the measures the Democrats and Obama administration were taking to get around their sluggishness – including Pelosi pushing the legislation through the House and Obama ’s EPA complying with the Supreme Court order and taking steps to regulate carbon .

THE idea that the Himalaya could lose its glaciers by 2035 — glaciers which feed rivers across South and East Asia — is a dramatic and apocalyptic one .
After the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) said such an outcome was very likely in the assessment of the state of climate science that it made in 2007 , onlookers ( including this newspaper ) repeated the claim with alarm .
In fact , there is no reason to believe it to be true .
This is good news ( within limits ) for Indian farmers — and bad news for the IPCC .
The IPCC , like ancient Gaul , is divided into three parts .
Working Group
I looks at the physical science of climate change .
Working Group II is concerned with impacts , vulnerability and adaptation .
Working Group III deals with mitigation .
The claims about Himalayan glaciers come from a short “ case study ” in a chapter on Asia in WG - II 's report from 2007 .
Like all of the IPCC 's work , this was meant to be an expert assessment of relevant research , resting mostly on peer - reviewed sources but also , at times , on the “ grey literature ” — reports by governments and other organisations that are not commercially or academically published .
The WG - II case study cites a grey report by the WWF , an environmental group , as the source of the date 2035 .
The WWF in turn cites a study presented in 1999 to the International Commission on Snow and Ice ( ICSI ) by Syed Hasnain , chair of ICSI 's working group on Himalayan glaciers .
But the passage about 2035 that the WWF report quotes comes not from that ICSI report ( which was unpublished ) but from an article that appeared around the same time in Down to Earth , an Indian magazine .
This article was based in part on an interview with Dr Hasnain , who was also quoted by New Scientist as saying it was possible the glaciers would be gone in 40 years .
The article in Down to Earth claims that the area covered by glaciers would drop from 500,000 k m2 to 100,000 k m2 by 2035 , a claim found in the IPCC report but not in the WWF report .
This suggests the Down to Earth article was itself a source for the IPCC , though Murari Lal , a retired Indian academic , now a consultant , who was one of the four co-ordinating lead authors of the chapter , says this was not the case .
There are two further problems with the area figure .
One is that the research in question was looking at all the world 's glaciers , not just the Himalaya's .
The other is that the research was looking at the prospects for 2350 , not 2035 .
Georg Kaser , a glaciologist at the University of Innsbruck , explains that a timescale of centuries , not decades , is far more plausible for the Himalaya .
Politics and logistics make a comprehensive study of Himalayan glaciers difficult , but if those individual glaciers which have been studied recently are representative , then the glaciers are retreating .
This retreat , however , is likely to take a long time .
To melt a glacier at an altitude above 6,000 metres , where many of the Himalayan glaciers are found , requires a lot more warming than can be expected by 2035 — a point made forcefully in a letter to Science by Dr Kaser and others , published this week .
Jeff Kargel of the University of Arizona , one of its authors , stresses that its criticism is aimed at this specific claim , not at the IPCC in general , and should not be seen as undermining the panel 's conclusions .
On January 20th the IPCC released a statement reiterating its overall conclusion on water from seasonal snow packs and glaciers in a warming world : that it is likely to be scarcer and available at different times .
The statement also says that in the case study on the Himalaya 's glaciers “ the clear and well - established standards of evidence , required by the IPCC procedures , were not applied properly . ”
Christopher Field of the Carnegie Institution 's Department of Global Ecology , who is now the co-chair of WG - II , says the fact that the review process failed to catch the problem needs to be looked into .
That a review process which included 40,000 comments did not catch the error proves that size is not everything — especially since the error was quite catchable .
Dr Kaser read the chapter after it was reviewed but before it was published .
As a glaciologist — he was an author of the relevant chapter in the WG - I report , a much more thorough take on the subject which makes no grandiose claims about the Himalaya — he found the passage absurd , and alerted the IPCC .
Problems he had with a passage on glaciers in WG - II 's chapter on Africa were subsequently addressed .
Those in the chapter on Asia were not .
This poses two questions .
One is why Dr Kaser , or some other glaciologist , did not see the chapter earlier on .
Like Gaul 's three parts , the IPCC 's working groups , rooted in different disciplines , have different tribal structures ; they do not communicate as well as they should .
Dr Field says he is determined to try to do something about this in the process leading up to the next set of assessments in 2013 .
The other question is why , when alerted by Dr Kaser , the IPCC did nothing .
When open criticism began last year , it was airily dismissed by Rajendra Pachauri , who chairs the IPCC and runs an institute in India where Dr Hasnain now works on glaciology .
If he had not heard the claims were wrong by that stage , he should have done .
This mixture of sloppiness , lack of communication and high - handedness gives the IPCC 's critics a lot to work with .
Meanwhile , the future of water resources in the places served by the glaciers remains unclear .
Glaciers in monsoonal climates , unlike high - latitude glaciers , gain mass from precipitation during the same warm season in which they lose mass from melting , which makes their behaviour complex .
And there are other water - related questions to be addressed , including possible changes to the monsoons and massive depletion of groundwater .
There is an urgent need to study these things , and to synthesise the results in a way that can be relied on .
Gold hits another all time high of $ 1,117.82 an ounce .
At this point the Fed must decide if the opportunity cost of the equity bubble and a few more S&P points is worth destabilizing the entire monetary system .
Knowing the Chairman's M.O. , the answer is an unequivocal yes , especially if it involves destroying the dollar 's value .

Zikerria Bellamy was born male but changed her gender A Florida teenager who changed her gender from male to female six years ago is taking legal action against McDonald 's for alleged discrimination .
Zikerria Bellamy , 17 , alleges managers at the Orlando branch twice refused to hire her because she is transgender .
She also claims an obscene message stating she would never be hired by the company was left on her voicemail .
The branch concerned has said it has a zero tolerance policy towards any form of discrimination .
' Gay slur '
The complaint , filed by the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund ( TLDEF ) before the Florida Commission on Human Relations , alleges that Zikerria Bellamy applied for a job at a McDonald 's restaurant in Orlando .
It is alleged that two managers at the branch refused to give Miss Bellamy an interview and an one occasion a manager saw the teenager , who arrived wearing a suit , and laughed at her .
She alleges the message , on 28 July , was left by a McDonald 's manager .
In the voicemail message , which has been published on YouTube by her lawyers , an unidentified man uses a gay slur to describe why the fast - food chain restaurant would not hire her .
In a statement , a spokeswoman for the restaurant said the employee who had left the message " acted outside the scope of his authority " , the Associated Press news agency reported .
Allison Garret said he was not responsible for hiring people and no longer worked there .
The New York - based TLDEF says that nearly 50 % of transgender people in the US have been fired or not given a job because of their transgender status .
Most US states do not have laws that specifically protect transgender people in the workplace .

Yemen : Pentagon ’s War On The Arabian Peninsula
Rick Rozoff
— — —-
Yemen will become a battleground for a proxy war between the United States and Saudi Arabia – whose state - to - state relations are among the strongest and most durable of the entire post - World War II era – on one hand and Iran on the other .
It is perhaps impossible to determine the exact moment at which a U.S. - supported self - professed holy warrior – trained to perpetrate acts of urban terrorism and to shoot down civilian airliners – ceases to be a freedom fighter and becomes a terrorist .
But a safe assumption is that it occurs when he is no longer of use to Washington .
A terrorist who serves American interests is a freedom fighter ; a freedom fighter who does n’t is a terrorist .
Yemenis are the latest to learn the Pentagon ’s and the White House ’s law of the jungle .
Along with Iraq and Afghanistan which counterinsurgency specialist Stanley McChrystal used to perfect his techniques , Yemen is joining the ranks of other nations where the Pentagon is engaged in that variety of warfare , fraught with civilian massacres and other forms of so - called collateral damage : Colombia , Mali , Pakistan , the Philippines , Somalia and Uganda .
— — —-
BBC News reported on December 14 that 70 civilians were killed when aircraft bombed a market in the village of Bani Maan in northern Yemen .
The nation ’s armed forces claimed responsibility for the deadly attack , but a website of the Houthi rebels against whom the bombing was ostensibly directed stated “ Saudi aircraft committed a massacre against the innocent residents of Bani Maan . ” [ 1 ]
The Saudi regime entered the armed conflict between the ( eponymous ) Houthis and the Yemeni government on behalf of the latter in early November and since has been accused of launching attacks inside Yemen with tanks and warplanes .
Even before the latest bombing scores of Yemenis have been killed and thousands displaced by the fighting .
Saudi Arabia has also been accused of using phosphorous bombs .
Moreover , the rebel group known as Young Believers , based in the Shi’ite Muslim community of Yemen which comprises 30 percent of the country ’s population of 23 million , claimed on December 14 that “ US fighter jets have attacked Yemen ’s Sa’ada Province ” and “ US fighter jets have launched 28 attacks on the northwestern province of Sa’ada . ” [ 2 ]
The previous day ’s edition of Britain ’s Daily Telegraph reported on discussions with U.S. military officials , stating “ Fearful that Yemen is in danger of becoming a failed state , America has now sent a small number of special forces teams to improve training of Yemen ’s army in reaction to the threat . ”
One unnamed Pentagon official was quoted as saying “ Yemen is becoming a reserve base for al - Qaeda ’s activities in Pakistan and Afghanistan . ” [ 3 ]
The conjuring up of the al - Qaeda bogey , however , is a decoy .
The rebels in the north of the nation are Shi’ites and not Sunnis , much less Wahhabi Sunnis of the Saudi variety , and as such are not only not linked with any group or groups that could be categorized as al - Qaeda , but instead would be a likely target thereof .
In service to American designs in the region , the British and American press lately has been referring to Yemen as the “ ancestral homeland ” of Osama bin Laden .
Bin Laden comes from a prominent billionaire Saudi Arabian family , of course , but as his father had been born in what is now the Republic of Yemen over a century ago the Western media are exploiting an insignificant historical accident to suggest Osama bin Laden ’s active role in the nation and to establish a tenuous link between the South Asian war in Afghanistan and Pakistan and Saudi and American armed intervention in a civil conflict in Yemen .
In 2002 the Pentagon dispatched an estimated 100 soldiers , by some accounts Green Beret special forces , to Yemen to train the country ’s military .
In that instance , coming as it did two years after the suicide bombing attack against the Navy destroyer USS Cole in the southern Yemeni port of Aden , attributed to al - Qaeda , and accompanied by drone missile attacks against identified leaders of the same , Washington justified its actions as retaliation for that incident as well as the attacks in New York City and Washington , D.C. the year before .
The present context is different and a U.S. - backed counterinsurgency war in Yemen will have nothing to do with combating alleged al - Qaeda threats , but will in fact be an integral part of the strategy to expand the Afghan war into yet wider concentric circles taking in South and Central Asia , the Caucasus and the Persian Gulf , Southeast Asia and the Gulf of Aden , the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula .
The eagerly awaited departure of President George W. Bush may have led to the end of the official global war on terror , now referred to as overseas contingencies operations , but nothing except the name has changed .
On December 13 the top commander of the Pentagon ’s Central Command in charge of the wars in Afghanistan , Iraq and Pakistan , General David Petraeus , told the Al Arabiya television network that the “ U.S supports Yemen ’s security in the context of the military cooperation provided by America for its allies in the region ” and “ stressed that U.S. ships in the territorial waters of Yemen [ are there ] not only to control but to impede the infiltrations of weapons to Houthi rebels . ” [ 4 ]
To be recalled the next time the al - Qaeda / bin Laden canard is used to justify expanding U.S. military involvement on the Arabian Peninsula .
The Yemen Post of December 13 wrote that the Houthi media office “ accused the U.S. of participating in the war against Houthis ” and released photographs of what were identified as U.S. warplanes “ involved in bombing operations in Sa’ada province [ in ] Northern Yemen . ”
The source estimated there have been twenty U.S. bombing raids coordinated with satellite surveillance . [ 5 ]
The Western press is again leading the charge in linking the Houthis , whose religious background of Zaydi Shi’ism is quite distinct from the Iranian version , to sinister machinations imputed to Tehran .
Even U.S. government officials have to date acknowledged no evidence that Iran is supporting much less arming the Yemeni rebels .
That will change if the script goes according to precedent as is indicated by Petraeus ’s comment above , and Washington will dutifully echo the Yemeni government ’s claim that Iran is arming its Shi’ia brethren in Yemen as it is accused of doing in Lebanon .
Yemen will become a battleground for a proxy war between the United States and Saudi Arabia – whose state - to - state relations are among the strongest and most durable of the entire post - World War II era – on one hand and Iran on the other .
In an editorial of five days ago the Tehran Times accused all parties to the Yemeni conflict – the government , the rebels and Saudi Arabia – of recklessness and issued a warning : “ History provides a good example .
Saudi Arabia funded extremist groups in Afghanistan and still , two decades since the withdrawal of the Soviet army from the country , the flames of war in Afghanistan are overwhelming the allies of Saudi Arabia .
“ And a similar scenario is emerging in Yemen . ” [ 6 ]
The comparison between Yemen and Afghanistan alluded in particular to Riyadh , in the second case hand - in - glove with the United States , exporting Saudi - based Wahhabism to expand its political influence .
Saudi Arabia is attempting to promote its own version of extremism in Yemen as it did earlier in Afghanistan and Pakistan and is currently doing in Iraq .
Far from the U.S. and its Western allies expressing any objection , the Saudis and their fellow Persian Gulf monarchies will be in the forefront of what is estimated to be $ 100 billion worth of Middle East arms purchases from the West over the next five years .
“ The core of this arms - buying spree will undoubtedly be the $ 20 billion U.S. package of weapons systems over 10 years for the six states of the Gulf Cooperation Council – Saudi Arabia , the U.A.E. , Kuwait , Oman , Qatar and Bahrain . ” [ 7 ]
Saudi Arabia is also armed with state - of - the - art British and French warplanes as well as U.S. missile defense systems .
What the earlier cited Iranian commentary warned about regarding “ the flames of war ” in Afghanistan is perfectly confirmed by the Commander ’s Initial Assessment of August 30 , 2009 issued by top American and NATO military commander in Afghanistan General Stanley McChrystal and published by the Washington Post on September 21 with the redactions demanded by the Pentagon .
The 66 - page document served as the blueprint for President Barack Obama ’s December 1 announcement that 33,000 more American troops are headed to Afghanistan .
In the report McChrystal stated , “ The major insurgent groups in order of their threat to the mission are : the Quetta Shura Taliban ( 05T ) , the Haqqani Network ( HQN ) , and the Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin ( HiG ) . ”
The last two are named after their founders and current leaders , Jalaluddin Haqqanni and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , the Mujahideen darlings of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency in the 1980s when the Agency ’s deputy director ( from 1986 - 1989 ) was Robert Gates , now U.S. Secretary of Defense in charge of prosecuting the war in Afghanistan .
And in Yemen .
In his 1996 book From the Shadows , Gates boasted that “ CIA had important successes in covert action .
Perhaps the most consequential of all was Afghanistan where CIA , with its management , funnelled billions of dollars in supplies and weapons to the mujahideen … . ” [ 8 ]
The New York Times in 2008 divulged these details :
“ In the 1980s , Jalaluddin Haqqani was cultivated as a ‘ unilateral ’ asset of the CIA and received tens of thousands of dollars in cash for his work in fighting the Soviet Army in Afghanistan , according to an account in ‘ The Bin Ladens , ’ a recent book by Steve Coll .
At that time , Haqqani helped and protected Osama bin Laden , who was building his own militia to fight the Soviet forces , Coll wrote . ” [ 9 ]
Coll is also the author of the 2001 volume Ghost Wars : The Secret History of the CIA , Afghanistan , and Bin Laden , from the Soviet Invasion to September 10 , 2001 .
Haqqani ’s colleague Hekmatyar “ received millions of dollars from the CIA through the ISI [ Pakistan ’s Inter - Services Intelligence ] .
Hezb - e - Islami Gulbuddin received some of the strongest support from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia , and worked with thousands of foreign mujahideen who came to Afghanistan . ” [ 10 ]
This past May the ( superlatively ) pro-American president of Pakistan , Asif Ali Zardari , told the American NBC news network that Taliban is “ part of our past and your past , and the ISI and CIA created them together … .
It ( the Taliban ) was ( a ) monster created by all of us … . ” [ 11 ]
On September 11 , 2001 there were only three nations in the world that recognized Taliban rule in Afghanistan : Pakistan , Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates .
U.S. President George W. Bush immediately afterward singled out seven so - called states supporting terrorism for potential retaliation : Cuba , Iran , Iraq , Libya , North Korea , Sudan and Syria .
Only Sudan , which expelled Osama bin Laden in 1996 , had any conceivable connections to al - Qaeda .
Of the nineteen accused September 11 airline hijackers , fifteen were from Saudi Arabia , two from the United Arab Emirates , one from Egypt and one from Lebanon .
Pakistan and Saudi Arabia remain highly - valued American political and military allies and the United Arab Emirates has troops serving under NATO command in Afghanistan .
It is perhaps impossible to determine the exact moment at which a U.S. - supported self - professed holy warrior – trained to perpetrate acts of urban terrorism and to shoot down civilian airliners – ceases to be a freedom fighter and becomes a terrorist .
But a safe assumption is that it occurs when he is no longer of use to Washington .
A terrorist who serves American interests is a freedom fighter ; a freedom fighter who does n’t is a terrorist .
For decades the African National Congress of Nelson Mandela and the Palestine Liberation Organization of Yasser Arafat were at the top of the U.S. State Department ’s list of terrorist groups .
No sooner had the Cold War ended than both Mandela and Arafat ( and Sinn Fein ’s Gerry Adams ) were invited to the White House .
The first shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 and the second in 1994 .
If a hypothetical self - styled jihadist left Saudi Arabia or Egypt in the 1980s for Pakistan to fight against the Afghan government and its Soviet ally , he was a freedom fighter in the U.S. ’s eyes .
If he then went to Lebanon he was a terrorist .
In the early 1990s if he arrived in Bosnia he was a freedom fighter again , but if he showed up in the Gaza Strip or the West Bank a terrorist .
In the Russian North Caucasus he was a reborn freedom fighter , but if he returned to Afghanistan after 2001 a terrorist .
Depending on how the wind is blowing from Foggy Bottom , an armed Baloch separatist in Pakistan or a Kashmiri one in India is either a freedom fighter or a terrorist .
Contrariwise , in 1998 U.S. special envoy to the Balkans Robert Gelbard described the Kosovo Liberation Army ( KLA ) fighting the government of Yugoslavia as a terrorist organization : “ I know a terrorist when I see one and these men are terrorists . ” [ 12 ]
The following February U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright brought five members of the KLA , including its chief Hashim Thaci , to Rambouillet , France to offer an ultimatum to Yugoslavia that she knew would be rejected and lead to war .
The next year she escorted Thaci on a personal tour of the United Nations Headquarters and the State Department and invited him as a guest to the Democratic Party presidential nominating convention in Los Angeles .
This November 1st
Thaci , now prime minister of a pseudo - state only recognized by 63 of the world ’s 192 nations , hosted former U.S. President Bill Clinton for the unveiling of a statue honoring the latter ’s crimes .
And vanity .
Washington supported armed separatists in Eritrea from the mid-1970s until 1991 in their war against the Ethiopian government .
Currently the U.S. is arming Somalia and Djibouti for war against independent Eritrea .
The Pentagon has its first permanent military base in Africa in Djibouti , where it stations 2,000 troops and from where it conducts drone surveillance over Somalia .
And Yemen .
In the words of Balzac ’s character Vautrin , “ There are no such things as principles , there are only events ; there are no laws , there are only circumstances … . ”
Yemenis are the latest to learn the Pentagon ’s and the White House ’s law of the jungle .
Along with Iraq and Afghanistan which counterinsurgency specialist Stanley McChrystal used to perfect his techniques , Yemen is joining the ranks of other nations where the U.S. military is engaged in that variety of warfare , fraught with civilian massacres and other forms of so - called collateral damage : Colombia , Mali , Pakistan , the Philippines , Somalia and Uganda .

Teeth are gnashing and swords are being drawn in response to the news that Comcast is snarfing down 51 percent of NBC Universal — the other 49 percent owned by General Electric — in a new joint venture .
The deal will give Comcast , already the nation 's biggest cable company and ISP , control over a huge swath of video content .
" This is the most important media merger since Lucy married Desi , " declared Andrew Schwartzman of the Media Access Project .
" The merger clearly threatens to transform video markets nationwide .
Although the details of the deal have not yet been announced , I am strongly concerned about the market power enjoyed by a Comcast / NBC combination .
No one entity should have control over such a large audience . "
The ensuing debate will push net neutrality questions " to the forefront , " warned Art Brodsky of Public Knowledge .
" Those who want to argue that AT&T , Verizon and , yes , Comcast , should be able to play favorites and have control over the content on the Internet will have an even larger barrier to surmount as the breadth , depth and economic might of the new media giant becomes apparent . "
They will also have to contend with noisy public opposition to the proposed merger .
" Free Press will be rallying people across the country who are tired of mega- mergers being rubber stamped , " the organization promised on Tuesday .
" We will make sure that this time their voices ca n’t be ignored . "
If there 's a ring of confidence in these declarations , it 's because the Comcast / NBC deal faces a very different regulatory environment than any recent mergers , notably the Sirius / XM or AT&T / BellSouth approvals .
One wonders whether either of these marriages would have gotten past a Federal Communications Commission with Democratic rather than Republican majorities — not to mention the scrutiny of the Justice Department , which will be weighing in on this latest question , too .
It 's also uncertain how the FCC will evaluate the Comcast / NBC union .
Most of the Commission 's media ownership rules prohibit any entity from buying up too many radio stations , television stations , or newspapers in a single market .
They also ban a company from owning two networks or too much national television audience share .
The NBC / Comcast deal offers the possibility of a single enterprise dominating ISPs , cable delivery , and now video content throughout the United States .
That 's a scary prospect for more than a few observers , but it 's not clear with what regulatory tools the FCC will evaluate this merger .
Still , crusading against mergers is something that the Stop Big Media crowd knows how to do .
They 've had lots of practice over the last decade , and that story has relevance for this controversy .
We will have rules
The Telecommunications
Act of 1996 required the FCC to review its media ownership rules every two years , and to consider " whether any such rules are necessary in the public interest as a result of competition . "
And so in late 2001 , Chair Michael Powell launched a dozen studies on the present media landscape , then opened a proceeding that pretty much declared all the restrictions up for grabs — even the dual - network rule , which prohibits radio and TV networks from merging with each other .
" Rebuilding the factual foundation of the Commission 's media ownership regulations is one of my top priorities , " Powell declared .
" For too long , the Commission has made sweeping media policy decisions without a contemporaneous picture of the media market . "
But by 2002 , you did n't have to hire any experts to know that a new force had arrived on the media market : the read / write / webosphere , which saw itself as a challenger against not only the two - party system , but network broadcasting as well .
While just about every major media entity avidly supported Powell 's efforts to relax the FCC 's broadcast ownership rules , Free Press and hundreds of regional and local groups rhetorically threw themselves across the rails of the process .
Urging them on were the FCC's two minority Commissioners , Michael Copps and Jonathan Adelstein .
While Powell consented to only one public hearing on the agency 's rules , Copps and Adelstein appeared at dozens of unofficial events , to which thousands of people attended .
Powell was unprepared for any of this .
His public comments were obstinate , often taciturn .
" [ L ] et me now tell you this , " he declared in 2003 .
" We will have broadcast ownership rules at the end of this proceeding . "
My religion
To almost everyone 's surprise , however , conservatives started having second thoughts about the process .
The National Rifle Association sent out a " Media Monopoly Alert " to its members , signed by NRA Vice President Wayne LaPierre , urging them to oppose media concentration : " [ Y ] ou better believe that if these Big Media executives get the control they want over America 's radio and TV airwaves , it will be all but impossible for your NRA to fight our grassroots battles in the way we have done so successfully in the past , " he warned .
And William Safire of the New York Times urged caution as well : " Michael Powell , appointed by Bush to be FCC chairman , likes to say ' the market is my religion ' , " Safire wrote .
" My conservative economic religion is founded on the rock of competition , which — since Teddy Roosevelt 's day — has protected small business and consumers against predatory pricing leading to market monopolization ...
Republicans in the House , intimidated by the powerful broadcast lobby , do n't admit that some regulation can be pro-business . "
As even Powell 's supporters later noted , by putting almost every one of the agency 's rules on the regulatory table , Powell created a huge political target for opponents of consolidation to zero in on .
When , by a vote of three to two , the agency finally relaxed many of the rules , the Senate quickly condemned the decision by a 15 - member majority .
And the decision itself , too big and complicated for its legal britches , was challenged by the Prometheus Radio Project in the Third Circuit Court of Appeals .
In 2004 , the Third Circuit granted a motion to stay .
The court argued that the FCC 's new rules needed to be redone , observing that the FCC 's analysis of media diversity at the time " gave too much weight to the Internet as a media outlet " and " irrationally assigned outlets of the same media type equal market shares . "
Six months later Michael Powell resigned as Chair of the FCC .
President Bush named Powell 's soft - spoken colleague Kevin Martin as the new chief .
Just one rule
Martin had voted for Powell 's changes , but he understood that his former boss had tried to accomplish too much .
" One of the things that I had advocated for , and I thought would have been much more helpful , was for the Commission to try to not say that we were going to take an action on all of these media ownership rules at once , " he explained to us in an interview .
" But rather , we should look at each rule individually . "
The rule that Martin focused on was the restriction on an entity owning newspapers and television stations in the same market .
In late 2007 , he got a three - to - two majority to relax the rule in the top 20 Nielsen markets .
The Senate quickly condemned the decision yet again , with Sen. Byron Dorgan ( D - ND ) launching a bill to reverse the measure .
Media reform groups quickly appealed the Order to the Third Circuit yet again , and also filed a Petition for Reconsideration against the move .
In November 2009 , the new FCC asked the appeals court to hold all of the FCC 's decisions in abeyance .
Why ?
Because the Commission plans to launch yet another cycle of its media ownership rules in 2010 .
It 's pointless , the Commission 's general counsel noted , for the court to weigh in on these matters when the FCC plans to rethink them relatively soon in its impending 2010 Quadrennial Review ( in 2004 , Congress changed the two - year rule to every four years ) .
That would be just in time , in fact , for the public to weigh in on the Comcast / NBC Universal deal .
As already noted , the Genachowski administration will soon come under tremendous pressure to stop or modify this deal .
But the FCC is going to have to frame its response within the context of the media ownership debates of the last eight years .
How it will accomplish that task remains to be seen .
China has a force of three ships patrolling the Gulf of Aden A senior Chinese naval officer has suggested that China establish a permanent base in the Gulf of Aden to support its anti-piracy operations .
Rear Admiral Yin Zhou 's proposal was posted on the defence ministry website .
Mr Yin said supplying and maintaining the fleet off Somalia was challenging without such a base , and said other nations were unlikely to object .
China 's navy currently has no overseas bases , but there are calls in the media and web forums for this to change .
The proposal comes after a Chinese cargo ship and its crew of 25 were rescued from Somali pirates on Monday , amid reports that a $ 4 m ( £ 2.5 m ) ransom had been paid to their kidnappers .
' Appropriate '
The Chinese navy has already been patrolling the Gulf of Aden for more than a year , protecting cargo vessels that are increasingly threatened by pirates based in Somalia .
Yin Zhuo , a prominent spokesman on naval matters , made his suggestion to establish a permanent base in the area during a state radio interview on Tuesday .
A transcript was later published on the defence ministry 's website .
The Chinese navy currently has no overseas bases " I believe that a relatively stable , relatively solid base for resupply and repair would be appropriate , " he said .
Such a base would provide a steady source of fresh food , along with facilities for communications , ship repair and recreation , Mr Yin added .
He offered no suggestion on where such a base should be located .
Any definite decision to establish such a base would have to be decided by the Communist Party , Mr Yin said .
Allaying foreign concern
Other countries have been closely monitoring China 's international deployments for signs of increasing assertiveness in its foreign defence policy .
Beijing 's leaders are sensitive to these concerns - and the first ships deployed in the Gulf spent more than four months at sea without docking .
" We did n't want to arouse unnecessary suspicion from some Western countries , " Mr Yin explained .
" Gradually , everyone saw we are there to carry out legitimate international duties and we are helping ships from other countries as well , " he said , adding that when his vessel finally docked at a French base , his crew were warmly welcomed .
Recently China has been working closely with the European Union , Nato and US anti-piracy coalitions , sharing information and now offering protection to ships from other countries .
According to BBC East Africa correspondent Will Ross , naval officials say they are pleased with what is an unusual show of international military cooperation .
Mr
Yin said he believed other nations in the region would understand China 's need for a naval supply base so that it could meet its international commitments .
The US and France already have bases in the region .
The Chinese navy has not been in this part if the world since the Ming Dynasty .
During the 15th Century , Chinese naval explorers reached the East African coast , visiting Mogadishu and Malindi , even taking back a giraffe and a zebra as souvenirs .
These days China is sending a lot more back home - such as African oil and minerals , which are vital for the country 's economy .

Religious Persecution ?
German Home - Schoolers Granted Political Asylum in US
A family of evangelical Christians who said they were being persecuted for their religious beliefs in Germany have been granted political asylum in the US .
The couple fled to Tennessee so they could home - school their five children , which is illegal in Germany .
MANILA , Philippines -
A man who admits to have worked as a child assassin for the powerful Ampatuan clan based in Maguindanao province came forward with " shocking " testimony of mass murders carried out by young boys in the service of the Ampatuan family .
" Abdul " ( not his real name ) told ABS - CBN News that he was 12 when Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao ( ARMM ) Gov. Zaldy Ampatuan allegedly sent him on a mission to kill one of the family 's political rivals — a councilor for Sultan Kudarat .
Abdul said he had been in the family 's service since he was 10 .
The Ampatuans funded his education from 4th grade to 3rd year high school .
When the Ampatuans allegedly ordered him to kill the councilor , then 12 - year - old Abdul did not disappoint .
" Pinapasok ako sa bahay niya .
Inabangan ko lang pag-uwi .
Pagdating na niya sa bahay niya , doon ko na siya babanatan , " Abdul told ABS - CBN News in an interview 2 weeks ago .
( I was allowed to enter the councilor 's house .
I waited for him to come home .
When he came home , that 's when I would kill him )
" Pero meron akong mga kasama .
Ako lang pumapasok .
Naka - uniform ako ng estudyante .
Kahit saan ako papasok - pasok , wala namang sumisita , " he said .
( But I had companions .
I was the only one who entered the house .
I was in my school uniform .
I would go in and out of places , no one would stop me . )
As a child assassin for the Ampatuans , Abdul said he killed no less than 100 people .
Training camps
Abdul said he and 30 other young boys had been brought to a training camp in the mountains of South Upi municipality in Maguindanao , around 32 miles southeast of Sultan Kudarat .
He claimed they were trained by Palestinians and Indonesians in combat tactics .
" Para ring sundalo ' yong training kasi iba ' yong pagturo sa amin .
Lahat nandoon na , parang paghawak ng baril , pagputok at pagtutok ng baril sa tao .
( We were trained like soldiers .
Everything was there , like how to hold a gun , how to aim a gun and how to shoot a person ) , " Abdul said .
From then on , Abdul said , murder became a normal routine .
He alleged that he carried out kill orders without question and without knowing whether the victims had done anything wrong .
" Hindi naman ako nagtatanong kasi nakikita [ namin ] harap - harapan .
Hanggang sa kuwan na kami , hinaharap — kinakausap kaming lahat .
[ Kapag ] may magtanong , patay agad .
( I never asked questions because we knew up front .
They would face us all and talk to us .
Anyone who would question would be killed ) , " he said .
Abdul , now in his late 20s , is currently in the Sultan Kudarat Provincial Jail on charges of murder .
He has been incarcerated for 10 years .
He is serving a 15 - year sentence .
He said he decided to come forward with his story after he " could not sleep since his conscience was bothering him . "
He was also said to have harbored ill feelings for the Ampatuan family for not helping him resolve the murder charges against him .
Direct orders from governor ?
Asked who among the Ampatuans gave him orders , Abdul claimed it was ARMM Gov. Ampatuan who was then a mayor of Shariff Aguak town .
" Hindi po direct sa akin .
' Yon pong katiwala niya .
( He did n't order me directly .
Zaldy 's aide would ) , " he said .
The last time he had spoken to the Ampatuans , Abdul told ABS - CBN News , was in 2003 .
Before that , he claimed the Ampatuans would sometimes break him out of jail to carry out murders .
In one instance , Abdul said he was sneaked out of jail to ambush another group of Ampatuan 's political enemies .
Abdul said he shot and killed 3 victims right at the Commission on Elections ( Comelec ) headquarters in Intramuros , Manila on November 2 , 2002 .
This time , it was Atty .
Felix Lidasan and his cousin Armando Macapeges , along with the latter 's brother Jamal Macapeges .
" Tatlo 'yon .
Hinabol ko nga , hinabol ko pa .
' Yong dalawa , on the spot , patay .
' Yong isa , nasa ospital nang mamatay .
( There were 3 of them .
I even had to chase them .
The two were dead on the spot .
The other one died at the hospital ) , " he said .
Lidasan and Macapages were at the Comelec to follow - up an electoral protest against Matanog mayor Nasser Imam , an in - law of current Shariff Aguak Mayor Anwar Ampatuan .
Ampatuans hands - on in killings too ?
Abdul claimed Zaldy was present at the time of the murders .
Zaldy , Anwar , family patriarch Andal Ampatuan Sr. and his son Datu Unsay Mayor Andal Ampatuan Jr. were recently arrested over the murder of 57 civilians and journalists in Ampatuan town .
Among his numerous exploits as a hired gun , Abdul said he could not forget the massacre of his town mates who refused to give up their land to the Ampatuans .
The powerful clan controlled the political and economic powers in Maguindanao and its adjacent areas .
" Sinusunog ' yong bahay .
Nasasagasaan pati ang bata , matanda .
Inuubos namin ' yon .
Walang makababa eh.
Pero gabi , gabi namin ginagawa .
( We would burn their houses .
Children and the elderly were not spared .
No one could escape .
We would do it at night ) , " Abdul said .
In many of the murders , Abdul claimed he was accompanied by a certain " Major Mukamad , " who is allegedly Chief Inspector Saudi Mukamad , leader of the 1057th Police Provincial Mobile Group , a police combat group .
Mukamad was implicated by witnesses as one of the perpetrators of the Ampatuan town massacre , according to the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group ( CIDG ) .
He has been relieved from his post . .
' Like a movie '
There have been many reports of insurgents or terrorist groups using child soldiers in combat .
However , the alleged use child assassins by Philippine warlords came as a surprise to Armed Forces of the Philippines ( AFP ) and the Commission on Human Rights ( CHR ) .
AFP spokesperson Lt. Col. Romeo Brawner Jr. said they could not find alleged training camps in South Upi , as described by Abdul in his interview .
" Maaaring ang nangyari was that they went into this area , nag - training sila and then umalis din sila .
( What could have happened was they went to this area and trained there .
Then they left ) , " Brawner said , suggesting that there may not be permanent training facilities for child assassins in the area .
CHR Chair Leila de Lima , meanwhile , wants a full investigation into the matter .
" If this is true , if it is a reality in that part of the country , then this surely warrants further investigation , " she said .
" This is shocking .
This is really unbelivable .
I mean , the Ampatuan town massacre is already unbelievable .
What [ Abdul ] is revealing is like a movie , " de Lima added .
Despite numerous attempts by ABS - CBN
News to get the Ampatuan family 's side on the matter through texts , calls and visits to the family 's offices , the Ampatuans had not given comment when this story was aired on TV Patrol on Wednesday and when this report was published on abs- cbnNEWS.com . — Report by Anthony Taberna , ABS - CBN

The Pacific Institute Analysis for the United Nations recommends coping methods for growing supply and demand gaps of transboundary rivers and aquifers .
By Steve Kellman
Circle of Blue
A new analysis from the Pacific Institute finds that climate change and its effect on freshwater supplies may lead to more cross - border conflicts over shared water resources if countries do n’t start preparing now .
The analysis , conducted by the California - based research institute and the United Nations Environment Programme , echoes recent Circle of Blue reports on shared freshwater resources serving as a flashpoint for international conflicts .
As climate change alters patterns of water supply and demand , as well as flood and drought , existing water agreements may no longer apply as new disputes arise .
Heather Cooley , a senior research associate with the Pacific Institute and one of the report ’s authors , told Circle of Blue that for decades researchers have said that change pressures aggravate water tensions , even between governments that already have agreements in place .
“ There have been some efforts to try to evaluate the impacts of climate change , look at shortage requirements within these agreements … but nowhere near what needs to be done to address these risks , ” Cooley said in a phone interview .
The Pacific Institute report describes ways in which several countries are now grappling with cross - border disputes — some more successfully than others — and ways in which their experiences can serve as a model for others .
“ This could be used as an impetus for even greater cooperation and the development of adaptation strategies , ” she said .
“ With different countries operating dams and reservoirs along these waterways , it ’s very important that they coordinate their efforts .
…
As we point out , it ’s best to try to do that before there ’s an issue . ”
One country ’s promise ; another country ’s threat
As Circle of Blue has recently documented , water is often at the center of international disputes .
Turkey ’s plan to build a series of dams and hydroelectric projects on the Tigris River is drawing protests from downstream countries including Syria and Iraq , which fear the project will give Turkey too much control over the headwaters of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers .
Six nations depend on the two rivers , according to the Pacific Institute report .
Shared rivers are also the flashpoint for disputes between India and Bangladesh , with Bangladeshi leaders pressing their Indian counterparts for new agreements on the Teesta River and other waterways .
A proposed dam on India ’s portion of the Barak River , which environmental experts claim may dry up two downstream rivers , has drawn public concern , and protest threats .
The two countries share deep freshwater links — they have 54 rivers in common , including the massive Ganges - Brahmaputra basin .
In the war - torn nation of Sudan , as special Circle of Blue correspondent Dr. Paul J. Sullivan reported , water is at the heart of many internal and external conflicts .
Sudan is one of 13 countries that depend on the Congo / Zaire River for at least part of its freshwater needs , the Pacific Institute report found .
The Nile River also supplies part of Sudan , and the Pacific Institute report notes that the Nile Basin Treaty governing use of the river was negotiated between Egypt and the Sudan alone , though nine other nations are located upstream .
Disagreements over water allocations have stalled a more comprehensive treaty , as we reported in December .
Colorado : A ‘ Model for Other Agreements ’
One of the case studies in the Pacific Institute report illustrates how states and nations can come to agreement on water issues , even in the face of changing conditions .
The Colorado River , which runs more than 1,400 miles ( 2,300 km ) from its headwaters in the Rocky Mountains to the Gulf of California , helps irrigate nearly 3 million acres ( 12,000 km2 ) of farmland and meet the water needs of 27 million residents in Las Vegas , Los Angeles , Mexicali , Phoenix , San Diego and Tijuana .
The question of who has rights to how much of the river ’s water is governed by a thicket of regulations , interstate compacts , agreements , compacts and judicial decisions , known collectively as the “ Law of the River . ”
While past cross - border discussions have been acrimonious , a recent round of negotiations in the face of the worst drought in over 100 years has resulted in a new agreement that sets specific “ triggers ” for when allocations should change depending on changing reservoir levels .
“ There are a number of safeguards that have been put in place to deal with variable flow and water quality , ” Cooley said .
“ Also , they have an amendment process that does provide some flexibility and could be a model for other agreements . ”
For example , a drop in the water level of Lake Mead would trigger an automatic reduction in water allocations for downstream communities .
This level of specificity is different from many other water treaties that set vague conditions — or no conditions at all — for how water allocations should change in periods of drought , Cooley said .
A flexible agreement will be critical in future years , as a recent study suggests that the Colorado River basin will see a reduction in runoff of between six and 20 percent by 2050 , even as rising temperatures and decreasing rainfall amounts increase irrigation needs among the regions farmers .
Population growth will also place even more demand on the declining resource , according to the report .
The Pacific Institute report offers a series of strategies for nations facing similar challenges .
They include establishing existing water agreements and expanding existing agreements ; enforcing an effective international legal framework like the UN Convention on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses ; evaluating existing treaties and agreements to assess flexibility in light of changing conditions ; establishing joint monitoring programs ; and conducting climate impact , vulnerability , and adaptation assessments .

The anti-whaling group Sea Shepherd says one of its boats has been hit by a Japanese vessel in the Southern Ocean .
The group says the Ady Gil was at a standstill in Australian waters off Commonwealth Bay when the Japanese whaling ship Shonan Maru 2 deliberately rammed into it .
Sea Shepherd spokesman Chris Aultman , a helicopter pilot for the group , says no crew members were injured in the incident , but the ship has been destroyed .
" The vessel was dead in the water .
It was completely and absolutely a wilful act , " he said .
" Luckily no one was in the bow of the vessel at the time of the collision or they certainly would have been killed instantly . "
Lacky Maclean , the first mate of the Sea Shepherd 's ship , the Steve Irwin , says the bow of the Ady Gil was cut off in the attack .
" There 's a big difference between throwing stink bombs and sinking a vessel , " he said .
A spokesman for Japan 's Fisheries Agency , which oversees the country 's whaling program , says it is investigating the incident .
The Federal Government has repeated its call for restraint by all parties in the Southern Ocean .
Earlier in the day the Ady Gil clashed with a different Japanese whaling boat .
Sea Shepherd unveiled the Ady Gil in October last year , describing it as " a fast , futuristic - looking trimaran that recently set the world record for global circumnavigation " .
The ship , which can reach up to 50 knots , was used to intercept and block harpoon ships from killing whales .
Captain Paul Watson , the president and founder of Sea Shepherd , had said the ship enabled the group 's current campaign to be the " most ambitious and aggressive effort to date " .
A Yuletide fir tree decorated with sparkling swastikas , apple - cheeked children in uniform eager to bake SS insignia - shaped cakes for the whole family , and festive Germanic candlesticks hand - crafted in a concentration camp – such were the dubious delights of Christmas under Nazi rule .
Sixty - five years after Germans celebrated the last Christmas of the Third Reich , a new exhibition at Cologne 's National Socialism Documentation Centre offers , for the first time , an insight into the elaborate propaganda methods devised by the Nazis in their campaign to take the Christ out of Christmas .
The exhibition contains selected items from a vast private collection of Nazi Christmas memorabilia , including swastika and Nazi SS tree decorations , Aryan department store catalogues featuring presents for boys – toy Nazi tanks , fighter planes and machine guns – and music for carols that have been stripped of their Christian content .

" The baby Jesus was Jewish .
This was both a problem and a provocation for the Nazis , " explained Judith Breuer , who organised the exhibition using the items she and her mother collected at flea markets over 30 years .
" The most popular Christian festival of the year did not fit in with their racist ideology .
They had to react and they did so by trying to make it less Christian . "
The regime 's exploitation of Christmas began almost as soon as the Nazis took power in 1933 .
Party ideologists wrote scores of papers claiming that the festival 's Christian element was a manipulative attempt by the church to capitalise on what were really old Germanic traditions .
Christmas Eve , they argued , had nothing to do with Christ but was the date of the winter solstice – the Nordic Yuletide that was " the holy night in which the sun was reborn " .
The swastika , they claimed , was an ancient symbol of the sun that represented the struggle of the Great German Reich .
Father Christmas had nothing to do with the bearded figure in a red robe who looked like a bishop : the Nazis reinvented him as the Germanic Norse god Odin , who , according to legend , rode about the earth on a white horse to announce the coming of the winter solstice .
Propaganda posters in the exhibition show the " Christmas or Solstice man " as a hippie - like individual on a white charger sporting a thick grey beard , slouch hat and a sack full of gifts .
But the star that traditionally crowns the Christmas tree presented an almost insurmountable problem .
" Either it was the six - pointed star of David , which was Jewish , or it was the five - pointed star of the Bolshevik Soviet Union , " said Mrs Breuer .
" And both of them were anathema to the regime . "
So the Nazis replaced the star with swastikas , Germanic " sun wheels " and the Nordic " sig runes " used by the regime 's fanatical Waffen SS as their insignia .
Housewives were encouraged to bake biscuits in similar shapes .
One of the exhibits is a page from a Nazi women 's magazine with a baking recipe : " Every boy will want to bake a sig ( SS ) rune , " proclaims the accompanying text .
The Nazification of Christmas did not end there .
The Christmas tree crib was replaced by a Christmas garden containing wooden toy deer and rabbits .
Mary and Jesus became the Germanic mother and child , while dozens of Christmas carols , including the famous German hymn " Silent Night " , were rewritten with all references to God , Christ and religion expunged .
At the height of the anti-Christian campaign , an attempt was made to replace the coming of Christ the Saviour with the coming of Adolf Hitler – the " Saviour Führer . "
" We cannot accept that a German Christmas tree has anything to do with a crib in a manger in Bethlehem , " wrote the Nazi propagandist Friedrich Rehm in 1937 .
" It is inconceivable for us that Christmas and all its deep soulful content is the product of an oriental religion , " he added .

One of the exhibition 's more disturbing items is a so - called Yule lantern – a Germanic candlestick that was produced on the orders of SS leader Heinrich Himmler by the inmates of Dachau concentration camp .
They were meant as gifts for faithful SS members .
Yet during the course of the Second World War , the Nazis ' attempts to take the Christ out of Christmas became increasingly overshadowed by the war effort .
The festival quickly turned into a scramble to send gift boxes and cards to troops at the front .
By the end of the war , the Nazis had tried to turn Christmas into a ceremony of mourning for the fallen but , by then , hardly anyone took notice .
Mrs Breuer 's mother , Rita , began collecting antique Christmas decorations in the 1970s .
Her husband had said he wanted the sort of old - fashioned German tree that his grandmother used to have .
But Rita Breuer and her daughter soon started to unearth bizarre tree decorations that had little to do with the traditional Christmas .
First World
War items included a miniature glass soldier carrying a hand grenade and military tree baubles in the shape of shells and tanks .
" The trend continued into the Nazi era , " Mrs Breuer said .
The church was too intimidated to protest , and the majority of Germans continued with the traditions they had become used to .
" The Nazi Christmas ideology appears to have been adhered to most by the families of party activists who lived in towns , " she added .
The Nazi version of some German carols that were stripped of their Christian content survive and are still unwittingly sung by today 's Germans .
The hijacking of Christmas did not end with the Nazis .
There were also attempts to de-Christianise the event in the former communist East Germany .
Prominent communist authors tried to substitute the birth of Jesus with that of the Soviet dictator Josef Stalin , who just happened to have been born in a humble Russian hut on December 21 .
" It may seem peculiar now , but in some cases the transition was almost seamless , " Mrs Breuer said .
Fact or fable : What Christianity took from myth
There was an element of truth to Nazi claims that Christmas had pagan roots .
When Christianity became the official religion of the Roman empire , it incorporated several ancient festivals and pagan traditions .
* Mithras
The ancient festival to mark the solstice on 25 December was to celebrate Mithras , the Roman God of Light .
Traditionally the festival marked the renewal of hope and is believed to have been taken up by Christians as the birthday of Jesus around the fourth century .
* Saturnalia
The customs of gift - giving , indulgent feasting and having fun comes from another Roman festival – Saturnalia – which was celebrated around 17 December .
Saturn , to whom the festival was dedicated , was the Roman God of agriculture and plenty .
Presents symbolised the redistribution of wealth from rich to poor during the season of greatest hardship and the rich would lay on big feasts to feed their poorer neighbours .
* New Year 's Eve
Decorating the home with greenery is today seen as a Christmas tradition , but originated from the Roman celebration for New Year 's Eve. Dedicated to the two - faced god Janus ( who looked both forward and back ) , Romans would have torch - lit processions , sing songs , have their fortunes told , give presents and decorate their homes with greenery to symbolise new life .
Other ways of celebrating Christmas were adopted more recently , and were once peculiar to northern Europe .
* Yule log
Typical of these is the yule log , which is believed to have arrived in Britain only in the 17th century .
One theory is that it originated in the Germanic paganism that was practiced across northern Europe before Christianity ; others argue it came from Anglo - Saxon paganism , a variant of Germanic paganism practiced in England in early medieval times .
The yule log was seen as a protective amulet and also a source of rivalry between neighbours .
How accurately must you predict the future before you can call yourself a futurist ?
That ’s the central question in a bit of online controversy regarding Ray Kurzweil .
The well known inventor and author has made many predictions over his career , and if you ’ve seen any of his lectures you know about the major ones .
Artificial intelligence will match and then exceed the human brain .
Humans and machines will merge .
The universe will be full of intelligence .
But it ’s a series of more precise predictions that he wrote for his 1998 book , The Age of Spiritual Machines ( TASM ) that are drawing flak .
In a recent post on his blog , Accelerating Future , Michael Anissimov has challenged TASM ’s predictions for 2009 .
Anissimov is no futurism lightweight , he ’s an integral part of the Lifeboat Foundation , the Singularity Institute and the Immortality Institute .
He and Kurzweil both work with the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence and the Singularity Summit .
In his post , Anissimov points out that seven of Kurzweil ’s forecasts have failed to come true by the end of 2009 .
Kurzweil responded to the critique on the blog .
The biggest point : TASM makes 108 predictions for 2009 , and Kurzweil says that 102 were correct or “ essentially correct ” .
This gives us all another chance to debate a favorite issue among technophiles : Does Kurzweil know what the hell he is talking about ?
In this corner , the challenger …
First , let ’s just jump straight into the predictions that Anissimov critiques .
I ’m going to paraphrase horrifically here so I encourage you to browse through TASM on your own to get the original text .
1 ) People will be wearing computers in the form of jewelry and clothing .
2 ) The majority of text will be generated using speech to text software .
3 ) Computer displays in glasses will be able to project images directly onto the eyes .
4 ) Three dimensional computer chips will be commonly used .
5 ) Translating telephone technology will be commonly used .
6 ) Warfare will be dominated by airborne drones , some as small as birds .
7 ) Intelligent roads ( really highways ) will allow humans to sit back and let the computers do the driving .
As you can tell by my gratuitous use of hyperlinks , many of these technologies are in development if not in commercial use .
None , however , are so widespread or dominant in their field that we can point to them and say “ oh , well that ’s obviously come to pass . ”
Like any good critic , Anissimov uses this lack of overwhelming evidence as a prod for Kurzweil and other futurists .
He calls for a departure from “ story telling ” futurism towards one that focuses on probability distributions for events .
Anissimov asks for all of us science minded folk to hold our futurists to strict account .
If we do n’t police these wild theorists , who will ?
And in this corner , the champ …
Well , Kurzweil will .
In his retort he carefully points out the ways in which he has already pursued the efforts that Anissimov is advocating .
His predictions in TASM were for decades , not particular years ( 2009 to 2019 , 2019 to 2029,etc ) .
Most of his forecasts should be seen as having a plus or minus probably distribution around them .
Kurzweil is also writing his own report to review and analyze his work in TASM .
According to his response in Accelerating Futures , that report is forthcoming .
In short , the futurist is not giving us magical exact dates , and is critical of his own work .
Of course , he also illustrates the ways in which Anissimov fails as a critic .
Grabbing 7 out of 108 predictions and using them to declare a failure is misleading .
Even if all seven are wrong ( more on that below ) what about the other 101 ?
Personally , I ’m impressed with anyone who has greater than 90 % accuracy in future forecasting .
Kurzweil also questions whether being off by a few years is really failing to predict the future .
If all seven come to pass in 2012 , was Kurzweil an idiot ?
By asking for probability distributions to predictions , but then demanding precision in those predictions to qualify for success , Anissimov is venturing into ( but not reaching ) hypocrisy .
Much as he did when challenged by Daniel Lyons in Newsweek , Kurzweil also takes the opportunity to actively defend his predictions one by one .
Again , I ’m paraphrasing grotesquely , so feel free to jump to Accelerating Future and read the original responses :
1 ) iPod shuffles , health monitors , hearing aids … these are all computers that can be worn on the body and fit the prediction .
2 ) Speech to text is gaining ground .
It ’s available in hand held devices , and as ( semi ) popular Apps on smartphones .
3 ) The technology to project images on the eye from a device embedded in glasses does exist .
It is n’t common yet .
4 ) By 3D we mean any layering of silicon , not necessarily cubes .
Such 3D computer chips are being shipped for sale now and becoming more common every day .
5 ) Like speech to text , this technology is gaining ground and has related Apps for smartphones .
6 ) Drones are a major part of the war in Afghanistan .
Some of their explosive ordinance is the size of birds and contain their own navigating intelligence .
7 ) Kurzweil does n’t address this one directly .
I ’d agree with Anissimov that we can consider it largely a “ fail ” , but just for now .
The next few years could prove Kurzweil correct .
Even looking just at these cherry picked predictions from TASM , I ’m going to give this debate to Kurzweil .
If we included the other 101 , I ’m inclined to think that the futurist will win there as well .
We ’ll have to wait for Kurzweil ’s essay on the subject and see how he interprets his work in TASM .
According to his blog response the score ( in his thoughts ) is : 89 correct , 13 “ essentially correct ” , 3 partially correct , 2 are ten years off , 1 is just wrong ( but it was tongue in cheek anyway ) .
Again , I find 90 % or greater accuracy to be remarkable .
Of course , when reviewing your own work it ’s easy to see how you were right .
I look forward to how others will score Kurzweil after a careful examination of all 108 predictions ( starting with making sure there are really 108 of them ) .
If most of these are accurate , what does that mean for the future ?
Not much .
Sure , it may mean that Kurzweil is extraordinarily gifted at seeing how trends will develop in the future .
Yet those predictions in of themselves are not what causes something to happen .
It takes the combined work of the global scientific community to create the steady rising tide of technology that affects our lives .
At best , futurists can provide us with the insight to avoid upcoming dangers .
Bioterrorism , nanotechnological pollution , anti-technology fundamentalism … these are potential conflicts that Kurzweil , or others , are actively seeking to avoid .
That ’s the real part of Kurzweil ’s work that I admire .
Correct predictions in a book are just credentials that can help the Kurzweils of the world convince our leaders to plan for both the good and the bad of the future .
Through his work at Singularity University , and his books and lectures , Kurzweil may convince enough of us to look forward and plan for what may come .
I think we should listen .
He seems to know what the hell he is talking about .

Climate Change Coming “ Faster Than Expected ”
by Kent M. Pitman ( Tuesday , April 15 , 2008 )
My Personal Position on Climate Change
I believe Climate Change is real and must be dealt with now .
Not later .
Now .
We are already late enough that we 're seeing unwanted effects we cannot undo .
If we act now , we can lessen future effects , and we may be able to stop the really bad ones .
If we wait , future effects will be worse and things will probably soon run so out of control that the future of mankind is threatened .
Why Faster Than Expected ?
Much is written about the probabilities .
Much more will be written .
People wish it were n't so , and they have motivation to want to soften it in their minds .
No matter how much they wish to soften it , they will only make it worse by delaying .
But here 's what 's worse ...
It 's no exaggeration to say that the opposition camp is poised to outright excoriate anyone found to have sounded more dire than any particular factoid bears .
The problem is that correct predicting requires sometimes overstating and sometimes understating .
Predictions can't be balanced on a case - by - case basis , and showing that someone erred on the high end does n't disprove the methodology they used to get there .
Let 's look at how the effect I 'm talking about plays out on a simpler issue ...
Suppose I have a practice of guessing ages .
Suppose I 'm not great at getting it exactly right , but I 'm basically right on average .
Suppose I can guess 5 years one side or the other of your correct age .
So you 're 30 and I sometimes guess 25 or 26 or anything up to 35 .
When I say 25 or 26 , I 'm within range and you applaud me for being within the stated range .
But when I say 31 or 32 , let 's say you accuse me of exaggerating and being mean .
So I learn to guess lower .
I take my best guess and I subtract 5 .
You'd think that would make me wrong more .
And it does .
Now I guess in the range 20 - 30 instead of 25 - 35 .
So I used to hit the mark within 5 above or below most of the time , now I often guess outside the range .
You 'd think that would be bad .
But people like it when I 'm wrong on the low end because it flatters them , favoring what they want to believe .
So I might find that even though I 'm wrong more , I 'm forgiven for this kind of wrong .
And even though I was right more before ( I only said I was guessing within 5 anyway , but I was not liked for overguessing ) , I was n't forgiven for being right in that case .
That 's what I think is happening in the media .
The populace wants to be flattered .
So politicians are flattering them .
Media are flattering them .
Even scientists are flattering them .
Not by telling falsehoods , but by pulling punches on the worst case scenarios .
So the problem is that since a great deal of it is only probably true , not provably true , it will not be written about .
It will , therefore , come as a surprise later when some of it really is true because no one wants to hint at it until they can see it 's really going to happen .
So watch for phrases like “ faster than expected ” to occur more and more in news stories as these “ probably ” scenarios turn out to be true .
It 's already happening .
Google it .
Some examples ( many accumulated , as predicted , after April 15 , 2008 , when this article was originally written ) :
( Click to skip forward past these citations . )
This essay was written 15 April 2008 .
Articles below here had already been published when I came up with this theory and went checking to see if there was a pattern of such articles .
( Click to skip back past these citations . )
Lack of Understanding of Math
Too many people do n't understand math and that 's making a mess of things , too .
I think one reason scientists are worried and other people are less worried is that scientists hear the language of math and understand its significance when applied to the real world , while many so - called “ normal people ” think that math and the real world are not related .
Words like “ non-linear “ or “ exponential ” come up a lot in news stories .
If you do n't know what this word means , you should find a friendly mathematician and ask .
But in effect the important part is that the progression is not a straight line ( non-linear ) and is twisted upward and upward faster and faster all the time ( exponential ) .
Like “ today is bad ” , “ tomorrow it is worse ” , and “ the next day is even more worse than the previous day . ”
It 's like the story of what would happen if you had a penny and doubled it every day .
It does n't sound like much until you see it played out , but ...
Day Amount 1 $ 0.01 2 $ 0.02 3 $ 0.04 4 $ 0.08 5 $ 0.16 6 $ 0.32 7 $ 0.64 8 $ 1.28 9 $ 2.56 10 $ 5.12 11 $ 10.24 12 $ 20.48 13 $ 40.96 14 $ 81.92 15 $ 163.84 16 $ 327.68 17 $ 655.36 18 $ 1,310.72 19 $ 2,621.44 20 $ 5,242.88 21 $ 10,485.76 22 $ 20,971.52 23 $ 41,943.04 24 $ 83,886.08 25 $ 167,772.16 26 $ 335,544.32 27 $ 671,088.64 28 $ 1,342,177.28
Now imagine that 's not a penny doubling but a measure of the difficulty of fixing the problem by looking at cost in dollars .
And let 's note one other thing : we do n't know if it 's really doubling .
It might be less .
That 'd be good .
But it 's probably not .
Let 's suppose we 're off by even just a tiny bit .
Let 's say it goes up by a factor of 2.3 every time instead of a factor of 2 .
How does that affect things ?
Day Amount 1 $ 0.01 2 $ 0.02 3 $ 0.05 4 $ 0.12 5 $ 0.28 6 $ 0.64 7 $ 1.48 8 $ 3.40 9 $ 7.83 10 $ 18.01 11 $ 41.43 12 $ 95.28 13 $ 219.15 14 $ 504.04 15 $ 1,159.28 16 $ 2,666.35 17 $ 6,132.61 18 $ 14,105.00 19 $ 32,441.51 20 $ 74,615.47 21 $ 171,615.58 22 $ 394,715.84 23 $ 907,846.43 24 $ 2,088,046.80 25 $ 4,802,507.64 26 $ 11,045,767.57 27 $ 25,405,265.42 28 $ 58,432,110.46
It seems like such a little difference .
But look at the outcome after 28 days ...
$ 58,432,110.46 instead of $ 1,342,177.28 .
The cost of fixing the problem might instead be like that .
You do n't even want to know what happens if the problem is tripling in cost rather than just doubling or multiplying by 2.3 do you ?
I did n't think so .
But I 'll tell you anyway .
On day 28 , the amount would be $ 76,255,974,849.87
In fact , here 's a table of how much the difference in cost is if we 're off by small factors in how fast thing are getting worse :
Starting with one penny ...
Every day
multiplying by ... Amount After 28 Days ...
Or , in plain English ... 2 $ 1,342,177.28 one million or so 3 $ 76,255,974,849.87 seventy - six billion or so 4 $ 180,143,985,094,819.84 one hundred and eighty trillion or so 5 $ 74,505,805,969,238,290.00 seventy - four quadrillion or so 6 $ 10,234,903,690,774,692,000.00 ten quintillion or so 7 $ 657,123,623,635,342,900,000.00 six hundred and fifty - seven quintillion 8 $ 24,178,516,392,292,584,000,000.00 twenty - four sextillion or so 9 $ 581,497,370,030,400,600,000,000.00 five hundred and eighty - one sextillion or so 10 $ 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.00 ten septillion or so
Let me help you read that table correctly .
By now you know it says that if we think we have a penny and it 's doubling daily , after a month it will be $ 1,342,177.28 .
But it also says that if we 're off by a factor of 5 in our understanding of how fast the rise is , so that it 's really going up by a factor of 10 every day instead of a factor of 2 , then the amount at the end of 28 days is not one million dollars but ten septillion dollars .
That 's the dilemma we face .
Of course , we can't really cost it out .
So no one is reporting the cost .
But that does n't mean there is no cost .
It just means the cost might be anything .
All we know is that the rate of increase in the cost is not constant , so it will be getting worse and worse , just like in that example .
So we 'd better start fixing it now , while it 's cheap .
The longer we wait , the more likely it is to cost us a million dollars to fix ... or maybe ten septillion .
I wo n't really scare you with the numbers that happen if we 're off by more than a factor of five , but it should scare you .
And it should scare you to think that at some point there wo n't be enough money in all the world to do what is needed .
No , it 's probably not increasing by the day like that .
But the point is that even if it's by the month or by the year , the rate at which things are going faster appears to be increasing .
That 's called acceleration .
Acceleration is bad in situations like this .
How bad is open to question , but it 's bad almost any way you cut it .
We need to be putting on the brakes ( decelerating ) not leaning harder on the gas ( if you 'll pardon the pun ) .
The Nature of Optimism
The public does n't want to live just in fear .
There 's an appetite for stories that give hope and suggest we can move apace without fear .
And we do need hope .
But , I claim , we 're getting more than our share of that .
I 'm not anti-optimism , by the way .
But the optimism , if there is any to be had , comes in this situation when people confront the truth .
The more avoidance , the less there is to be optimistic about .
Hope gives us a reason to live .
But fear gives us a reason to move quickly .
When being chased by an enemy , it can be more optimistic to be running scared than sitting unafraid .
Optimism is n't a synonym for “ without fear . ”
The Risk of Inaction
Some people think it 's just as important not to do the wrong thing .
It is important not to do the wrong thing .
We have to be as right as we can .
It would be nice if we could just wait until we were sure we were right .
But it 's not clear that it 's safe to wait .
Some guessing may be required .
In decision making , especially in situations where people are acting politically , the status quo is often presented as a sort of neutral choice , where the risk is associated with doing something and there 's no risk to the status quo .
That 's silly , of course .
If you 're at the bottom of a hill exposed to an oncoming avalanche , the status quo ( sitting still ) can be quite risky .
A decision is a decision , and it needs to be seen that way .
We 're making decisions all the time by inaction on the environment .
We 're not waiting to decide whether to do something risky ; we 're doing something known to be risky and we 're wondering if we should do something different .
And at some point , even if we do n't know what the right or wrong fix is , we need to admit that the cost of inaction is so high that we need to just go with our best guess and cross our collective fingers in hope .
Because we know that sitting still and doing nothing while crossing our collective fingers is not going to get the job done .
Bush on Climate
Bush 's record has been terrible on these issues .
He has worked against the Kyoto treaty .
He has worked to suppress critical data about climate change .
He has in general delayed action in ways that have been extraordinarily hurtful .
Now , probably worried about his pathetic place in history , he is trying to talk about climate change .
He 's giving a speech tomorrow on climate change .
It 's said he 'll be finally urging all nations to establish national goals of cutting emissions .
If it 's true , it 's something he should have done earlier .
But this issue is too important for partisan politics .
Yes , it 's hard to support people who one thinks might be working toward cynical ends .
I 'm not saying re-elect him .
But if he finally comes out and sets explicit , aggressive goals for greenhouse gas emissions , and insists that other nations do likewise , we should support him and applaud him .
It matters to have good standards — no matter who puts them in place .
It matters to do it sooner rather than later .
It does n't matter whose name is in the history books .
It matters that there are history books .
If the cost is writing his name into the books , and the effect is that we get what we need , then let 's rev up the printing presses and get to it .
Update ( 17 Apr 2008 ) : Well , he gave his speech , and the proposal was both inadequately aggressive in its goals and not explicit in various critical details .
Alas .
Well , let 's hope he gets a clue soon .
Hopefully everyone will still retain an open mind if he does .
Update ( 18 Apr 2008 ) : Underscoring this ongoing pattern of non-commitment further , according to an Associated Press article published at PhysOrg.com , talks in Paris among the 16 countries ( including the US ) that produce about 80 percent of the world 's carbon emissions concluded without agreement today ( Friday , April 18 , 2008 ) .
Two follow - up meetings are scheduled for May and June .
Quoting the article : “ The EU has pledged to cut its emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 , while the United States has not committed to any fixed emissions cuts .
Speaking in Washington on Wednesday , President Bush said only that the U.S. should stop the rise in its emissions by 2025 . ” Update ( 12 Jul 2008 ) :
At this point , I think he 's just trying to hide the damage his administration has caused , and which he must surely know he has caused , in some vain attempt to maximize the number of good words he 's used and to minimize the number of brave actions he will take .
This week 's reports on White House suppression of EPA findings are just the latest examples , as discussed in a story in the Los Angeles Times , excerpted here : The Bush administration Friday rejected its own experts ' conclusion that global warming poses a threat to the public welfare , launching a comment period that will delay action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at least until the next president takes office .
...
Bill Kovacs , a U.S. Chamber of Commerce vice president , said the EPA staff 's proposals were “ an unprecedented power grab by unelected officials who want to stretch the application of the Clean Air Act into regulation of the entire economy . ”
...
White House Press Secretary Dana Perino said in a written statement that the EPA staff proposal would have given the agency “ unprecedented power affecting anyone who uses or produces energy -- from stores and manufacturing facilities to power plants , farmers , even schools , hospitals and apartment buildings . ”
She said the EPA would have functioned “ like a local planning and zoning board , with potentially devastating effects on our economy . ”
...
EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson said he would receive comments for 120 days on how the government should regulate greenhouse gases , a step that Joan Claybrook , president of the public - interest lobbying group Public Citizen , said would guarantee that “ the issue will not be dealt with until a new administration comes to town . ”
...
In a draft of the document completed in May , EPA staff members concluded that regulations reducing greenhouse gas emissions could save $ 2 trillion through lowered gasoline costs and other benefits over 30 years .
In the final document , that figure was slashed more than 50 % , to $ 830 billion .
The lower figure is based largely on an estimate that gasoline will cost $ 2 a gallon over the next three decades , less than half the current price .
It 's almost as if he 's betting there will be a Democratic administration to follow , and that they can “ take the heat ” for what must necessarily be done .
The saddest thing of all is that he does not understand the hurt caused by simply delaying .
To him , it 's the same problem whether we start now or start in January .
But really the problem is every day worse , and delaying is not just putting this onto someone else 's watch , but in fact is accepting additional certain cost to the world through willful delay .
The best case scenario he can hope for , at this point , is that history will remember him badly .
The worst case is that there will be no one left to write nor later read any such history .
It was heartening recently to see Al Sharpton and Pat Robertson team up to make a commercial encouraging people to care about this matter .
Let 's have more of that .
Politicians may disagree on some things .
But this should n't be one of them .
About the 2008 Presidential Race
I 've been quite worried that none of the likely candidates is taking Climate Change adequately seriously .
I think Obama is looking at it most seriously .
Repeated statements like this are encouraging :
“ I will make a commitment that Al Gore will be at the table and play a central part in us figuring out how we solve this problem .
He 's somebody I talk to on a regular basis .
I 'm already consulting with him in terms of these issues , but climate change is real .
It is something we have to deal with now , not 10 years from now , not 20 years from now . ”
Source : The Washington Post ( 2 - Apr-2008 )
Remarks like these are important , too :
“ All of us are going to have to change our habits .
We are a wasteful culture , ” he said .
It takes great political courage to tell people what they do n't want to hear .
But the problem can't be fixed by electing the leader most willing to lie to us .
Ask Your Candidates Hard Questions
If you ’re a US citizen , please participate in the 2008 election process and make sure to communicate to your candidate of choice the importance of the climate change issue .
I ca n’t tell you who to vote for .
We each have to think very hard on that matter .
What I ’d ask you to do is to get involved in making sure your chosen candidate knows this issue matters .
Here are some remarks that I posted at Universe Today in January 2008 :
Everyone should ask their preferred presidential candidate :
If you believe the Earth is getting warmer at an alarming rate , why is this not the most important thing on your presidential agenda ?
If you believe the recent unusually warm readings are not something to worry about , upon what scientific evidence do you base your sense of relaxed comfort ?
If you are not sure whether to be alarmed at recently observed warm temperatures or not , what are some examples of specific signs you 're looking for that , if they were seen , would cause you to think " maybe I should take this more seriously . "
If you delay strong action now , and later find that it had been essential to act earlier , how shall we judge your degree of personal responsibility for that mistake ?
And , finally , if it turns out that there is global warming but it's not man-made , do you think that makes the situation better or worse ?
If this situation could magically be known to NOT be man-made , would you then ignore the problem and just assume nature cares about us enough to correct things on its own ?
What is your plan for this eventuality ?
Summary
The population as a whole does n't seem to trust what it can not see .
That 's very sad , because Science is all about how to overcome that .
The population really needs to trust Science on this one .
No , you do n't have to blindly trust it if you do n't want to .
Go out and learn some Science and look at the data critically yourself .
Science is not just one more form of mysticism asking you to trust it without any understanding .
It is all about measuring and testing and reproducing things .
But measuring and testing and reproducing only goes so far .
At some point you have to put all that you 've learned about prediction to the test .
If the only way to work up a fear about the end of the world is to experience it , that 's bad .
We need to see the waterfall on the horizon and have Science turn the boat now while the steering is still even partly working .
The public is in denial .
But that does n't mean the problem is not happening .
Will it happen with certainty ?
No one can say .
But will it probably happen ?
Yes .
And it will probably happen “ faster than expected ” .

BDR TO BECOME AN ARCHIVE FROM 2015
As some of you may have noticed BDR has been very quiet on the update front for over a year now .
Since september last year ( 2013 ) I have been studying and have taken on other responsibilities in my day to day life .
I held off on making a desicion and thought I may find time to get new updates on the site , but I have recently come to the conclusion that I need to concentrate on new things and move my attention away from BDR .
The site will stay online as an archive and will continiue to be free but there will be no more blog updates or new music .
I may decide to start posting on the site again sometime in the distant future but for now I feel I need to make this statement and let the subject rest .
I know the site has brought a huge amount of people alot of joy and I 'm really happy that I can leave all the content online for others to discover .
Much love and respect to everyone who helped me and made the journey so much fun , you know who you are ... xxx Disowned : )

Here is collection of weird animals :
Though they may not be ready to embrace socialism by name , many Americans are experiencing a general shakiness in their faith in capitalism .
In the midst of congressional debates over healthcare , cap and trade , and new financial regulations , they ’re rightly asking :
Does the profit motive provide appropriate solutions to all problems ?
Does the criterion of “ winning or losing ” apply to all socioeconomic circumstances ?
The questions apply to other areas not dominating the headlines , such as the justice system .
If healthcare should n’t be denied on financial grounds , is n’t it equally objectionable that “ justice ” improves with high - powered ( and expensive ) legal representation ?
Life savings can evaporate in legal fees as easily as in hospital fees .
Even further from the headlines , is our culture of “ free ” expression – the speech , images , and music dominating media – the best imaginable ?
Considering their importance for cultural wellbeing and upliftment , we might question our “ whatever sells ” approach .
In his recent documentary , “ Capitalism : A Love Story , ” Michael Moore distinguishes between democracy and “ evil ” capitalism , but they are related practices .
Our culture reflects people ’s choices , voting with their purchases .
Mr. Moore ’s ire for Wall Street greed is understandable .
But be wary whenever someone nominates another abstract enemy – the war on drugs , the war on poverty , the war on illiteracy , the war on terrorism ( and countless other “ isms ” ) … the war on capitalism ?
Sincere citizens want to correct these problems , but there is often an insidious self - deception in the way we frame the issue , as though we confront an independent entity completely removed from our choices and actions as individuals or societies .
How often does victory in such “ wars ” have something of the futile elusiveness of shadow - boxing ?
Capitalism and democracy are not about getting the best of anything – sometimes they come close , but that ’s not the criterion .
They tend to give us only what the majority wants – that ’s it .
It puts the onus on us .
Therefore , we should be equally distrustful of blaming capitalism or overcrediting it .
Such either / or thinking runs into the ditch of polarized , name - calling politics :
Who ’s to blame , lenders or borrowers ?
Do we have to choose ?
Sports competition is often a metaphor for capitalism .
Coaches with a “ winning is everything ” attitude are admired .
But one thing should be clear by now : Winning should not be the only criterion .
It is estimated that the top 20 financial corporations in this country control 70 percent of US financial assets , up from 12 percent in 1990 .
Projected to its logical conclusion , do we eventually arrive at a champion ?
Then what ?
The same faith in competition rules the courts .
In an adversarial system , the lawyer ’s objective is winning , not truth per se .
Regulations to rein in abuses create new hurdles in the contest .
Loopholes will always be found by those intent on doing so .
Nothing overrides intent , which is why faith in new laws or systems must be tempered .
With pure motive , the old rules , or no rules at all , would probably work just fine .
Without pure motive , does the system really matter ?
Our founding fathers understood that freedom without virtue is an alluring illusion .
Our contemporary ideas on freedom need critical examination .
A man driven by greed may be free to pursue his desires , but that “ base camp ” definition of freedom does not preclude enslavement to baser desires .
Pundits or artists may freely peddle their sensational impulses , but if responsibility is missing , freedom is deformed .
Freedom is nothing without right choices .
If we are enslaved by a foreign tyrant or by our own self - destructive appetites , what is the difference ?
There will always be a debate over how much government oversight is required .
President Reagan famously declared that “ government is the problem ” – another enemy .
But nonintrusive government is earned – or lost – by an exact formula : “ ... when men are prepared for it , that will be the kind of government which they will have ” said Henry David Thoreau .
Real freedom is a hard - won spiritual condition , not the law of the jungle .
Solutions are sought in theories , philosophies , systems of government , new programs , corrective legislation , and then more legislation correcting the corrections … anywhere but in the hearts of men , and anything but genuine self - government that preempts legislation .
There is no shortage of prominent figures designating enemies , always with one glaring omission .
But as long as we ’re making lists , we might want to take counsel of a bit of wisdom from Walt Kelly ’s comic strip character , Pogo : “ We have met the enemy and he is us . ”
David Arzouman is an artist , composer , writer , and educator developing a new art school in Tokyo .
The Star Trek Online beta was loads of fun , but also boring .
Of course , it was still the beta so not all of the features were implemented yet , but it felt rather repetitive .
My main issue was that while I was gaining levels , I never felt any stronger .
You can spend experience points on character - enhancing talents , but the bonuses are hardly noticeable .
Things really started to pick up for me after I got my new ship , though .
Finally getting past your starter ship makes a huge difference but it took a VERY long time to get .
Everyone in the chat really did talk about their favorite captains the whole time .

There has been a lot of talk about magnet links since The Pirate Bay decided to include them on their site recently .
Various BitTorrent clients quickly added support for these type of links , and recently the first ' magnet - only ' torrent index opened to the public .
Last November , The Pirate Bay decided to close down its tracker .
According to The Pirate Bay team , BitTorrent has evolved up to a point where trackers are no longer needed .
“ We ’re talking to the other torrent admins on doing magnet links , ” a Pirate Bay insider told TorrentFreak , adding that they might even stop serving torrents in the future .
Following this announcement , several torrent clients quickly added support for magnet links .
The format was already supported by uTorrent and Vuze , but Transmission , BitComet and others soon followed after the Pirate Bay announcement .
Although magnet links work very well , BitTorrent cannot rely solely on this type of link just yet .
The .torrent files still hold crucial information needed to start the downloading process , and this information has to be available in the swarm .
Despite this , it is possible to setup a torrent site without torrents , solely relying on magnet links and saving precious bandwidth and resources .
This is exactly what the newly - launched TorrIndex does .
Instead of hosting torrent files , the site uses magnet links exclusively .
The magnet links on TorrIndex also include the trackers from the original torrent , and they are properly formatted so they look just like regular torrent downloads in your torrent client .
TorrIndex gathers the links from various other torrent sites on the net and also allows users to add magnet links to the site .
At first sight it seems that the site uses well respected and moderated sources , since the number of fake and spammy magnet links are lower than on many regular torrent sites .
Aside from the fact that TorrIndex is the first magnet - only torrent index , the site ’s setup is pretty straightforward .
There is no option to comment on any of the links and there are no other fancy features , it ’s just a searchable index of magnet links .
Magnet ’s to replace torrents ?
TorrentFreak contacted the owner of the site , who told us that everything is totally automated .
The magnet links are put in categories automatically based on the filetype , size and a few other parameters .
Another novelty is that TorrIndex is the first to use DHT information for their seed and peer count , in addition to the statistics reported by the trackers .
“ We collect the numbers from trackers and the DHT cloud , ” the owner said .
TorrIndex is currently still in the Beta testing phase , so do n’t be surprised if something appears to be broken .
We ’re told that the design will be updated and comment and torrent rating features are under consideration .
The site proves that it ’s possible to start a torrent site without having to host actual torrent files .
We predict that many sites like this will follow in the months to come , and it would n’t surprise us if The Pirate Bay also converts to a magnet - only index in the future .
By By Stephanie Dearing Dec 12 , 2009 in Crime Outspoken Chairman of the Commission for Public Complaints Against the RCMP ( Royal Canadian Mounted Police ) , Paul E. Kennedy , has issued two reports in the past week that rip the RCMP for their tasering practices .
" This incident is a compelling case which ought to cause the RCMP itself to be concerned and take action . "
Kennedy reviewed the case after receiving a complaint from the girl 's mother .
His investigation found that the RCMP constables ' certification to use the taser was expired at the time of the incident .
Kennedy also said that the RCMP 's investigation into the incident was " ... deficient because of its lack of depth , timeliness and management . "
Kennedy criticized the RCMP for not having an across - the - board standard for self investigation , saying the RCMPs internal investigations are often " flawed and inconsistent . "
He also found that " The Constable deployed the Taser against Miss X when it was unreasonable to do so . "
Kennedy made 14 recommendations , saying " The RCMP has reached a crossroads in its development as a policing agency .
How it responds to the challenges to its reputation as a world - renowned agency will be determined not by statements confirming an understanding that these challenges exist but by embracing a philosophy of change and by making a concerted effort to implement that philosophy . "
Another report released this week was concerned with the Robert Dziekanski case .
In October 2007 , Robert Dziekanski lost his life after being tasered multiple times by the RCMP at the Vancouver Airport .
In the Dziekanski case , which is still undergoing a " ... the conduct of the four members of the RCMP who responded to the 911 calls of a disturbance being caused by Mr. Dziekanski fell short of that expected of members of the RCMP .
Additionally , while the subsequent investigation was found to be unbiased , it could have been done better .
The CPC report also raises concerns about the manner in which the RCMP communicated with the public following Mr. Dziekanski's death . "
The Commission had received 100 complaints about the RCMP 's handling of Robert Dziekanski , which is why Kennedy released the report on December 8 .
In his The report on the tasering of the girl held at the Arctic Tern was not the first time Kennedy has found RCMP self - investigations fell short .
This summer , Kennedy released a report called In 2008 , the Commission looked into the use of tasers by the RCMP and noted three main " ... that the inappropriate assessment of a subject 's behaviour has resulted in elevating the level of intervention beyond what was acceptable according to the RCMP 's use of force model ; that the position of the CEW on the use of force model allows for the deployment of the weapon far too early in police encounters ; and that RCMP data collection and analysis practices for the CEW usage database are both ineffective and inefficient . "
The Commission had been asked to conduct the review by then - Minister of Public Safety , Stockwell Day .
The recommendations made in the report still have not been implemented .
Kennedy was
One report investigated a complaint about a girl in custody being tasered .
In March 2007 , a 15 year old girl who was detained in the Northwest Territories at the Arctic Tern Youth Facility , was tasered while she was being restrained on the floor of the detention center .
Handcuffed and held face down by three youth officers from the detention facility , the agitated girl refused to take her anti-depressant medication .
Two other youth officers were in attendance .
The RCMP were called in from the Inuvik detachment , and Constable Noella Cockney attended the call , threatened the girl with tasering if she failed to comply , then tasered the girl .
The press release from the office of the Commission states that the victim of the tasering was asked to go to segregation , which the girl refused each time .
Kennedy saidKennedy reviewed the case after receiving a complaint from the girl 's mother .
His investigation found that the RCMP constables ' certification to use the taser was expired at the time of the incident .

His multiple findings were summarized by stating in a press release The Commission had received 100 complaints about the RCMP 's handling of Robert Dziekanski , which is why Kennedy released the report on December 8 .
In his findings , Kennedy said the RCMP misled the public by releasing the wrong information to the press and by not correcting the errors .
The report on the tasering of the girl held at the Arctic Tern was not the first time Kennedy has found RCMP self - investigations fell short .
This summer , Kennedy released a report called Public Interest Investigation Police Investigating the Police , and the RCMP took exception to Kennedy 's criticisms .
In 2008 , the Commission looked into the use of tasers by the RCMP and noted three main concerns The Commission had been asked to conduct the review by then - Minister of Public Safety , Stockwell Day .
The recommendations made in the report still have not been implemented .
Kennedy was reappointed to his position last year , but his term ends December 31 and the Conservative party has said his term will not be renewed .
Kennedy has worked for the government of Canada since 1974 .

Somewhere along the line  at a wedding , at a child ’s birthday party , in third - grade music class  everybody has done the hokey pokey .
Admit it : you sang the silly song , you did the silly dance .
You know the one :
You put your right hand in ,
You put your right hand out ,
You put your right hand in ,
And you shake it all about .
You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around .
That ’s what it ’s all about .
Popular as the song is , its authorship has long been in dispute , with the credit usually going to Larry LaPrise , who as part of a musical group , the Ram Trio , is said to have created it in Sun Valley , Idaho , as a novelty number to entertain vacationing skiers .
The trio , whose other members were Charles Peter Macak and Tafft Baker , recorded the song , “ The Hokey Pokey , ” in the late 1940s .
There are many reasons to question this version of the song ’s provenance , however .
Among them is that a very similar song , “ The Hokey Pokey Dance , ” was copyrighted a few years earlier , in 1944 , by a club musician from Scranton , Pa. , named Robert Degen .
Mr. Degen  who claimed for decades that Mr. LaPrise had stolen his song  died in Lexington , Ky. , on Nov. 23 , his 104th birthday .
( Mr. LaPrise died in 1996 , and the two men never met . )
How running jogs your memory by creating new brain cells
A regular jog leads to the growth of new cells in the area of the brain which boosts your memory
We all know running is good for your body .
But it can also do wonders for the mind , according to Cambridge University scientists
A regular jog leads to the growth of new cells in the area of the brain which boosts your memory , a study has found .
It is not clear why aerobic exercise triggers the growth of grey matter ( known as neurogenesis ) but it may be linked to increased blood flow or higher levels of hormones that are released while exercising .
Timothy Bussey a behavioural neuroscientist at Cambridge and a senior author on the study said the team studied two groups of mice , one which had umlimited access to a running wheel while the other did not .
After a few days left alone , they put both groups of mice through a series of memory tests on a computer screen .
It displayed two identical squares side by side , and if they nudged the one on the left with their nose they received a sugar pellet reward , while the one on the right yielded nothing .
The mice who had been running were almost twice as successful as those in the control group at picking the correct square .
At the start of the test , the squares were 30 cm apart , but got closer and closer together until they were almost touching .
This part of the experiment was designed to test how good the mice were at separating two very similar memories .
The human equivalent could be remembering what a person had for dinner yesterday and the day before , or where they parked on different trips to the supermarket .
The greatest improvement was seen in the later stages of the experiment , when the two squares were so close they nearly touched , according to a report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The sedentary mice got steadily worse at the test because their memories became too similar to separate .
M Bussey told the Guardian : ' At this stage of the experiment , the two memories the mice are forming of the squares are very similar .
It is when they have to distinguish between the two that these new brain cells really make a difference . '
He added : ' We know exercise can be good for healthy brain function , but this work provides us with a mechanism for the effect . '
The scientists also tried to wrongfoot the mice by switching the square that produced a food reward but the running mice were quicker to catch on when scientists changed them around .
Nobel Prize winning physicist Wolfgang Ketterle has said running gives him time to think through problems
The running mice clocked up an average of 15 miles ( 24 km ) a day .
Brain tissue taken from the rodents showed that the running mice had grown fresh grey matter during the experiment .
Tissue samples from the dentate gyrus part of the brain , one of the few regions of the adult brain which can grow new cells , revealed on average 6,000 new brain cells had been created .
Previous studies on people with depression have found their symptoms can improve if they exercise regularly .
Some antidepressant drugs work by encouraging the growth of new brain cells .
It is also thought exercise might also reduce stress , which inhibits new brain cells through a hormone called cortisol .
The Cambridge researchers joined forces with colleagues at the US National Institute on Ageing in Maryland to investigate the effect of running .
A few days of running led to the growth of hundreds of thousands of new brain cells that improved the ability to recall memories without confusing them , a skill that is crucial for learning and other cognitive tasks , researchers said .
Many great minds have said they enjoy a jog .
Nobel Prize winning Physicist Wolfgang Ketterle has said : ' When I run , I think about everything : physics , family problems , plans for the weekend .
I have n't made any big discoveries on a run , but it does give me time to think through problems .
Some solutions are obvious , but they are only obvious when you are relaxed enough to find them . '

The Kremlin Kowtow
At a recent meeting with Russian liberals in Moscow , a well - known European intellectual started trying to convince them that , as he put it , " Russia is not a dictatorship these days .
[ President Dmitry ]
Medvedev is trying to liberalize the system , and with time Russia will become a democracy .
You should n’t try to hurry things . "
Not surprisingly , this advice provoked consternation among an audience that had expected at least some encouragement from Continental liberals .
At a conference last month in Berlin , I witnessed another example of this divide .
When I started to raise the question of democratic standards in Western - Russian relations , I was interrupted by another Western attendee .
" You irritate us , " he said .
" International relations are not about values ; they are about power ! "
If he is right , Russian liberals will have to reconsider their expectations about the Western opinion - leaders they have long counted on for moral support and understanding .
A consensus seems to be growing among Western policymakers and intellectuals that Russia is not ready for liberalism and that there are even certain advantages to dealing with the illiberal political order built by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin .
This may be why Western policy toward Russia has only served to shore up the Russian powers that are pursuing anti-Western interests .
The results could be catastrophic — not merely for the activists who are working to make Russia a free country , but for the moral authority of those in the West who preach liberty but practice something quite different .
The U.S. " reset button " policy demonstrates this paradox nicely .
The United States , of course , needs to have a dialogue with Russia on security issues , including arms control .
But turning a nuclear arms pact into the main item on the agenda only reveals how reluctant both sides are to discuss the real issues at stake — the fundamental political differences between the two societies .
Instead , Moscow and Washington revive ghosts of the past and use a Cold - War era mechanism to try to imitate cooperation .
In the end , the U.S. - Russian security dialogue will do little to help President Barack Obama accomplish his goals of reining in an aggressive Iran , ending the war in Afghanistan , and advancing a nonproliferation regime .
Instead , it will work in the Kremlin ’s favor , bolstering Russia ’s great - power status and making it easier to prop up the current authoritarian system .
The European Union ’s policy on Russia is also helping to maintain the Russian status quo , buying Russian energy resources and raw materials , and helping to finance Russia ’s oligarch class and strengthen the political elite .
Having accepted Russia into European institutions — the Council of Europe in particular — European leaders try not to notice that Russia ’s system does not conform to the very principles these organizations are designed to promote .
One could get the impression that , for the sake of advancing their economic interests , European governments have decided not to make an issue out of these principles , convincing themselves that Russia is simply not ready for them yet .
Some Western leaders have no qualms about openly legitimizing the Russian regime .
Gerhard Schroeder , who now serves on the board of the Gazprom - led Nord Stream pipeline project , is just the most well - known example of how morally flexible Western leaders can be for the right price .
The former German chancellor behaves as Russia ’s world envoy , defending the Kremlin ’s policies with such enthusiasm that Germans have started to joke , " The parrot sitting on his shoulder speaks with a Russian accent . "
Another of Putin ’s friends is Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , the Kremlin advocate who long since seems to have stopped caring about his own reputation .
And then there are France ’s leaders .
In his time , former French President Jacques Chirac did not allow what he called " little " European countries to criticize Putin at EU - Russia summits .
Chirac even awarded Putin France ’s highest decoration — the insignia of Grand Croix of the Légion d’Honneur .
He did it secretly , not wanting to infuriate the French public .
Chirac ’s successor , Nicolas Sarkozy , not only thinks it proper to congratulate the Kremlin on manipulated elections , but actually allows the Kremlin to manipulate him politically .
In August 2008 , when France held the EU presidency , Sarkozy pretended not to notice that Moscow was n’t fulfilling two key provisions of the Medvedev - Sarkozy plan to settle the Russian - Georgian conflict : withdrawing Russian troops and allowing international discussion on the final status of Georgia ’s breakaway regions .
This gave the Russian elite further reason to see the European Union as an organization it could string along or simply ignore .
Key to the European policy toward Russia is Germany — and just because Schroeder is n’t in power does n’t mean Schroederization is at an end .
Previous generations of German leaders did business with the Soviet Union , but they at least tried to bring change — or dreamed about it .
One gets the impression that the current German elite , on the other hand , is hoping only to avoid change in Putin ’s Russia .
Although the East Germany - raised Chancellor Angela Merkel was once known as a critic of Russia ’s undemocratic tendencies , her government has expanded its economic cooperation with Russia as the German economy has slumped , seeking deals in the shipping and automotive sectors .
Germany ’s decision to abandon a value - based approach to Russia has encouraged the European Union ’s Russia policy to be equally " pragmatic " — focused on maintaining the status quo , in other words .
True , when some Western leaders come to Moscow they make a point of meeting human rights activists or the moderate opposition .
" They ask us how they can help us .
We explain that they should raise the question of human rights and democracy when talking to Russian leaders , " says Arseny Roginski of the human rights group Memorial .
" But after that , usually nothing happens . "
Western intellectuals are even more prone to the Kremlin ’s enticements than the politicians .
They battle for the honor of taking part in the Valdai Club — a series of regularly arranged meetings with Russian leaders .
At these meetings , prominent attendees have been known to put preapproved questions to the Russians , playing the latter part in the Kremlin - orchestrated show .
" Mister prime minister … you are a democrat ! " exclaimed a leading French intellectual at the meeting with Putin when he was still president .
" You are really a liberal ! " declared a well - known German expert at the meeting with Medvedev .
Experts from the European Council on Foreign Relations recently transmitted the Kremlin ’s ideas to Western audiences in the essay collection , What Does Russia Think ? , which included little in the way of critical assessment , instead simply rehashing justifications for authoritarianism and Moscow ’s geopolitical ambitions .
Leading Kremlin spin doctor Gleb Pavlovsky argued in the afterword , " The consensus that Putin has created in Russia … is a value - based reality .
It is based on the possibility of a free life in a secure environment — something that Americans take for granted . "
Regretfully , the European experts had no response to this assertion .
Does that mean they agree ?
Other intellectuals take part in Kremlin - organized forums to discuss new standards for democracy and Russia ’s contribution to their development .
One such forum took place under Medvedev ’s aegis in Yaroslavl last autumn .
The French and Spanish prime ministers , François Fillon and José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero , respectively , who attended the event , clearly had no real idea what was going on , but their presence raised the event ’s prestige .
Among those taking part in the forum were Western intellectual gurus such as Alvin Toffler , Immanuel Wallerstein , and Fareed Zakaria — who should certainly know better than to give their names to an event that suggests any positive link between " Russia " and " democracy . "
One influential European leader , Robert Cooper , the E.U. director - general for external and politico - military affairs , does not shy from discussing democracy with the Russian political elite .
In an interview with the pro-Kremlin Russian Institute he concluded , " Sometimes I think that the word ‘ democracy ’ becomes problematic .
I would prefer to talk about responsible , open government that defends the rights of nations … but has enough legitimacy to use tough administrative measures when there is a need for them . "
Such an understanding of democracy is exactly what the current Russian government is looking for .
Russia ’s reform - minded forces have long since stopped calling on the West to help advance democracy in Russia .
They understand that transforming Russia is a job for Russian society itself .
But reform - minded Russians expect the West at least to avoid holding back change by supporting the authoritarian forces that would suppress it .
Prominent Russian human rights activists and liberals like Sergei Kovalev , Garry Kasparov , and Grigory Yavlinsky , long considered pro-Western voices , have recently become critics of the West ’s increasingly accommodating policies toward Russia .
One might say that these voices are just a small minority of Russian society .
But if the West loses this pro-Western minority , it will lose Russia altogether .
So what would a more principled Russia policy entail ?
Western leaders must keep liberal and democratic principles in mind while dealing with the Russian elite .
They must be wary of the latest fairy tales about " modernization , " avoid naively spreading the Kremlin ’s ideas , and try to understand what is actually taking place inside the Russian system , which is showing signs of serious instability and degradation and may soon become a challenge for the West .
At the moment , there are no hints that the West is ready to make even these minimal efforts .
This begs the question :
How can Western civilization resolve its own internal problems with democracy if it abandons its mission of promoting liberty ?

Steamwheedle Cartel
Do not forget to loot the little Crate that Knot spawns if you free him !

1400
Open the boxes and loot everything but ONE thing , for example the Poisons that are often in there .
It does n't matter for the NPC if the box is open or if there is no money in there .
Just one thing must be inside !
I even found an epic dagger one time in there , so it can really be worth it !
Shen 'dralar
Libram of Protection :
Libram of Focus
Libram of Rapidity
Darkmoon Faire
Bloodsail Buccaneers
You do n't need to do it in this order , its just the order in which I did it .
First of all , a list of what you have to do :
In former times it seems as if you need to be exalted woth the Steamwheedle cartell while being honored with the Bloodsail Buccaneers .
You can do this in two ways :
Over a longer period of time like I did ( about 3 months ) or very fast .
When you do it slow , you can earn very good money , if you do it fast you will need a great amount to buy all the things you need .
I 'll describe the slow way .
By the time I started with the Achievement , I was revered and honored with the Steamwheedle fractions so I decided to push them to exalted first .
If you are a perfectionist and want to have them on exalted while being honored ( or higher ) with the Bloodsails , start with the pirates first .
As I 've said before , I started with them , but you do n't have to .
There are two ways of farming them to exalted .
The first way is to do Dire Maul runs ( North ) to get the Goblin Skackle Key .
This key drops randomly from all Ogers .
Sometimes you 'll have luck and it drops from the first Mob , sometimes you 'll clear the whole Instance and non drops it .
If you get it , run to the Goblin and complete the Quest Free Knot ! .
This will reward you with 350 reputation for the whole Cartell .
Sometimes you 'll have luck and one of those Librams will drop .
You have two options then : Firstly , you have the Mats for the Librams all the time with you ( I will list them later on ) and instantly turn it in or you just teleport out of the Instance and put it on a Guild Bank ( you can deposit there as much as you want , regardless of the " unique " or you send it to an Alt .
Depending on when the Libram drops I recommend the porting .
As I 've said , I did it slow , so I used this teleporting to sell all the stuff I 've collected , put Runecloth in the AH etc .
Also , doing this is kind of dull .
Teleporting out and taking a break is always nice .
But I know many that just farmed the Libramstuff before and just took it with them to turn them in .
You have to decide .
If you want , you can also do a second quest : The Gordok Ogre Suit
At the first time
It 'll give 250 rep , after that 75 every turn in .
I recommend doing this at least one time for the great rep , after that it depends .
There you can find the leather needed for this quest and other nice things you can sell on the AH .
Sometimes even nice epic recipes !
They still sell on the AH for nice money !
The second way : Farming Mobs , for example the Pirates unter Ratchet .
This way is slightly faster , but you 'll get no Librams or Pristine Black Diamonds while farming there , so I do n't recommend that .
For this , you need an Rogue alt , a good friend that plays a rogue or LOTS of money .
I , for one , leveled a Rogue for this , you only need about lvl 56 .
But first things first .
You start at neutral with them and there is only one way to get them to exalted .
Start off grinding the Mobs at Durnholde .
They give 5 rep per mob and you can do this until 11999 / 12000 Honored .
After that you need a Rogue to pickpocket Heavy Junkboxes for you .
If you have a lvl 80 rogue you can go to LBRS and just farm the hell out of the mobs .
Just stealth around and pickpocket everything .
You will needof them .
If you do it like me , lvl until 56 , then go to the Eastern Plaguelands and farm in Tyrs Hand .
It 's most of the time empty there and you can get up to 55 boxes / h. Also , a little tip : For this , you 'll need much luck and money .
You start at neutral .
If you have n't alreaedy done the quests for this faction , do them !
The second Quest is a classquest from a Item that drops in Diremaul .
You should find at least one while doing your " Free Knot " runs .
If you 're Alliance , you also have to do this Quest : Elven Legends as a Horde this one : Elven Legends .
Every " new " Char has to do that .
Without this Quest you can't turn in the Librams .
After this , you have do turn in about 84 of the Librams .
I will list the Items you need for the Librams , but since they only drop in Dire Maul , you can only hope that there are many in the AH or farm them .
Those Stitchings drop in Stratholme from the Abominations .
Easy to farm .
Farmable in Scholomance .
I hated it !
Happy farming .
This faction really sucksSince you 've raiding the AH whenever possible , you should have a decent amount of Decks .
A Epic deck ( regardless of the lvl , it can be a lvl 60 Deck ) rewards 350 rep per turn in .
I recommend them .
Buy them cheap , resell them for profit !
I made SO much money with that , I bought every deck up to 250g and resold them for 300 - 500g !
But that method needs time and patience .
A rare and green Deck rewards 25 rep per turn in .
Sell these things too !
Not everyone lvls with Items you can buy for Emblems , so you can at least get a decent amount of the gold you 've spent back .
If you are a inscriptionist : Lucky you !
Just farm your ass off .
But before you turn in Decks , I recommend turning in one of those many Items , , for example Thorium Widgets or Armor Kits .
There are many more , just look what is the easiest to get for you .
You can get rep until the halfway of friendly , after that you NEED the Decks .
This is the easiest one .
Just go to Booty Bay and kill everything .
RAMPAGE .
With a group of a few persons , this is easy doable in a few hours .
I hope you like my guide , if I forgot something just say it and I 'll add it .
Also , remember :
Some viewers of President Obama ’s State of the Union address Wednesday night say they could see Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito mouth the words “ No , that ’s not true ” during one contentious moment in the speech .
CNN host Wolf Blitzer said he saw Alito mouth the words during the president ’s criticism of a recent Supreme Court ruling that rolled back decades of restrictions on corporate and union campaign spending .

“ Last week , the Supreme Court reversed a century of law to open the floodgates for special interests — including foreign companies — to spend without limit in our elections , ” Obama said Wednesday night .
At that moment , video footage shows Alito furrowing his brow and shaking his head in disapproval — although he stands up to applaud moments later .
While Raw Story ’s examination of the footage did n’t show Alito saying the words , the claim was backed up by Politico ’s Kasie Hunt , who says she saw Alito mouth “ Not true ” as the president delivered his line .
Alito is considered to be one of the conservatives on the US ’s highest court , and he voted in favor of rolling back campaign finance laws .
Politico suggests that it could have been “ Alito ’s ‘ you lie ’ moment , ” referring to House Rep .
Joe Wilson ’s outburst during the president ’s address to Congress on health care in September .
“ Well , I do n’t think American elections should be bankrolled by America ’s most powerful interests , and worse , by foreign entities , ” the president continued .
“ They should be decided by the American people , and that ’s why I ’m urging Democrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps to right this wrong . ”

The president has been unusually critical of the Supreme Court in the wake of the ruling in Citizens United vs. FEC .
Typically , presidents refrain from criticizing Supreme Court rulings , in an effort to respect the separation of powers — something the president acknowledged briefly in his State of the Union address .
But the SCOTUS decision on campaign finance has taken an unusual amount of heat from politicians and the press alike , with the New York Times calling it a “ radical decision ” and President Obama describing it as “ strik[ing ] at our democracy itself . ”

Peter Moore was previously seen in a video released by the kidnappers British hostage Peter Moore has been released alive after more than two - and - a - half years in captivity in Iraq .
Foreign Secretary David Miliband said the IT consultant from Lincoln , who was captured in Baghdad in May 2007 , was in good health and " absolutely delighted " .
His family said news of his release was " the best Christmas present ever " and " a big black cloud " had been lifted .
Four bodyguards were seized with Mr Moore .
Three were shot dead ; the fourth is also thought to have been killed .
The bodies of Jason Swindlehurst , from Skelmersdale , Lancashire , and Jason Creswell , of Glasgow , were returned to the UK in June 2009 , followed by that of Alec MacLachlan , of Llanelli , Carmarthenshire , in September .
Please turn on JavaScript .

Mr Miliband has called for the release of the body of the fourth guard - Alan McMenemy from Glasgow .
Mr Miliband said Mr Moore , who had been released on Wednesday morning , was in the British Embassy in Baghdad and would be reunited with his family as soon as possible .
Mr Moore 's stepmother Pauline Sweeney told the BBC that hearing of his release was " the best Christmas present ever " .
" We spoke to him this morning .
I just burst into tears and kept asking if it was true .
He sounds really well , very upbeat , he 's cracking jokes , " she said .
" He said when they came in to him this morning , he thought he was going out to a bullet in his head .
ANALYSIS BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner
The sudden and dramatic release of Peter Moore has not come entirely out of the blue .
The Americans have only just handed over a key Shi'ite militant , Qais Al - Khaz'ali , to the Iraqi authorities after holding him since 2007 .
This is the man the kidnappers always wanted back .
They made it clear from the outset they wanted to trade prisoners : Qais and a handful of other Shi'ite militants for the five Britons .
British government policy has always been not to make substantive demands to kidnappers .
The tragedy for most of the British hostages and their families is that Iraq 's political reconciliation process has only now reached a point where Qais could be released without appearing to give in to those kidnappers ' demands .
" He had seen quite a few of the appeal broadcasts , which kept him going and made him realise there were people out there fighting for him and that he was n't forgotten . "
The foreign secretary said he had had a " very moving " conversation with Mr Moore , who was " to put it mildly , absolutely delighted " .
He is undergoing medical checks .
Mr Miliband said : " The joy and relief that will be felt by Peter 's family will be mirrored by the continuing anguish of the family of Alan McMenemy .
" We have believed for some time that he has been killed and his family have been told our view of his likely fate . "
The foreign secretary also told the BBC there were no concessions or deals made to secure Mr Moore 's release .
" This was an Iraqi - led process of political reconciliation in which an armed group has made vows to come within the political system and to renounce violence , and that 's the foundation of Peter Moore 's release , " he said .

Mr Moore had been working for US management consultancy Bearingpoint in Iraq .
The other men were security contractors employed to guard him .
The group was captured at the Iraqi Ministry of Finance by about 40 men disguised as Iraqi policemen .
They were understood to belong to an obscure militia known as the Islamic Shia Resistance , which demanded the release of up to nine of their associates held in US military custody since early 2007 .
Several had already been handed to the Iraqi government and some had since been freed under the reconciliation process .
' Key ' figure released BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said a senior Whitehall official had confirmed that Qais Al - Khaz 'ali - the leader of the group that kidnapped the five Britons in Baghdad - was released " very recently " by the US to the Iraqi authorities .
" The main person the abductors wanted back , I 'm told , is out of US custody ... and handed over to the Iraqis , " he said .
Qais Al - Khazaali had been suspected of involvement in the kidnapping and eventual killing of five US soldiers , Mr Gardner added .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown said : " I am hugely relieved by the wonderful news that Peter has been freed .
Alan McMenemy is believed to have been killed by his captors " At this moment of celebration , we also remember the families of British hostages who have been killed in Iraq and elsewhere .
" And we pledge to continue to do everything we can to bring British hostages back to their loved ones . "
Mr Moore 's father Graeme , 60 , from Wigston , Leicestershire , said he was " over the moon " at the news .
He said : " We are so relieved and we just want to get him home , back now to his family and friends .
" I 'm breaking down , I 'm just so overjoyed for the lad . "
His natural mother , Avril Sweeney , 54 , from Thornton Cleveleys , Lancashire , said : " It 's like a big black cloud has been hanging over me and it has lifted now .
" I can smile again . "
Terry Waite , who himself was a former hostage , said he was absolutely delighted at Mr Moore 's release .
He added : " It is both a very happy time for Peter and his family and ... while the other families will be delighted for him , there will be that tinge of sadness and one keeps them in mind at this point . "

NEW YORK , Jan 7 ( Reuters ) -
The security scare that shut Newark airport for hours and delayed thousands of passengers was caused by a man who slipped into a secure area to give a woman one last goodbye kiss , a newspaper reported on Thursday .
The breach at Newark Liberty International Airport , one of three major airports serving the New York City area , rattled security officials and the airline industry because it came so soon after the attempted Christmas Day bombing of a Detroit - bound airliner .
A videotape of the Newark incident shows the man embracing a woman at the C - 1 security checkpoint before she passes through passenger screening , the Star - Ledger newspaper of New Jersey said , citing unnamed security officials who have viewed the tape .
The man , who was not a passenger , walks past a spot where a Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) officer should have been stationed to move closer to the woman , the paper said .
The woman holds up a rope meant to keep unscreened people out of the secure area so that the man can passes underneath , and they walk hand - in - hand toward the boarding area before disappearing from view , the paper reported .
The man left the airport and has not been identified .
The TSA officer who was working that area has been placed on administrative leave .
U.S. Sen . Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey is attempting to make the video public , a spokesman for the senator said .
“ After viewing video of the security breach , I am even more outraged by the lapse that occurred , ” Lautenberg told the Star - Ledger .
One of the planes hijacked in the Sept. 11 attacks of 2001 took off from Newark airport .
That flight crashed into a Pennsylvania field .

The ex-president of Google China has revealed on his microblog supposed details on Apple 's forthcoming tablet : 10.1 - inch screen with webcam , " awesome UI . "
Kaifu Lee , former president of Google China , someone with supposed close ties to Apple , has revealed several details about Apple 's tablet on his microblog ( translation from Gadget Mix ) :
" The Apple Tablet looks like a bigger iPhone that sports an awesome UI packed in a beautiful 10.1 - inch screen .
The tablet combines the functions of both netbook and kindle , an ebook reader .
It has virtual keyboard for text entry and a webcam for video conferencing . "
This falls in line with recently reported details on the tablet .
Earlier in December analyst Yair Reiner of Oppenheimer predicted that the device would have a 10.1 - inch multi - touch display using the same technology as the iPhone .
He also stated that Apple has been reaching out to book publishers in order to strengthen the position of the tablet as an ebook platform .
AppleInsider reported earlier last week that Apple had plans for a virtual keyboard with a dynamic surface that would give users tactile feedback when typing in order to identify individual keys .
Supporting the idea of a " bigger iPhone , " iPhone developers were reportedly asked to prepare their apps for a demo next month by making them support full - screen resolutions rather than the fixed 320x480 resolutions of the iPhone and iPod touch .
TOP TEN REASONS NOT TO HAVE LASIK SURGERY
1. LASIK causes dry eye
Dry eye is the most common complication of LASIK .
Corneal nerves that are responsible for tear production are severed when the flap is cut .
Medical studies have shown that these nerves never return to normal densities and patterns .
Symptoms of dry eye include pain , burning , foreign body sensation , scratchiness , soreness and eyelid sticking to the eyeball .
The FDA website warns that LASIK - induced dry eye may be permanent .
Approximately 20 % of patients in FDA clinical trials experienced " worse " or " significantly worse " dry eyes at six months after LASIK .
(1) In 2014 , an FDA study found that up to 28 % of patients with no symptoms of dry eyes before LASIK reported dry eye symptoms at three months after LASIK .
Moreover , corneal nerve damage during LASIK may lead to a chronic pain syndrome known as corneal neuralgia .
2. LASIK results in loss of visual quality
LASIK patients have more difficulty seeing detail in dim light ( loss of contrast sensitivity ) and experience an increase in visual symptoms at night ( halos , starbursts , glare , double vision / ghosting , ) .
A published review of data for FDA - approved lasers found that six months after LASIK , 17.5 percent of patients report halos , 19.7 percent report glare ( starbursts ) , 19.3 percent report night - driving problems and 21 percent complain of eye dryness .
(1) The FDA website warns that patients with large pupils may suffer from debilitating visual symptoms at night .
In 2014 , an FDA study found that up to 46 % of patients who had no visual symptoms before surgery , reported at least one visual symptom at three months after surgery .
3 . The cornea is incapable of complete healing after LASIK
The flap never heals .
Researchers found that the tensile strength of the LASIK flap is only 2.4 % of normal cornea .
(2) LASIK flaps can be surgically lifted or accidentally dislodged for the remainder of a patient ’s life .
The FDA website warns that patients who participate in contact sports are not good candidates for LASIK .
LASIK permanently weakens the cornea .
Collagen bands of the cornea provide its form and strength .
LASIK severs these collagen bands and thins the cornea .
(3) The thinner , weaker post - LASIK cornea is more susceptible to forward bulging due to normal intraocular pressure , which may progress to a condition known as keratectasia and corneal failure , requiring corneal transplant .
4 . There are long - term consequences of LASIK
• LASIK affects the accuracy of intraocular pressure measurements , ( 4 ) exposing patients to risk of vision loss from undiagnosed glaucoma .
• Like the general population , LASIK patients will develop cataracts .
Calculation of intraocular lens power for cataract surgery is inaccurate after LASIK .
(5 ) This may result in poor vision following cataract surgery and exposes patients to increased risk of repeat surgeries .
Ironically , steroid drops routinely prescribed after LASIK may hasten the onset of cataracts .
In 2015 , researchers reported that people who've had Lasik are having cataract surgery approximately 10 years earlier , on average , than people with the same axial lengths of the eye who have not had Lasik , and about 15 years earlier , on average , than the general population .
Another study presented in 2015 found that people who have undergone LASIK have cataract surgery six years sooner than people who have not had LASIK .
• Research demonstrates persistent decrease in corneal keratocyte density after LASIK .
(6 ) These cells are vital to the function of the cornea .
Ophthalmologists have speculated that this loss might lead to delayed post - LASIK ectasia .
5. Bilateral simultaneous LASIK is not in patients ’ best interest
In a 2003 survey of American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery ( ASCRS ) members , ( 7 ) 91 % of surgeons who responded did not offer patients the choice of having one eye done at a time .
Performing LASIK on both eyes in the same day places patients at risk of vision loss in both eyes , and denies patients informed consent for the second eye .
The FDA website warns that having LASIK on both eyes at the same time is riskier than having two separate surgeries .
6. Serious complications of LASIK may emerge later
The medical literature contains numerous reports of late - onset LASIK complications such as loss of the cornea due to biomechanical instability , inflammation resulting in corneal haze , flap dislocation , epithelial ingrowth , and retinal detachment .
(8) The LASIK flap creates a permanent portal in the cornea for microorganisms to penetrate , exposing patients to lifelong increased risk of sight - threatening corneal infection .
( 9 ) Complications may emerge weeks , months , or years after seemingly successful LASIK .
7. LASIK does not eliminate the need for glasses
Since LASIK does not eliminate the need for reading glasses after the age of 40 and studies show that visual outcomes of LASIK decline over time , ( 10 ) LASIK patients will likely end up back in glasses – sometimes sooner rather than later .
Imagine putting on an old , outdated pair of glasses .
That 's what LASIK vision is like years after surgery -- your old prescription is permanently lasered onto your corneas .
It 's like being stuck with an old pair of glasses of the wrong power .
8 . The true rate of LASIK complications is unknown
There is no clearinghouse for reporting of LASIK complications .
Moreover , there is no consensus among LASIK surgeons on the definition of a complication .
The FDA allowed laser manufacturers to hide complications reported by LASIK patients in clinical trials by classifying dry eyes and night vision impairment as " symptoms " instead of complications .
( 1)
9. Rehabilitation options after LASIK are limited
LASIK is irreversible , and treatment options for complications are extremely limited .
Hard contact lenses may provide visual improvement if the patient can obtain a good fit and tolerate lenses .
The post -LASIK contact lens fitting process can be time consuming , costly and ultimately unsuccessful .
Many patients eventually give up on hard contacts and struggle to function with impaired vision .
In extreme cases , a corneal transplant is the last resort and does not always result in improved vision .
10 . Safer alternatives to LASIK exist
It is important to remember that LASIK is elective surgery .
There is no sound medical reason to risk vision loss from unnecessary surgery .
Glasses and contact lenses are the safest alternatives .

By now , most Facebook users are aware by some means or another that the company has made changes to its privacy settings .
Though these updates have largely been controversial , there are a handful of changes that are actually good and some that are at least neutral .
They are also just different enough ( but in a subtle way ) to make our previous Facebook privacy guide a little outdated , so we thought we would go over some of the settings again to help our readers lock down their profiles as they please .
The good news : you can still divide up your friends into lists — as many or as few lists as you like !
As we discussed in our previous privacy guide , the reason you want to do this is so you can divvy up permissions ( which we will show you later ) , and you can do this by going to your Friends > All Friends >
Create a new list .
Tweaking access : the new way
The idea is the same as before , but implementation is different .
By going into Settings > Privacy Settings , you can control which types of people can see different kinds of information about you .
Here 's an example from the Profile Information page :
Here , you can set who can access information such as your interests , birthday , political views , family and relationships , education and work , photos of you , and more .
The choices are usually Everyone , Friends and Networks , Friends of Friends , Only Friends , or Customize .
The Customize screen allows you to specifically pick and choose your networks or friends who can see particular data ; from here , you can specify any custom lists you have made .
If you want , you can also specify specific friends , and block specific friends from that particular kind of update ( can we say " no more Mom rooting around in your party photos " ? ) .
Yes , much of this functionality is the same as before .
The difference is the way it 's presented from the main screen for each section — we feel that it lays out the options in a clearer manner than before and allows users to granularly tweak these settings without getting too lost in menu items .
Permissions on wall posts , one post at a time
The most significant change that Facebook made this month was the much - requested ability to determine permissions on a per-post basis .
Previously , you had to set universal preferences for wall posts — either all your friends could see them , or none of them , or everyone , et cetera .
Now , you can determine at each posting juncture whether you want everyone on earth to see it or just specific groups .
Just underneath the wall posting box is now a little lock icon that , when clicked , exposes your options .
Again , you can elect to have a wall posting shown to everyone , friends and networks , friends of friends , just friends , or customized to individual friends and lists .
You can differentiate the posts you have " protected " ( versus ones that are displayed to whatever your default settings are ) by the little lock icon next to the post :
The post I made in the above screenshot was limited to a custom list that I made for the Ars staff , meaning that anyone else who goes to my Facebook page can't see it unless they 're a member of that list .
What 's missing ?
There are a few things that are no longer part of Facebook 's privacy settings that were there before .
For one , regional networks are no more , and this is largely a good thing , as people could unknowingly share too much information with strangers within their city or state without realizing it .
( The idea with your personal networks is that you know the people in them , and therefore you are less likely to accidentally share stuff with strangers . )
There 's also no way to block your personal information from Facebook apps .
The only way to avoid sharing your information with third - party app developers is to uninstall all applications .
You can , however , control what your friends can share about you with third party developers by going to your Settings > Privacy Settings >
What your friends can share about you >
Edit Settings :
Another major element that 's gone is the ability to manage multiple levels of permissions with regards to your friends list .
This is because Facebook now considers your name , profile picture , city , gender , and friends " publicly available information , " so anyone who finds you on Facebook can see who you associate with , even if you otherwise hide your info from nonfriends .
There is one catch to this —
Facebook relented on the initial complaints about the friends list and has now enabled users to universally show or hide them .
You can do this by going to your own profile and scrolling down to your friend list , then clicking on the little pencil icon .
A menu will pop out with a number of options ; one of them will be to show your friend list to everyone :
As the box says , your friends are always visible to your other friends , but if you are cavorting with enemies of the state or inside sources , random strangers wo n't be able to see your Facebook connections unless they friend you first .
Update : A reader has brought to our attention that it 's still possible to access someone 's hidden friends list through Facebook .
All you have to do is look up someone 's Facebook ID number and plug it into this URL where it says " USERID " : www.facebook.com/ajax/typeahead_friends.php?u=USERID&__a=1
Conclusion
As usual , there are some shortcomings to Facebook 's transition to a simpler privacy system .
Some of them are major — the transition tool recommends that users share everything with everyone as part of its default settings — while others are less so .
Despite this , the company at least seems to be trying to give users what they want , and a few good things have come out of it .
Of course , the company is happy to pat itself on the back for these changes .
" Facebook 's plan to provide users control over their privacy and how they share content is unprecedented in the Internet age .
We have gone to great lengths to inform users about our platform changes , " a Facebook spokesperson told Ars .
" We ’re pleased that so many users have already gone through the process of reviewing and updating their privacy settings and are impressed that so many have chosen to customize their settings , demonstrating the effectiveness of Facebook ’s user empowerment and transparency efforts . "
One thing we have learned from Facebook is that changes like these — especially as they pertain to user privacy — are always evolving .
The company tends to keep an eye on how people are using the service and eventually makes tweaks to its offerings to better coincide with that .
As a result , these latest changes may themselves be changed .
Since they 're here for time being , we may as well all learn how to use them .
How Life Has Suddenly Changed in America
by Bill Sardi
Recently by Bill Sardi : Is The U.S. Economy Being Tanked By Mistake or By Intent ?
Life is suddenly changing in America .
It ’s 8:30 AM .
I ’m getting my 5 - year - old son in the car to take him to preschool .
I have to drive him down backstreets to school because the police are handing out traffic citations on the main drag , in the wake of downturns in public tax receipts .
My son asks why ?
I tell him the truth .
We are avoiding the police on their motorcycles .
I even find that if you live in California you can get a traffic citation and you do n’t even need to pull your car out of the garage .
Violation VC 14600 ( A ) mandates payment of $ 214 for failure to notify the Department of Motor Vehicles of address change within 10 days .
It ’s us versus the public employees now , their job or mine .
My son enjoys the drama of trying to avoid the cops and says he will be on the lookout for me .
No more P.S. # 24
I drop my son off at preschool , a church - run school .
He wo n’t be attending public school like his parents did because we want him to learn values , not to believe he accidentally evolved from an ape - like creature , and we do n’t want him exposed to all the propaganda injected into school curriculums about global warming , overpopulation , gay agendas , mandated vaccinations , the idea that the earth is to be valued above human life , or blind loyalty to government above God .
Some of this thinking creeps into church schools too , so we are vigilant .
I ’m back on the road , carefully driving under the speed limit .
I feel like a driver on marijuana who is driving ever so carefully to avoid being stopped by the police .
There are a growing number of intersections now snapping photos of me driving by .
It ’s all an effort to boost public revenues , not increase public safety .
The ghost office
I pull into the post office parking lot to purchase some stamps .
As I enter , the post office is a ghost of its former self .
For the past six years that I have used this post office there have always been long lines of customers waiting to be served by no less than three clerks .
Today there is no one in line , and only one clerk serving a sole customer at the counter .
The last few times I have visited this post office , and another nearby branch , it has left me wondering where all the customers have gone .
I read where the US Post Office is a few billion dollars in the red and is scaled down into a junk mail delivery service .
Electronic mail has made a profound change in the way Americans communicate .
You wonder , will the post office cease to exist at some time in the near future ?
The hard - bare store
Now I ’m headed to a chain hardware store , to pick up some salt tablets for the home water softening system .
As I enter the store I think there must be a fire drill underway and everybody must be out in the back parking lot .
It ’s another empty store .
Inventories on store shelves have been pared .
With a search down every store aisle , I find three other customers and no one waiting in line at the cashier ’s stand .
The clerk hands me a $ 10 discount coupon if I come back this Saturday .
The revenuers at the front gate
I ’ve arrived back home now to find a humane society man at the front gate .
He wants to know if we have any unlicensed pets at home .
I indicate no , saying we can’t have pets because we are located next to a hillside that is frequented by coyotes and a bobcat that would devour any pet that strayed outdoors .
But I wonder how many more regulatory agencies like this are going to come visiting , searching for code violations ?
I wonder if the dog catcher paid a visit , not because there has been an upsurge in stray dogs , but because of a shrinking budget at the dog pound ?
If you like this site , please help keep it going and growing .
Turn out the lights , only this is n’t romance
I finally enter my home office , above the garage , making sure I do n’t turn on too many lights .
With all of the empty homes in California , I notice our electric bill keeps rising even though our kilowatt - hours of usage are down .
We put in all LED lighting a few months ago .
But we ’re thrown into tier 4 and tier 5 pricing schedules in order to pay for all the people who cannot afford to pay their electric bill .
We will install solar panels on the hillside this year and avoid paying unduly high electric bills that will soon approach the average home mortgage payment .
Extended family burdens
I ’ve got to make a phone call now to set up a small new business venture with my wife ’s uncle .
With the downturn in the construction industry , he is nearly out of work as a fire sprinkler design engineer .
I think everybody who has a job is now being confronted by family members with requests for loans they can’t possibly repay , or to move in and share rent , or maybe even come work for you .
Everybody had better get used to family members on their doorstep .
Looking over my shoulder
That job completed , I move on to keeping daily watch over the frail economy .
What is the stock market doing ?
I do n’t own stocks , but the market will determine whether a crash has started and maybe whether the value of gold will go sky high .
Who knows when that long - predicted day of reckoning will occur ?
It seems closer every day .
I wonder if I will have to run down to the bank and pull out my money , and then run to the grocery store and buy everything on the shelf before hordes of panicked Americans realize there is a bank run underway .
We lost $ 16,500 in the Indy Mac bank failure .
That ’s about $ 24,000 in pre-tax dollars .
So it ’s not like this is an irrational phobia .
I find I ca n’t share all the frightening things I learn about our collapsing American economy with my wife .
Our spouses are nesters and home builders , who work tirelessly toward building a secure and safe home .
The financial realities of the day are too stressful .
If you want to maintain your marriage , you find someone else to trade notes with about the economy , not your wife .
My wife feels more secure with a lot of money in the bank while I am concerned the bank will fail and our currency will be devalued .
Today Credit Suisse predicts a future glut of gold will cause a huge decline in the price of gold , while another noted economist says the stock market will collapse when government props are removed , which would drive the price of gold upwards as investors search for other places to invest their money .
How to gauge sudden changes in the economy presents many challenges .
Ah , remember you have a job to do
At this point , I have n’t got a lick of my own work done today .
It ’s like working while looking over your shoulder .
My income is down by two - thirds from a primary source while Goldman Sachs reports record profits off of bailout money .
You have to wonder .
It seems like an economy where all are for one , the bankers , and none are for all .
To rescue a nursing mother
Now the most distracting part of the day begins .
A young mother , an acquaintance by telephone , who has called a number of times in the past with questions about personal health issues , calls to explain she is driving her car down the freeway but feels she is having a panic attack .
Her heart is pounding fast .
The back of her neck is tight .
Her fingers are freezing cold .
She had a recent skin rash , she explains .
She says this all happened a few days ago and she had to call the paramedics by the side of the road .
She is nursing a newborn , and she does n’t have health insurance .
Her milk is drying up .
Her bowel movements are less frequent .
Her doctor found nothing wrong after the prior episode .
Her husband is busy making a living as a house painter .
I ’ve got a mother on the phone line with a baby in the car and she is driving in a pouring rain storm while having a panic attack .
She wants to know if she is having a stroke .
Being a health reporter as I am , I get more of desperate emails and phone calls like these from people who have no health insurance and are facing a health crisis .
You try to steer them in the right direction , towards home remedies that are known to be effective and low cost .
I ca n’t play doctor , I can only provide information .
But what to do with this panicky mother driving the car ?
I ask about her location .
I advise her to drive to a store and get some iron pills , that her symptoms are consistent with iron - deficiency anemia .
She heads for a store miles away .
She is obviously not thinking clearly .
I ask about her location and go online to find a CVS Pharmacy is just ahead .
I advise her to pull off the freeway and pull into that store parking lot while I ’m calling the pharmacist on another phone line to inform her there is a customer having a panic attack with a baby in their parking lot , and could they help out .
The store people come to her aid , recognizing she is n’t thinking clearly , and find her some iron pills that do n’t cause stomach upset .
I advise her to open up the bottle right then and take an iron pill immediately .
She does this and within minutes she is feeling much better .
In all my telephone log shows , with cell phone dropouts , I had to handle seven phone calls from this distressed mom .
The iron pills did the trick .
It will take her about six weeks to rebuild sufficient red blood cell levels .
Back to reality
Now , what was I doing ?
I have a job to do , e-mails to answer , telephone calls are piling up .
I have a writing assignment , and a radio interview scheduled later in the day that I have to prep for .
It seems like there are so many sudden changes in my daily schedule I can’t get anything done .
I see zillow.com just sent me an e-mail showing the value of my home has dropped by $ 50,000 in the past 30 days .
Do n’t you just love the immediacy of the world we live in today ?
The Best of Bill Sardi
In today ’s post , we ’re going to cover several topics , but primarily grammars .
I ’d like to use an example inspired by some Perl 5 code I wrote for work recently .
So we have a bunch of text that we want to process and deal with .
Perl ’s supposed to be great at that , right ?
To be precise , let ’s talk about the following text , describing some questions and their answers :
pickmany : Which items are food ?
ac : Rice ac : Orange ac : Mushroom ai : Shoes pickone :
Which item is a color ?
ac : Orange ai : Shoes ai : Mushroom ai : Rice
To parse this in Perl 6 , I ’ll start by defining a Grammar .
A Grammar is a special type of namespace for holding regular expressions .
We ’ll also define several named expressions to split up our parsing a bit .
grammar Question :: Grammar { token TOP {
* < question >+ } token question { < header > < answer >+
} token header { ^^ $ < type > = [ ' pickone '| ' pickmany ' ] ':' \s+ $ < text > = [ \N* ]
} token answer { ^^ \s+ $ < correct > = [ ' ac ' | ' ai ' ] ':' \s+ $ < text > = [ \N* ]
} }
First , a brief overview of what ’s going on here , from a standpoint that assumes you ’re familiar with regular expressions at least a little .
By default in Perl 6 grammars , whitespace is ignored and matches occur over the entire string .
It ’s like the /x and /s Perl 5 modifiers are turned on .
TOP is the regex that ’s called if we try to match against the entire grammar as a whole .
‘ token ’ is one of three identifiers used to declare a regex , including ‘ regex ’ , ‘ token ’ , and ‘ rule ’.
‘ regex ’ is the plain , unmodified version , and the second two just enable some additional options .
‘ token ’ disables backtracking , and ‘ rule ’ both disables backtracking and causes whitespace in the regex to match literal whitespace in the matched text .
We wo n’t use ‘ rule ’s here .
The < foo > syntax is what ’s used to call another named regex .
‘ ^^ ’ is used to match the beginning of a line , as opposed to lone ‘ ^ ’ , which matches the beginning of the entire matched text .
The square brackets , [ ] , are non-capturing grouping , like (? : ) in Perl 5 regular expressions .
The = syntax is used to assign the RHS into the name specified on the LHS .
You ’ll see what I mean later when we use the result of this regex .
Let ’s see what we get if we try matching against that grammar and printing the result we get back :
my $ text = Q { pickmany :
Which items are food ?
ac : Rice ac : Orange ac : Mushroom ai : Shoes pickone :
Which item is a color ?
ac : Orange ai : Shoes ai : Mushroom ai : Rice } ; my $ match = Question : : Grammar.parse ( $ text ) ; say $ match.perl ;
Try running that yourself if you like .
It produces 232 lines of output , which is a bit too much to include here .
Let ’s pull out just one part , the questions .
# Print the question for $ match < question >.
flat -> $q { say $ q < header > < text > ; } We need to use . flat , because $ match < question > is an array held in a scalar container .
As a reminder , postfix <> is the auto - quoting named lookup syntax .
That ’s equivalent to the following , but a little easier to type , and also easier to read :
# Print the question for $ match {' question '}. flat -> $q { say $ q{ ' header '}{ ' text '} ; }
So we can see that a match object contains named items as hash values , and repetitions are stored as an array .
If we had any positional captures , made with parens just like Perl 5 : ( ) , they would have been accessed through the positional interface , with postfix [ ] , like an array .
The next step is to make some classes and then populate them from the match object .
First some class definitions :
class Question :: Answer { has $. text is rw ; has Bool $. correct is rw ; }
class Question { has $. text is rw ; has $. type is rw ; has Question : : Answer @.answers is rw ; }
Building Question objects out of the match object is n’t that bad , but it ’s still not pretty :
my @questions = $ match< question >.map : { Question.new ( text => ~ $ _< header >< text > , type => ~ $ _< header > < type > , answers => $ _<answer >.map : { Question :: Answer.new ( text => ~ $ _< text > , correct => ~ $ _< correct > eq ' ac ' , ) } , ) ; } ;
Remembering that any repetition in the regex is reflected as an array in the match object , we map over the < question > attribute , building a Question object for each .
Each < question > match has an array of < answer > matches , so we map over those too , building a list of Question : : Answer objects for each one .
We are stringifying the values to have strings in our array , rather than a bunch of Match objects .
As you can guess , this approach does n’t scale up very well .
A much nicer way to do it is to build the objects as we go .
The method used to do this is to pass an object as the :action argument to the .parse ( ) method on the Grammar .
The parsing engine will then call methods on that object with the same name as the regexes being parsed , with the evaluated match object for the rule passed as an argument .
If the method calls ‘ make ( ) ’ during execution , the argument to ‘ make ( ) ’ is set as the ‘.ast ’ ( for “ Abstract Syntax Tree ” ) attribute of the match object .
Okay , that ’s a fairly abstract description .
Let ’s see some real code .
We need to make a class with methods named the same as those three regexes :
class Question :: Actions { method TOP ( $ / ) { make $ < question >». ast ; } method question ( $ / ) { make Question . new ( text => ~ $ < header > < text > , type => ~ $ < header > < type > , answers => $ < answer > ».ast , ) ; } method answer ( $ / ) { make Question : : Answer.new ( correct => ~ $ < correct > eq ' ac ' , text => ~ $ < text > , ) ; } }
$ / is the traditional name for match objects , and it ’s as special as $ _ , in that there ’s special syntax that accesses its attributes .
Named and Positional access without a variable ( $ < foo > and $ [ 1 ] ) are translated into access to $ / ( $ / < foo > and $ / [ 1 ] ) .
It ’s only a one - character difference , but it saves some visual noise , and helps it fill a semantic space similar to $ 1 , $ 2 , $ 3 , etc. in Perl 5 .
In the ‘ TOP ’ method , we just use a hyperoperator method call to make a list of the .ast attributes of each item in $ < question > .
Again , whenever we call ‘ make ’ in an action method , we ’re setting something as the ‘.ast ’ attribute of the match object that gets returned , so this is just fetching whatever we ‘ make ’ in the ‘ question ’ method .
In the ‘ question ’ method , we construct a new Question object , populating its attributes from the match object , and specifically set its ‘ answers ’ attribute as the list of objects we produce in each call to the ‘ answer ’ regex from the current parse of ‘ question ’ .
In the ‘ answer ’ method , we do the same thing , setting the ‘ correct ’ attribute to the result of a comparison , so that it satisfies the ‘ Bool ’ type constraint on the attribute .
So , again , to use this in a parse , we instantiate this new class and pass the object as the :action parameter to the ‘. parse ’ method of the grammar , and then we fetch the constructed object from the ‘.ast ’ attribute of the match object it returns :
my $ actions = Question : : Actions.new ( ) ; my @questions = Question :: Grammar.parse( $text , :actions ( $actions ) ).ast.flat ;
We need . flat for the same reason as before .
Now we can inspect the created objects to see that everything went according to plan :
for @questions -> $q { say $ q.text ; for $ q.answers.kv -> $ i , $ a { say " $ i ) { $ a.text} " ; } }
To finish this post off , let ’s add a method to Question to ask the question , fetch an answer , and grade the question .
Let ’s start by printing out a representation of the question , its answers , and a prompt :

Next , let ’s fetch a line from STDIN and pull out the digits .
my $ line = $ * IN.get ( ) ; my @answers = $ line.comb(/< digit >+/) >>.
Int.sort ;
‘ comb ’ is kind of the opposite of ‘ split ’ , in that we specify what we want to keep instead of what we want to discard .
The advantage here is that we do n’t have to choose a delimiter .
The user can enter “ 1 2 3 ” , “ 1,2,3 ” , or even “ 1 , 2 , and 3 ” .
We then use a hyperoperator method call to generate an array of Integers from the array of Matches , and then sort it .
Next , let ’s generate a corresponding array of all of the correct answer indexes , and then compare them to determine correctness of the response .
This is n’t the only way to do it , merely the first that occurred to me . :)
my @correct = @.answers.kv.map ( { $ ^value.correct ??
$ ^key !! ( ) } ) ; if @correct ~~ @answers { say " Yay , you got it right ! " ; return 1 ; } else { say " Oops ... you got it wrong . :( " ; return 0 ; } }
Let ’s call it on each question and collect the results by mapping over our new method :
my @results = @questions.map(*.ask ) ; say "
Final score : " ~ [ + ] @results ;
You ’ll get results like this :

Choose all that are true , separated by spaces
Which items are food ?

Choose the one item that is correct
Which item is a color ?
0 ) Orange 1 ) Shoes 2 ) Mushroom 3 ) Rice > 1 Oops ... you got it wrong . :(
Final score : 1
With everything put together , here ’s the full program we ’ve written :
Yōkai Daizukai , an illustrated guide to yōkai authored by manga artist Shigeru Mizuki , features a collection of cutaway diagrams showing the anatomy of 85 traditional monsters from Japanese folklore ( which also appear in Mizuki's GeGeGe no Kitarō anime / manga ) .
Here are a few illustrations from the book .
Kuro - kamikiri [+]
The Kuro - kamikiri ( " black hair cutter " ) is a large , black - haired creature that sneaks up on women in the street at night and surreptitiously cuts off their hair .
Anatomical features include a brain wired for stealth and trickery , razor - sharp claws , a long , coiling tongue covered in tiny hair - grabbing spines , and a sac for storing sleeping powder used to knock out victims .
The digestive system includes an organ that produces a hair - dissolving fluid , as well as an organ with finger - like projections that thump the sides of the intestines to aid digestion .
Makura - gaeshi [+]
The Makura - gaeshi ( " pillow - mover " ) is a soul - stealing prankster known for moving pillows around while people sleep .
The creature is invisible to adults and can only be seen by children .
Anatomical features include an organ for storing souls stolen from children , another for converting the souls to energy and supplying it to the rest of the body , and a pouch containing magical sand that puts people to sleep when it gets in the eyes .
In addition , the monster has two brains -- one for devising pranks , and one for creating rainbow - colored light that it emits through its eyes .
Doro - ta - bō [+]
The Doro - ta - bō ( " muddy rice field man " ) , a monster found in muddy rice fields , is said to be the restless spirit of a hard - working farmer whose lazy son sold his land after he died .
The monster is often heard yelling , " Give me back my rice field ! "
Anatomical features include a gelatinous lower body that merges into the earth , a ' mud sac ' that draws nourishment from the soil , lungs that allow the creature to breathe when buried , and an organ that converts the Doro - ta - bō 's resentment into energy that heats up his muddy spit .
One eyeball remains hidden under the skin until the monster encounters the owner of the rice field , at which time the eye emerges and emits a strange , disorienting light .
Hyōsube [+]
The Hyōsube , a child - sized river monster ( a relative of the kappa ) from Kyushu that lives in underwater caves , ventures onto land at night to eat rice plants .
The monster has a relatively small brain , a nervous system specialized in detecting the presence of humans , thick rubbery skin , sharp claws , two small stomachs ( one for rice grains and one for fish ) , a large sac for storing surplus food , and two large oxygen sacs for emergency use .
A pair of rotating bone coils produce an illness - inducing bacteria that the monster sprinkles on unsuspecting humans .
Yanagi- baba [+]
Yanagi - baba ( " willow witch " ) is the spirit of 1,000 - year - old willow tree .
Anatomical features include long , green hair resembling leafy willow branches , wrinkled bark - like skin , a stomach that supplies nourishment directly to the tree roots , a sac for storing tree sap , and a cane cut from the wood of the old tree .
Although Yanagi - baba is relatively harmless , she is known to harass passersby by snatching umbrellas into her hair , blowing fog out through her nose , and spitting tree sap .
Mannen - dake [+]
The Mannen - dake ( " 10,000 - year bamboo " ) is a bamboo - like monster that feeds on the souls of lost travelers camping in the woods .
Anatomical features include a series of tubes that produce air that causes travelers to lose their way , syringe - like fingers the monster inserts into victims to suck out their souls , and a sac that holds the stolen souls .
Fukuro - sage [+]
The Fukuro - sage -- a type of tanuki ( raccoon dog ) found in Nagano prefecture and Shikoku -- has the ability to shapeshift into a sake bottle , which is typically seen rolling down sloping streets .
The bottle may pose a danger to people who try to follow it downhill , as it may lead them off a cliff or into a ditch .
The Fukuro - sage usually wears a large potato leaf or fern leaf on its head and carries a bag made from human skin .
The bag contains a bottle of poison sake .
Anatomical features include a stomach that turns food into sake , a sac for storing poison that it mixes into drinks , and a pouch that holds sake lees .
The Fukuro - sage 's urine has a powerful smell that can disorient humans and render insects and small animals unconscious .
Kasha [+]
Kasha , a messenger of hell , is a fiery monster known for causing typhoons at funerals .
Anatomical features include powerful lungs for generating typhoon - force winds that can lift coffins and carry the deceased away , as well as a nose for sniffing out funerals , a tongue that can detect wind direction , and a pouch containing ice from hell .
To create rain , the Kasha spits chunks of this ice through its curtain of perpetual fire .
Bisha - ga - tsuku [+]
The Bisha - ga - tsuku is a soul - stealing creature encountered on dark snowy nights in northern Japan .
The monster -- which maintains a body temperature of - 150 degrees Celsius -- is constantly hidden behind a fog of condensation , but its presence can be detected by the characteristic wet , slushy sound ( " bisha - bisha " ) it makes .
Anatomical features include feelers that inhale human souls and cold air , a sac for storing the sounds of beating human hearts , and a brain that emits a fear - inducing aura .
The Bisha - ga - tsuku reproduces by combining the stolen human souls with the cold air it inhales .
Kijimunaa [+]
The Kijimunaa is a playful forest sprite inhabiting the tops of Okinawan banyan trees .
Anatomical features include eye sockets equipped with ball bearings that enable the eyeballs to spin freely , strong teeth for devouring crabs and ripping out the eyeballs of fish ( a favorite snack ) , a coat of fur made from tree fibers , and a nervous system adapted for carrying out pranks .
The Kijimunaa 's brain contains vivid memories of being captured by an octopus -- the only thing it fears and hates .

The deal called for Congress to vote on whether to reinstate Mr. Zelaya , as well as the formation of a national unity government and a truth commission to investigate the events that led up to the coup and its aftermath .
But none of the accord ’s elements has yet been achieved .
Congress delayed its vote , and then Mr. Zelaya renounced the agreement and remains a virtual prisoner in the Brazilian Embassy in Tegucigalpa , the capital .
On Monday , he said in a telephone interview that he would not return to office if Congress voted to restore him merely to serve as a figurehead .
“ The elections only changed the president , but it did not change any of the structure that carried out the coup , ” he said .
Mr. Lobo has said that because he did not sign the accord , it is not up to him to fulfill it .
But if he is to win recognition from other countries  and bring back the aid money that has been suspended  then he will probably have no choice but to go along with some version of the agreement .
Even before the political crisis halted investment and paralyzed an economy that was already buffeted by the global economic crisis , Honduras faced a dire situation .
Remittances from Hondurans working in the United States account for almost a quarter of gross domestic product , and they have dropped 12 percent this year .
The Honduran economy could shrink as much as 4.5 percent this year , said Mauricio Díaz Burdett , an economist at the Fosdeh research institution here .
BOSTON — Police say a frustrated Boston woman called 911 to say she could n't get her 14 - year - old son to stop playing video games and go to sleep .
Police spokesman Officer Joe Zanoli said Monday the mother called for help around 2:33 a.m. on Saturday to say that the video - game - obsessed teenager also walked around the house and turned on all the lights .
Two officers who responded to the house convinced the child to obey his mother .
Zanoli says the mother 's 911 call over video game obsession " was a little unusual , but by no means is it surprising -- especially in today 's day and age when these kids play video games and computer games . "
The Boston Herald first reported the 911 call , saying the boy was playing the popular " Grand Theft Auto " game .

Recently by Peter Schiff : Mission Not Accomplished
As business owners undergo the yearly ritual of passing through eye - popping health insurance premium increases to their employees , it ’s easy to understand why any attempt at health insurance reform would be met with some degree of hope .
Unfortunately , President Obama and his Democratic allies in Congress are about to take a very bad system and make it unimaginably worse .
While ramming their new legislation through Congress , the Democrats have taken great pains to point out that they do not intend to “ socialize medicine . ”
But make no mistake , that ’s where we ’re headed .
Even if some naïve centrists believe that their efforts have denied the Left a total victory , the practical implications of the current legislation sow the seeds for complete capitulation .
This first round of reform could be labeled as the ‘ neutron bomb ’ of the insurance industry : it leaves some of the private apparatus standing , but it irradiates whatever remains of the industry ’s market viability .
The Little Book of Bul ... Peter D. Schiff Best Price : $ 0.05 Buy New $ 1.99 ( as of 05:25 EST - Details )
The bill ’s centerpiece is a clause prohibiting insurers from denying coverage based on a pre-existing medical condition .
However noble and marketable an idea , this proscription removes the very basis upon which any insurance model operates profitably .
A system of insurance requires that premiums be collected from a pool of low - risk people so that funds are available in case a high - risk event befalls a particular person .
In that way , premiums can be low and coverage can be widely available , even if the benefits offered are hypothetically unlimited .
For example , homeowners buy fire insurance even though their houses are very unlikely to burn down .
Recognizing that a fire could wipe them out financially , most homeowners endure the cost of coverage even if they never expect to collect .
The same model applies to health insurance in a free market .
However , the health care bill removes the need for healthy individuals to carry insurance .
Knowing that they could always find coverage if it were eventually needed , people would simply forgo paying expensive premiums while they are healthy , and then sign on when they need it .
But insurance companies cannot survive if all of their policyholders are filing claims !
If you like this site , please help keep it going and growing .
Correctly anticipating this incentive , the Senate bill imposes an annual fine which gradually escalates to $ 750 for those who fail to buy coverage .
So what ?
I would gladly pay $ 750 in order to avoid the $ 8,000 per year I pay now for personal health insurance .
Currently , I ’m relatively healthy for a 46 year old and I do n’t anticipate making a big claim .
But if I do , under the new rules I can always get ‘ insurance ’ after the fact .
Heck , if I can stay healthy for the next couple of decades , I ’ll save a fortune .
Think about how much easier the decision would be if I were 20 years younger !
Since most people are capable of figuring this out , the entire insurance industry would collapse under such a system .
Crash Proof 2.0 : How t... Peter D. Schiff Best Price : $ 1.50 Buy New $ 3.97 ( as of 10:46 EST - Details )
There can be no question that $ 750 annual maximum penalty is a mere placeholder .
It is the camel ’s nose under the tent .
When the non-discrimination provision kicks in , the only way these companies could remain solvent would be for Congress to raise the fine to the point where the penalty is greater than the gain of skipping coverage .
For me , that would have to be roughly $ 8,000 per year .
Introducing such a fine right now would have surely killed the bill .
So , the wily wonks in Washington have chosen to move slower , knowing that once the first step is taken , the second becomes inevitable .
However , there is another , more devious possibility .
Perhaps our elected officials actually intend to bite the hands that feed them .
They could double - cross insurance companies by not raising the fine in five years , thereby forcing the industry into bankruptcy as millions of healthy people opt - out .
During the ensuing ‘ insurance crisis , ’ our courageous leaders could ride to the rescue with a nationalized , single - payer system .
The real tragedy is that the current bill does nothing to restrain the forces that are propelling healthcare costs into the stratosphere , namely : regulatory bans of insurance competition , the out - of - control medical malpractice industry , federal programs and subsidies , and a tax code that favors a third - party payment system — which alienates the patient from the cost of his care .
To consider that many in Washington have the nerve to market this multi-trillion dollar monstrosity as a “ deficit reduction bill ” is to realize that our representatives have lost all touch with reality .
For those keeping score , the government made similarly rosy projections in the mid-1960 ’s when Medicare was first introduced .
The inflation - adjusted cost of that program already exceeds the original estimate by a factor of ten .
That ’s probably where we are headed this time around .
The Best of Peter Schiff
An Oxford University study says the best way to reduce emissions in the short term is a ' drastic downscaling of both size and weight ' of conventional petrol and diesel cars .
The research by Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment suggests that we should not rely on manufacturers producing hydrogen or battery - powered vehicles in the next decade .
The report ' Future of Mobility Roadmap ' assesses the potential for low carbon transport on land , by air and sea .
It finds that electric and hydrogen vehicles are likely to remain niche products for many years because of limited battery life and the high cost of platinum , which is needed for the catalysts in hydrogen fuelled cars .
The study editor Sir David King and lead author Dr Oliver Inderwildi urge the government to impose higher taxes on drivers of large , inefficient vehicles and reinvest the money in better public transport and measures to get more people cycling and walking .
Dr Inderwildi says : ' There is ample opportunity for emissions reductions by further improvements of currently available technology combined with a change in user habits . '
Rather than rely on the manufacturers to provide the ' silver bullet ' solution to cut transport emissions , the report recommends behavioural change , urging consumers to influence manufacturers through their buying power .
Manufacturers are more likely to produce smaller vehicles if customers opt not to buy larger , heavier vehicles with higher carbon emissions .
Better technology could significantly cut emissions from aircraft and shipping but incentives and regulation will be needed to encourage users to switch to low - carbon forms of transport , says the report .
It highlights algae - based biofuels as a means of significantly cutting transport emissions in the future and points out the limitations of biofuels as an alternative because of land shortages and food security concerns .
First generation biofuels , derived from food stocks , ' have proved the viability of such fuels , but remain a local solution , as in Brazil , ' it says .
Dr Inderwildi sees electric and diesel rail systems as the way forward in bringing down transport emissions but says there are disadvantages in the resulting infrastructure costs and lack of flexibility in route planning .
Even so , reducing the carbon footprint of cars and replacing domestic flights with high speed rail could still produce ' drastic emissions savings ' .
The study warns that action must be taken immediately to have any impact on climate change because of the long lifetime of transport fleets and subsequent delays in technological impact .
' Many technological options are already available and , in combination with infrastructure investments , [ will ] support the economy , reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide other long - term benefits , ' says the report .
The first time I made Momofuku roasted pork belly I was pretty happy with the results , aside from the fact that it got a little too crispy ( ok , burnt ) on top .
I chalked it up to lack of air flow in the toaster oven compared to the oven - oven .
The burntness aside , my other complaint was that the piece of meat that I started with was too thin to get a decent slice of belly featuring the gorgeous layering of meat and fat .
The problem with the too thin cut of meat was easily solved : I bought a thicker slice of meat and set out with high hopes .
This time I would roast it the right way , in the oven , and my belly would be golden meltingly tender meat .
There are two philosophies of meat roasting : 1 . high heat to sear , then low and slow , or 2 . low and slow , then high heat to finish .
Chang ’s belly follows the first philosophy , sear the meat so the outside is toasty and and then cook it low and slow so the meat is tender .
The initial high heat renders out a bunch of fat so that when you get to the low and slow , you ’re basically confiting the belly in it ’s own pork fat bath .
In theory , this cooking method works .
I ’m sure Momofuku ’s pork bellies come out great every time .
Mine , on the other hand burn and shrink .
Too much fat is rendered out and I ’m left with tiny burnt remnants of what used to be luscious belly .
Even using the oven to improve air circulation did n’t help .
I started out with a piece of belly the size of , oh , let ’s say a paper back novel and ended up with a charred piece of meat the size of a chocolate bar .
Needless to say , I was sad .
I was determined to roast a perfect piece of belly for my pork buns so I did what any obsessive - compulsive person would do : I bought another piece of belly to try again .
This time I deliberated at the meat counter until I saw the thickest , meatiest piece of belly they had .
After two failed trials of meat roasting philosophy 1 , I knew it was time to move on to meat roasting philosophy 2 : low and slow with high heat to finish .
To ensure my success , I also decided to cover the belly with parchment paper so there would n’t be excessive browning on top .
I put the belly in a 250 ˚F toaster oven for over 3 hours and near the end removed the parchment paper , basted , and cranked the temperature up to 400˚F .
Success , delicious success : golden brown , pillowy - soft , visible layers of meat and fat .
It was the most beautiful pork belly I ever did see !

Basing from my previous GIMP article titled Creating Pseudo - 3D Imagery with GIMP , you learned how to do some basic selection manipulation , gradient application , faking Depth of Field , etc .
In line with that , I ’m following it with a new article very much related to the concepts discussed therein but we ’ll raise the bar a bit by having a glimpse on compositing , where we ’ll use an existing image or photograph and later add in our 2 - dimensional element seamlessly with the said picture .
So if you have n’t read yet “ Creating Pseudo - 3D Imagery with GIMP ” , I highly suggest you do so since almost all major concepts we ’ll tackle here are based off of that article .
But if you have an idea on how to do the implied concepts here , then you ’re good to go .
If you have been following my advices lately , this might feel cliché to you , but you ca n’t blame me if I say “ Always plan what you have to do ! ” , right ?
There you go , another useful and tad overused advice .
Just to give you an overview , this article you are about to spend some time on will teach you basically how to : 1 ) add 2 - dimensional elements to photos or just any other image you wish to , 2 ) apply effects to better enhance the composition , 3 ) plan out your scenes well
However , this guide does n’t teach you how to pick the right color combination nor does it help you how to shoot great photographs , but hopefully though , at the end of your reading , you ’ll soon be able to apply the concepts with no hassle and get comfortable with it each time you do .
Some of you might be a bit daunted by the title alone of this article , especially those of you most inclined with specialized compositing software , but as much as I would want to make use of those applications , I ’m much more comfortable exploring what GIMP is capable of , not only as a simple drawing application but as a minor compositing app as well .
The concepts that I present here though are just basic representations of what compositing actually is .
And in this context , we ’ll only be focusing on still images as reference and output all throughout this article .
If you wanted however to do compositing on series of images , animation , or movie , I highly suggest GIMP ’s 3D partner – Blender .
Ok , promotion set aside , let ’s head back to the topic at hand .
To give you an idea ( because I believe [ and I ’m positive you do too ] that pictures speak louder than words ) , here ’s what we should be having by the end of this article , probably not exactly matching it but fairly close enough and I ’ll try my best to be as guiding as possible .
So let ’s hop on !
Heart and Sphere Composited with GIMP
Compose , Compose , Compose !
Yup , you read it thrice , I did too , do n’t worry .
So what ’s the fuss about composing anyway ?
The answer is pretty straightforward , though .
Just like how a song is written through a composition , a photo / image is almost the same thing .
Without the proper composition , your image would never give life .
By composition , I mean a proper mix of colors , framing , lighting , etc .
This is one of the hardest obstacles any artist or photographer might face .
It will either ruin a majestic idea or it will turn your doodle into a wonderful creation you could almost hear the melody of your lines rhythm through your senses ( wow , that was almost a mouthful ! ) .
Whichever tool you ’re comfortable using , it really does n’t differ a lot as compared to how you could easily interpret your ideas into something much more fruitful than worrying how to work your way around .
That ’s probably one reason I stuck into using GIMP , not only am I confident it can deliver anything I could 2 - dimensionally think of but more importantly I am comfortable using it , which is a very important thing regarding design in my opinion .
Just like how I wrote this article , composition comes into play ( or you might already have doubted me already ? ) .
Without the drafts and planning I made , I do n’t believe I could even finish writing a paragraph of this one .
To start off the process , we ’ll use one photograph I shot just for this article ( in an attempt to recreate the first image I showed you ) .
Or if you do n’t want to follow this article thoroughly , you can grab a sample photo from Google Images or from Stock Exchange ( www.sxc.hu), just be sure to credit the owner though or whatever conditions or licenses the image has .
Photo to work on
Photo Enhancement
Honestly , the photo we have is already decent enough to work with , but let ’s just try making it better so we wo n’t have to go and adjust it later on .
First , let ’s open our image and do some primary color correction to it , just in case you ’re the type who thinks “ something has got to be better , always ” .
Go ahead and fire up our tool of choice ( GIMP in this case ) and open the image ( as you can see below ) .
Opening the image in GIMP
With our photo active in our canvas and the layer it is on ( which is the only layer that you see in the Layer Window by default ) , right click on the image , select Color , then choose Levels .
Adjusting the image ’s color levels is one good way to fix some color cast problems and to edit the color range of your colors non-destructively ( extreme cases excluded ) , another great tool is using the Curves Tool to manipulate your image the same way that you do with Levels .
But again , for the sake of this tutorial , we ’ll use the levels tool since it ’s much easier and faster to edit .
You can see a screenshot below of the Levels Tool that we ’ll be using in awhile .
Levels Tool
One nifty tool we can use under our Levels Tool is the Auto function which ( you guessed it right again ! ) , automates the color adjustment on our image based on the histogram reading and graph analysis of GIMP .
Oftentimes , it makes the task easier for you but it might also ruin your image .
Nothing beats your visual judgment still so if you ’re not contented with what the Auto Leveling gives you , go on and move the sliders that you see in the window .
Normally , I only adjust the Value data of the image to correct it ’s overall brightness and contrast without altering the overall color mood of the photo .
But if in case you were n’t lucky enough to set your color balance settings on your camera the moment you shot the photo or if you felt the image you ’re seeing infront of you is color casted too much , you can freely choose the other color channels ( Red , Green , and Blue respectively ) from the drop - down menu .
You can see a screenshot below on how I adjusted the photo we currently loaded .
Value Level Adjustment
RGB Color Level Choices
That ’s basically all that we need to do to enhance our photo ( or you could go ahead and repeat the process a few more times to get the appropriate feel you wanted ) .
If you wanted a safer way of editing ( just in case you might run out of undo steps ) , duplicate your base layer that holds your image and work on the duplicate layer instead of the original one , then you can just switch the visibility on and off to see the changes you ’ve made so far .
In Los Angeles , where medical marijuana dispensaries outnumber Starbucks and McDonald 's restaurants combined , a mood - altering beverage with a cannabis - oriented marketing campaign is gaining traction .
Southern California has become the bestselling market for Mary Jane 's Relaxing Soda , a sugary drink laced with kava , a South Pacific root purported to have sedative properties .
Matt Moody , a Denver nutritional supplement developer who created the beverage , said the name was an unabashed reference to weed , though the relaxant compounds in kava are chemically unrelated to those in marijuana .
Along with drinks like Slow Cow and Ex Chill , Mary Jane 's is part of a new group of so - called slow - down or anti-energy drinks , which are expected to be among the top food trends of 2010 , according to advertising agency J. Walter Thompson .

WASHINGTON ( AP )  NFL commissioner Roger Goodell would not acknowledge a connection between head injuries on the football field and later brain diseases while defending the league 's policies on concussions before Congress .
Under sometimes - contentious questioning from lawmakers — and suggestions about reconsidering the league 's lucrative antitrust exemption — Goodell sat at a witness table Wednesday alongside NFL Players Association head DeMaurice Smith .
Both men agreed to turn over players ' medical records to the House Judiciary Committee .
Chairman John Conyers , D - Mich. , asked Goodell whether he thinks there 's an injury - disease link .
Goodell responded that the NFL is n't waiting for that debate to play out and is taking steps to make the game safer .
" I just asked you a simple question .
What is the answer ? " persisted Conyers .
Goodell replied by saying a medical expert could give a better answer than he could .
Rep. Maxine Waters , D - Calif. , whose husband played in the NFL , asked Goodell how the league was addressing the welfare of retired players during current collective bargaining negotiations with the union .
Goodell said that it's a " priority for the owners and players to take better care of our retired players , " but Waters cut him off , demanding specifics .
" We 've heard from the NFL time and time again — you 're always ' studying , ' you 're always ' trying , ' you 're ' hopeful , " ' Waters said , pointing a finger in Goodell 's direction .
" I want to know what are you doing ... to deal with this problems and other problems related to injuries ? "
When Goodell said that talks between owners and players are in the early stages , Waters said it 's time " for Congress to take a look at your antitrust exemption " and that she thinks it should be removed .
A 1961 law grants professional sports leagues antitrust exemption for broadcasting .
That has allowed the NFL to sign TV contracts totaling billions of dollars on behalf of all its teams , helping transform the league into the economic powerhouse it is today .
Dick Benson told the committee about the death of his son , Will , a high school quarterback in Texas , several weeks after a helmet - to - helmet hit in 2002 .
The following year , Benson founded the Will Benson Foundation for Sports Safety .
He said the game needs to be changed to reduce physical contact , especially helmet - to - helmet contact .
Sobbing , he said , " Do n't let it happen again . "
In addition to medical records from the NFL and its union , Conyers wants information on head injuries from the NCAA , high schools and medical researchers to better understand football 's health risks .
" We need an expeditious and independent review of all the data , " Conyers said , calling the problem a " life and death " issue that warrants federal scrutiny .
" I say this not simply because of the impact of these injuries on the 2,000 current players and more than 10,000 retirees associated with the NFL and their families , " Conyers said .
" I say it because of the effect on the millions of players at the college , high school and youth levels . "
Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas , the top Republican on the panel , said that while Congress can highlight the consequences of playing football , " the NFL does not need Congress to referee this issue . "
" Football , like soccer , rugby and even basketball and baseball , involves contact that can produce injuries , " Smith said .
" We cannot legislate the elimination of injuries from the games without eliminating the games themselves . "
Several other Republicans questioned the point of the hearing .
Rep. Ted Poe of Texas said that Congress ' involvement in football would mean the end of the sport .
" We 'd all be playing touch football , " he said .
Gay Culverhouse , former president of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers , said that NFL team doctors are not player advocates , and called for an independent neurologist to be on the sidelines .
" Players get to a point where they refuse to tell the team doctor that they have suffered a concussion ... ( because ) they know there is a backup player sitting on the bench , waiting to take their position , " Culverhouse said .
" They are a disposable commodity , " she added .
" There is a draft coming up every April and these players fight to hold on to their jobs and they welcome shots and anything else that will keep them on the field .
This is , in my mind , inhumane , and I watched it since the early ' 70s , and I will tell you that it has not changed . "
Dr. Andrew Tucker , team physician for the Baltimore Ravens , echoed Culverhouse 's assertion that players are prone to hiding information about head injuries .
In his testimony , Goodell said that the league has " reduced red tape , simplified the process for applicants and their families , and sped disability determinations . "
The league recently commissioned a report which suggested that retired pro football players may have a higher rate than normal of Alzheimer 's disease or other memory afflictions — although the league was quick to point out the report did not prove a link .
" We learned a good deal from the report and are actively following up with the 56 players who reported memory problems , " he said .
Dr. Robert Cantu , co-director of Boston University 's Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy , said there is " growing and convincing evidence " that repetitive concussive and subconcussive hits to the head in NFL players leads to a degenerative brain disease known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy .
" The public health risk is already here and we cannot afford to wait any longer to make changes to the way we play sports , " he said , calling for rule and technique changes .
His colleague at the center , Dr. Ann McKee , showed the committee images of brains of dead football players with CTE .
" We need to take radical steps " to change the way football is played , she said .

New Jersey added a new herb to its state garden last Tuesday when Gov. Jon S. Corzine signed the New Jersey Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana
Act on his last day in office .
But though 14 states have now legalized medical marijuana , New York , which has relatively liberal possession laws and actually passed a medical - marijuana law in 1980 but never put it to use , remains forbidden ground for those who seek to relieve their symptoms with cannabis .
This year , however , supporters of medical marijuana in Albany and elsewhere hope to harness what they see as growing momentum .
Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried of Manhattan , the Health Committee chairman and a nearly annual sponsor of medical marijuana legislation , said that he hoped this year ’s bill would reach the floor in the next few weeks and that both houses would pass it by March , before they get tied up with the state budget .
An almost identical bill has been proposed in the Senate , sponsored by Thomas K. Duane , the Senate Health Committee chairman .
Each bill would allow the use of marijuana to “ treat a serious illness under medical supervision , ” such as cancer , arthritis or H.I.V./ AIDS .
“ I think that the main obstacle over the years has been the fear of many in public life to touch anything with drugs , ” Mr. Gottfried said .
“ But I think the climate around the states has changed . ”
He referred to the new laws in a handful of states , as well as to the reversal in longstanding federal policy in October , when the Justice Department stopped pursuing and prosecuting users or providers of medical marijuana who were complying with state laws .
“ What is often surprising is that people tend to assume it ’s a controversial bill , and that ’s been an obstacle , ” Mr. Gottfried said .
“ But other than the state Conservative Party , there has been little to no resistance .
Even public opinion polls show overwhelming support . ”
Scott Reif , a spokesman for the Senate majority leader , Dean G. Skelos , said that the issue had not come up recently and had not on been on the Senate ’s radar .
Several Republican senators have quietly expressed support for medical marijuana , said Gabriel Sayegh , a project director for the Drug Policy Alliance Network , which works to promote medical marijuana laws .
Michael R. Long , the chairman of New York State ’s Conservative Party , said that while he was not currently working with any organizations to block the bill , he firmly believed that passing the legislation would send the wrong signal to young people , especially in the face of the antismoking campaigns and taxes on sugared drinks .
“ And especially when there is no medical proof that marijuana assists anyone anyway , ” Mr. Long said .
“ It would open the floodgates for misuse . ”
In 1980 , the Legislature and Gov. Hugh L. Carey enacted a medical marijuana law in New York .
But the law required that a state review board be set up to rule on doctors ’ requests to prescribe marijuana , and one was never appointed .
In this century , medical marijuana bills have been introduced several times .
Two passed the Assembly with bipartisan support , but stalled in the Senate .
Last year ’s version was derailed during the Senate stalemate in Albany in June .
Some Republicans who favor legalizing marijuana for medical purposes are against the idea of allowing patients and caregivers to grow their own , according to the Marijuana Policy Project .
Others have looked with concern at California , where the state has had difficulties restricting the sale and cultivation of marijuana after its law was passed in 1996 .
There , local governments have had to step in because of public safety issues , as well as unintended effects that some say have a provided legal shield for commercial growers .
Tuesday , the Los Angeles City Council moved to shutter most of the city ’s thousand - plus marijuana dispensaries .
To make the law more palatable to skeptics , Mr. Gottfried said , this year ’s legislation allows registered patients to obtain at most only most 2.5 ounces of the drug from state - licensed entities , which would be overseen by the state ’s Department of Health .
While Gov. David A. Paterson has not announced his position on the bill , he made his views on the issue known in a Rolling Stone article last year .
“ Our society is odd because we have this contempt for marijuana smoking , ” he said .
“ Meanwhile , people have access to pharmaceutical products that are just destroying them . ”
Other supporters of medical marijuana in New York include the Medical Society of the State of New York , the New York State Nurse ’s Association , the Hospice and Palliative Care Association of New York , the StateWide Senior Action Council and Gay Men ’s Health Crisis .
“ If New York does n’t pass medical marijuana legislation , ” said Mr. Sayegh of the Drug Policy Alliance Network , “ it has everything to do with the dysfunction in Albany . ”
" Even worse , it could end up in the hands of a fanatical young Muslim and incite him to consider some form of retaliation or retribution .
He could use it to get worked up and want to really ' finish the game ' .
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Dozens of Iraqi security force members were involved in attacks that killed up to 112 people in Baghdad last week , Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki said on Wednesday .

There is widespread suspicion in Iraq that the police and armed forces have been infiltrated by militants , take bribes to allow insurgents to mount attacks , or may be colluding with militants to undermine Maliki before a March 7 general election .
A series of high - profile attacks on supposedly secure government targets have killed hundreds in recent months and eroded Maliki ’s ability to present himself as the man who turned around Iraqi security , a key plank of his election campaign .
Maliki vowed he would not let ongoing insurgent attacks influence the polls .
He said there were at least 45 members of the security forces involved in the December 8 attack .
“ The network was a large one , 24 from one arm of the Iraqi security forces , 13 from another , and eight or nine from another , ” Maliki told a news conference without saying which branch of the security forces those involved came from .
Maliki promised a reward of around $ 85,500 to anyone who alerting the government to car bombs before they detonate .
The reward would “ get citizens involved in supporting the security service and remedy its deficiencies , ” he said .
Large financial rewards have been offered in the past by the U.S. military for information on insurgent leaders .
U.S. combat troops pulled out of urban areas in June , leaving Iraqi forces to take the lead , but bombings have raised renewed questions about the competence of Iraqi security forces as U.S. troops prepare to fully withdraw by the end of 2011 .
NO U.S. DRAWDOWN DELAY
Still , Maliki said the attacks would not delay the U.S. drawdown , echoing assurances from the U.S. administration that it will not alter plants to end combat operations by August 31 2010 and bring troop levels to 50,000 by then .
“ As for the effect of these operations on the withdrawal , not at all .
The withdrawal has been completely finalized with a defined timetable , ” he said .
Maliki ’s comments came days after the interior and defense ministers got a lengthy grilling from lawmakers angry about the spate of high - profile bombings .
In October , bombs near the Justice Ministry and Baghdad governor ’s offices killed 155 people , and blasts near the Foreign and Finance Ministries in August killed 95 .
On Tuesday , more bombings close to Baghdad ’s heavily guarded Green Zone government complex killed four people .
Maliki ’s comments add a new dimension to investigations into the December 8 attacks , which the Shi’ite Muslim - led government initially blamed on Sunni Islamist al Qaeda and members of Saddam Hussein ’s banned Sunni - dominated Baath party .
Some believe political jockeying between Iraq ’s fractious ethnic and sectarian groups ahead of the March polls has given insurgents an opportunity to stage more high - impact attacks .
Overall violence in Iraq has fallen sharply since the worst of the sectarian bloodshed unleashed after the 2003 U.S. invasion .
ARTISTIC merit will no longer be a defence for the use of images of children deemed to be pornographic under the recommendations of a working party set up by the NSW Attorney - General .
If the recommendations that John Hatzistergos releases today become law , a person producing , distributing or possessing such material could still argue artistic merit but once the material was ruled to be pornographic the defence would lapse .

'' The working party 's report suggests that once such material has been found to be unlawfully pornographic , whether or not it is intended to be art , is irrelevant , '' Mr Hatzistergos said .
'' Instead , the report recommends adopting Commonwealth provisions , which require that once a court has considered arguments that certain material is art and reached a determination that it is nevertheless unlawfully pornographic , no further defence of artistic merit is available . "
THE runaway phenomenon that is “ Mad Men , ” with its stylish depiction of Kennedy - era New York , where men dressed with style and philandered with impunity , has handed modern men their very own “ Sex and the City ” fantasy .
But an overlooked aspect of “ Mad Men ” is the fashion turnabout it represents .
In the show , the older men  Don Draper and his boss , Roger Sterling  are the best - dressed characters , while the new - kid , cool - cat copywriters are so loath to play the game that they wo n’t even wear a tie .
Soon enough , the hippie movement would deride the necktie as a “ dog collar ” and any corporate - minded spoilsport as a “ suit . ”
In the decades that followed , a minor genre of films addressed the Unsuiting of Mr. X , from “ Barefoot in the Park ” ( 1967 ) and “ Easy Rider ” ( 1969 ) to “ After Hours ” ( 1985 ) and “ Something Wild ” ( 1986 ) .
Now the tie is on the other neck .
Today the well - off 55 - year - old is likely to be the worst - dressed man in the room , wearing a saggy T - shirt and jeans .
The cash - poor 25 - year - old is in a natty sport coat and skinny tie bought at Topman for a song .
Young men are embracing the “ Mad Men ” elements of style in a way that the older men never did , still do n’t and just wo n’t .
The result is a kind of rift emerging between the generation of men in their 20s and 30s and those in their late 40s and 50s for whom a suit was not merely square but cubed , and caring about how one looked was effeminate .
The evidence of this style gap is everywhere .

Or take a look at the Cincinnati Bengals linebacker Dhani Jones , who favors double - breasted suits and bow ties and talks about “ the resurgence of the gentleman . ”
ST . PAUL , Minn . -- Chris Osgood allowed five goals on 25 shots , looked shaky at times and did n't move too swiftly from side to side during just his second start in five and a half weeks .
But Detroit Red Wings coach Mike Babcock was n't about to blame Osgood for his team 's 5 - 2 loss to the Minnesota Wild on Wednesday at Xcel Energy Center .
He pinned this defeat on his club 's poor attention to detail .
" The two power - play goals , he did n't have a chance on those , " Babcock said .
" Part of it is helping your goaltender out .
When your team plays the way it did tonight , I do n't think you can evaluate the goaltender .
That would be totally unfair . "
The Wild scored three goals on their first six shots -- two by Antti Miettinen -- and broke it open on goals by Guillaume Latendresse and Martin Havlat 1:01 apart early in the third period .
Osgood said he felt better than he did in his previous start ,
eight days earlier .
But he also is eager to provide a lift for a sputtering team that is 1 - 3 - 3 in its past seven games .
" For me , still , I wish I could stand on my head and steal a game , " Osgood said .
" Yeah , we did n't play great , but if I can get in there and steal a game , maybe that will start something .
Just got to keep my ( nose ) to the grindstone and keep working hard . "
Pavel Datsyuk scored both goals for the Red Wings in the first period .
Babcock said the top line of Datsyuk , Henrik Zetterberg and Dan Cleary was the only bright spot for his club .
Red Wings defenseman Brad Stuart left the game in the third period , after it was out of hand , because of a sprained left shoulder he sustained in the first period .
Stuart said he did n't know the extent of the injury but that he could have finished the game .
He will be re-evaluated Thursday .
" The game was kind of out of reach , so we decided to get some treatment on it , " Stuart said .
" At that point , why risk making it worse ?
See how it feels tomorrow . "
Babcock was hoping for a better effort from a team that squandered a two - goal lead in the final 90 seconds of regulation and lost 5 - 4 in overtime to Phoenix on Tuesday .
" Our attention to detail was n't very good , " Babcock said .
" This , tonight , no way , unacceptable .
" You 'd think you 'd respond , right ?
I thought we had one line .
I thought Datsyuk , Zetterberg and Cleary were a good line .
The rest of us , we were n't here . "
The Red Wings , trailing 3 - 2 , were on the power play when Cleary was whistled for high - sticking with 1:16 left in their man-advantage .
The Wild seized the momentum .
Latendresse scored during four - on - four play , and Havlat scored on the power play .
" I thought we were set up to get ourselves going , we were right there , ( but ) we got that penalty and that gave them a lot of momentum , " Red Wings captain Nicklas Lidstrom said .
" They scored ( twice ) and that deflated us .
It 's disappointing when you feel you 're right there . "
Despite allowing three goals in the first period , the Red Wings had some jump , as Datsyuk twice responded to goals by Miettinen , which were set up by Andrew Brunette .
Datsyuk knocked in the rebound of a shot by Lidstrom at 4:46 to tie it 1 - 1 , then tipped in a blast by Lidstrom at 17:14 to tie it 2 - 2 .
Andrew Ebbett gave the Wild the lead for good at 17:40 , deflecting in Greg Zanon 's blast from the point .
" I do n't think we helped Ozzie out at all on some of the goals they scored , " Lidstrom said .
Osgood , however , took some of the blame .
" I can play a lot better than I have the last two games , " Osgood said .
" I have to keep moving forward , working hard .
Do n't give up .
That 's a motto for our team . "
The Senate finance committee overwhelmingly voted to approve Ben Bernanke for another four - year term as Federal Reserve board chairman .
This is a remarkable event since it is hard to imagine how Bernanke could have performed any worse during his last four - year term .
By Bernanke 's own assessment , his policies brought the US economy to the brink of another Great Depression .
This sort of performance in any other job would get you fired in a second .
But for the most important economic policymaker in the country it gets you high praise and another term .
There is no room for ambiguity in this story .
Bernanke was at the Fed since the fall of 2002 .
( He had a brief stint in 2005 as chair of President Bush 's council of economic advisors . )
At a point when at least some economists recognised the housing bubble and began to warn of the damage that would result from its collapse , Bernanke insisted that everything was fine and that nothing should be done to rein in the bubble .
This is worth repeating .
If Bernanke knew what he was doing , he should have been able to see as early as 2002 that there was a housing bubble and that its collapse would throw the economy into a recession .
It was also entirely predictable that the collapse could lead to a financial crisis of the type we saw , since housing was always a highly leveraged asset , even before the flood of subprime , Alt - A and other nonsense loans that propelled the bubble to ever greater heights .
Of course as the bubble expanded , and the financial sector became ever more highly leveraged , the risks to the economy increased enormously .
Through this all , Bernanke just looked the other way .
The whole time he insisted that everything was just fine .
To be clear , there was plenty that the Fed could have done to deflate the bubble before it grew to such dangerous proportions .
First and foremost the Fed could have used its extensive research capabilities to carefully document the evidence for a housing bubble and the risks that its collapse would pose to the economy .
It then should have used the enormous megaphone of the Fed chairman and the platform of the institution to publicise this research widely .
The Fed could have ensured that every loan officer who issued a mortgage , as well as all the banks officers who set policy , clearly heard the warnings of a bubble in the housing market , backed up by reams of irrefutable research .
The same warnings would have reached the ears of every potential homebuyer in the country .
It 's hard to believe that such warnings would have had no impact on the bubble , but it 's near criminal that the Fed never tried this route .
The second tool that the Fed could have pursued was to crack down on the fraudulent loans that were being issued in massive numbers at the peak of the bubble .
It is absurd to claim that the Fed did n't know about the abuses in the mortgage market .
I was getting emails from all over the country telling me about loan officers filling in phony income and asset numbers so that borrowers would qualify for mortgages .
If the Bernanke and his Fed colleagues did not know about these widespread abuses , it is because they deliberately avoided knowing .
Finally , the Fed could have had a policy of interest rate hikes explicitly targeted to burst the bubble .
Specifically , it could have announced that it will raise rates by half a percentage point at every meeting , until house prices begin to fall and it will keep rates high until house prices approach their pre-bubble level .
This is what a responsible Fed policy would have looked like .
But Ben Bernanke did not pursue a responsible Fed policy .
He insisted that everything was just fine until he had to run to Congress last September , saying that if it did n't immediately give $ 700bn to the banks through the Tarp programme then the economy would collapse .
How on earth can you do worse in your job as Fed chair than bring the economy to the brink of a total collapse ?
If this is success , what does failure look like ?
But , in Washington no one is ever held accountable for their performance .
The economic collapse is treated like a fluke of nature – a hurricane or an earthquake – and not the result of enormous policy failures .
So , it is the 15 million unemployed that go without work , not Ben Bernanke .
Instead , many of the senators praise Bernanke to the sky and thank him for his service .
The running line in the Senate is : " It could have been worse . "
That is the way Washington works these days .
And , everyone should be very very disgusted .
West Point , New York ( CNN ) -- President Obama said Tuesday that the deployment of 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan is part of a strategy to reverse the Taliban 's momentum and stabilize the country 's government .
" There is no imminent threat of the government being overthrown , but the Taliban has gained momentum , " Obama said at the U.S. Military Academy .
" Al Qaeda has not re-emerged in Afghanistan in the same numbers as before 9/11 , but they retain their safe - havens along the border .
" And our forces lack the full support they need to effectively train and partner with Afghan security forces and better secure the population .
...
In short , the status quo is not sustainable . "
Obama said he'd begin sending the additional troops " at the fastest pace possible " starting in early 2010 " with a goal of starting to withdraw forces from the country in July 2011 . "
The president said additional U.S. forces bolstered by NATO troops " will allow us to accelerate handing over responsibility to Afghan forces . "
Senior administration officials said Tuesday that Obama has a goal of withdrawing most U.S. forces by the end of his current term , which ends in January 2013 .
Watch what the new troops will do in Afghanistan
It will be the second increase of U.S. forces in the war - torn Islamic country ordered by Obama since he took office in January .
In his speech Tuesday , Obama said his strategy had three objectives :
• Deny al Qaeda a safe haven
• Reverse the Taliban 's momentum and deny it the ability to overthrow Afghanistan 's government
• Strengthen Afghanistan 's security forces and government
The additional troops was one way to achieve these , he said .
Other strategies will include holding Afghan government leaders accountable for corruption , focus assistance on areas that could help the lives of Afghans , and securing the country 's border with Pakistan .
" We are in Afghanistan to prevent a cancer from once again spreading through that country .
But this same cancer has also taken root in the border region of Pakistan .
That is why we need a strategy that works on both sides of the border , " Obama said .
The president said he rejected the option of committing more forces for an undefined mission of nation - building without any deadlines .
" I reject this course because it sets goals that are beyond what we can achieve at a reasonable cost , and what we need to achieve to secure our interests , " Obama said .
" Furthermore , the absence of a timeframe for transition would deny us any sense of urgency in working with the Afghan government .
It must be clear that Afghans will have to take responsibility for their security , and that America has no interest in fighting an endless war in Afghanistan . "
Obama rejected analogies with the war in Vietnam that divided America in the 1960s and 1970s .
" Unlike Vietnam , we are joined by a broad coalition of 43 nations that recognizes the legitimacy of our action , " Obama said .
" Unlike Vietnam , we are not facing a broad - based popular insurgency .
And most importantly , unlike Vietnam , the American people were viciously attacked from Afghanistan , and remain a target for those same extremists who are plotting along its border . "
Obama said the U.S. has no interest in occupying Afghanistan .
" We will support efforts by the Afghan government to open the door to those Taliban who abandon violence and respect the human rights of their fellow citizens , " Obama said .
" And we will seek a partnership with Afghanistan grounded in mutual respect -- to isolate those who destroy ; to strengthen those who build ; to hasten the day when our troops will leave ; and to forge a lasting friendship in which America is your partner , and never your patron . "
Obama spoke to an audience of West Point cadets , staff and guests in outlining his strategy that he has deliberated for months , meeting several times with his national security team .
He recognized that some in the audience had fought in Afghanistan , and some would be deployed in the future .
" As your commander in chief , I owe you a mission that is clearly defined , and worthy of your service , " he said .
The additional U.S. forces " will increase our ability to train competent Afghan security forces , and to partner with them so that more Afghans can get into the fight , " Obama said .
" And they will help create the conditions for the United States to transfer responsibility to the Afghans . "
Obama also said he is asking NATO allies to provide more troops , and that he is " confident that there will be further contributions in the days ahead . "
" Our friends have fought and bled and died alongside us in Afghanistan , " he said .
" Now , we must come together to end this war successfully .
For what 's at stake is not simply a test of NATO 's credibility -- what 's at stake is the security of our allies , and the common security of the world . "
The new troop deployment would increase the total U.S. commitment to roughly 100,000 troops in Afghanistan , bolstered by more than 40,000 NATO forces .
Obama , whom Republicans had accused of " dithering " over the decision , concluded the deployment needs to be accelerated to knock back the Taliban , the senior officials said .
The push for a speedy deployment is surprising because White House officials who defended Obama 's slow pace of coming to a decision had said the Pentagon would n't be able to get new troops to Afghanistan that quickly .
A Pentagon official noted that , under the new strategy , Obama is " trying to do it faster " than the 12 - month timeline initially requested by Gen. Stanley McChrystal , the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan .
McChrystal wrote in a report in August that a " failure to gain the initiative and reverse insurgent momentum in the near - term ( next 12 months ) -- while Afghan security capacity matures -- risks an outcome where defeating the insurgency is no longer possible . "
The Pentagon official said Obama 's six - month timeline for sending the new troops is " very aggressive " and will be challenging for the military to fulfill .
The official expressed confidence , however , that the military would successfully carry out the order .
Opponents of an increased U.S. troop deployment complain that the government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai is corrupt and an unreliable partner .
Obama spoke to Karzai for an hour by videoconference Tuesday to discuss the deployment decision , according to a White House statement .
" The president also emphasized that U.S. and international efforts in Afghanistan are not open - ended and must be evaluated toward measurable and achievable goals within the next 18 to 24 months , " the statement said .
Share your views on Obama 's Afghanistan decision
The decision to send the troops carries significant political risk for Obama , who will announce it nine days before he travels to Oslo , Norway , to accept the Nobel Peace Prize .
His liberal base , which helped him win last year 's presidential election , opposes another troop deployment to Afghanistan .
In addition , the deployment , expected to cost an extra $ 30 billion a year , comes amid high unemployment as the economy emerges from a recession .
That concerns Democrats and Republicans faced with competing domestic priorities such as health care reform and job creation .
U.S. - led troops first invaded Afghanistan in response to the al Qaeda terrorist network 's September 11 , 2001 , attacks on New York and Washington .
The invasion overthrew the ruling Taliban , which had allowed al Qaeda to operate from its territory , but most of the top al Qaeda and Taliban leadership escaped the onslaught .
Taliban fighters have since regrouped in the mountainous region along Afghanistan 's border with Pakistan , battling U.S. and Afghan government forces on one side and Pakistani troops on the other .
Al Qaeda 's top leaders , Osama bin Laden and Ayman al - Zawahiri , remain at large and are suspected to be hiding in the same region .
The conflict has so far claimed the lives of more than 900 Americans and nearly 600 allied troops .
A frantic voice came over the radio : a blast had just destroyed Guinea - Bissau ’s military headquarters .
I drove toward the compound and , when I arrived , everyone was still shouting and running through the smoking ruins of the building .
Bissau ’s only ambulance was shuttling back and forth from the hospital , ferrying the bodies of victims .
All that four heavily armed soldiers would tell me was that General Batista Tagme Na Wai , head of the army , had just been assassinated .
At six o’clock the next morning , my friend and informant , Vladimir , a reliable security man who worked at my hotel , came to tell me that President Joao Bernardo Vieira had just been killed , too .
I asked how he knew , but he simply shook his head .
When I pulled up at the president ’s house , soldiers were shooting in the air and swinging machetes to keep a crowd of people away .
The president ’s armored Hummer was still parked out front , the tires flat and its bulletproof windows shattered .
The police cars from his escort were destroyed .
A rocket shot from a bazooka had penetrated four walls of his house , ending up in the living room .
After ruling Guinea - Bissau for nearly a quarter of a century , Vieira , known to his people simply as Nino , was dead .
In just nine hours Guinea - Bissau had lost both its president and the head of its army .
Why such violence ?
Was this double assassination the result of an old rivalry between Vieira and Tagme , or was it something more ?
The army ’s spokesman , Zamora Induta , declared that the president had been killed by a group of renegade soldiers and that assailants had used a bomb to assassinate General Tagme .
He said there was no connection between the two deaths .
Of course , nobody believed this .
Since 2007 , Guinea - Bissau , a former Portuguese colony and one of the poorest nations in the world , has become the new hub for cocaine trafficking .
The drug is shipped from Venezuela , Colombia , and Brazil to West Africa en route to Europe .
Everyone suspected that these assassinations were somehow linked to drug trafficking .
I headed back to the military headquarters .
After taking some pictures of the destroyed building , I sneaked out of the generals ’ view and made my way to a backyard where some soldiers were resting , sipping tea under a big tree .
I offered cigarettes and was given tea in return .
Paul — the chief of a special commando unit from the region of Mansoa — told me they had had a hell of night .
I thought he was referring to the general situation , but then he told me that he and his men had been sent to the president ’s house the night before .
It had been their job to kill him .
Paul wore a denim cowboy hat and two cartridge belts across his body , in perfect Rambo style .
It was noon , the sun higher than ever , but a chill ran through me .
“ We went to the house , to question Nino about the bomb that killed Tagme Na Wai , ” Paul told me in French .
“ When we arrived he was trying to flee with his wife , so we forced them to stay .
When we asked if he issued the order to kill Tagme , he first denied his responsibility but then confessed .
He said he bought the bomb during his last trip to France and ordered that it be placed under the staircase , by Tagme ’s office .
He did n’t want to give the names of those who brought the bomb here , or the name of the person who placed it . ”
Something about the quality of the details , the casual authority of Paul ’s voice , convinced me he was telling the truth .
“ You know , Nino was a brave man but this time he really did something wrong .
So we had to kill him .
After all , he killed Tagme and made our life impossible . . .
We have not received our salary since six months ago . ”
“ So , what happened after you questioned him ? ” I asked .
“ Well , after that we shot him and then we took his powers away . ” I asked what he meant .
“ Nino had some special powers , ” Paul explained .
“ We needed to make sure he wo n’t come back for revenge .
So we hacked his body with a machete — the hands , the arms , the legs , his belly , and his head .
Now he ’s really dead . ”
Paul erupted in a smoky chuckle , joined by his men .
I scanned the laughing soldiers and saw that three had blood spattered on their boots and pants .
The next day , I convinced one of Vieira ’s cousins to let me into the president ’s house .
He led me to the kitchen , to show me where Nino Vieira was executed .
Blood was all over the room .
The bulletproof vest he always wore sat propped on a chair .
Hundreds of AK - 47 bullet casings and the machete used to dismember his corpse still lay scattered on the floor .
The rest of the house was looted and destroyed .
The soldiers had taken everything .
Nino Vieira ’s and Tagme Na Wai ’s brutal assassinations go way beyond the settling of personal scores .
They reflect more than a mere confrontation between warring ethnic groups — the president ’s Papel and the military leader ’s Balanta .
According to Calvario Ahukharie , the national director of Interpol , this escalation of violence is the result of a war to gain more control over drug trafficking .
“ The army , the navy , and the president are all involved .
Nino was number one and Tagme number two — and they were competing , ” he told me .
“ Someone had to fall . ”
A confidential source close to Interpol , who spoke on condition of anonymity , told me that a private jet had arrived in Bissau on February 26 , three days before the assassination of General Tagme Na Wai .
There is no record of such aircraft at the airport ’s flight - traffic office , but the bomb that killed General Tagme was made in Thailand — the kind of device you could n’t buy in Africa , the kind you would have to fly in .
This same day , two hundred kilos of seized cocaine disappeared from the navy storage .
According to my source , some soldiers known to be loyal to President Vieira were spotted loading the undocumented flight , and the plane took off a few hours later .
I asked Director Ahukharie if he could confirm the information I had obtained .
I wanted to know if the bomb had arrived on that jet and if the missing two hundred kilos of cocaine had been loaded on board as all or part of a payment .
“ I ca n’t give you more details than you already have , ” Ahukharie said .
“ We also suspect that the bomb arrived in Bissau on a private flight a few days before the assassination , and it ’s true that two hundred kilos of cocaine have vanished .
That ’s all . ”
But the mysterious arrivals and departures of private jets have figured prominently in Bissau ’s growing drug war .
The US Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) and the Spanish police confirm that a Gulfstream jet proceeding from Venezuela landed in Bissau on July 12 , 2008 , loaded with five hundred kilos of cocaine .
The Guinean police immediately surrounded the jet and arrested the three - member crew , including the pilot , Carmelo Vásquez Guerra .
Three policemen and two air - traffic - control agents were also arrested and charged with complicity with the traffickers .
Carmelo Vásquez Guerra was an especially big catch ; he had been investigated by the Mexican Police in 2006 for piloting a DC - 9 jet — also proceeding from Venezuela and loaded with five tons of cocaine — that landed in Ciudad del Carmen , Campeche , Mexico .
During this operation Miguel Vásquez Guerra , Carmelo ’s brother , was arrested along with five other members of the jet ’s crew — all reputed to have been part of the Chapo Guzman criminal organization , the most powerful among the Mexican drug cartels .
Five days after Carmelo ’s arrest in Bissau , however , the drugs vanished .
Interpol , in cooperation with the DEA and the FBI , inspected the plane with a drug - sniffing dog and confirmed that cocaine had been transported on the jet , but the cargo was now nowhere to be found .
Antonio Maria Costa , executive director of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime later conceded that “ hundreds of boxes had been taken out from this jet , ” and opened an investigation into the case , in cooperation with the FBI , Interpol , and the DEA .
In November 2008 , just before the spiral of violence started , Interpol and the Judicial Police seized a similar plane , also originating from Venezuela .
Again the police seized a payload of cocaine , and again it mysteriously vanished .
The pilot fled to Malawi but the copilot was arrested ; Interpol was also able to recover seven satellite phones that were then decrypted , providing important information about a network of drug traffickers .
I met Lucinda Barbosa Ahukharie , Director of the Judicial Police , at her office to ask some questions about the second jet that was seized .
“ I ’m fighting a war , alone , against someone that I will never defeat , ” she said .
“ Look at our offices .
We have nothing here .
The international community keeps promising aid but we are working with just one car and most of our agents have had no salary for four months .
Of course they are corrupt — they need to feed their families !
How can we possibly compete with drug traffickers ? ”
Then she locked the door and picked up a folder from her desk .
“ I want to show you the situation we have here . ”
Dr. Ahukharie opened the folder and showed me a series of pictures taken with a mobile phone , by one of her informants at the airport .
They depict some soldiers , in uniform , unloading the private jet seized in November .
Their faces are n’t clearly visible , but a witness would be able to identify them .
“ See ?
That ’s how things work here .
We had the flight , the pilot , and the pictures .
We also had the drugs but then they vanished .
This would have been an easy trial in your country , but here nothing happened .
The judge said the pictures do n’t show any evidence , and now that the drugs have gone , the trial is dead . ”
“ I know your name , Marco , so if I see anything published from you that mentions drug trafficking I will find you , wherever you are . ”
From the day this plane was seized , the equilibrium between the army and the president has been unsettled , and Bissau ’s streets have turned more violent .
Bubo Na Tchuto , former Chief of the Navy , was arrested in November and fled to Gambia a few hours after .
The president ’s compound was assaulted in December in what appeared to be more a settling of scores than an attempted coup d’état .
At least fifteen people have died in drug - related violence .
President Nino Viera was aware of the power that his generals were gradually gaining and was growing increasingly paranoid .
Copies I obtained of reports looking into the November jet seizure detail how the original investigation was killed — with General Tagme Na Wai mentioned by name .
Viera decided , investigators now believe , to eliminate all those who were putting his business at risk .
They say the goal was to strengthen his position at home and to regain control over the drug - trafficking trade .
He needed to show the Latin American cartels that Guinea - Bissau was still a convenient place for their business — that they need n’t fear seizure , that their product would not occasionally disappear .
Vieira , who was renown for his brutality , let it be known that he was preparing to take action against his enemies .
The navy chief fled in fear for his life .
The president knew it would not be so easy to intimidate General Batista Tagme Na Wai .
There would be no room for mercy or for mistakes — which is why he had Tagme blown to smithereens .
One night I headed to the Palace Hotel — a huge , Chinese - style building on the way to the airport surrounded by a series of luxury bungalows that are always closed and empty .
The Palace became famous on January 11 , 2008 , when French intelligence and the judicial police arrested Ould Sinda and Ould Sidi Chabarnou , two al Qaeda terrorists from the Baqmi , the Maghreb wing of the organization .
The two had killed a family of four French tourists in Mauritania and then fled to Bissau , with the eventual aim of reaching Guinea - Conakry .
They spent some days at the Palace pretending to be businessmen and never left the hotel , probably waiting for a contact or for instructions .
The hotel ’s European - style disco-bar is the beating heart of Bissau ’s nightlife , where drug traffickers hang out drinking hundred - dollar bottles of whiskey and smoking puros imported from Cuba .
I was barely inside when a drunk guy and five of his friends dragged me out .
They were all Lebanese .
They told me in French that they knew I was a journalist and demanded to know the purpose of my visit .
“ We all know what the foreign journalists look for in this country , ” the ringleader said , “ and I know your name , Marco , so if I see anything published from you that mentions drug trafficking I will find you , wherever you are . ”
The presence of Lebanese strongmen is an alarming sign .
According to reports from Interpol and United Nations agencies , cocaine traded through West Africa accounts for a considerable portion of the income of Hezbollah .
These reports say Hezbollah uses the Lebanese Shiite expatriate population in South America and West Africa to guarantee an efficient connection between the two continents .
To maintain and expand its influence on the Shiite community , however , Hezbollah needs money .
The estimated $ 120 million given annually by Iran is just a slice of the pie .
Most of Hezbollah ’s support comes from drug trafficking , a major moneymaker endorsed by the mullahs through a particular fatwa .
In addition to the production and trade of heroin in the Middle East , Hezbollah facilitates , for a fee , the trafficking for other drug - smuggling networks , such as the FARC and its cocaine trade .
Guinea - Bissau is a strategically unique trait d’union between Latin America ’s cocaine supply and Europe ’s market , where the Euro is stronger than the US dollar and the voracious appetite for coke is growing .
An archipelago of ninety islands , Bissau is an convenient staging point .
When shipments from Latin America reach the coast of Guinea - Bissau , the cocaine is broken into smaller consignments that are then sent by fast boats to the coasts of Morocco and Senegal or moved in trucks through Mauritania and across the Sahara to the Mediterranean coast .
Convoys of heavily armed four - wheel - drive vehicles travel through the Sahel , across regions controlled by a network of terrorists associated with al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb .
The Lebanese network based in Bissau does business at the source , directly with the FARC , on behalf of Hezbollah .
The associated al Qaeda cells , based in the Sahel , receive a cut for letting smugglers cross their territories in Mauritania .
Ronald Noble , Secretary General of Interpol , confirms that cocaine trafficking in West Africa has supported several Hezbollah operations in Lebanon as well as al Qaeda since at least 2006 .
Analysts and counterterrorism experts explain that profits from cocaine trafficking have allowed the Lebanese network to diversify its portfolio of illegal activities in West Africa .
In Nigeria , for example , 80,000 barrels of oil a day are siphoned from illegally tapped pipelines — an estimated $ 4 billion each year .
In Sierra Leone and Liberia , al Qaeda and Hezbollah have begun investing in diamonds .
Out of this diverse criminal activity emerged a terrorism - financing network , led by the Lebanese clan of Assad Ahmad Barakat in Ciudad del Este , on the freewheeling “ tri-border area ” where Argentina , Brazil , and Paraguay converge — a region famous for cocaine trafficking , piracy , and contraband goods .
Barakat was arrested in 2002 by Brazilian and Paraguayan authorities working in cooperation with the FBI , but his clan continues to serve as a key financier for Hezbollah .
The Lebanese network operating in Bissau is the next link in the chain .
President Nino Vieira had some hand in distributing drugs , but mostly he assisted by looking away and allowing the Lebanese to do their business .
In return he reaped considerable personal benefits , and the country itself benefited from a surge in foreign investments , mostly from the Middle East , that in 2006 totaled over $ 42 million .
Put those numbers together and the Palace Hotel starts to make a little more sense .
But Guinea - Bissau ’s role in Latin American drug - trafficking dynamics is not limited to its connections with the tri-border area .
During the last few months Buenos Aires , to the south , has turned into one of the major points of shipment for the cocaine smuggled into Africa , in particular to Guinea - Bissau and South Africa ( where traffickers are amassing big quantities for the 2010 World Cup Soccer championship ) .
On March 12 , ten days after Vieira was killed , the Argentine government declared that the Consulate of Guinea - Bissau in Buenos Aires was involved in criminal activities related to money laundering , drug trafficking , and illegal arms trade .
Arms were a part of what was being trafficked from Argentina to Bissau , but mostly the shipments consisted of the base ingredients to produce ephedrine and methamphetamines , which were then trafficked from South America to West Africa and then smuggled through Mexico en route to the US .
All of this was supervised by the Lebanese network in the tri-border area of South America and managed in Bissau with the cooperation of Nino Vieira .
I asked a former journalist who had been a correspondent for a Portuguese magazine to show me where Bissau ’s drug lords lived .
We met at night , in front of my hotel , and went for a ride through the darkness .
“ It all started when the fishermen found the drugs in the sea , ” he told me while I drove .
“ A load of cocaine was dumped overboard , from a ship that was intercepted by the Senegalese Coast Guard , in 2005 .
The fishermen in Biombo found these packs and did n’t even know what it was .
Some of them used it to fertilize their crops , some to paint their bodies and others simply kept the packs in their house .
In this country very few knew what cocaine was . ”
He shook his head and smiled bitterly .
We passed in front of the UN building and turned down a dark deserted road — then into a bizarre kind of Beverly Hills for the drug connected and the drug corrupted .
Mansion after mansion guarded by armed security .
The man in the middle was blindfolded and the men on either side of him were holding rifles .
One of them wore a SWAT hood and pressed a pistol against the hostage ’s chest .
“ See this ?
That ’s where Augusto Bliri lives . ”
My journalist friend pointed to a huge mansion with a yellow Hummer parked in the courtyard .
“ That ’s the traffickers ’ neighborhood .
This other house is where Bubo Na Tchuto used to live before he fled to Gambia . . .
I guess the house is empty now . . .
Look , over there , that was Pablo Camacho ’s hideout . ”
Bliri , Na Tchuto , Camacho .
The local gangster , the former rear admiral for Guinea - Bissau ’s navy , a Colombian trafficker .
Neighbors .
Business partners .
Bliri is a young but savvy drug lord who is a legend in Bissau .
He started the cocaine business here .
He lived in Germany for several years , so when the fishermen found the mysterious packs with the white powder , he instantly knew what to do : he bought some kilos for almost nothing and converted them into hundreds of thousands of Euros .
Now he spends most days driving around in his yellow Hummer , stopping in for a few drinks at the Samaritana , while children guard his SUV for a few coins .
Last year one of Bliri ’s lieutenants killed a Spanish trafficker who had tried to steal some cocaine .
The Bissau police arrested and imprisoned the suspected killer but after three days he was freed .
No trial , no evidence .
Nothing .
The same happened when Bliri was busted and convicted in 2006 .
The police found firearms in his Hummer and a large amount of money .
He was sentenced to four years but his lawyer , Carlos Lopes Correira , convinced the judge to let him go ; his client was sick , Correira argued , and the basement where he was imprisoned was unhealthy .
I asked Lucinda Barbosa Ahukharie if Bliri ’s gang was connected to the Lebanese network .
“ Of course they are , ” she said .
“ The Lebanese are too smart , and would never put their own hands in the fire , so they protect these gangs because they need someone to do the job .
These kids are untouchable , and they know it .
They resolve any problem with bribes , so they do n’t fear anyone . ”
I decided to see if I could infiltrate Bliri ’s gang .
I approached one of Bliri ’s lieutenants ( I will call him Omar , because I promised to protect his identity ) ; he was smoking marijuana with his friends at the Samaritana .
We arranged to meet at the Kilimanjaro , a restaurant with a dark , secluded patio , at eleven o’clock at night .
The place was abandoned when Omar arrived ; even the owner was gone .
I was a bit nervous , but I stood and shook his hand .
I had decided to be straight and tell him exactly who I was and what I was looking for .
“ I know who you are and what your business is , ” I said .
“ I just need you to show me how the whole thing works .
I ’m a photographer , but nobody will know your name or see your face .
I promise .
Will you help me ? ”
He was silent for a few long seconds .
“ What you are asking for is really risky , ” he said .
“ I have great respect for you , brother , but you ’re a little mad !
Do you know you could have been killed if you would have met someone else rather than me ? ”
His answer rattled me , but I understood it to be a skeptical “ yes . ”
We had a drink .
He took my phone number , and then we both left .
In the weeks that followed I met him almost every day .
He tested me several times , gradually opening up to me , revealing his world .
He introduced me to his people , inviting me three times in one week to share dinner with his gang .
It took weeks , but slowly , I was gaining Omar ’s respect .
At carnival time , he invited me for a beer at the cabañas of barrio Bra , a place where no stranger would go alone .
Everyone was drinking and dancing to the loud beats of Bissau ’s pop music .
Omar was a little high and started to tell me about his problems with his girl .
After that night , I think , we were something like friends .
I asked Omar if Bliri knew that I existed .
I already knew the answer , but I needed to test Omar .
He laughed at the question .
“ If Augusto did n’t know about you , we would n’t be here , ” he said .
“ I gave him my word that you ’re reliable .
If you do something wrong I will probably get killed , but in this case I would n’t be the only one who would die . ”
He smiled at this .
“ You know , we have our rules here .
This is Africa , brother . ”
We gathered for another party in an abandoned lot where the gang set up a wall screen with a projector and played a DVD of one of 50 Cent ’s concerts .
There were grills crowded with dozens of camaraos tigre , a jumbo shrimp the size of a lobster .
Four buckets were filled with beers , and a group of girls danced liked they ’d taken lessons from Beyoncé .
The men kept drinking .
None of them spoke English , but would periodically salute the screen with a loud and awkward “ Go , motherfucker ! ” followed by a big laugh .
“ One of these days I ’ll show you what happens to those who break the rules , ” said Omar , holding my arm .
He had a strange smile on his face and his eyes were shining when he pointed at mine .
I shivered and asked what he meant .
“ Ah - ah -ah ! ” He erupted into a loud laugh “ You do n’t have to worry , nothing is going happened to you . . . unless you break some rule . ”
He kept laughing ; my face felt paralyzed and my eyes clearly betrayed my fear .
“ No one is going to die , do n’t worry .
We do n’t kill people that often here .
We ’re cool .
I ’m just going to show you something , but not tonight . ”
A few days later , I was in my room , ready to sleep , when the phone rang .
It was minutes before midnight .
“ Marco ! ” Omar barked into the phone .
“ You should come now .
There ’s something I promised to show you , remember ?
Go to the airport parking lot .
You will find my friends there in half an hour .
And do n’t forget your camera ! ”
I did n’t know what to do .
I was fucking scared .
I was afraid of what I was about to see , but I was also afraid to stand up to Omar .
When I arrived , half an hour later , the airport was abandoned .
I locked my car , waited for a few minutes .
A four - wheel drive pulled up .
They approached and , through my window , a guy told me to get in the front seat of their car .
Omar was not inside , but I recognized the driver .
I did n’t know his name — had never even talked to him — but he was always around at the parties .
When I got in the car , I saw there were three other men in the backseat .
The one in the middle was blindfolded and the men on either side of him were holding rifles .
One of them wore a SWAT hood and pressed a pistol against the hostage ’s chest .
We drove without a word toward Quinhamel , a little village thirty minutes outside Bissau , when suddenly the driver turned down a secondary road , a dark dirt path flanked by cashew trees .
He pulled over , and the two men got out of the backseat , leading their blindfolded hostage .
“ If you want to take pictures , do it , ” the driver said .
“ Just make sure not to take my face .
I ’ll check your camera later . ”
He was extremely relaxed , businesslike .
I could n’t bring myself to get out of the car .
I started to photograph through the windshield , while outside the gangsters pointed their rifles at the hostage .
They spoke Creole , so I could n’t understand what they were saying , but it was clear they were threatening the hostage , asking questions that he never answered .
He was so frightened he did n’t even cry .
While the gunmen questioned the hostage , the driver stretched out under a cashew tree .
He smoked patiently , almost comfortably .
I finally got out of the car and shot two or three pictures before they forced the hostage onto his knees .
They pointed a gun to his head , shouted at him , then kicked him to the ground .
The man was shaking .
Suddenly , the driver rose .
He said it was time to go .
We got into the car .
The hostage was left in the middle of nowhere , at 2 A.M. and miles from Bissau .
But , as he vanished in the side mirror , at least he was alive .
“ You knew we would n’t have killed him , right ? ” the driver asked as he turned back onto the main road toward Bissau .
“ This guy talked too much .
He should pay more attention .
The next time he could have serious troubles . ”
I still do n’t know why Omar allowed me to photograph this .
Maybe he wanted to send me a message , or just show his power .
Maybe he wanted to remind me that there are rules here , that I ’m from another world and this is Africa .
Oil reserves as large as Saudi Arabia 's may soon embolden Ugandan officials who 've been threatening to punish homosexuals with death , just as independently oil wealthy Saudi Arabia does .
Mary Daly - who emerged as a major voice in the women 's movement with her first book , " The Church and the Second Sex , " published in 1968 , and " Beyond God the Father : Toward a Philosophy of Women 's Liberation , " which appeared five years later - died last Sunday in a Massachusetts nursing home .
She was 81 .
Her writings were viewed , then and now , as all the more significant because she wrote and taught at a Jesuit university .
" She was a great trained philosopher , theologian and poet , and she used all of those tools to demolish patriarchy - or any idea that domination is natural - in its most defended place , which is religion , " said Gloria Steinem .
Dr. Daly taught at Boston College for more than 30 years , but her relationship with the institution grew tempestuous as she insisted that only women could take her classes .
Sister Joan Chittister , feminist author and member of the Benedictine Sisters of Erie , Pa. , said Dr. Daly turned standard theological concepts upside down .
" Mary played with language in such a way that you simply had to stop and think , " Chittister said .
" You could n't use old words in the old ways . "
" Ever since childhood , I have been honing my skills for living the life of a Radical Feminist Pirate and cultivating the Courage to Sin , " she wrote in the opening of " Sin Big , " a 1996 autobiographical article for the New Yorker magazine .
" The word ' sin ' is derived from the Indo - European root ' es - , ' meaning ' to be . '
When I discovered this etymology , I intuitively understood that for a woman trapped in patriarchy , which is the religion of the entire planet , ' to be ' in the fullest sense is ' to sin . ' "
Dr. Daly 's career at Boston College , where she joined the theology faculty in 1966 , ultimately ended over what administrators saw as her sin of exclusivity .
After the college went co-ed in the early 1970s , she allowed only women to take her classes , teaching a few men privately over the years .
The dispute spilled into the courts in the late 1990s when a male student hired a lawyer after Dr. Daly barred him from her class .
The college tried to force her into retirement , and she sued , citing breach of contract .
She and the college reached a settlement in 2001 and , at 72 , she agreed to retire .
Those who knew Dr. Daly and her work say the dispute did not diminish her contributions .
" I think she was a central figure for the feminist movement in the 20th century and hopefully beyond , " said Robin Morgan , who edited " Sisterhood Is Powerful : An Anthology of Writing From the Women 's Liberation Movement . "
" She redefined the parameters of philosophy . "
Observation of the day :
On brewing coffee with C4
During an email discussion of the explosive used by the testicle - toasting terrorist of Detroit , my friend retired Col.
John Meyer commented on his own use of the stuff — and offered a warning .
“ I ’ve heated many a cup of coffee on C4 , rolled into little balls , ” he said .
“ The trick was to never try to stamp out the fire when you were finished . ”
Asked to explain this use of C4 , he added :
The small balls of C4 used to heat rations were about the size of spitballs .
C4 can be ignited with a match .
As one ball would burn out , you rolled another up next to it , so it would ignite .
We used a modified C-ration can for a stove .
One side was cut open , so there was plenty of air for the ‘ rapid combustion . ’
As a side note , long before there was a Starbucks , we figured our C4 heated coffee was pretty expensive .
A one - pound block of C4 was reported to cost about $ 90 .

In this ongoing series with Dr. Jack Alpert , www.skil.org , you become an integral player in the human experiment of the 21st century .
How will human numbers affect you , your kids and future generations ?
What will you do to change course ?
Something ?
Nothing ?
Just ride out the consequences ?
Will any national leaders take the initiative over human overpopulation in America ?
In an intriguing interview , " Does Your Addition See the Future Clearly ? "
Dr. Alpert presents a few simple realities facing future generations .
" Today 20 percent of the world 's human population consumes about 80 percent of the world 's resources and the remaining 80 percent of the population consumes the remaining 20 percent , " said Alpert .
" Over the next 40 years , the world 's population is expected to add 2.5 billion people -- mostly to the large poor group .
Due to limits of , and damage to , the environment , everyone is experiencing increased costs of living relative to income .
Most are experiencing reductions in the delivery of goods and services . "
The question Dr. Alpert asks is how will the arrival of 2.5 billion more people change who gets what goods and services ?
To answer this we have to consider several factors :
1 ) Will the produced goods and services get bigger , remain the same , or get smaller ?
Certainly , delivery of goods and services will be diminished by :
a. exhausting non-renewables , in particular our diminishing oil reserves
b. using renewables above their maximum productive rate
c. overusing the absorption capabilities of the environment such as carbon emissions now being debated in Copenhagen
d. delivery of goods and services will increase because technology will deliver more with less
" Assume the net effect of these counter processes is that the delivery of goods and services will remain constant , " said Alpert .
" I feel this assumption is optimistic because I believe the current delivery of goods and services ( the total human footprint ) is near global carrying capacity . "
2 ) Will the rich communities increase , hold constant , or decrease their present aid to the poor large community ?
" I assume the rich communities , faced with their own decreases in deliveries ( increases in costs relative to income ) will not increase their generosity , " said Alpert .
" Let 's assume they hold their contributions to the poor community constant . "
3 ) This means the poor community will have to stretch its 20 percent of the global bounty over nine billion people instead of 6.8 billion .
4 ) Since at least a billion of the poor group is already living close to starvation levels , no food can be shared by them without causing death .
5 ) The sharing must come from poor people living at least two times subsistence .
If there are 2.5 billion in this group a sharing strategy could add five billion people to the group living just above starvation .
That would mean that six billion people would be living just one bad harvest from starvation and death .
6 ) If these numbers fail to show you a future of unwanted conditions , consider that there is an additional demand on global resources .
Normal rich people are used to and expect a 2 - 3 percent improvement in their wellbeing each year .
To fuel this they will need 2 - 3 percent more of the world 's goods and services .
Remember there are no unallocated goods and services .
7 ) Because each rich person can pay more for goods and services than each poor person , he or she can purchase ( in the market ) part of the 20 percent of the goods and services now supporting the poor .
8 ) This transfer of two percent of global resources from poor to rich translates to a 10 percent reduction of the goods and services used to feed the poor group each year .
I think this means that the poor population declines , through starvation at 10 percent .
( For example , 10 percent of nine million or about 900 million people .
9 ) I think this means that in ten years all the people whose life sustenance was dependent on that 20 percent of the globe 's goods and services have now starved to death .
10 ) All these deaths were caused by market forces .
No one has to take personal responsibility .

Scattered Notes On Logic , Truth And Paradox ~ Updated Every Wednesday
Were toddlers in the boot drugged with Nytol before mother ' asphyxiated them ' ?
Tests are being carried out today to determine whether two children allegedly murdered by their mother were drugged with Nytol before they were smothered .
Fiona Donnison walked into a police station on Wednesday and told shocked officers she had killed her son Harry , three , and daughter Elise , two .
An initial post - mortem carried out yesterday on the bodies of Harry and Elise revealed that they had been asphyxiated less than 24 hours before they were found .
The bodies of Elise , 2 , and Harry , 3 , Donnison were found in the boot of a car in Heathfield on Wednesday .
A post mortem revealed they had been asphyxiated
Officers are investigating whether Mrs Donnison gave the children the sleeping drug Nytol before suffocating them a few hours before they were found , the Sun newspaper reported .
However the results of toxicology tests wo n't be known for several weeks .
A Sussex Police spokesman yesterday confirmed that officers had had ' previous contact ' with the Donnison family ' within the last few months ' .
It also emerged last night that Mrs Donnison , 43 , suffered the agonising cot death of a baby daughter six years ago .
Mrs Donnison and her husband Paul found their world falling apart after their first child - Mia Florence - died at just ten months .
Although they had two more children , the rows and spells of depression grew more frequent until Mrs Donnison took Harry and Elise and moved into a rented home several months ago .
Friends spoke of a ' history of allegations and counter allegations ' between the couple , who had both been married previously .
Last weekend Mr Donnison , 46 , an accounts manager , was arrested over claims that he assaulted his estranged wife during a bitter argument .

On Wednesday , Mrs Donnison walked into an East Sussex police station and confessed to murdering her children ..
Their bodies of Harry and Elise , in two sports holdalls , were in the boot of her Nissan car , parked close to the £ 500,000 home in Heathfield , East Sussex , where the family had lived .
Detectives were still searching the house and the rented home in Surrey where Mrs Donnison , a former City worker , moved with the children .
She slashed her wrists before walking into the police station in Heathfield - which is just 300 yards from her former home - and was taken to hospital in Eastbourne .
She is recovering under police guard but detectives have not yet been able to interview her .

Family home :
The Donnisons lived together in this house before separating just before Christmas
Friends said the marriage began to collapse after little Mia died in April 2004 , just two months before her first birthday .
When the couple discovered she was not breathing , they took her to hospital but doctors could not save her .
At an inquest the following month , coroner Alan Craze returned a verdict of death by natural causes .
The official cause was ' sudden unexpected death in infancy ' .
Family members posted tributes to Mia on a memorial website .
A poem written by one of her grandmothers reads : ' A flower blossoms ; then withers and dies .
' It leaves a fragrance behind which , long after its delicate petals are but little dust , still lingers in the air ...'
Cordoned off :

Mrs Donnison is under police guard at Eastbourne General District Hospital
Her parents , and Mrs Donnison 's sons from her previous marriage , wrote : ' We all miss Mia terribly - with all our love and hugs always - Mummy , Daddy , Will and Ollie xxxxx '
Neighbours noticed a marked change in Mrs Donnison after the tragedy and said she often appeared ' strained ' .
A friend said she had been deeply depressed after losing Mia , but was always a ' loving mum ' to her other children and well as her two older sons W , 15 , and O , 12 .

The friend said : ' This was not like her .
She must have snapped . '
But the couple 's marriage had been falling apart for a long time .
The friend said : ' I knew it was never going to work between them .
' It was just not meant to be .
They were both so different .
I 've been around them when they rowed . '
Mr Donnison is currently on police bail after being arrested for common assault .
It is understood his wife accused him of scratching her during a row at their old home .
A Sussex Police spokesman said : ' We are aware of previous contact with the police in relation to this family .
' This will be reviewed as a matter of standard procedure with various agencies and also to help the current inquiry . '
It is thought the Independent Police Complaints Commission will be asked to probe the force 's dealings with the Donnisons , as there appeared to be no warning of the horror that unfolded this week .
Insiders said detectives were trying to establish what drove Mrs Donnison to allegedly take the lives of her children .
A source said : ' At this stage , police do n't know what caused the break - up of her marriage and what triggered this terrible tragedy .
' It is not clear whether either of the Donnisons were involved in new relationships . '
Officers are also checking Mrs Donnison 's mental health records and are liaising with social services over whether they had had any contact with the family .
Social services refused to comment but a spokesman for the local mental health trust said it had had no dealings with Mrs Donnison .
Forensic scientists last night removed what looked like a medicine box from Mrs Donnison 's rented home in Lightwater , Surrey .
The clear plastic box appeared to contain tablets and medicine bottles .
Neighbours on the quiet residential street in Lightwater , where one of Mrs Donnison 's older sons was also living , described her as a ' loner ' who had made no effort to get to know people in the area .
' She was always looking down , ' said one man .
' I think she only ever waved to me once and that was because she had no other choice because I was standing right in front of her . '
An elderly neighbour said : ' The previous Monday she just put the kids in the car and went .
She was gone for the whole week .
' Nobody knew where she had gone and then a For Rent sign went up but she came back on Saturday .
I just assumed it was to clean the house ready to move out . '
At Mr Donnison 's parents ' home in Chertsey , Surrey , a relative said : ' We 're going through hell .
We 've never been through anything like this before .
' I 'm sure you can imagine how difficult it is to come to terms with what has happened . '
Because Dartmouth ’s analysis focuses solely on patients who have died , a case like Mr. Putrus ’s would not show up in its data .
That is why critics say Dartmouth ’s approach takes an overly pessimistic view of medicine : if you consider only the patients who die , there is really no way to know whether it makes sense to spend more on one case than another .
According to Dartmouth , Medicare pays about $ 50,000 during a patient ’s last six months of care by U.C.L.A. , where patients may be seen by dozens of different specialists and spend weeks in the hospital before they die .
By contrast , the figure is about $ 25,000 at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minn. , where doctors closely coordinate care , are slow to bring in specialists and aim to avoid expensive treatments that offer little or no benefit to a patient .
“ One of them costs twice as much as the other , and I can tell you that we have no idea what we ’re getting in exchange for the extra $ 25,000 a year at U.C.L.A. Medical , ” Peter R. Orszag , the White House budget director and a disciple of the Dartmouth data , has noted .
“ We can no longer afford an overall health care system in which the thought is more is always better , because it ’s not . ”
By some estimates , the country could save $ 700 billion a year if hospitals like U.C.L.A. behaved more like Mayo .
High medical bills for Medicare patients ’ final year of life account for about a quarter of the program ’s total spending .
Under the House health care legislation pending in Congress , the Institute of Medicine would conduct a study of the regional variations in Medicare spending to try to determine how to reward hospitals like Mayo for providing more cost - effective care .
Hospitals identified as high - cost centers might even be penalized , perhaps receiving lower payments from the government .
The Senate bill calls only for studies of Medicare spending variations , so it will be up to House - Senate negotiators to resolve the matter in the final legislation .
That prospect worries Dr. Rosenthal and his U.C.L.A. colleagues , who say that unless the distinction can be clearly drawn between excellence and excess in medical care , efforts to cut wasteful spending could be little more than blunt rationing .
Stancl told the court he had been taking medication for depression
A US teenager who blackmailed fellow students at his secondary school into having sex after using their Facebook images has been convicted .
Anthony Stancl , 19 , from Wisconsin , admitted two counts of sexual assault and in return other more serious charges were dropped .
Prosecutors said he tricked boys into sending naked images of themselves , and then blackmailed the boys for sex .
Stancl , who said he had been depressed , faces up to 50 years in jail .
The case came to light after a 16 - year - old pupil told the authorities he was being blackmailed .
After exchanging explicit pictures of himself with Stancl - who prosecutors said posed as a girl online - when he was 15 , the boy had been told the images would be distributed around the school if he refused to perform sex acts .
The boy 's images were among about 300 such pictures and videos of more than 30 male students at New Berlin Eisenhower High School , in south - east Wisconsin , that police found on Stancl 's computer .
Waukesha County district attorney Brad Schimel said he was satisfied with the plea deal , which spared victims from having to appear in court - a key factor in his negotiations , the Associated Press news agency reported .
" I 've never had a case where the victims and their families were more apprehensive about testifying , " Mr Schimel was quoted by AP as saying .
" From the victims ' perspective , they 're relieved we 're doing this . "
The United States is moving toward enshrining a free and open internet with six proposed rules designed to prevent telecommunications companies from interfering with how people use their connections .
The rules are needed because American internet providers have interfered with internet traffic on a number of occasions and they must be prevented from doing so in the future , said Federal Communications Commission chairman Julius Genachowski in a speech at the Brookings Institution in Washington .
" The rise of serious challenges to the free and open internet puts us at a crossroads .
We could see the internet 's doors shut to entrepreneurs , the spirit of innovation stifled , a full and free flow of information compromised .
Or we could take steps to preserve internet openness , helping ensure a future of opportunity , innovation , and a vibrant marketplace of ideas , " he said .
" The internet is an extraordinary platform for innovation , job creation , investment , and opportunity .
It has unleashed the potential of entrepreneurs and enabled the launch and growth of small businesses across America .
It is vital that we safeguard the free and open internet . "
The FCC , the United States ' counterpart to the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission , has since 2005 applied four so - called net neutrality principles in its decision - making .
The regulator is now seeking to codify those principles , along with two new ones , as law .
The principles
Two new principles will join those original four and be formalized as official rules that will apply to both wired and wireless networks : Consumers are entitled to access whatever lawful internet content they want .
Consumers are entitled to run whatever applications and services they want , subject to the needs of law enforcement .
Consumers can connect to networks whatever legal devices they want , so long as they do not harm them .
Consumers are entitled to competition between networks , applications , services and content providers .
Service providers are not allowed to discriminate between applications , services and content outside of reasonable network management .
Service providers must be transparent about the network management practices they use .
Genachowski , who was appointed to his job this summer by President Barack Obama — a fellow net neutrality supporter — said the FCC will launch its rule - making process in October and will seek input from the public and interested companies .
The rules will have to be approved by the FCC 's five commissioners , three of which are Democrats and supporters of net neutrality .
Happy to hear news
Net neutrality supporters cheered the news .
Vint Cerf , the Google vice - president who helped created the internet in the 1970s and 1980s , said the rules are needed because internet providers have recently started blocking applications — such as peer - to - peer software — and favouring certain websites .
" If consumers had a wide choice of broadband service providers , preserving an open internet might not be such a critical issue .
Unfortunately , the vast majority of Americans have few [ if any ] choices in selecting a provider , " he wrote on Google 's public policy blog .
" As a result , these providers are in a position to influence whether and how consumers and producers can use the on-ramps to the internet — and we 've already seen several examples of discriminatory actions or threats that impair openness . "
One of the instances Cerf was referring to was cable provider Comcast 's blocking of peer - to - peer traffic last year .
The company was sanctioned by the FCC and ordered to stop the practice , but Comcast filed a lawsuit against the regulator saying it did n't have the authority to make such demands .
The lawsuit is still pending .
The move is a major blow to phone and cable companies , who have argued that they need to manage their networks as they see fit .
They have also said that further regulation of their networks will discourage investment in them .
Wireless companies will be particularly opposed as so far , they have been able to call the shots on what applications and services consumers can use on their devices .
" We believe that this kind of regulation is unnecessary in the competitive wireless space as it would prevent carriers from managing their networks — such as curtailing viruses and other harmful content — to the benefit of their consumers , " Chris Guttman - McCabe , vice - president of regulatory affairs for the Cellular Telephone Industries Association , told the Wall Street Journal .
In Canada the CRTC is looking at whether net neutrality rules are needed , and if so , what they should be .
The regulator held a series of hearings this summer and is expected to announce its findings this year .
Canadian internet providers have said net neutrality rules are not needed because the Telecommunications
Act already prohibits preferential treatment of traffic .
Neutrality supporters , however , have argued that cases such as the slowing of peer - to - peer traffic by several internet providers — which the CRTC allowed after hearings last year — show that the rules are n't strong enough .
Report : The Twin Crises : Immigration and Infrastructure The Social Contract Press
Immigration will be responsible for more than 80 % of the spending needed to expand infrastructure capability between now and mid-century , according to " The Twin Crises : Immigration and Infrastructure , " a new report on the impact of immigration on U.S. public works by prominent researcher Edwin S. Rubenstein .
The report was released at a Press Conference on January 13 at the National Press Club in Washington , D.C.
For more information , see :
HS Today article
Uninsured , Unreimbursed Care Threatens EDs , Trauma Units , Report States by Anthony L. Kimery , Tuesday , 13 January 2009
A new report released Tuesday by the group Social Contract at a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington , DC asserted that " hospitals throughout the country have been inundated by uninsured immigrants " and that " the financial strain has affected the quality of medical services , forced hospitals to close clinics and emergency rooms , and put infrastructure expansion plans on hold . " ... While advocates for illegal aliens and pro-amnesty supporters maintain that statistics and other evidence that shows that providing emergency medical care to uninsured illegals and related unreimbursed costs are flawed or biased , studies HSToday.us has reviewed and authorites HSToday.us has interviewed assert just as strongly that that argument is unfounded .
Indeed , studies by GAO and the Department of Health and Human Services tend to support the conclusion of the new Social Contract study .
WorldNetDaily article
" If the infrastructure crisis could be fixed by spending money , there would be no crisis , " Mr. Rubenstein explained in a statement .
" Since 1987 , capital spending on transportation infrastructure has increased by 2.1 percent per year above the inflation rate .
At $ 233 billion ( 2004 dollars ) , infrastructure is already one of the largest categories of government spending .
Our infrastructure is ' crumbling ' because population growth has overwhelmed the ability of even these vast sums to expand capacity . " ...
In his research , Rubenstein finds that the average immigrant household generates a fiscal debt of $ 3,408 after federal benefits and taxes are considered .
At the state and local level , the fiscal debt amounts to $ 4.398 per immigrant household .
" There are currently about 36 million immigrants living in about 9 million households , so the aggregate deficit attributable to immigrants comes to $ 70.3 billion , " he writes .
" Immigrants could deplete the amount of funds available for infrastructure by as much as $ 70 billion per year . "

Going by hairdos , this looks to be from the late 1990s or the turn of the century .

POCKET MONSTERS ARE REALLY POCKET DEMONS ... [ Everything Is Terrible ! ]
Yes , we know — when the FCC puts out a press release ( PDF ) titled " Columbia Institute for Tele - Information to Conduct Independent Review of Telecom Capital Expenditures to Assist FCC , " the eyeballs begin to glaze and the limbs feel suddenly heavy .
But this one 's worth rousing the brain for , because the FCC announcement means that the agency is taking a close look at just how much investment ISPs make in their broadband lines .
The FCC's National Broadband Plan is due to Congress next February , and the agency just launched the first of its 20 different staff - led workshops into all aspects of US broadband .
The FCC is looking beyond its walls , too , already commissioning studies about worldwide broadband deployment and usage from Harvard 's Berkman Center for Internet and Society ( of which Charles Nesson , the Harvard Law professor who recently represented file - swapper Joel Tenenbaum , was a cofounder ) .
Now , the FCC is asking Columbia 's Institute for Tele - Information ( CITI ) to do an outside review of " projected deployment of new and upgraded networks to help inform the FCC 's efforts in developing the National Broadband Plan . "
This analysis wo n't be a mere economic examination of work that might be paid for by the government , either ; CITI " will provide an analysis of the public statements of companies as to their future plans to deploy and upgrade broadband networks " but will also do a " historical evaluation of the relationship between previous such announcements and actual deployment . "
Genachowski has promised an FCC decision - making process that is driven by data , and in commissioning the two studies , he appears interested in taking a hard look at two common complaints about US Internet service : 1 ) that some other countries are doing much better in terms of both speed and competition and 2 ) that , because of this perceived lack of meaningful competition , US ISPs have turned broadband into a cash cow without making enough investment in faster speeds or better technologies .
If today 's press release sounds dry , it is — but ISPs have gotten the message and are already going public to defend their record of investment .
Comcast points out that it previously pledged to upgrade 65 percent of its coverage area to 50 M bps DOCSIS 3.0 by the end of 2009 ; in an announcement today , the company raised that target to 80 percent ( and it plans 100 percent coverage by the end of 2010 ) .
Translation : we 're investing !
( Which should be easy to do when you just announced a 4.5 percent increase in quarterly revenue , as the company did today . )
Most of the large cable companies are in a decent infrastructure position .
Having already built out hybrid fiber / coax ( HFC ) systems a decade ago , there 's plenty of bandwidth in the system , and relatively inexpensive DOCSIS upgrades at the headend can provide major speed boosts .
That 's one of the reasons that , for operators like Time Warner , broadband costs are going down even as revenue continues to rise .
Nothing wrong with that , of course , unless you try to claim that broadband costs are soaring and thus prices must be raised .
Coming in for more criticism are the telcos , except for Verizon , which is deploying fiber to the home across its service area .
But none of the other major players are doing so , at most offering some fiber to the node schemes increase speeds marginally .
Yet companies like AT&T are basically minting money ; the company pulled in $ 12.9 billion in profit in 2009 alone , up from $ 4.8 billion in 2005 .
As an AT&T customer , numbers like this always make me wonder why I 'm not surfing the Internet from a 100 M bps fiber - optic line — or at least something faster than 6 M bps DSL .
CITI 's analysis dovetails nicely with the work that the Berkman Center is doing .
Together , the two reports should give us a nice picture of just how the US stacks up to other countries , what the true costs of broadband deployment and upgrade are , and whether some companies have gone into " harvest mode " on their lines .
Claim : Motorists in most U.S. states can be fined for failing to slow down or change lanes when passing parked emergency vehicles .
TRUE
Example : [ Collected via e-mail , January 2004 ]
Let my misfortune be a lesson for you .
This is a long story , but a must read .
This really happened to me yesterday ( 12/10/03 ) .
Let my misfortune be a lesson for you .
This is a long story , but a must read .
This really happened to me yesterday ( 12/10/03 ) .
Yesterday , I was driving into town along the Southwest Freeway around 12:30 PM .
I was in the far left lane doing the posted speed limit of 65 and going with the flow of traffic .
When I got over the Bissonnett / Braeswood overpass , there was an HPD squad car parked on the left shoulder with the officer standing out in front of his vehicle pointing his radar gun at oncoming cars .
Your inclination automatically tells you to slow down , whether you were speeding or not .
Not a 1/2 mile down the freeway , there was another HPD officer that had someone pulled over on the left shoulder giving the person a ticket .
I thought , man this was an obvious speed trap and kept on going .
I had slowed down to around 60 at that point as now the posted speed limit was 60 .
About a mile up the road , around Gessner , another HPD officer had someone else pulled over to give them a ticket and literally in front of that traffic stop was another HPD officer ( yes we are up to 4 cop cars now in about a mile ) walking around to the front of his car .
Just as I was approaching him , he pointed his radar gun at me and signaled for me to pull over .
I was shocked , because I know that I was going the posted speed limit ( 60 ) as I immediately looked at my speedometer .
The officer came to my window and said “ do you know how fast you were going ? ” I said yes , I was going 60 .
He said “ you were doing 58 ” and he showed me his radar gun , which read 58 .
I said okay .
He said “ you failed to slow your speed down by 20 MPH or move over to the adjacent lane when an emergency vehicle was stopped in the flow of traffic . ”
I said , I did not know that was a law ( of course that is never a defense ) and he said it was and asked for my license .
The officer wrote me a ticket that carries a $ 200 fine for this infraction .
Come to find out , this is a new state law as of September 1 , 2003 .
From the TX DPS website , the law reads : SB 193 requires drivers nearing a stopped emergency vehicle that has lights activated , unless otherwise directed by a law enforcement officer , to : Vacate the lane closest to the emergency vehicle , if the highway has two or more lanes traveling the direction of the emergency vehicle ; or Slow to a speed not more than 20 miles per hour ( mph ) less than the posted speed limit when the posted speed limit is 25 mph or more ; or Slow to a speed not more than five mph when the posted speed limit is less than 25 mph .
A violation is a punishable by a maximum fine of $ 200 .
If the violation results in property damage , the maximum fine increases to $ 500 .
If the violation results in bodily injury , the offense is enhanced to a Class B misdemeanor .
It was signed by the governor on June 18 and became Law on 9/1 .
Origins : On 1 September 2003 , a new traffic law went into effect in the Lone Star state .
Troopers did n’t strictly enforce it for its first ninety days on the books ( they began ticketing in earnest only in December 2003 ) , which is why reaction to this new measure did n’t begin to surface until
three months after one might have expected it to .
The “ Move Over Act ” ( Sec. 545.157 of the Texas Transportation Code ) requires motorists approaching emergency vehicles that are stopped with their lights flashing by the sides of roads to move out of the lanes closest to these vehicles or to reduce speed to 20 mph under the posted limit .
( If the speed limit is less than 25 mph , motorists must slow to 5 mph . )
This law was intended to reduce the number of injuries to police officers , paramedics , ambulance workers , and fire fighters who have all too often been winged by cars whizzing past sites where they were attempting to
carry out their duties .
“ The whole idea of that law is to keep people from running over us , ” said Kyle Coleman , a lieutenant with the Bexar County Sheriff ’s Department .
“ It ’s a real nerve - racking experience .
You feel the wind from the ( side ) mirror slide across your back . ”
“ People were not slowing down and it ’s very dangerous for the emergency services personnel to be on the side of the road , ” said Tela Mange , a spokeswoman for
the Texas Department of Public Safety .
“ They are very vulnerable .
There oftentimes are wrecks because people are not paying attention or are more interested on what ’s going on in the side of the road . ”
Many of those who serve have been killed by careless motorists .
In 2003 , among the police officers killed nationwide , 13 were struck by vehicles while they were on duty outside of their vehicles .
In the five years since we originally published this article many other states have passed “ move over ” laws , the latest being New York , which in January 2011 enacted a law requiring drivers approaching a stationary emergency or maintenance vehicle with flashing lights to move to the next adjacent lane if it is safe to do so , and , barring that , to reduce their speed .
All states except Hawaii and the District of Columbia now have some form of “ move over ” law on the books , as do many of the Canadian provinces .
A January 2010 message circulated by e-mail claimed that a new “ move over ” traffic law had been implemented in California just that month :
In California , the “ Move- over ” law became effective on January 1 , 2010 .
In California , the “ Move- over ” law became effective on January 1 , 2010 .
I wanted to let my friends know about the CA move over law .
My son got a ticket on Pleasant Hill coming back from Wal - Mart .
A police car ( turned out it was 2 police cars ) was on the side of the road giving a ticket to someone else .
My son slowed down to pass but did not move into the other lane .
The second police car immediately pulled him over and gave him a ticket .
My son and I had never heard of the law .
It is a new law that states if any emergency vehicle is on the side of the road , if you are are able , you are to move into the far lane .
The cost of the ticket was $ 754 , with 3 points on your license and a mandatory court appearance .
Please tell everyone you know ( that drives ) about this new law .
However , California ’s “ move over ” law was actually passed in 2006 and implemented in 2007 , and the standard penalties for violating it are exaggerated in the e-mail :
California has had a “ Move Over , Slow Down ” law for several years .
The law that took effect Jan. 1 [ 2010 ] made it permanent and added Caltrans trucks to the list of vehicles you must make way for , which includes police cars , fire engines , ambulances and tow trucks .
If you see an emergency vehicle on the side of a highway with lights flashing , you must slow down and move into an adjacent lane if it is safe to do so .
The fine [ for violating this law ] is around $ 146 , with one point on your record .
( Although the monetary fine specified in the California Vehicle Code for an infraction of this type is “ not more than $ 50 , ” the state and the county where the infraction took place typically impose additional penalty assessments and surcharges , so the total fine paid can vary from county to county and is likely to be around the $ 146 figure mentioned above . )

TmoNews is reporting on three hot new handsets that are rumored to be hitting T - Mobile in this first quarter of 2010 .
One handset is the HTC HD2 which was made official at CES .
The second is an unknown handset from Garmin that was spotted recently at the FCC showing off its AWS band and is rumored to be launching in May .
Last but not least is a handset identified as the myTouch2 , also referred to as the myTouch Slide and codenamed the Espresso .
Android fans will recognize that last codename has been making the rounds in the rumor mill over the past few months .
It has shown up in a list of codenames from a leaked Android 2.1 ROM , will be rocking the latest version of HTC ’s Sense UI and may have the same 528MHz processor found in the Hero / Magic , a QWERTY keyboard and a 320×480 display .
This latest revelation now places the handset as the potential successor to the myTouch 3G with a T - Mobile launch tentatively set for May 17th .
Any future Android owners out there going to pass on the Nexus One and wait on the Espresso ?

A Look Back at Apple Special Event Invites
Ever since Apple sent out the invites for the January 27th event , rumoured to be a tablet reveal , people have been dissecting the design of the invitation trying to gain some insight .
There is a history of this activity , but from memory I ca n’t remember any accurate information being derived from an invitation .
But just to confirm my suspicion , I scoured the web to find any Apple Event invitations and then compared them against the actual announcements made at that event .
I ’ve collated the information I discovered here and listed them in ascending date order .
16th October 2003
This is the earliest Apple Special invite I could find .
Very clearly aimed at the music market , and carrying heavy iPod branding this event was rumoured to be an unveiling of iTunes for Windows , and that ’s exactly what it was .
It ’s easy to understate the importance of this event but in Apple ’s recent history , it ’s one of the biggest .
Porting iTunes to Windows allowed iPods to work with Windows , the biggest operating system on the planet .
It was at this point the iPod leapt from a niche product to a mainstream darling .

7th September 2005
With hindsight , you could chose to read quite a lot into this invite .
Like the previous invite , this is clearly aimed at the iTunes / iPod ecosystem .
Looking at the image used in the invitation you might like to assume that the iPod at the time would have fitted into the pocket in the jeans .
You might also like to assume that the iPod Nano would fit into the smaller pocket also present in the picture .
It was the iPod Nano that was the announced at this event .
This event was also noteworthy for the release of the original iPhone .
Well , the Motorola ROKR E1 , the ill fated first phone to integrate with iTunes .
This collaboration really did n’t deliver what users wanted from an Apple Phone , or even a phone that was capable of linking to iTunes .
Image Source .
12th October 2005
If you had to choose one word to describe the theme of this invite , it would probably be some variation of “ show ” .
The “ One more thing … ” tagline , a staple of Apple events that sets its announcements apart from other companies because of it ’s showmanship , and the theatre curtains , both point to a show or a performance .
It is therefore a tad surprising that the rumours circulating around the time of this event were so mundane .
An updated G5 tower and G4 PowerBooks , whilst important to the core Apple user base , are n’t terribly exciting .
What ’s less surprising is that all the announcements were related , at least tenuously , with performances , visual performances .
We had the first iMac to come with an iSight camera built in , the first video iPod and iTunes version 6 . Image Source .
28th February 2006
As far back as I can remember , this was the strangest and most disappointing Apple event of recent times .
In sharp contrast to the previous event ( 12t October 2005 ) , the rumours were far more exciting than the actual reveals .
People were expecting what we now know is the iPod Touch and some of the first Intel powered iBooks , but instead they got the Apple Hi-Fi and a Mac Mini Core Duo .
If the last event could be summed up with “ Show ” I think this one could be summed up with “ Meh ” .
Image Source .
12th September 2006
In a similar vein to the “ One more thing … ” invitation , this was clearly aimed at the iTunes ecosystem ( with a general theme of entertainment ) and it notable for having one of the few reveals that truly came out of left field , the Apple TV ( or iTV as it was originally named at this event ) .
We also saw iTunes 7 and second generations of the iPod Nano and the iPod Shuffle .
Image Source .
25th September 2006
This invite was sent out very shortly after the previous invite ( “ It ’s Showtime ” , above ) and the event was only a week or so later .
There was no mystery at all to this particular event , held at the photokina photography event , and clearly referencing Aperture , everyone knew what was coming .
This was the announcement , and almost immediate release , of Aperture version 1.5 .
Probably more important than the even itself was the ability to download a trial of Aperture 1.5 a week later , and a very quick turnaround on a patch barely a week later again .
Image Source .
15th April 2007
Much like the Photokina event above , this invite was related to the NAB event in 2007 .
Many in the industry hailed some of the Apple products announced at this special event as revolutionary .
The headliners were Final Cut Studio 4 and Final Cut Server .
Final Cut Server especially was an insightful move by Apple , given the direction media creators were heading in , namely to distributed computer systems with share libraries and resources .
We also saw the introduction of some very specific stand - alone technologies and products , like Apple ProRes , Motion 3 and Color .
A very specific , focus presentation to a very specific audience .
The invitation clearly pointed towards the content contained within .
Image Source .
5th September 2007
The rumours prior to this event were pretty accurate .
Many people were eagerly expecting a phone - less iPhone , and we got the iPod Touch .
I ’ll also remember this event for the release of the rather oddly shaped iPod Nano , the square one .
We also got the iPod Classic , with its huge storage capacity , and to accompany the iPod Touch , the WiFi iTunes store .
As seems to be the way , this iPod focused event got an iPod focused invitation .
Apple left no doubt in anyone ’s mind as to what the topic of conversation was going to be .

WWDC , 9th June 2008
Whilst not really a special event , this invite was sent out for the keynote that kicked off WWDC 2008 .
I wanted to include it because I thought the imagery used matched the keynote itself .
The images used in the invite has the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco duplicated and heading to two different locations .
The keynote was similarly split into two .
The first half was concentrated almost entirely around the iPhone SDK and even included a demonstration on stage of a basic application being built .
The second half of the keynote was far more consumer orientated and included the revealing of Mobile Me and the iPhone 3G .
I do n’t think too much can be read into the invitation here as it was certainly more about the entire WWDC event rather than just the keynote .
I just liked the way the imagery used mirrored the keynote , whether it was intentional or not .
Image Source .
9th September 2009
Well , that certainly looks like an iPod interface , does n’t it ?
The timing of this event combined with this invitation once again left no doubt as to the topic of the event , iPods .
At this one we got the second generation iPod Touch , the fourth generation iPod Nano as well as a new version of iTunes ( v8 ) complete with HD movies .
Image Source .
14th October 2008
Looking through this list , it sort of feels like Apple ’s lost a bit of the adventure some of the early events had .
Through the years it appears as if the invitations are getting less and less vague .
Apple is setting more realistic expectations .
No doubt this has something to do with their greater size and exposure to the stock market , which hangs on every event , watching , judging .
The rumours preceding this event were mostly centered around new sized notebooks .
In fact , people were so keen to get the details down you ’ll find images online where people have attempted to extrapolate the size of the notebook in the invitation from the relative size of the Apple logo .
The products were , however , rather more mundane .
We simply got updated versions of the MacBook Pro , MacBook Air , MacBook and the new 24 ″ Cinema Display that ’s designed for notebooks .
Image Source .
9th September 2009
It seems that Apple events around the September 10th ( 7th in 2005 , 12th in 2006 , 5th in 2007 , 9th in 2008 and 9th again in 2009 ) always focus on their iPod holiday line - up .
It makes sense from a business perspective and we all know what to expect .
Hence Apple does n’t even attempt to add any mystery to these events at all .
Even as these events go , this was a fairly low key affair .
We got some new colours for the iPod Shuffle , iTunes 9 and updated iPod Touches and Nanos .
Quite unspectacular .
Image Source .
27th January 2010
And here we are , up to date .
We do n’t know what Apple will reveal on the 27th , but everyone is suspecting it to be a tablet computer or device of some sort .
You can read an article I wrote covering some usability issues Apple will have to overcome here .

Searching for Trends
Now we ’ve collected some of the invites sent , can we extract any trends from the data ?
Well yes and no .
There are certain events for which Apple seems comfortable to divulge the topic of conversation before hand .
The iPod events are an example of this , they very rarely deviate from the iPod branding leaving no doubt that it ’s an iPod event you ’re going to .
We ’ve also seen some examples of Apple being very explicit with other events .
The MacBook event for one .
It ’s fun to speculate why they do this , but I suspect the reason is that they need to set realistic expectations before hand .
Since the launch , and subsequent success of , the iPod , Apple has been thrust into the spotlight .
As I touched on earlier , they ’re a mainstream electronics company now , not a niche computer manufacturer .
The difference may sound minor ( pedantic , even ) , but it ’s not .
Apple showed with the iPhone that they can , in one move , change an industry .
They ’ve done it three times .
Analysts and Market Watchers expect them to do this every time .
Let ’s take an example , the MacBook event on 14th October 2008 .
Even back as far as then there were rampant rumours of a touchscreen device , a tablet .
If Apple had phrased the invite “ We ’re changing mobile computing forever ” , or something with an equal amount of pomp an drama ( and ambiguity ) , this speculation would have grown .
And when speculation grows , so does expectation .
If speculation had grown to the point it ’s currently at , and Apple had just released a fairly minor MacBook refresh , the disappointment would have been crushing and no doubt their stock market price would have taken a beating .
But instead , Apple told everyone exactly what they were going to be talking about , and then delivered in line with those expectations .
Looking back over these invites , and the events they represent , I can only really remember one where Apple failed to meet expectations ( February 28th 2006 ) .
That ’s quite an accomplishment .
The Tablet Event ?
That brings us on to the tablet event , so let ’s look at it in a little more detail , taking into account the things we ’ve learned from past events .
The Wording
“ Come see our latest creation . ” is a vague and inviting tagline .
There ’s a relaxed feel to the copy that is n’t unheard of for Apple events .
You ’ll also notice that “ creation ” is used in the singular , rather than the plural .
Not since the original iPod event can I remember an Apple special event that focused solely on a single product .
You ’ll note that the biggest announcement of recent times , the original iPhone at MacWorld 2007 , followed a fairly lengthy section on the Apple TV .
As far as we know , there ’s little play on words that Apple has been fond of in the past .
The MacBook Air release ( MacWorld 2008 ) was accompanied by banners stating “ There ’s something in the air ” , which lead people to suspect some sort of cloud based service , possibly for media .
However , it was altogether more blatant than that .
There is also a distinct lack of hyperbole from this invitation .
This may be down to managing expectations , as I ’ve discussed previously , or it may be to allow for some vagueness and ambiguity .
To add some hyperbole you also need to add some specifics .
Like the iPod invitation of 7th September 2005 , they are clearly hinting that it ’s mobile music consumption that ’s changing .
This does n’t prevent Steve Jobs from throwing in some hyperbole during the event though , much like his “ Today we ’re going to make history together ” statement before unveiling the iPhone .
The wording does compliment the overall theme of the invite though .
The Theme
I do n’t think it ’s difficult to pick a theme for this invite .
If I had to sum it up in one word , it would be “ creativity ” .
We have the use of the word “ creation ” , rather than product or device ( neither of which sound particularly Apple , but have been used in the past ) which conjures certain images and feelings .
It ’s not something that ’s been engineered , or manufactured , but rather something that ’s been created lovingly .
Then we ’ve got the paint splatters that appear to be breaking out of some sort of boundary ( thin , grey lines around the outside of the invite ) .
If you think of an audience that this is aimed at , one would be hard pressed to disagree that it ’s the creative community .
The arty splatters , the breaking out of boundaries , the colour and the words .
The paint splatters breaking out of the boundary could also be seen as Apple signalling that they ’re about to do something other manufacturers in the industry are n’t doing .
They are breaking the mould .
Predictions
Based purely on the invitation , I think it ’ll be fun to speculate on what we ’ll see in the event .
Rather than specific products , I want to think about the words that will be used and the themes .
Based purely on the boundary part of the invite ’s design , I would expect to see Apple talking about creating a new market segment .
They ’ll push whatever it is they ’re hawking as something that ’s never been done before .
Incomparable to existing products .
I think there ’ll also be an element of selling it to creatives .
Apple has a long standing reputation as being the computer of choice for creative professionals ( artists , photographers , graphic designers etc. ) , and I think they ’ll play heavily on this .
I would imagine that they ’ve thought through some use cases to demonstrate ( this is a favourite of Steve Jobs , he likes to run through scenarios on stage – remember the call to Starbucks during the MacWorld 2007 iPhone keynote ? ) , and I would n’t be surprised if they included some form of content creation , rather than just consumption .
And here ’s the key concept I think will run through the event .
There are many tablets out there but the use cases are limited .
They are mostly used for content consumption because the inputs are n’t up to scratch ( crippled keyboard , stylii etc. ) .
Apple will create a device that can be used as much for content creation as consumption .
Of course , that ’s reading a lot into an invite .
Probably too much .
And I would n’t be at all surprised if I was 100 % wrong on everything .
But is n’t speculation fun ?
If you know of any invites I ’ve missed out , please let me know and I ’ll add them to this Apple Special Event Invitation Gallery .
Thanks .
So what do you think ?
Can we read anything into the invite ?
Does it follow a clear trend , or not ?
Let us know in the comments .

On how to build software , there is still much we do not know for sure ; but we have also learned a few principles that can be considered firm .
By definition these are not new ideas ; today ’s principle , for example , is related to what agile developers know as “ timeboxing ” .
But even if they have been published and discussed they are not universally applied or understood .
An example is the CPU Clock principle : release at fixed frequency .
When planning for a new release of a system you can play with three parameters : functionality ; quality ; release time .
The CPU Clock principle states that once a release time has been set you should never budge .
If something has to go , it will be functionality .
At Eiffel Software we have been applying this principle systematically since shortly after we released EiffelStudio into open source in 2006 .
There are two releases a year , the “ Northern Spring release ” on May 15 and the “ Southern Spring release ” on November 15 [ 2 ] .
The content of each release is finalized six weeks before ( April 1st , October 1st ) and no delay is tolerated [ 3 ] .
This scheme is a radical departure from the previous mode of operation .
Of course every release had a planned delivery date , but it also had planned functionality ; often , the functionality was not all ready at the appointed time , so the delivery date would shift , often by many months .
No doubt the release plan was thought realistic at the time the team devised it , but it is a natural human tendency to promise too much and hope for the best .
Delays came not so much from major obstacles , as features would get dropped if found too hard to include , but from functionality which the team believed to be “ almost there ” as the release date approached ; a week passed , then a month , then maybe a half - year or more .
The better technique , as we have learned ( no doubt many others have too ) is to make release time the non-negotiable target .
As with the clock cycle of a CPU in a modern computer , the sequence of release deadlines is the heartbeat to which everything else in the process must synchronize .
The scale is different from that of a computer by a few orders of magnitude ( months rather than pico - or nanoseconds ) , but the principle is the same .
The scheme requires a strict rule that whatever is not ready in time will not make it into the release .
Indeed it has occurred a few times that some scheduled functionality had to be dropped , or at least moved to the next release .
But now — with two and a half years of experience — comes the remarkable lesson : this case , dropping a planned feature because it is not ready at the appointed time , happens only exceptionally .
It is not hard to analyze the reasons :
Developers work better .
It is not pleasant , for a developer who has devoted considerable effort to a new mechanism , to see that it does not make it to the product .
Knowing that the deadline is coming , and that it is for real , is a powerful incentive to finish the work .
Everyone , managers and developers , learns to be realistic .
Managers will not set impossible goals ; developers will not commit to impossible implementations .
Traditionally , some software projects have always had to treat delivery time as the number one goal .
If you had to adapt an automatic teller machine network to the introduction of the euro , there was not much other choice than to be ready on January 1 , 2002 , and preferably a little before that .
But many projects have a more lackadaisical attitude .
They would fare better by adhering to the CPU Clock principle .
In describing it I have left a question open .
Functionality should yield to release punctuality , but we saw that there is a third parameter : quality .
What about it ?
Should we be ready to sacrifice it as well ?
I will not address the question furtherfor the moment , if only because this may be a good topic for reader comments before I come back to it in a future post .
The CPU clock principle addresses release times : the times when new versions of the product are made available to its users .
It does not necessarily apply to internal milestones of the development team .
Timeboxing , a related idea made popular by agile methods , is about such internal , intermediate steps ; the typical iteration period of timeboxing is a f ew weeks .
While fixed deadlines and a fixed frequency may be useful for such short internal iterations , the case for timeboxing is less compelling , especially for a large project where the various components may evolve along different timelines .
Because the CPU Clock principle governs the global scheduling of a product development , the scale is different .
I cited above the 6 - month periodicity of EiffelStudio development ; although each project will define its own period , it makes no sense to go below one month for any significant software effort .
How universal is the principle ?
Only two exceptions come to mind : very small projects , and the initial phase of a project , when the development is taking shape and it is too early to define the ideal release scheme .
Outside of these two cases , I see the CPU Clock principle , on the basis of our experience and of discussions with many developers and project leaders , as the only sustainable model for healthy software projects .

Actually some last - minute technical problems have occasionally caused short delays in the actual delivery , without affecting the overall cycle .
We have taken measures to ensure that these do not occur again .

HTC mobiles are now up for something new with their latest inventions popping up .
They have shown themselves to be one of the most powerful Asian firms to be around with new Touch .b idea .
This idea has been released via the web and is expected to be a continued sensation carrying forth in the next year .
However the last release from HTC has not been as powerful as it should have been estimated .
But that does n’t stop HTC bringing forth new and incredible inventions our way .
There HTC phone that was code named ROME will from now use BrewMP with some of the new platforms that have applications to run across .
There are going to be fine surprises that bring really successful use for customers in the coming year .
There are going to be easy to create applications that would run smoothly enough .
The HTC basic model supports Wi-Fi and comes with a 2 MP camera but no video recording .
The European series will successfully bring about something like a big sensation with new Flash support and much more than the basic model ’s provisions .
There is going to be quite a nifty price tag attached to it though .
Waiting for the new release for the coming year would also mean that you are getting a break from all the Android vs Windows mayhem .
[ digg - reddit - me ] I said I was going to make a point of noting solid criticisms of the Obama administration by mainstream conservatives and right wingers .
Mona Charen of the National Review wrote a solid piece that did n’t resort to blatant falsehoods as far as I could tell that made a solid case against health care reform .
Her basic point is that she does n’t trust the Democrats :
Every single page [ of the health care bill ] proclaims something that is dubious — that the Democrats know what they are doing .
Rather than talking about death panels , she points out that electronic recordkeeping has overwhelmed doctors with information they are not used to having to sort through – and thus has made hospitals less efficient .
( She cites no study , but it is certainly plausible that this would be a short term effect . )
Preventive care , she explains , while probably saving lives could end up costing more – as “ more and more of us are tested for more and more diseases . ”
Her big point is that this health care reform is “ brought to you by the same people ” who brought you Medicare and Medicaid – and that the costs of these programs were vastly underestimated .
As she points out :
In 1965 , Congress predicted that by 1990 , Medicare would be costing $ 12 billion .
The actual cost — $ 90 billion .
Long term forecasts of government spending – or really anything – are a fool ’s game , and Charen is right to point this out .
On a macroeconomic level , there are too many factors to take into account – and that ’s not even counting “ black swans ” that change everything .
In this case , the major factor causing the government health care costs to be so off was the explosion of health care inflation in the 1980s which has only gotten worse since .
But it ’s not clear that Medicare or Medicaid played any role in this – especially as their costs have been below that of private insurance .
Bill Clinton made a similar point to Charen ’s yesterday in trying to make the case for why the health care reform should be passed :
There is no perfect bill because there are always unintended consequences …
Yet , Clinton maintained :
The worst thing to do is nothing .
As Steven Pearlstein writing for the Washington Post described the price of doing nothing ( and was later echoed by Barack Obama ) :
Among the range of options for health - care reform , there ’s one that is sure to raise your taxes , increase your out - of - pocket medical expenses , swell the federal deficit , leave more Americans without insurance and guarantee that wages will remain stagnant .
That ’s the option of doing nothing …
This is the answer Democrats give to the sensible concerns of Charen and those like her : there inherent uncertainty in any attempt to change a macroeconomic trend , but given where we are headed if we do nothing , it ’s worth trying .
The only other option is to give up .
This is exactly the sort of sensible criticism that – in my opinion – conservatives should be making .
However , the answer should not be to do nothing , but to “ tinker ” instead of instituting massive top - down changes , and to adopt the measures that work after tinkering .
For the most part , this is exactly the approach the current bills take – which is a testament to the fundamental insights of the conservative movement of the past few decades .
To take into account this fundamental insight while promoting a liberal agenda is in fact the essence of Obama ’s approach :
It ’s why 40 % of the stimulus was tax cuts ; it ’s why the key health care reform is to create a market that allows individuals to make decisions based on information that is more transparent ; it ’s why the answer to global warming is a cap - and - trade program that decentralizes authority and whose main mechanism is a market .
That this has been Obama ’s approach is what has forced the right wing opposition to him to become so unhinged .

The recently Forza'd Delorean DMC - 12 is probably best - known for its brushed stainless steel body , but what would happen if you spent weeks carefully polishing it ?
A spectacular mirror finish to put those chrome - crazy oil sheiks to shame .

The genesis of the very early trend comes from Delorean - owner John McCarty who decided if you 're going to do something , do it all the way .
He wanted to polish his car to a mirror finish and spent about forty hours per panel hand polishing the cars stainless body panels to ultimate perfection , some sections took as much as four hours per square inch .
That 's some dedication right there .
He started with 400 grit wet sandpaper and went all the way diamond polishing paste .
Unbelievable .

Of course , the sincerest form of flattery is imitation , so there have been a few more knuckleheads to take on the task .
Most people have , you know , jobs and stuff to do though so the other polishing jobs have n't been so extreme , but they do add a certain something to the already visually interesting Delorean .
You know what 's great about this modification ?
A couple hours with a graining wheel and it's back to normal if the need should arise .

For the first time in a while , it looks like there might be some division among the Federal Reserveâ€™s policy setting members regarding when the central bank should begin to tighten its easy money policies that have been credited with keeping the U.S. economy afloat during the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression .
The Federal Reserve has expanded its balance sheet by purchasing $ 1.5 trillion worth of Treasury bonds and mortgage - backed securities , as well as making loans available to banks and investment firms for collateral that would usually be deemed too high risk and unacceptable .
In addition to expanding its balance sheet , the Fed has lowered the Federal funds rate to a record low of â€œnear 0%.â€ 
Many revolving consumer loans â€ “ credit cards , home equity loans , etc. â€ “ are tied to the federal funds rate , so the lower the rate , the cheaper these loans and debt become .
The Federal Reserveâ€™s measures have helped to thaw the credit market , slow the bleeding in the housing market and slightly revive consumer spending , which , in turn , has the economy in a fledgling recovery .
So , at what point does the Fed back off and start to tighten its monetary policy ?
On one hand , youâ€™ve got policy members – most importantly , chairman Ben Bernanke â€ “ who appear to want to make sure the economic recovery has a strong footing before starting to tighten the screws .
While waiting to remove the stimulus would certainly help the economy in the near - term , it could end up creating more bubbles ( read : commodities ) and push us towards an inflationary recession at some point down the road .
On the other hand , youâ€™ve got policy members â€ “ most importantly , inflation hawk Thomas Hoenig – who want to tighten monetary policies sooner rather than later .
While acting now will help to squash the threat of inflation down the road , it could kill the current economic recovery and undo all of the work done to this point .
Based on the fact unemployment is above 10 % and will likely climb higher through at least the middle of 2010 , and the dollar has been strengthening lately , I expect the Fed will wait a while before pulling its monetary stimulus and raising short - term interest rates .
Plus , their track record shows the central bank tends to be a bit behind the curve ( read : not pro-active ) .

Two British film - makers have discovered what they believe to be the source of the 1,900 - year old aqueduct built by the emperor Trajan in the early second century AD .
The underground chambers were found – and filmed – after some years of research into Roman hydraulics by the documentary - makers Ted O'Neill and his father Michael O'Neill .
According to Ted , it took some perseverance to find the location , which was hidden beneath a disused church some 30 - 40 km north - west of Rome .
Despite difficulties and delays in getting access to the site , the O'Neills were finally able to enter the underground chambers of the church in June 2009 .
While the aqueduct was used from Roman times until the ninth or tenth centuries , by the Renaissance period it had fallen out of use .
It was rebuilt by Pope Paul V between 1605 and 1615 and renamed the Aqua Paola after him .
It still carries spring water to Rome to this day ( culminating at ' Il Fontanone ' on the Janiculum Hill ) .
Aqua Traiana : Huge Importance to Ancient Rome
However , the source of the Aqua Traiana / Aqua Paola had fallen out of the public consciousness , despite the fact that it was known as recently as 1935 .
A reference to it in a book , The Aqueducts of Ancient Rome by Thomas Ashby , who was director of the British School at Rome between 1906 and 1925 , helped lead the O'Neill team to the right spot near the ruined chapel of Santa Fiore , on the shores of Lake Martignano ( near Lake Bracciano ) .
The Aqua Traiana transported pure spring water to the Janiculum Hill , providing bathing and drinking water for people in that area , water for industry , as well as water for the original St Peter 's church ( built during the reign of Constantine I ) from the fourth century onwards .
According to Mike O'Neill , this was of ' enormous importance ' to ancient Rome .
He adds : “ The site of the water source was also of great religious importance . ”
The source is right in ancient Etruria – the area of northern Lazio and southern Tuscany today – and was also an important water source for the Etruscans .
The Romans , under emperor Trajan at the start of the second century AD , then built a nymphaeum at the site and built their aqueduct to take the water to Rome .
“ This enabled the Romans to bring about what could be seen as one of the first industrial revolutions , ” said Mike O'Neill .
“ With a plentiful water supply coming into the city from the north , the Romans were able to expand certain industries such as grain grinding and stone sawing .
“ The water was also important as a domestic source .
Trajan went to great lengths to collect very pure spring water , which enabled a big improvement in hygiene and sanitation , as well as drinking water .
I do n't think it 's a coincidence that at the time , the empire was able to grow to its greatest extent , while the city of Rome also had a population of as many as 1.5 million . ”
According to Ted O'Neill , the moment the film - crew entered the underground chambers for the first time , they were struck by the preservation of the Roman opus reticulatum brickwork .
They were accompanied by professor Lorenzo Quilici , an expert of ancient Roman topography from the University of Bologna .
Filming Inside the Underground Spring
Ted O'Neill explained : “ The chapel has two rooms extending off to each side , both of which are bricked off .
The base of the structure is semi-oval shaped .
The chapel is about 3 m below today 's ground level , so a ladder was needed to get down into a chamber behind a bricked - up arch , as well as lighting equipment .
There , the team found beautiful brickwork in pristine condition .
Professor Quilici confirmed that they are in fact Roman .
Beyond this subterranean chamber , there is a long gallery that leads to the beginnings of Trajan 's aqueduct . ”
The team was researching and filming another Roman aqueduct at the time – the Aqua Alsietina , which also begins at Lake Martignano .
Ted O'Neill said : “ We 've been very interested in aqueducts from the north of Rome – although those that come into Rome from Tivoli and from the Castelli Romani are more commonly talked about . ”
The shores of both Lake Bracciano and Lake Martignano were known to the ancient Romans as a leisure retreat from the city .
The Aqua Alsietina transported water into the Trastevere area of Rome ( to Augustus 's ' naumachia ' - a man-made lake where the Romans could re-enact sea battles ) .
The O'Neills run a small production company making documentaries and films .
Film - makers by trade , their work has led them to some in - depth research into the aqueducts of Rome since they first became interested in the Aqua Vergine Nuova some time ago .
They are interested in documenting these ancient structures from an historical viewpoint , as well as covering the Renaissance restorations and the modern state and use of the aqueducts .
Issue # 82 • July / August , 2003
You are hereby summoned to appear for jury trial service .
Failure to respond will subject you to punishment for contempt , including a $ 1,000 fine , imprisonment for five days , or both . ”
I understand that jury duty is my civic responsibility , but still when I got this jury duty notice my first thought was , “ What a waste of time .
How can I get out of this ? ”
The thought of sitting all day in the jury box while lawyers argued back and forth manipulating facts in order to win their case just did not appeal to me .
“ There must be an excuse I can use to get out of this , ” I thought .
Then I thought of several newspaper articles I had recently read .
In one , a man in our city was sentenced to 42 years to life in prison under California ’s “ three - strikes ” law , a law passed by voters to imprison violent criminals for life .
Was this man ’s third strike murder , rape , or assault ?
No , it was stealing a pair of tennis shoes .
“ That ’s not right , ” I thought , “ Nor , is it the intent of the law . ”
In another case , our local district attorney was quoted in the newspaper as saying he had asked a suspect to voluntarily come in to his office for questioning or else “ We will kick your door in and drag you into the street . ”
Wait a minute .
If the crime this person is accused of committing is so minor that he can drive himself to the office , why ca n’t the district attorney come to his house and knock on the door ?
Why would they have to drag him into the street ?
“ That sounds like an abuse of power , ” I thought .
Then I read about a local 16 - year - old high school girl at a large party of high school friends .
She apparently took off her clothes , ran around naked , yelled “ What ’s a girl have to do to get sex around here , ” and then started having sex with multiple young boys at the party .
Later , she began drinking liquor she brought to the party , continued with other boys , and passed out from the alcohol .
Several boys under age 18 were charged with sexually assaulting her after she passed out .
There is no question the boys are at fault and , if guilty , the boys do deserve punishment .
Also , there is no question that her actions caused her own problems .
It was the actions of the district attorney that got my attention , however .
The boys were given the choice to “ voluntarily ” plead guilty within five days and attend a “ diversionary program ” without jail time or else they would be charged as adults , facing eight years in prison and being required to register as sex offenders for the rest of their lives .
Not much of a choice .
“ Wait a minute , ” I thought , “ Either the crime they are accused of warrants a diversionary program or prison as an adult .
Which is it ” ?
Also , “ What happened to their constitutional right to a fair trial ? ”
Is the district attorney worried he cannot get a conviction if the jurors consider the girl ’s actions that night .
Now I knew why I needed to comply with the summons for jury duty .
I needed to be there to determine innocence or guilt , but even more so I needed to be there to make sure the defendant received a fair trial and was not “ railroaded ” by the district attorney .
This was not normal thinking for me .
I am an average American citizen who supports my government and police and who is fed up with increasing crime .
I believe the police and courts are trying to protect us from criminals .
However , more and more , I am disturbed by the loss of our freedoms and our rights , and their attempt to win convictions at all costs .
My “ day in court ”
On the day of jury duty , I was one of more than 100 people called as prospective jurors for a particular trial .
All had taken off work or stopped their daily lives in order to do their civic responsibility .
Either that , or the threat of five days in jail for not showing up got their attention .
I figured it must be an important trial to need so many prospective jurors .
When we were in the courtroom , I could see a clean - cut young man at the defendant ’s table .
The judge began .
“ The defendant is accused of spray painting the front door of a business .
The charge is vandalism under $ 400 , a misdemeanor . ”
My first thought was , “ What !
You took all of us away from our work and lives for this ? ”
My next was , “ Wait a minute .
This is so minor that I ’m sure he could have plea - bargained this charge away if he was guilty .
I ’ll bet the guy is innocent and he wants his day in court . ”
Now I really wanted to be on the jury .
The judge continued .
“ As jurors , you are required to enforce the law even if you disagree with it .
You must use the evidence presented and what you are told the law is as you deliberate this case .
You can not consider anything else .
You cannot judge based on your beliefs about the law being right or wrong . ”
This did not sound right to me .
I always believed that a juror has the right and responsibility to use their conscience in making a decision .
The instructions given by the judge seemed like a way to manipulate outcome of the trial .
Then I remembered another case .
Bryan Epis was charged in Sacramento Federal Court with a four - count federal indictment for “ conspiring to manufacture 1000 marijuana plants , ” a crime which carries a mandatory 10 - year prison sentence .
While a federal crime , he was co-founder of Medical Marijuana Caregivers and was operating legally in accordance with California ’s medical marijuana law established in 1996 by Proposition 215 .
Under this law , he was allowed to provide marijuana to seriously ill patients who had a doctor ’s prescription .
Whether or not one believes that the law or the use of marijuana is right , it was the actions of the federal prosecutors and the court that bothered me .
The first federal attorney involved in this case offered Mr. Epis four months of house arrest in exchange for a guilty plea without a trial .
Wanting the trial he is guaranteed by the Constitution , he refused .
A new federal attorney took over the case and offered him four years in prison in exchange for a guilty plea .
When Mr. Epis again refused , the federal prosecutor filed charges that carried a mandatory 10 - year prison term .
Now I was really confused .
Was the crime so minor that four months of house arrest is appropriate , or was it so serious that he deserves 10 years in prison ?
Or , is the government trying to deny him his right to a trial by threatening a long prison term if he does not plead guilty “ voluntarily ? ”
“ No problem , he will receive a fair trial and the jurors will decide , ” I thought .
Suppressing evidence
Unfortunately , that is not how it works anymore .
The information the jury is told is severely restricted .
They are given just what government ( the judge and prosecutors ) decide is appropriate , rather than all the facts needed to make an informed decision .
In this case , jurors were not allowed to hear about California medical marijuana laws or the reasons he grew the marijuana .
The prosecutor even sought a gag order so the case would not be reported in the newspaper .
“ If the jurors see that there is a mandatory 10 - year sentence , I do n’t see how the government can receive a fair trial , ” argued the federal prosecutor .
“ Wait a minute , ” I thought , “ Is n’t it the defendant who has a right to a fair trial ?
Where does it say the government has such a right ? ”
Bryan Epis was convicted and sentenced to the mandatory 10 years in prison .
A juror said afterwards that he would not have convicted him if he had known the sentence .
So much for a defendant receiving a fair trial .
Today , there are many obstacles to a defendant receiving a fair trial , including bad laws , inappropriate application of laws , and manipulating the information juries can hear .
Bad laws come from many directions .
Elected legislators at all levels of our government have swamped us with a tremendous number of laws , many valid and many not .
Even good laws are applied inappropriately , as in the case of the man sentenced to 42 to life for stealing a pair of tennis shoes .
It was a good law intended to remove violent criminals from society , but wrongly applied to an act of petty theft .
Unelected bureaucrats increasingly have the power to write and enforce regulations that have the effect and consequences of law , often without the right to a trial .
Federal and state tax , environmental protection , and occupational safety agencies are all prime examples of such regulatory bodies .
Even the U.S. Constitution is constantly under attack .
Unbelievably , in a case that is certain to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court , the Federal Appeals Court in San Francisco recently ruled that Americans do not have the right to own firearms as individuals , only the state - run militia can own guns .
This is a surprising decision even for this notoriously liberal court .
Prosecutors also charge defendants with as many laws as they can find that remotely apply in order to overwhelm the defendant , often bending the laws to try to make them fit .
They want a jury to think that with so many charges , the defendant must be guilty of something .
A children ’s dentist in Pasadena , California , was unfortunate enough to have a patient die in her dental office during treatment , despite following standard care .
She was arrested on felony child endangerment , her own children were taken from her , and she was charged with violating 81 laws by the district attorney .
At trial , all 81 charges were either dropped or she was found not guilty .
Some of the charges were clearly lies and there was no reason she should have been charged in the first place .
Jurors stated the trial was a huge waste of taxpayer money .
The district attorney and the State Board of Dental Examiners ruined her life without having a case .
Trials without juries
The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States gives the accused in criminal prosecutions the right to “ a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed . ”
More and more , however , individuals are denied a trial at all .
In family court and cases by the IRS , jury trials are not allowed .
Federal law and some state laws deny a trial in cases where the sentence that can be imposed is six months or less .
They can charge a defendant with multiple crimes , each with a 6 - month penalty that can run consecutively .
Therefore , in an end - run around the Sixth Amendment , an accused can be sentenced to years in prison without a jury trial .
The government tries to avoid a trial whenever possible , knowing that many cases would be thrown out if the juries realized how the laws were being applied .
Stacking juries
Our jury system is certainly not impartial .
There are problems with how the jury is selected and the instructions they are given .
“ Failure to respond will subject you to punishment for contempt , including $ 1,000 fine , imprisonment for five days , of both , ” was the statement that made me show up for jury duty .
I wondered how many individuals do n’t even bother to respond to the summons for jury duty .
I asked the court clerk , and , while avoiding directly answering the question , he said , “ We send them a summons to see the judge , and if they ignore that a warrant is issued for their arrest . ”
Forcing people to serve on juries is not a way to find impartial jurors .
Of the 100 or so of us summoned for the “ graffiti trial , ” 16 names were randomly called .
The judge informed them they were required to follow what they were told the law was , regardless of whether they agreed with it .
They were first questioned regarding whether they could be present the dates of the trial and a number were excused due to schedule conflicts .
Sometimes , potential jurors are excused due to the length of the trial being a financial hardship .
Often , these will be self - employed or other hard - working individuals who are not paid by their employers while they are on jury duty .
This leaves government employees , welfare recipients , retired individuals , some workers of large corporations , and others with “ time on their hands ” as the main source of jurors .
The judge then excused some jurors because they had heard about the case or knew someone involved in the case .
As potential jurors were excused , someone else from the group of 100 would randomly be called to fill their spot .
Next , both the prosecution and defense asked questions to each juror .
They both have “ peremptory challenges ” in which they can remove a potential juror for no reason .
This is where they “ stack the deck ” in their favor by trying to include those who may be sympathetic to their case while removing those who may not .
Lawyers also use peremptory challenges to try to adjust the racial and gender make - up of the jury to favor their side .
One young man looked baffled and embarrassed as he was excused without an explanation .
While no reason was given , I noted that he was an engineering student .
Lawyers typically do n’t want engineers or others who are too analytical on a jury since they may think the case out rationally .
Jurors with education , strong convictions , and knowledge are routinely excluded from juries .
Defense lawyers I have spoken with said that prosecutors try to have a jury of impressionable people who have about a seventh grade education and who wo n’t think about the case on their own .
They want to be able to easily persuade them .
The problem with juries does n’t end with their selection .
The judge and prosecutor control the testimony and the instructions that jurors are allowed to hear .
The “ whole truth and nothing but the truth ” is not heard by the jury , only the information the judge decides should be heard .
The judge determines the evidence that is admissible or inadmissible , the importance to be given to any evidence , and then requires jurors to consider only this information .
Many jurors have a problem with this .
They want to be told the whole truth and then be allowed to decide the case .
How can you judge the case unless you know all the facts ?
Twelve jurors were finally selected for my case .
Unfortunately , I was one of the many jurors not selected or even questioned .
I left not knowing if this man was found innocent or guilty , but knowing that I needed to learn more about the rights of jurors .
What can a juror do ?
Since it is pretty clear that it is hard , if not impossible , for a defendant to receive a fair trial today , what can a juror do ?
We all want criminals off the streets , but jurors are the only people who can make sure the defendant receives a fair trial .
The following is not something jurors will be told or something that the court wants them to know , but it has been so ever since the common law jury system was established almost 800 years ago .
On June 15 , 1215 , England ’s King John signed the Magna Carta ( Great Charter ) establishing liberties and rights of the population .
Among other things , this established the principle of the right to a jury trial and the right and duty of the jurors to determine and judge the facts , to judge the justice of the law , and to declare the accused innocent .
The intent of powers given to the jury was to protect citizens in case the government became too powerful and established laws violating the rights of the people .
The Magna Carta later became the basis of our liberties and Constitution .
America ’s founding fathers also worried that the government they were creating could become powerful and corrupt , threatening the rights and liberties of Americans .
In the Constitution and the Bill of Rights , they provided the right to a trial by a jury of one ’s peers as a method to protect citizens from the power of an over - zealous government .
A jury can refuse to convict a defendant who has clearly violated the letter of the law if they feel the law is unjust or unconstitutional , essentially vetoing the effect of the law .
In early America , jurors were told of this right and writings of our founding fathers show this was their intent .
John Adams stated in 1771 “ It is not only … [ the juror ’s ] right , but his duty … to find the verdict according to his own best understanding , judgment , and conscience , though in direct opposition to the direction of the court . ”
In 1789 , future President Thomas Jefferson stated , “ I consider trial by jury as the only anchor yet devised by man by which a government can be held to the principles of its constitution . ”
Things changed as time went by .
A Supreme Court ruling in 1895 found that judges were not at fault if they failed to remind jurors of this right .
After that , judges not only stopped telling jurors they can judge the law , they now falsely tell jurors their only job is to decide if the evidence is sufficient to find the accused guilty .
They are told they must do this even if they disagree with the law .
Defense attorneys can be charged with contempt of court if they inform jurors that they may acquit if they feel the law is unconstitutional , unjust , or applied unfairly .
Jurors ’ real responsibilities
Throughout the history of America , juries have protected our freedoms by refusing to find an accused guilty of a law they felt was wrong .
By refusing to convict an accused , they essentially have vetoed bad laws .
As early as 1735 , a printer named John Peter Zenger was accused of seditious libel for publishing an article critical of colonial rule in violation of a law requiring government approval of anything critical of the government .
Mr. Zenger admitted to publishing the article , stating that the facts justified publication .
The judge stated that truth was no defense for violation of the law and the jury could not consider the truth .
Disregarding the judge ’s instructions , the jury found Mr. Zenger not guilty .
When enough juries acquit defendants that have clearly violated a law , the government eventually stops trying to enforce the law .
The Salem witch trials in 1693 were stopped after 50 defendants in a row were acquitted .
Before the Civil War , Northern juries refused to convict individuals accused of assisting escaped slaves in violation of the Fugitive Slave Act , effectively stopping the law .
During Prohibition in the 1930s , convictions of bootleggers and speakeasy owners became rare as jurors refused to convict the accused , despite the 18th Amendment and the Volstead Act .
Essentially , they vetoed the law and prosecutors eventually stopped bringing cases to trial .
Subsequently , the law was overturned .
Over the years , most of these jurors probably just voted their conscience , not even realizing they had a legal right to judge the law .
Many had been told by the judge to only deliberate on the facts presented and not question the fairness of the law .
Each juror has the power to affect change .
There is nothing that requires a jury to reach a unanimous verdict .
Under criminal law , only one juror must find the accused not guilty for him to be not convicted .
When a jury decides to acquit a defendant , the decision is final and cannot be overturned .
The judge cannot harass or punish jurors for voting their conscience and they may be asked , but not forced , to explain their verdicts .
If you are called for jury duty , it is an opportunity to protect the rights of the accused and , by doing so , your own rights and freedoms .
Most of the time the law will probably be constitutional and , hopefully , applied justly .
What can a juror do if it is not ?
First of all , understand that nothing in the Constitution or Supreme Court decisions requires a juror to take an oath to follow the law as explained by the judge .
As a juror , when you in good conscience believe that the law is wrong or unconstitutional , is being applied unfairly , the accused is being unjustly charged or made “ an example of ” by the government , you have the right and responsibility to find them not guilty , despite what the judge or your fellow jurors say .
Remember , your one not guilty vote is all that it takes to prevent conviction .
You will get the credit or blame for the results of the trial and will have to live with your decision .
The practice of a juror using their conscience to find a defendant not guilty because the law is unjust has been called jury independence , jury veto , jury discretion , jury referendum , or , commonly by the media , as jury nullification .
Jury nullification is essentially when an accused individual is acquitted of a crime that he clearly committed because the jury feels there are extenuating circumstances , feels the law is unjust or applied unfairly , or because the sentence is too harsh for the crime .
While historically a legal right , judges and prosecutors today fear an informed jury as a loss of their power .
Sometimes , the only way the government can get convictions of bad laws is to tell jurors they are required to uphold the law and to bar them from the jury if they disagree .
Judges have even told jurors that they may not consider the U.S. Constitution in their deliberations .
Prosecutors fear the jury that has all the information , for they may find the government ’s case or the punishment to be absurd .
Do you think a jury would have convicted the man for stealing tennis shoes if they knew he would receive a life sentence ?
The jurors in Brian Epis ’ case said they would not have convicted him if they knew he faced a mandatory 10 - year sentence .
Jurors will routinely be disqualified if they question the law , if they disagree with the law , or if they question the constitutionality of the law .
They are also disqualified if they agree with the concept of an informed jury or of jury nullification .
Judges who are hostile to jury nullification have even used their power of “ contempt of court ” to jail jurors , without a trial , if they believe in or discuss jury nullification with other jurors .
An informed jury scares the court like nothing else .

Also , inform others about jury rights by talking with your friends or writing letters to local newspapers .
The more jurors that are aware of their rights , the better our justice system will be .
In America today , our individual rights and freedoms are under constant attack and it is the duty of all of us to defend them .
Read the Constitution and know your rights as a citizen .
If called as a juror , do n’t immediately look for an excuse to get out of jury duty .
Rather , be happy that you can use your right to analyze the case and to vote your conscience to ensure a fair trial .
An informed jury is the way we have to stand up to a powerful government .
I had got compassionate leave and was travelling north with my sister and three - year - old Angela to see my mother .
I was in sole and uneasy charge of Angela when I noticed that across the saloon carriage there were three airmen with the flash " Poland " on their shoulders , one of whom was staring intently in our direction .
I followed his gaze and found that he was looking at Angela .
After a moment 's hesitation he got up , came across the passage , smiled at Angela , and handed her a block of chocolate .
She was lady enough to say " Tank you " in a small voice , and then the Polish airman – a corporal – went back to his seat .
When my sister came I told her what had happened , and she went across to the corporal to thank him .
He blushed and his English was very self - conscious as he tried to say : " That 's all right ; I have two children myself . "
Then I heard my sister telling him : " My brother has been in Poland for three years – prisoner of war . "
The corporal 's face lit up , and they all three waved to me to join them .
I went and my sister returned to her small daughter .
They began to speak to me in English , but I could tell that they were uncomfortable in it and asked them in German if they spoke the language of our enemies .
They nodded excitedly .
" But we do n't like to speak it .
[ If ] we happen to use it here people look accusingly at us as though I were Hitler himself and my two friends Göring and Goebbels . "
The first thing he said was " Where were you a prisoner of war ? "
And when I said , casually enough , " Posnan " I thought the corporal was going to leap over the table to embrace me .
He turned to his friends , his eyes shining .
" Posnan ! " he exclaimed .
" I come from Posnan ! "
After that he could not speak fast enough for all the emotion he felt .
He had not seen his native town since those black days of September 1939 .
His face clouded as he asked hesitantly , " And how are they going on , the people at home ? "
I could not tell him they were living on the fat of the land .
But I could tell him that some of the people of Posnan are among the bravest I have ever seen .
The corporal told me that he had not had any message from Poland all the time he had been away .
When he had said this he became suddenly silent , and the conversation lapsed .
I was just going to return to my sister and Angela when he blurted out : " Do you know X street in Posnan ? " I did not need to recollect .
" Know it !
Why , I 've shovelled snow off X street many a time . "
He looked at me and lowered his gaze again .
" When you were in Posnan , " he said , " did you ever notice in X street two little boys , one about six and one about ten , both with blond hair ? "
My mind flew back to that street where I had spent many a cold winter morning with others from the camp .
I told him that I did not remember two children , but that there was certainly one boy of about ten we had seen often because his fair hair marked him out from the others .
I said , too , that we had often spoke to him and given him chocolate from our Red Cross supplies .
I suppose that if I were writing fiction this encounter would be justifiably condemned as incredible .
This Pole had given my little niece a piece of chocolate , and it was all Lombard Street to a penny orange that I had done the same for his son in Posnan .
The trials of the long years did not seem severe at that moment , for I realised as never before how truly we were together in a common cause .
A child in a Polish city street – and a child in an English train .
It is something to think about .

In its new " A Fistful of Dollars " report , the International Monetary Fund concludes that the riskiest mortgage lenders were also the most active lobbyists in Washington .
IMF researchers found that during 2000 to 2007 , lenders lobbying more intensively on mortgage - related legislation — such as consumer protection laws and securitization — made more hazardous mortgage loans than those who lobbied less .
“ These results suggest that lobbying may be linked to lenders expecting special treatments from policymakers , allowing them to engage in riskier lending behavior , ” the report notes .
The big lobbyists originated mortgages with higher loan - to - income ratios , securitized a faster growing proportion of their loans , and had faster growing loan portfolios .
Not surprisingly , lobbyist lenders ’ stock suffered more during the financial crisis and delinquency rates are higher in areas where lobbying lenders ’ mortgage lending grew the fastest .
New research by Edward Pinto , a former chief credit officer for Fannie Mae and a housing expert , has found that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac began buying risky loans as early as 1993 , The Wall Street Journal reports .
Pinto also says that Fannie and Freddie routinely misrepresented the mortgages they were acquiring , reporting them as prime when they had characteristics that made them clearly subprime or Alt - A .
By the end of 2008 , the two government - sponsored enterprises , or GSEs , held or guaranteed approximately 10 million subprime and Alt - A mortgages and mortgage - backed securities , risky loans with a total principal balance of $ 1.6 trillion that are now defaulting at unprecedented rates .
Since 2008 , under government control , the two agencies have continued to buy dicey mortgages in order to stabilize housing prices .

Maggie Burgos and Soraya Lopez are mother and daughter who share more than blood : they both battled depression , and in Burgos ' case , made multiple suicide attempts .
Now , the two helped launch the " Back Me Up " campaign , to raise awareness .

The article , originally published in the Rochester , NY - based Democrat and Chronicle , described the local organizations trying to combat what is quickly becoming a national problem :
Nationally , 14 percent , or one in every seven , Hispanic female high school students have attempted suicide , compared with 8 percent of their white and 10 percent of their black counterparts , according to a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
But even if percentage points should be lower for each category , Hispanics would still have a higher rate of suicide attempts than white and African - American students , leading many researchers to ask why .
" I do n't know exactly if anyone has figured out why it ( suicide attempts ) is higher for young Latinas , " said Juan Pea , assistant professor at the Washington University in St. Louis George Warren Brown School of Social Work .

While this comparison leaves out Asian American women , another group that has historically struggled with high rates of suicide attempts , the logical question is why is this rate increasing among Latinas of all backgrounds ?
Researchers became alarmed when girls as young as 11 and 12 began showing up in hospitals , but answers remain frustratingly elusive .
Research is still underway , and most studies point to things like peer pressure , and a disconnect between the daughter and the mother over acceptable behavior .
Unfortunately , nothing stands out as a definite cause for the increase .
Sadder still , in tough financial times , many outreach programs are scaling back - or closing up shop entirely .
The Back Me Up campaign started in September 2008 with the goal of reaching out to both Latino youths and their parents in the Buffalo and Rochester area .
Youth Power attempted to extend the grant for another year .
But Orlando said that because of the state 's budget problems and economy , such an extension was not possible .

I probably get more upset than is reasonable when I come across articles with no date on them .
I scroll furiously for a few minutes , try to see if the date was put in some stupid place like the fine print written in almost - white - on - white at the bottom of the post surrounded by ads .
Then I skim the article looking for references to software versions that might clue me in on how old this material is .
Then I check the sidebars to see if there ’s some kind of “ About this Post ” block .
Finally , I make a mental note of the domain in a little mental list I use to further filter my Google searches in the future .
Then I close the browser window in disgust .
If it were n’t completely gross and socially unacceptable to do so , I would spit on the floor every time this happened .
Why would you NOT date your articles ?
In almost every single theme for every single content management solution written in any language and backed by any database , “ Date ” is a default element .
Why would you remove it ?
It is almost guaranteed to be more work to remove it .
Why would you go through actual work to make your own writing less useful to others ?
What happens when you do n’t date your articles ?
People have no idea whether your article has anything to do with what they ’re working on .
If you wrote an article about the Linux kernel in 1996 , it ’s of no use to me * now * , even if it was pretty hardcore at the time .
Readers are forced to skim your article looking for references to software versions to see if your article is actually meaningful to them or not .
Why make it hard for people to know whether your article is useful ?
The only reason I can think of is that you already know your articles are old , so not dating them insures that people at least skim enough to see some of the ads on your site .
You are irreversibly lame if you do this .
It causes near seizures in people like me who really hate when you do n’t date your work , as well as all of your past teachers , who no doubt demanded that you sign and date your work .
Every time you do n’t date an article online , a seal pup is clubbed to death in the arctic , and a polar bear gets stranded on a piece of ice .
At some point , I will make an actual list of web sites that regularly do not date their work .
A sort of hall of shame for sites that fail to link their writing to some kind of time - based context .
If you have sites you ’d like to add , let me know in the comments .

MALE PRIVILEGE in health care reform deepens with each line drawn in the sand .
Senate Democrats got their 60th vote to close debate and move reform toward a Christmas Eve vote by succumbing to Nebraska Senator Ben Nelson ’s demands to include abortion restrictions .
The reform bill passed by the House contains even more harsh restrictions .
The few women in Congress , or those pursuing office , are shrugging in political resignation .
Martha Coakley , the Democratic candidate for the seat of the late Ted Kennedy , told the Globe in a statement that she supports the Senate bill even though she was disappointed in the restrictions .
Barbara Boxer , the California Democrat , felt it was a save to get what she could out of Nelson .
The House bill bans insurers from offering coverage for abortions to any American who receives any federal insurance subsidies .
Under the Senate bill , women who receive a subsidy for policies that cover abortion could keep that coverage but must pay into a separate account for the abortion coverage .
“ My goal was to try to reach some compromise . . .
I think we achieved that , ’’ Boxer said .
This was after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi capitulated last month to antiabortion politicians .
Fellow Democrat Lois Capps of California said of the Senate compromise : “ I am disappointed that women ’s access to full reproductive health care is again paying the price . ’’
The question is why women must always compromise as the men set the rules , with Oklahoma Republican Tom Coburn railing that even the latest compromise still “ throws the unborn under the bus . ’’
Abortion is the latest example of how a male majority on Capitol Hill continues to control women , directly or indirectly .
Studies clearly indicate that if women had an equal say in reform , it would take a very different shape .
“ Mothers of all kind , married , single , regardless of race and ethnicity are significantly more supportive than men on issues like health care , ’’ said Hartwick College political scientist Laurel Elder .
Elder and political scientist Steven Greene of North Carolina State University have collaborated on several studies detailing how gender and parenthood affect political attitudes .
In research released this year , they found that mothers “ are significantly and substantively more likely than their non-mother counterparts to support the government playing an active role in providing programs and services to its citizens , especially those in need . ’’
In research four years ago , they found that parental involvement was “ significantly correlated with support for nationalized health care . ’’
Elder and Greene say that attitude likely reflects “ the societal expectation as well as the reality that women play the primary role in nurturing their children and take primary responsibility for their health care . ’’
According to the Kaiser Women ’s Health Study , 79 percent of mothers say they are the ones who choose the doctors for their children and 84 percent say they are the ones taking their children to appointments .
In telephone interviews yesterday , Elder and Greene both found it ironic that male senators who are likely not the ones staying home are so demonstrative about limiting government involvement in health care .
Research shows that women , particularly mothers , continue to pay silent social and economic penalties in a nation that has some of the worst parental leave policies of the industrialized world .
“ Millions and millions more women are going to have health care under reform , ’’ Greene said , “ but a lot of them are going to be struggling to pay . ’’
They will continue to struggle because of the men of Congress , who listen more to the insurance companies than mothers .
Health reform may give more coverage than ever .
It will also take away from women more rights than ever .

Israel and US behind Tehran blast - Iranian state media
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement Iranian state media have accused Israel and the US of being involved in a bomb attack which killed an Iranian physicist in Tehran .
State broadcaster Irib quoted Iran 's foreign ministry spokesman as saying there were signs of Israeli and US involvement " in the terrorist act " .
The US state department dismissed the allegation as " absurd " .
Masoud Ali Mohammadi - described as a " devoted revolutionary professor " - was killed by a remotely - controlled bomb .
ANALYSIS Jon Leyne , BBC Tehran correspondent
The original story seemed straightforward .
According to Iranian media , Masoud Ali Mohammadi was a nuclear scientist , assassinated by counter - revolutionaries , Zionists and agents of the " global arrogance " .
The implication was clear - it was a Western plot to sabotage Iran 's nuclear programme .
But as so often in Iran , there was more to it .
According to British academics , Mr Mohammadi is an expert in another branch of physics , and highly unlikely to be involved in nuclear research .
At the same time , the reformist movement issued what it said was evidence that Mr Mohammadi supported their presidential candidate Mir-Hossein Mousavi in last year 's election .
It all added to suspicions created by the unusually prompt and thorough coverage of his death in the Iranian media .
Whatever actually happened , the opposition will certainly fear this killing will be used as an opportunity for a new crackdown .
Reports in the Iranian media described Mr Mohammadi as a nuclear physicist , but it appears that his field of study was quantum theory .
There was also confusion as to whether the attack had any political overtones .
One university official said Mr Mohammadi was not a political figure .
But other reports said his name appeared on a list of academics backing opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi before the 2009 presidential election .
Tensions have been high in Iran since the disputed election led to mass protests against the government .
Mr Mohammadi , who worked at Tehran University , " was killed in a booby - trapped motorbike blast " in the city 's northern Qeytariyeh district , state - run Press TV reported earlier .
It showed pictures from the scene of the blast , saying windows in the nearby buildings had been shattered by the force of the explosion .
' Triangle of wickedness ' Local media reports say the bomb was attached to a motorcycle parked outside Mr Mohammadi's home , although one agency said it had been planted in a rubbish bin .
Professor Mohammadi was killed as he was leaving his home , media say Irib later quoted Iran 's foreign ministry spokesman as saying that " in the initial investigation , signs of the triangle of wickedness by the Zionist regime , America and their hired agents , are visible in the terrorist act " .
Press TV quoted security officials at the scene as saying that the equipment and system of the bomb used in the attack had been related to a number of foreign intelligence agencies , particularly Israel 's Mossad .
In its earlier report , Irib said Mr Mohammadi " was martyred this morning in a terrorist act by anti-revolutionary and arrogant powers ' elements " .
The BBC's Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne , who is in London , says Iran usually refers to its enemies in the West as " the arrogant powers " .
The opposition in Iran will fear that Tuesday 's blast will be used against it as part of a crackdown , our correspondent adds .
Police sealed off the area and launched an investigation into the incident .
Some conservatives have suggested that the People 's Mujahideen Organisation - a banned militant group opposed to the Tehran government - was involved .
The group denied the accusation .
No-one has claimed responsibility for the blast and at this stage there could only be speculation as to possible motives for the attack , correspondents say .
There has been much controversy over Iran 's nuclear activities .
Tehran says its nuclear programme is for peaceful energy purposes , but the US and other Western nations suspect it of seeking to build nuclear weapons .
In December , Tehran accused Saudi Arabia of detaining an Iranian nuclear scientist and handing him over to the US .
Saudi Arabia denied the claim .

Long ago , software companies enforced copy protection by requiring that the original product CD be inserted with each usage .
When copying CDs in their entirety became commonplace , the software giants turned to other methods , mostly centered around internet - based authentication .
However , when I installed several games for my son on our new computer , I found that the old practice still persisted .
Several games made by different manufacturers all required that the CD be inserted to run them .
Since he is too young to be handling CDs , I was motivated to find a solution to this problem .
My solution employs all free software components .
The first is called ISO Recorder .
Depending on which version of Windows XP you have , you have to download either version 1 or 2 of this program .
When installed , ISO Recorder adds a context menu to your real CD drives , so that when you right - click the CD under My Computer , it gives you the option of “ Create image from CD ” and “ Copy CD - to - CD ” .
Place the CD you want to “ clone ” in your drive , open up “ My Computer ” , and right - click on the CD .
Choose “ Create image from CD ” and specify a location for the file .
If you have installed the program already , it may make sense to put the image file in the program directory ( generally under “ C: \Program Files \software company \software title ” ) .
That way if you un-install the program , when it deletes the program directory , the image file will be deleted with it .
If , however , you want to re-install the program later , you can place it elsewhere , and use the ISO image to re-install the program instead of the product CD .
To put your ISO image to use , you need a program called Virtual CloneDrive .
In the installation options , make sure “ .iso ” is checked under file associations .
After installation , if you navigate to the folder your CD image is located in , you will notice that its icon has been replaced by a sheep ( a.k.a .
Dolly , the famous cloned sheep ) .
When you click on this icon , Virtual CloneDrive will “ mount ” this image to the first available drive letter .
For all intents and purposes , it will appear as if you have placed the actual CD into a new CD drive on your computer .
If you have autoplay enabled on your computer , it will autoplay the virtual CD , in most cases starting the program contained on it .
You can also browse the files on the CD .
Virtual CloneDrive defaults to mounting just one drive concurrently although it can support up to eight .
In most cases , one drive is the best configuration , since the type of programs that require the product CD typically would only be used one - at - a - time .
Each time you select a new ISO file , the drive letter being used by Virtual CloneDrive is replaced with the virtual CD for the new file , as if you took the last CD out and put a new one in .
However , if you do need to run more than one of these programs at a time , you can change this option by running CloneDrive from Start -> Programs and selecting the settings tab .
The last step to automating the process of mounting the images to the virtual CD drive is to change your normal program shortcuts to point to the ISO images instead of the normal applications .
Then , when you click to start the programs , instead of saying “ please insert CD ” it will start , just as it should !
In order to do this , find the shortcut , either on your desktop or under Start -> Programs ( or both ) and right - click it .
Change the filename under the “ Target ” field to the name of your image file , with the “ ISO ” extension .
Once you have done this with all the games or other programs on your computer that require CDs , file the original CDs away somewhere , and know that your all your programs are now only one click away , no CDs necessary .
