It 's back in the news again .
On Friday , December 14 , a hearing was held here in Philadelphia on whether Joey Vento , owner of the popular South Philly cheesesteak shop Geno's , violated non-discrimination policies when he put up a sign that reads : " This is America .
When Ordering , Speak English . "
A decision by the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations is at least two months away .
This has been a very divisive issue in Philly and beyond ever since it first hit the news in 2006 .
People seem to have very strong feelings about this -- those who are offended by the perceived bigotry vs. those who seem to be offended by foreigners and immigrants who are n't so fluent in English .
A very amusing aspect to the story is that , when you visit Geno 's or any of several other cheesesteak shops in Philly , the ordering hardly sounds like English :
" Gimme a Whiz , wid . "
" Provolone widdout .
Scoop it . "
At Geno's , this is the " English " you must speak in order to get your cheesesteak quickly and with minimal harassment .
That irony aside , when this issue first hit the news , I found the sign offensive , and I still do .
My immediate reaction was that it is discriminatory and should not be allowed .
But then I cooled down and started to look at it as a free - speech issue .
And this is exactly the argument that Vento 's attorneys are using .
Let Vento keep the sign up , I thought , and let fair - minded people boycott his shop and support Vento 's competitors , like Pat 's Steaks across the street .
Money talks .
But then I heard the argument set forth at Friday 's hearing by Rev. James Allen , chairman of the Commission , who said that the sign at Geno 's reminded him of signs he saw while growing up in the segregated South .
And I thought about my own Grandma Leoni , who immigrated from Italy in the early 20th century but never really got a good grasp on the English language .
She was loved by all in her neighborhood , even though her English was very poor .
She was a warm and kind - hearted person , always ready to set another place at the table .
And people gladly made the extra effort to communicate with her .
If Grandma Leoni were alive today , how would she feel about that sign at Geno's ?
Is n't Vento himself a first - or second - generation Italian American ?
Did his grandparents speak English as fluently as he would like to require of his customers ?
What would Grandma Vento think ?
Finally , we need to think of the tourism industry .
What does Vento 's sign say to all the people from around the world who visit our city and want to experience our most famous cuisine ?
If Philadelphia is ever to be seen as a world - class city , can we as a city really condone this kind of apparent discrimination ?
I said it when this issue first arose in 2006 , and I want to end with it again : Philadelphia is supposed to be the City of Brotherly Love , not the City of Xenophobic Bigotry .
Philly 's own Ben Franklin , that great proponent of brotherhood and tolerance , is surely spinning in his grave .

For every man who fits into one of the categories of unmarried men put forth by social scientists  men who cannot commit , men who are afraid of divorce , men who have been forced to the edges of the economy  there is a man like Chris Cunningham of Staten Island .
Mr. Cunningham , 41 , a sanitation worker , seems to defy any theory about why he is single .
He has , he said , simply not met the right woman .
Born and raised in Brooklyn , and now assigned to an office job in Manhattan with the Department of Sanitation , Mr. Cunningham said he was undeterred by his parents ’ divorce and was ready for marriage , having just ended a decade - long relationship going nowhere .
He makes a comfortable living at about $ 80,000 a year .
He appears self - deprecating and sweet , and is clean - shaven ( his head , too ) .
Eager to have children of his own , he bought Christmas presents last year for several children in Milltown , N.J. , where he often spends weekends with his best friend and neighboring couples .
With most of his friends paired off , and few single women in the Milltown clique , his dating life has stalled .
“ It ’s funny , ” he said one Saturday as adults mingled and children scampered with water toys at a block party .
“ You feel kind of like they met someone and got their lives started , and you ’re still waiting for it to happen to you . ”
Some social scientists have found that married men are healthier and earn slightly more than unmarried men .
But it is unclear whether marriage produces higher incomes and better health , or whether people who are richer and healthier in the first place more often choose to marry .
Beyond the questions of finances and health , there is the issue of how content these men are .
All the men interviewed for this article looked younger than their age .
All said they were happy with their lives , even Mr. Cunningham , with his clear longing for a family of his own , and Mr. Thomas , of Fort Collins , who said he might move to Denver to meet more women .
Mr. Ryan , too , said he enjoyed being single .
He stood talking in his kitchen on a Saturday when he had no plans other than a solo bike ride .
It was a slow weekend day  his birthday , in fact  and though the phone never rang , he was free for dinner .
Now Ireland 's equivalent of the Heritage Council - An Taisce - has denounced U2's plans to partly demolish and redevelop a hotel they own by the River Liffey in Dublin .
An Taisce has also demanded a public inquiry into the new " U2 Tower " , which at 32 storeys would be the highest building in Ireland .
Situated at the mouth of Dublin Bay , the tower will be designed by Sir Norman Foster .
An Taisce fears it will blight the Georgian cityscape on the southside of the Liffey .
" Our biggest concern is that the U2 Tower will stick out of the skyline from parts of Georgian Dublin like Merrion Square .
It could potentially be an incongruous blot on the skyline on the southside of the city , " said Ian Lumley , An Taisce 's national heritage officer .
Mr Lumley claimed there was no proper environmental impact survey carried out for the proposed project .
Nor , he said , had U2 or the planners taken into consideration one of the band 's global concerns : the effect of climate change .
" From the limited information we have seen about the proposed tower , there is no consideration being taken into the impact of rising sea levels , " he said .
" This tower is at the mouth of Dublin Bay and yet no provision has been made as to the effect of rising sea levels on an entire area earmarked for more residential living as well as businesses .
For all these reasons there has to be an independent public inquiry before this project is allowed to go ahead . "
Further up the Liffey there is more controversy about another U2 - owned property , the Clarence Hotel , which the band revitalised thanks in part to a tax - exemption scheme in the 1990s aimed at reviving the entire Temple Bar district .
U2 plans a € 150 million ( $ 250 million ) revamp of the Clarence , which Bono has promised will turn it into one of the most spectacular hotels in Europe .
This project has been criticised by An Taisce and the veteran environmentalist Mike Smith .
Mr Smith accused U2 of acting arrogantly over the Clarence plan .
He warned that if Ireland 's planning authority , An Bord Pleanala , allowed the scheme to go through , he would go to court to halt it .
" Since 2000 Ireland has had strong protection for listed buildings which are now called ' protected structures ' , " Mr Smith said .
" In the case of the Clarence , the developers ' belief that there is an exceptional need to pander to international five - star punters ' alleged insistence on underground parking and swimming pools is unlikely to pass muster …
If An Bord Pleanala say yes I will go straight to the High Court to block what U2 are planning . "
He was also scathing of U2's decision to move part of its music operations out of Ireland .
" The common good is not served by allowing the richest people in Ireland to build with the benefit of tax incentives , which is what happened to Temple Bar and the Clarence , only to demolish when they get bored , " Mr Smith said .
A spokesman for the Clarence Hotel project said that it would " help the Irish economy to retain its reputation as progressive " .

Bara Brost - Swedish Women Fighting to Bare Their Breasts
Two Swedish women are hopping mad after they were banned from their local swimming pool for going topless .
The women have seen a significant ripple effect after bringing the situation to the attention of local media .
Ragnhild Karlsson 22 , and her friend Kristin Karlsson 21 , live in the university town of Uppsala , Sweden .
On September 5th they headed to the local swimming complex and jumped into the pool after removing their bikini tops .
They swam without incident , among a pool full of other swimmers , until a lifeguard noticed the two .
She blew her whistle and ejected the pair from the complex when they opted not to put on their swimsuit tops .
The two are claiming that it is against the law to treat men and women differently .
The pool complex indicates that they enforce the rule because they want to prevent sex crimes .
The college students do n't believe woman should bear responsibility for sex crimes carried out by their male counterparts .
The two believe that woman should be able to decide for themselves whether they need protecting .
The pool operators indicate it is a complex issue .
They claim that aside from the security issue , it is also a hygiene issue and a ' manners and customs ' issue .
More simply stated - not all of their guests want to see bare chested woman .
A spokesman for the swim facility indicates they have asked their governing body to look into the situation and perhaps make recommendations .

WASHINGTON  A federal judge in Sacramento on Wednesday upheld a California law regulating greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks , another in a string of legal defeats for the auto industry this year .
The ruling , by Judge Anthony W. Ishii of United States District Court , affirms a 2002 California law that would effectively force automakers to raise the average fuel economy of fleets by about 30 percent by 2016 .
A bill pending in Congress demands a 40 percent mileage increase by 2020 .
The auto companies challenged the California law , which 15 other states say they intend to adopt , saying that it is technically and financially impossible to meet .
They also argued that regulation of vehicle mileage is the responsibility of the federal government , not the states .
“ We can all agree that higher fuel economy is important , but the issue here was about federal fuel economy law , ” said Dave McCurdy , president of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers .
“ Under federal law , only the federal government can set fuel economy standards for all 50 states . ”
I can probably agree with this sentiment from Martin J. Laubach over at Smalltalk of Oz :
All that just screams that many people in IT today do quite obviously not have the necessary basic training .
They might learn how to plug Hibernate into an enterprisey Java application and how to battle XML config files , but there does not seem to be a computing 101 course any more .
It 's as if a garage mechanic could only read the diagnostic codes from the motor microprocessor but has no idea that there is oil in the engine ( or why , for that matter ) .
And it seems that 's not only me , see for example Raganwald noticing the same lack of compentence in the field .
That scares the shit out of me .
Who writes the software to control nuclear power plants again ?
What scares me more though is the example he pulls from Alberto Savoia 's essay in Beautiful Code :
I checked with several other Java programmers , and most of them were not familiar with the unsigned bit shift operator , or where not 100 percent sure how it worked .
For them , seeing calculateMidpoint ( low , high ) is more obvious than seeing ( low + high ) >>> 1 .
There 's a trade off here .
Do we have a very wide API that contains all of these little functions that do useful things , or do we expect people to knock up their own when they need one ?
Clearly we need to have the skills to write our own when we have to , but we should also have the wisdom to use the library whenever possible anyway .
Not because we 're dunderheads , but because details matter in software development and details are easy to get wrong .
The detail at question here is what does ( low + high ) >>>
1 do when the sum overflows ?
In C or C++ you 'll get an incorrect calculation .
In Haskell it'll work fine ( but you 'll have ( low + high ) / 2 instead ) because it has big number support .
What Java will do I do n't know , but then I 'm not a Java programmer .
This implies that it 's probably a very bad thing indeed .
I 'd expect any competent programmer to be able to read ( low + high ) >>>
1 and be able to see what it is meant to do .
I 'd expect a good ( and experienced ) developer to use calculateMidpoint ( low , high ) because it is a little easier to read , but more importantly , much less likely to have subtle bugs in it .
He 's a singer who has made some odd career moves in his time , from changing his name to an unpronounceable love symbol to scrawling " slave " on his cheek in protest at his record company .
But industry experts yesterday warned that Prince 's latest decision might be the most controversial of all .
He has threatened to sue thousands of his biggest fans for breach of copyright , provoking an angry backlash and claims of censorship .
His lawyers have forced his three biggest internet fansites to remove all photographs , images , lyrics , album covers and anything linked to the artist 's likeness .
A legal letter asks the fansites to provide " substantive details of the means by which you propose to compensate our clients [ Paisley Park Entertainment Group , NPG Records and AEG ] for damages " .
The singer himself is believed to take a close interest in unofficial use of his image and music , monitoring websites from his sprawling Paisley Park studio complex in Minneapolis .
A coalition named Prince Fans United , representing Housequake.com , Princefans.com and Prince.org , has been formed by the website organisers to fight back .
They said they would contest the action on the basis that it was an attempt " to stifle all critical commentary about Prince " .
They added that the " cease and desist " notices went as far as calling for the removal of pictures taken by fans of their Prince tattoos and their vehicles carrying Prince - inspired licence plates .
" It 's a really short - sighted and futile move , " said Nicola Slade , editor of the industry newsletter Record of the Day .
" Prince has got a lot of fans and as he 's decided to take a more leftfield approach to releasing his material , he should be nurturing the relationship .
I 'm shocked , really . "
The singer had been considered to be in the vanguard of efforts by some artists to cut record labels out of the equation and forge their own relationships with fans through the web and live concerts , having been one of the first to sell music directly to fans via his website .
He recently completed a 21 - night residency at London 's O2 arena , effortlessly mixing up the setlist each night to draw on a rich back catalogue that includes Purple Rain , Raspberry Beret , Kiss and Sign o' the Times , and was lauded for a genius marketing move in giving away his CD to concertgoers and with copies of the Mail on Sunday .
Alex Burmaster , an analyst at Nielsen Online , said : " It 's a paradox that a musician who has done so much to bring himself closer to his fans , particularly with his ' them and us ' crusade against the record labels , should be engaging in a course of action that effectively removes the raison d'etre of fansites .
" But it 's the mark of the man who always goes against the grain that he should be doing this at a time when other artists and their labels are suddenly embracing the social media phenomenon . "
In 1993 , amid a bitter dispute with the record label , Prince changed his name to an unpronounceable " love symbol " as a step towards his " ultimate goal of emancipation from the chains " that he said tied him to Warner Bros .
Yesterday 's move follows an earlier declaration of war on copyrighted material hosted by web giants such as YouTube and eBay .
In September , he appointed the internet company Web Sheriff to police the removal of up to 2,000 clips from YouTube .
Web Sheriff managing director , John Giacobbi , said at the time that the singer wanted " to create a template for other artists " .
" Prince does n't really want to go around suing people - he'd much rather people just respected his rights .
He will be victorious , " he said .
Controversy followed this decision , too , when a mother from Pennsylvania posted a clip of her baby dancing to his 1984 hit Let 's Go Crazy and Prince 's lawyers demanded it was taken down .
Lawyers at the Electronic Frontier Foundation have vowed to contest the claim on her behalf , saying the song is hardly audible and constitutes fair use .
By going after the Google - owned YouTube , Prince was merely following the lead of a handful of other big rights owners - including MTV - owner Viacom , the estate of Elvis Presley and the Premier League - that believe the video sharing site makes advertising revenue off the back of their copyrighted content .
But while some artists have resorted to the law in an attempt to persuade websites or internet providers to remove pirated songs and there have been disputes over lyrics , most decided long ago that it was counterproductive to attempt to get fans to remove images and album covers .
" You can get things taken down , the legal tools are there to do it , " said Caroline Kean , a partner at the law firm Wiggin .
" The reason people do n't is partly practical , because there are so many images , but also due to the bad publicity you get from going after your biggest fans .
Most people soon realised it was counter - productive . "
A spokeswoman for the fans ' campaign said the sites had always tried to work with Prince 's management .
But it appeared that Prince wanted to edit his past and there was " no sign " of his lawyers backing down , she said .
" He 's trying to control the internet 100 % and you can't do that without infringing people 's freedom of speech , " she added .
Fan mail began flowing in when Gershon was featured in the science section of The New York Times ( Jan. 23 , 1996 ) .
Fame can happen when work titled " Do developing enteric neurons need endothelins ? " is transformed into a really great read .
Sandra Blakeslee 's story explained why ailments such as ulcers and chronic abdominal pain are n't all just in our heads but are also the work of the gut 's little - known nervous system .
The sequel to that story was a wave of letters and calls .
Why so many ?
" You 'd be upset , too , if your gut had you chained to the toilet , " says Gershon .
" The typical letter says ' I 've seen six doctors , three of whom tell me I 'm a nut or give me tranquilizers that put me asleep but do n't change my gut .
What can I do about it ? ' they ask .
Or they tell me my research is their problem . "
In part , he understands .
" When I call up the NIH to check on my grants , I become painfully aware of the influence the brain can have on the gut . "
So Gershon refers patients to his colleague Joe Sweeting at Columbia 's new Center for Intestinal Dysfunction .
" I have n't asked if he likes me or hates me for sending him all this traffic , " says Gershon .
Occasionally , however , a wicked sense of humor threatens to overwhelm him after reading hundreds of letters about bowel problems .
" One woman called me saying , ' Doctor , you 've just got to do something for me .
I 've been full of gas for 40 years .
What do I do ? ' " recounts Gershon , who resisted the temptation to prescribe flatulence and listened sympathetically .
" But I 'm a mouse doctor , " says the scientist .
He studies the relatively unpublicized " second little brain in the gut , " which can independently control the gut 's behavior and talk back to the big brain in the skull .
On the cellular level , Gershon is tracing the development of the bowel 's brain in the embryo-- work he says suggests that congenital defects in the bowel could contribute to problems such as Crohn 's disease and irritable bowel syndrome .
" It is a message of hope that has brought me thousands of letters this month , " Gershon told a congressional hearing this spring .
" Desperate people are out there .
Drugs to treat the psychoses of the brain in the bowel will soon be forthcoming .
We are beginning to realize that research on how the mind makes the gut go wrong may have been misdirected .
The bowel may not misbehave because a person is crazy , but a misbehaving bowel can drive anyone mad . "
Or as Blakeslee put it in the Times , " Like Siamese twins , the two brains are interconnected ; when one gets upset , the other does too . "
That 's one reason why these disorders have been frustrating for patients and difficult for doctors to pin down .
Take ulcers , for example .
" Did the anxiety cause people to get Helicobacter pylori [ the bacteria responsible for the majority of ulcers ] or did the bacteria make them anxious ? " asks Gershon , " It 's pretty clear that the bacteria make people anxious .
If your gut is burning , it 's nerve - wracking . "
That kind of logic has the public intrigued .
It also has brought four book offers ( three for the lay audience ) , a persistent offer to serve as his agent , calls for television appearances , requests for interviews as far away as Brazil , and , as seen above , some interesting correspondence .
That 's the untold side of a science story : what happens when research written for one 's colleagues becomes public domain .
The public responded right before the March due date for NIH grant applications , a rather hairy time for any biomedical researcher .
And , of course , there was that book agent on the line again .
" He told me I 'm losing a lot of money because I 'm letting the moment when I 'm hot go by , " laughs Gershon .
" He had a lead for a six - figure contract for a popular book on the enteric nervous system .
I just have to figure out how someone like Lewis Thomas would write it . "
But judging from his recent testimony before the House , he should n't dismiss the idea .
Gershon 's newfound prominence afforded him the opportunity to address Congress , in a pitch for continued funds for basic science .
" There is an enemy among us , " he stated , " that yearly extracts a greater toll from our people than the Russians ever did , or ever are likely to do .
... I am referring to the army of disease . "
With the ability to communicate to legislators the importance of supporting the struggle against that enemy , this once - obscure researcher may be an effective people doctor of a different variety .

DRIVING a taxi in New York City can be a grueling , thankless job .
It is also a unionless job .
But on Wednesday , many of the city ’s 44,000 licensed cabdrivers are planning to go on strike for 48 hours to protest the new global positioning systems being installed in the city ’s 13,000 yellow cabs .
While the Taxi and Limousine Commission supports these devices and has mandated that they be up and running in the city ’s entire fleet by January , many cabdrivers — myself included — see this new technology as one big expensive headache .
Perhaps the commission should listen to cabdrivers before pushing a device that we ’d be better off without .
The device has no navigational abilities .
The monitor , which is set into the partition separating the driver from the passenger , cannot be seen or accessed from the front of the cab .
It does not give directions or plot routes .
All it does is keep track of where you are — both on - and off - duty — and this information is then stored in the commission ’s databases .
Officials at the commission say the primary purpose of the devices is to track lost property and make sure cabbies are n’t taking passengers from point A to point B by way of point Z. Sadly , there are some bad cabdrivers out there who take visitors for a “ ride , ” but in reality , we have much more to fear from our passengers than they have to fear from us .
WASHINGTON , Aug. 20 — For years , the Bush administration has shrugged off concerns about the trillions of dollars that the United States owes to China , Japan and oil - producing countries in the Middle East , arguing that these debts give no undue leverage to foreign governments .
But at a time of global financial instability , the administration has started to worry that foreign governments are increasingly converting their dollar holdings into investment funds to acquire companies , real estate , banks and other assets in the United States and elsewhere .
The fear is that these so - called sovereign wealth funds could destabilize markets or provoke a political backlash .
In response , the Bush administration is pressing the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to examine the behavior of these funds , which control up to $ 2.5 trillion in investments , and develop possible codes of conduct for them .
Among the proposed rules would be an obligation to disclose investment methods and to avoid interfering in a host country ’s politics .
Officially , the United States welcomes all investments , except those that could compromise national security .
“ Money is naturally going to gravitate toward dollar - based assets because of the strength of our economy , ” the Treasury secretary , Henry M. Paulson Jr. , said in an interview .
“ I ’d like nothing more than to get more of that money .
But I understand that there ’s a natural fear that they ’re going to buy up America . ”
PBS ' Moyers on planned media consolidation rule change : FCC / industry ' revolving door ' moves to further give away your airwaves Nick Langewis

This FCC Chairman Kevin Martin was heavily criticized by members of the public , along with his colleagues , at the sixth and final public hearing , held on November 9 , 2007 , on his planned changes to rules on media consolidation .
Input from the public , leading up to the vote , is being accepted until December 11 , 2007 .
Attendees were heavily suspicious of the short notice given , five business days , as a tactic to prevent more of the public from learning about the hearings , as well as being able to attend and provide input in an already short time window before the commission 's vote takes place .
Running this hearing with five days ' notice , and then trying to jam media consolidation through by mid-December , to me is damning evidence , by the total abuse of the process itself , that you 're up to some kind of no good .
If this is a legitimate issue , then it deserves and demands a legitimate public process to determine the outcome .
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves for not respecting the democracy you live in .
-- Hearing participant Martin 's proposed changes , condemned by colleagues , senators , and the public alike , would soften rules on media ownership to allow the owner of a newspaper in one of twenty major cities to also own a television or radio station , a move seen by some as a homogenization of news coverage and content , nonetheless a handout to already thriving media giants .
Who do these guys work for , anyway ?
As you will see on our website at pbs.org , one FCC commissioner after another has gone to work in the media world .
How can you serve the public when , in the back of your mind , you think that one day , Rupert Murdoch may have a big job for you ?
Remember Michael Powell ?
He was the last FCC chairman who wanted to let big media have all it can eat .
Powell is now in the pay of ' the world 's leading private equity firm focused on media , entertainment , communications , and information investments . '
-- Bill Moyers Video of this episode , also on Raw Replay , is available below .
More information on media consolidation , previous PBS coverage , and transcript , is available at PBS.org .
For some reason , I ’m always short on time , and apparently I ’m not the only one .
There ’s just not enough hours in the day , and that ’s a problem for the web industry overall .
Working with can be frustrating as it is when things are n’t going your way , so any time you can save is greatly appreciated .
Enter VMware Fusion , my most recent Time Saver .
Windows XP on OS X
VMware Fusion is a virtual machine software , which means that it lets you run other operating systems ( or OS ) on your computer , such as Windows XP or a Linux distribution .
In my case , I ’m on Mac which means I ’m running OS X .
That means that I , when doing web development , had to have a PC booted up , with the necessary browsers installed .
Now , it may be a luxury problem since I ’ve got a three monitor setup and not everyone ’s as equipped in this matter as I am , but that Windows XP instance took up valuable screen real estate , which is a bad thing when being used to having plenty of space .
No more !
I bought VMware Fusion , set up a virtual machine ( which was very easy , just allocate space on your hard drive ) , and then I installed Windows XP Pro on it .
The installation runs as it always does , in a window on your computer , when working with VMware ’s virtualization software , and it was a breeze .
There are some quickstart files to download , but I figured I ’d do the full install to make sure everything I wanted was in .
So the installation was a breeze , or as much of a breeze as a Windows XP install can be .
You do need a valid license , and you do need to activate your copy , it ’s just like installing on a PC , so this is n’t emulation .
That means that you ’ll have to buy a Windows license if you ’re a Mac user .
Since I ’ve been on Windows before , I had everything I need .
Unity Integrates the Windows Applications
Now , you can run your virtual machine either in a window on your computer , or you can use the Unity feature .
That means that you can have VMware Fusion embed ( for lack of a better word ) your Windows applications ( or whatever OS you fancy ) in OS X !
In other words , I can run Internet Explorer 6 for bug testing in a nice little OS X - like window , instead of having it confined to a big Windows XP window .
This is just great , brilliant , and marvelous !
I will never again run a Windows PC just for bug testing .
I ’ve got control of my screen real estate , and I ’m very happy with not having to go through a lot of hassle to see what my code does in various browsers .
Everything ’s on my Mac Pro workstation , and that makes me a happy designer .
The fact that I never need to wait for Windows booting up also kicks ass , I ’ve just suspended it in a state with all the browsers etc. open !
Lovely .
VMware Fusion recently updated to 1.1 for Leopard support , but I do n’t know if there ’s any real change from running 1.1 on Tiger – I have n’t upgraded my workstation to the new OS X version yet .
There are other solutions to this , such as Parallells , which basically does the same thing .
Boot Camp , included with Leopard , is n’t the same though , since it only lets you install a Windows instance on your computer and choose it on startup , not run it side by side .
I recommend VMware Fusion to everyone who needs to switch to Windows every now and then , to see how code and design turns out .
It ’s only $ 79.99 , which is totally worth it in my book , but then you need a Windows license as well , of course .

Any speculation on whether Trent knew this was coming down when he resigned the other day ?
Prominent Mississippi trial attorney Richard " Dickie " Scruggs , the brother - in - law of outgoing GOP Sen .
Trent Lott , was indicted by a federal grand jury Wednesday on charges that he and four other men tried to bribe a Mississippi state court judge .
According to the 13 - page indictment , Scruggs and three other attorneys -- including Lott 's nephew Zach -- attempted to bribe Mississippi Third Circuit Court Judge Henry L. Lackey with at least $ 40,000 in cash .
Lackey was assigned to hear a lawsuit in which Scruggs ' firm was named as a defendant in a dispute involving $ 26.5 million in attorneys ' fees stemming from a court settlement with State Farm Insurance over Hurricane Katrina claims .
The indictment alleges that the bribe was intended to resolve the case in Scruggs ' and his firm 's favor .
Now , as bmaz pointed out on yesterday 's thread on Scruggs , Scruggs was due to hold a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton -- so it 's not like Scruggs espouses the same politics as his brother - in - law , and it adds this to a long list of cases in which Trial Lawyers who support Democrats get into legal trouble .
Also note , this is not the Paul Minor case , as I suggested it might be yesterday .
This has to do with Scruggs ' efforts to help a lot of Katrina victims get their money from State Farm .
I have no idea if there 's merit to the charges -- with this DOJ , who knows ?
You do n't have to be Bev Harris or a Diebold obsessive to get pissed off about this story from Page B4 of today 's WaPo .
You just need to be a citizen who expects a basic level of competence and integrity in the election process :

Webb 's last name has been cut off on part of the electronic ballot used by voters in Alexandria , Falls Church and Charlottesville because of a computer glitch that also affects other candidates with long names , city officials said yesterday . . .
Election officials attribute the mistake to an increase in the type size on the ballot .
Although the larger type is easier to read , it also unintentionally shortens the longer names on the summary page of the ballot .
Thus , Democratic candidate Webb will appear with his first name and nickname only -- or " James H. ' Jim ' " -- on summary pages in Alexandria , Falls Church and Charlottesville , the only jurisdictions in Virginia that use balloting machines manufactured by Hart InterCivic of Austin .
" We 're not happy about it , " Webb spokeswoman Kristian Denny Todd said last night , adding that the campaign learned about the problem a week ago and has since been in touch with state election officials .
" I do n't think it can be remedied by Election Day .
Obviously , that 's a concern . "
Let 's review :
1 ) Two weeks before the election , we know that one of the two major party candidates for the top - of - the - ballot race in Virginia will definitely have his name truncated to " James H. ' Jim ' " on the final voting machine screen seen by many NoVa voters before casting their votes .
Meanwhile , his opponent , George F. Allen , will have his full name displayed ;
2 ) We 're being told that this error can and will not be fixed before Election Day -- in fact , Alexandria Registrar Tom Parkins is later quoted as saying that " this is not the kind of problem that has either shaken our confidence in the system overall or that of the vote .
There have been far worse problems around the country . . .
We 're not comfortable with [ this problem ] in the long term , but we have every reason to expect it will be rectified before the next election . "
In that case , OK , then ;
3 ) And there are no plans to shelve the goddamn machines in favor of substitute paper ballots .
I do n't live in Alexandria , Falls Church , or Charlottesvile .
But if I did , I 'd be calling my Board of Elections and demanding that they get off their asses and fix this problem -- either by getting their machine vendor to display Jim Webb 's entire fucking name on their worthless machine or by printing paper ballots .
Preferably ballots wide enough to contain that whopper of a name , " James H. " Jim " Webb . "
Is is too much to ask for voting machines that work as well as , I do n't know , a fucking toaster ?
One of the things that played an important role on my recent trip to India ( besides the amazing people I met there ( but that ’s a whole other post ) , were the amazing books that seemed to “ cross my path ” at just the right moment .
Whether running across them at local bookshops or receiving them for free from random travelers I met along the way , all 6 books seemed to have come into my life just as I needed to hear them most .
The synchronicity of how it unfolded was incredible .
I found myself reading 4 or 5 books at a time ( most of them I am still reading back home .. ) quickly jumping from one book to another in sort of a spiral form .
It ’s almost as if I came across enough information in one book to quickly prepare me for the next chapter in the next book , and then so on and so forth with the rest of them .
By the time I went back to continue the first one , I was reading it from a whole new state of awareness , making it that much more clear to me as I read .
I could n’t have planned it better if I tried .
So anyway , I strongly recommend any of the following books from my own personal experience .
However , only you can know if and when the time is right for you .

BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
The head of Iraq 's main humanitarian group said an 18 - year - old approached him with a baby suffering from leukemia .
The desperate mother said she 'd do " anything " for treatment for her child -- and then offered herself up for sex .
Baha , 12 , waits for treatment in an Iraqi Red Crescent center after shrapnel pierced his left eye .
Said Ismail Hakki breaks down in tears as he recalls that story .
Leukemia can be treatable to a degree in much of the world , but not in Iraq .
The baby died two months later .
" It shook me like hell , " said Hakki , the president of the Iraqi Red Crescent .
" All my life I 've been a surgeon .
I 've seen blood ; I 've seen death .
That never shook me -- none whatsoever .
But when I see the suffering of those people , that really shook me . "
The plight of Iraq 's children is nearing epidemic proportions , he said , with mothers and fathers abandoning their children " because they 're becoming a liability . "
The parents do n't do it out of convenience , they do it out of desperation .
Watch the plight of Iraq 's children »
" When you become so desperate , you tend to just throw everything up and go , " Hakki said .
" Every time I look at those children , I ask myself first , ' What crime have those children committed ? ' "
Hakki says Red Crescent has the monumental task of treating and feeding more than 1.6 million children under the age of 12 who have become homeless in their own country .
That 's roughly 70 percent of the estimated 2.3 million Iraqis who are homeless inside Iraq .
How to help the Iraqi Red Crescent
With 95,000 volunteers and 5,000 employees , the Iraqi Red Crescent is the last line of defense for the country 's poor , sick and displaced .
They try to blend in as best they can , with Shiites , Sunnis and Kurds working in the neighborhoods distinct to their ethnicities .
Six employees of the Iraqi Red Crescent have been killed over the last four years .
Eight have been wounded , including six left disabled by the severity of their wounds .
Impact Your World See how you can make a difference
Hakki says the spike in numbers of abandoned children is especially alarming , the result of sectarian violence and drastic socio-economic problems .
The majority of parents in Iraq , he says , leave their children with a single relative who often has about 20 to 30 children to look after .
Some parents just leave their kids altogether .
Many of the families are living in areas without basic needs , like water and electricity , and there are no jobs available .
" It 's a desperate situation , " he said .
" Children are becoming a liability for both the father and the mother . "
The greatest concern is the ripple effect it will have in the long term -- an entire generation lacking basic life skills , surviving with no education , no income and no families .

" The trauma of what 's happening to those children is enormous , " he said .
" If somebody is injured by a bullet or shrapnel , it takes a week or two and he 's fine .
...
The psycho -social injury is pretty deep and can take months , if not years , to heal .
" That 's the task -- the mammoth task -- the Iraq Red Crescent is facing . "
The group gets some financial support from the central government .
It 's also negotiating with the U.S. Embassy , he said , to see if it can offer financial aid .
But funds are low .
Just recently , the group closed 18 camps for the winter and is trying to house those thousands of people in abandoned government buildings .
At a waiting room at an Iraqi Red Crescent treatment center in Baghdad 's Mansour district , CNN came across several young children in desperate need of care .
But they were among the lucky ones -- if that term can even be applied -- because their parents remain with them .
Baha , a 12 - year - old boy , was waiting to see a doctor , recalling the exact date -- January 16 , 2004 -- he lost his left eye .
" I want my eye to get well , " he said .
Baha was with his father in a market when someone opened fire on U.S. soldiers .
When the soldiers fired back , shrapnel hit his eye .
Despite what happened , this brave boy still goes to that same market .
" I 'm not afraid , " he said .
Across the room , 3 - year - old Saja lightened the mood in the room .
" Iraqis , we are still brothers ! " she sang .
She giggled , laughed and darted around , bringing smiles to all who saw her .
Yet , she could n't see most of what was around her .
She 's blind in one eye and losing sight in the other -- the result of shoddy medical care .
Her father , Dia'a , said he heard about the Iraqi Red Crescent from television and others who had been treated here .
He said he can't afford to travel outside the country for medical treatment for his girl .
This clinic , he said , has given him " a ray of hope that I had lost . "
He , too , expressed despair over the plight of Iraq 's youngest generation .
" Our children are suffering .
All they talk about is weapons and bombs , " he said .
" They are children .
We are older ; our hair turns gray .
What happens to them hearing all the explosions and bombs ?
" We can't make them feel better because we are down . "
That 's a sentiment that haunts the head of the Iraqi Red Crescent .
" There are times I get up in the middle of the night and I say , ' Oh my God , how are we going to solve it ?
God help me to help those kids ! ' "

ESO OWL INTRODUCTION SCIENCE WITH OWL OWL DESIGN PUBLICATIONS GALLERY FAQs LINKS General Information and Services Observing Facilities and Operations Projects & Developments Science Activities ESO Intranet Our Wonderful Logo OWL People Send comments Last modified : 2006/04/13 OWL - a future milestone for Astronomy ?
A 100 -M CLASS OPTICAL AND NEAR -INFRARED TELESCOPE OWL will operate in open air and be covered by a sliding enclosure during daytime .
Building on the success of its 8 - m Very Large Telescope ( VLT ) and the coming to maturity of controlled optical systems , ESO has studied the concept of a giant , next generation optical and near - infrared telescope , dubbed OWL for for the eponymous bird 's keen night vision , and for OverWhelmingly Large ( an implied reference to astronomer 's taste for bold names such as Very Large Telescope , Extremely Large Telescope , etc. )
With a diameter of 100 meter , OWL would combine unrivalled light gathering power with the ability to resolve details down to a milli-arc second .
A crude simulation showing images of the same object as seen by existing facilities and by OWL .
OWL angular resolution will be 40 times better than that of the Hubble Space Telescope .
( Click to enlarge ) THE NEXT GENERATION
With the present generation of 8 to 10 m class telescopes well along the way , a number of astronomical Institutions are now starting to work towards the next generation of Extremely Large Telescopes ( ELT ) .
Detailed Science Studies have shown that giant collectors - 25 - m diameter up - working near their diffraction limit ( a hundredth to a few thousands arc - second on the sky ) are indeed needed for the next major advances in the knowledge of the Universe we live in .
-- OWL design relies extensively on serially produced modules .
Most current ELT projects are up scaled versions of the segmented Ritchey - Chrétien concept , successfully pioneered in the early 90's with the twin 10 -m diameter Keck telescopes located on top of Mauna Kea , Hawaii .
Since 1997 , ESO has worked in close cooperation with European Industries on an original concept , with the goal of breaking the steep cost to diameter law of this classical approach .
OWL relies on a paradigm change : while nearly all telescopes in the past have been built as one - off prototypes , OWL is based on mass production of the major cost items , notably the overall mechanical structure with modular building blocks ( as pioneered by Gustave Eiffel in 1899 for his eponymous tower ) and spherical primary segmented mirror ( pioneered by the Hobby - Eberly Telescope in the 90s ) .
This results in a cheap structure , extremely light but with high performance , as well as low - cost , yet very high quality optics .
The OWL study was completed and subsequently reviewed by an international panel of experts in the fall of 2005 .
Design and analysis validate the concept as a cost - effective and time - effective way to build any ELT significantly larger than 60 m .
In particular , we found a much more hopeful cost to diameter relationship .
The review panel concurred with the soundness of the concept .
However , in view of the global cost and the huge technological development needed , with significant cost and schedule risks , it recommended to study instead a less ambitious 30 - 60 m facility - the European ELT .
OVERWHELMING SCIENCE OWL will provide detailed observations of the farthest objects ..
With its keen angular vision , OWL will be capable of imaging solar system objects at resolutions comparable to that offered by space probes , but over much longer time scales .
It will unveil the intricate processes underlying the formation of stellar and planetary systems , not only in our own Galaxy but also in many nearby ones .
Even more important , and in combination with its huge light gathering power , OWL should shed light on the two major cosmic mysteries of our time , of whether there are life - bearing planets like our own around other Suns , and on the meaning of the enigmatic dark matter and dark energy which in toto make up 96 % of the mass content of our Universe .
OWL will be able to image exo-planets and determine their atmospheres ' composition , and thereby , possibly , reveal the existence of biospheres .
It will peer into the deepest reaches of the Universe and witness the birth of the very first stars and galaxies .
As illustrated in the figure above and through its direct view of star formation history back to the very first stars to have ever exploded , it will probe the laws of physics at an energy scale unreachable with the largest particle accelerator .
If the past history of every generation of telescope holds true , the most important discoveries awaiting OWL could very well happen in new , unanticipated , areas .
It may , eventually , revolutionize our perception of the Universe as much as Galileo 's telescope did .
A WIDE RANGE OF SIZE Although designed for 100 - m diameter , OWL is a concept with a wide range of applicability .
A preliminary analysis shows that the upper limit for the concept is in the range of 130 meters .
This limit is essentially set by the fact that with larger diameters , monolithic relay mirrors beyond proven dimensions ( about 8 - m ) would probably become necessary .
In addition , safety with respect to dynamic excitations ( wind , earthquakes ) and fatigue would probably imply a structural design relying extensively on expensive composite materials - whereas the OWL structure is made of standard steel .
The lower size limit is in the 60 - m range , below which simpler optical solutions become attractive .
COMPETITIVE COST AND TIME SCALE
The modular approach can break the time - honoured Time versus Diameter law of approximately 1 year per 1 - m of diameter , which by itself would practically prohibit the construction of any Telescope much larger than about 10 - 20 m .
Another crucial feature of the mass production approach is that it leads naturally to the " growing a Telescope " scheme , with early opening of the facility for science observations significantly before start of full operation .
Indeed , existing segmented telescopes were already turned to the sky before the integration of segments was complete , mainly for engineering work .
With " only " a quarter of its 3048 segments integrated , OWL would already perform as a 50 - m class telescope and thus deliver unequalled science performance 3 to 4 years before before full completion .
The total estimated cost of OWL is about 1,200 millions of Euros , including 940 million Euros in capital investment .
INDUSTRY AS A KEY PARTNER
Industry has played and is still playing a key role in ESO projects and its involvement right from the early phases of a new project is considered as essential .
European industry deserves substantial credit for the excellent performance of ESO's 8 m Very Large Telescopes .
The VLT project has been equally benefitial to suppliers , in the form of profitable spin - offs or by promoting them to world - leaders in their respective fields .
In the case of OWL , the project size and its general reliance on low - risk , serially produced components add to the incentives for industrial participation .
The OWL concept study was supported by quite a number of industrial studies .
These studies confirm internal cost , schedule and performance estimates , as well as the unequivocal interest of potential suppliers to be associated with the project .

Student mulls lawsuit after being kicked off campus for wearing Edwards t- shirt David Edwards and Jason Rhyne
Published : Friday October 5 , 2007

This A Texas high school student is considering a lawsuit after being kicked off campus for wearing a t - shirt supporting Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards .
Sophomore Pete Palmer , who attends Waxahachie High School just outside of Dallas , is not allowed to wear the Edwards shirt because of a strict policy prohibiting shirts carrying messages enforced by the Waxahachie Independent School District ( WISD ) .
The dress code , available at the WISD website , states that " T - shirts , other than WISD clubs , organizations , sports , or spirit t- shirts , college or university t- shirts , or solid - colored t- shirts , are prohibited . "
Palmer 's father , however , who is an attorney , thinks there is a clear - cut free speech issue involved .
He cites a Supreme Court decision earlier this year which held that a Vermont middle school had violated a student 's rights by not allowing him to wear an t - shirt critical of President Bush , although the shirt in that case also featured drug imagery .
 Its a First Amendment constitutional right that people have fought and died for and I dont know why he should give it up just because Waxahachie thinks it would be okay , " the senior Palmer said .
" It had nothing to do with trying to stifle anyone 's free speech , " WISD District Superintendent Thomas Collins , told Fox 's Dallas - Fort Worth affiliate .
" It was an opportunity for us to continue to try and maintain a safe and orderly environment ... the dress code gives us the tools to make a decision on what is right and what is n't . "
A power point presentation , viewable at the school district 's website , shows examples of other shirts deemed unacceptable under the code , including the jersey of baseball player Alex Rodriguez .
But Pete says he 'll keep wearing his Edwards shirt , even if it means a trip to court .
" I just think they 're wrong .
I think this , what they 're saying oversteps its bounds when it comes to this , " he said , adding that " it 's an incorrect policy and if by God , if they have to get a court ruling to do so , then it 's important to do it . "
A Sept. 24 post at John Edwards ' official blog , purportedly authored by one of the boy 's parents , said the incident " is the subject of a federal suit that [ Palmer ] anticipates filing next week , should the situation not be resolved to our satisfaction . "
" We called the campaign to notify , but ( understandably ) had trouble getting through to anyone who might make the Senator aware of how deeply his supporters feel about his candidacy in Texas , " the post continued .
The following video is from Fox Dallas Fort Worth News , broadcast on October 2 , 2007 .

" A degree in philosophy ?
What are you going to do with that then ? "
Philosophy students will tell you they 've been asked this question more times than they care to remember .
" The response people seem to want is a cheery shrug and a jokey ' do n't know ' , " says Joe Cunningham , 20 , a final - year philosophy undergraduate at Heythrop College , University of London .
A more accurate comeback , according to the latest statistics , is " just about anything I want " .
Figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency show philosophy graduates , once derided as unemployable layabouts , are in growing demand from employers .
The number of all graduates in full - time and part - time work six months after graduation has risen by 9 % between 2002 - 03 and 2005 - 06 ; for philosophy graduates it has gone up by 13 % .
It is in the fields of finance , property development , health , social work and the nebulous category of " business " that those versed in Plato and Kant are most sought after .
In " business " , property development , renting and research , 76 % more philosophy graduates were employed in 2005 - 06 than in 2002 - 03 .
In health and social work , 9 % more .
The Higher Education Careers Services Unit ( Hecsu ) , which also collates data of this kind , agrees philosophers are finding it easier to secure work .
Its figures show that , in 2001 , 9.9 % of philosophy graduates were unemployed six months after graduation .
In 2006 , just 6.7 % were .
On average , 6 % of all graduates were unemployed six months after graduation .
In 2001 , 9.3 % of philosophy graduates were in business and finance roles six months after graduation .
In 2006 , 12.2 % were .
In 2001 , 5.3 % were in marketing and advertising six months after graduation .
In 2006 , 7.3 % were .
It is particularly significant that the percentage finding full - time work six months after graduation has risen , since the number of philosophy graduates has more than doubled between 2001 and 2006 .
In 2001 , UK universities produced 895 graduates with a first degree in the discipline ; in 2006 , they produced 2,040 .
And it is so popular with its graduates that many go on to postgraduate study rather than join the workforce .
Charlie Ball , who runs Hecsu's labour market analysis , says : " More philosophy graduates are being produced , and they are much less likely to be unemployed than five years ago . "
Philosophers have always come in handy in the workplace with their grounding in analytical thinking .
Why , only now , are they so prized by employers ?
Open mind
Lucy Adams , human resources director of Serco , a services business and a consultancy firm , says : " Philosophy lies at the heart of our approach to recruiting and developing our leadership , and our leaders .
We need people who have the ability to look for different approaches and take an open mind to issues .
These skills are promoted by philosophical approaches . "
Fiona Czerniawska , director of the Management Consultancies Association 's think tank , says : " A philosophy degree has trained the individual 's brain and given them the ability to provide management - consulting firms with the sort of skills that they require and clients demand .
These skills can include the ability to be very analytical , provide clear and innovative thinking , and question assumptions . "
Deborah Bowman , associate dean for widening participation at St George 's , University of London , which offers medicine and health sciences courses , says philosophers are increasingly sought after by the NHS : " Graduates of philosophy who come in to graduate - entry medicine , or to nursing courses , are very useful .
Growth areas in the NHS include clinical ethicists , who assist doctors and nurses .
Medical ethics committees and ethics training courses for staff are also growing .
More and more people are needed to comment on moral issues in healthcare , such as abortion . "
Being on an ethics committee of the NHS is something Cunningham is looking into .
" It would be a direct application of my skills , " he says .
The popular philosopher Simon Blackburn , a professor at Cambridge University , sees the improving career prospects of philosophy graduates as part of a wider change of public perception .
" I guess the public image of a philosopher has tended to concentrate on an ancient Greek in a toga , or some unwashed hippy lying around not doing very much , " he says .
" I do detect a change in the way the public sees philosophers .
I have been pleasantly surprised by the number of people who come to philosophy events nowadays . "
Blackburn can take some credit .
The user - friendly books on philosophy that he and other philosophers such as AC Grayling , Stephen Law , Julian Baggini , Nigel Warburton and Alain de Botton write have made their way into the mainstream .
Course design
Those in charge of designing university courses have also become sensitive to claims that their subject has no relevance to the modern day .
Blackburn says : " In the years after the second world war , there was a sort of Wittgensteinian air about philosophy , which meant practitioners were proud of the fact that they appeared slightly esoteric and were not doing anything practical .
There was very little political philosophy , and moral philosophy was disengaged from people 's actual moral problems , and that did lead to the subject being marginalised .
That has changed .
Political philosophy is a central part of the Cambridge course . "
Jonathan Lowe , professor of philosophy at Durham University , agrees that courses ' concern with the real world has accelerated in the past five years .
" It 's probably because of the new financial arrangements for students that courses have had to prove they are applicable to real world issues , " he says .
" And the teaching methods have changed .
There are more student - led sessions .
Students have to argue on their feet and give presentations .
That probably shows at interviews . "
News that employers and the public hold philosophers in higher regard should presumably be cause for celebration ?
Not entirely , says Blackburn .
" It is also slightly worrying , because people turn to philosophers when they feel less confident and more insecure . "
A Dallas jury , a week ago , caused a mistrial in the government case against this country ’s largest Islamic charity .
The action raises a defiant fist on the sinking ship of American democracy .
If we lived in a state where due process and the rule of law could curb the despotism of the Bush administration , this mistrial might be counted a victory .
But we do not .
The jury may have rejected the federal government ’s claim that the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development funneled millions of dollars to Middle Eastern terrorists .
It may have acquitted Mohammad el - Mezain , the former chairman of the foundation , of virtually all criminal charges related to funding terrorism ( the jury deadlocked on one of the 32 charges against el - Mezain ) , and it may have deadlocked on the charges that had been lodged against four other former leaders of the charity , but do n’t be fooled .
This mistrial will do nothing to impede the administration ’s ongoing contempt for the rule of law .
It will do nothing to stop the curtailment of our civil liberties and rights .
The grim march toward a police state continues .
Constitutional rights are minor inconveniences , noisome chatter , flies to be batted away on the steady road to despotism .
And no one , not the courts , not the press , not the gutless Democratic opposition , not a compliant and passive citizenry hypnotized by tawdry television spectacles and celebrity gossip , seems capable of stopping the process .
Those in power know this .
We , too , might as well know it .
The Bush administration , which froze the foundation ’s finances three months after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks and indicted its officials three years later on charges that they provided funds for the militant group Hamas , has ensured that the foundation and all other Palestinian charities will never reopen in the United States .
Any organized support for Palestinians from within the U.S. has been rendered impossible .
The goal of the Israeli government and the Bush administration — despite the charade of peace negotiations to be held at Annapolis — is to grind defiant Palestinians into the dirt .
Israel , which has plunged the Gaza Strip into one of the world ’s worst humanitarian crises , has now begun to ban fuel supplies and sever electrical service .
The severe deprivation , the Israelis hope , will see the overthrow of the Hamas government in Gaza and the reinstatement of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas , who has become the Marshal Pétain of the Palestinian people .
The Dallas trial — like all of the major terrorism trials conducted by this administration , from the Florida case against the Palestinian activist Dr. Sami al - Arian , which also ended in a mistrial , to the recent decision by a jury in Chicago to acquit two men of charges of financing Hamas — has been a judicial failure .
William Neal , a juror in the Dallas trial , told the Associated Press that the case “ was strung together with macaroni noodles .
There was so little evidence . ”
Such trials , however , have been politically expedient .
The accusations , true or untrue , serve the aims of the administration .
A jury in Tampa , Chicago or Dallas can dismiss the government ’s assaults on individual rights , but the draconian restrictions put in place because of the mendacious charges remain firmly implanted within the system .
It is the charges , not the facts , which matter .
Dr. al - Arian , who was supposed to have been released and deported in April , is still in a Virginia prison because he will not testify in a separate case before a grand jury .
The professor , broken by the long ordeal of his trial and unable to raise another million dollars in legal fees for a retrial , pleaded guilty to a minor charge in the hopes that his persecution would end .
It has not .
Or take the case of Canadian citizen Maher Arar , who in 2002 was spirited away by Homeland Security from JFK Airport to Syria , where he spent 10 months being tortured in a coffin - like cell .
He was , upon his release , exonerated of terrorism .
Arar testified before a House panel this month about how he was abducted by the U.S. and interrogated , stripped of his legal rights and tortured .
But he could n’t testify in person .
He spoke to the House members on a video link from Canada .
He is forbidden by Homeland Security to enter the United States because he allegedly poses a threat to national security .
Those accused of being involved in conspiracies and terrorism plots , as in all police states , become nonpersons .
There is no rehabilitation .
There is no justice .
“ He was never given a hearing nor did the Canadian consulate , his lawyer , or his family know of his fate , ” Amnesty International wrote of Arar .
“ Expulsion in such circumstances , without a fair hearing , and to a country known for regularly torturing their prisoners , violates the U.S. Government ’s obligations under international law , specifically the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman , or Degrading Treatment or Punishment . ”
You can almost hear Dick Cheney yawn .
The Bush administration shut down the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development six years ago and froze its assets .
There was no hearing or trial .
It became a crime for anyone to engage in transactions with the foundation .
The administration never produced evidence to support the charges .
It did not have any .
In the “ war on terror , ” evidence is unnecessary .
An executive order is enough .
The foundation sued the government in a federal court in the District of Columbia .
Behind closed doors , the government presented secret evidence that the charity had no opportunity to see or rebut .
The charity ’s case was dismissed .
The government has closed seven Muslim charities in the United States and frozen their assets .
Not one of them , or any person associated with them , has been found guilty of financing terrorism .
They will remain shut .
George W. Bush can tar any organization or individual , here or abroad , as being part of a terrorist conspiracy and by fiat render them powerless .
He does not need to make formal charges .
He does not need to wait for a trial verdict .
Secret evidence , which these court cases have exposed as a sham , is enough .
The juries in Tampa , Chicago and Dallas did their duty .
They spoke for the rights of citizens .
They spoke for the protection of due process and the rule of law .
They threw small hurdles in front of the emergent police state .
But the abuse rolls on .
I fear terrorism .
I know it is real .
I am sure terrorists will strike again on American soil .
But while terrorists can wound and disrupt our democracy , only we can kill it .
Some sun can be a good thing
Researchers found lung cancer rates were highest in countries furthest from the equator , where exposure to sunlight is lowest .
It is thought vitamin D - generated by exposure to sunlight - can halt tumour growth by promoting the factors responsible for cell death in the body .
The University of California , San Diego study appears in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health .
Experts warn that exposure to sunlight is still the major cause of skin cancer - a disease which is on the increase around the world .
Lung cancer kills more than one million people every year around the globe .
The researchers examined data from 111 countries across several continents .
Cell glue
They found smoking was most strongly associated with lung cancer rates - accounting for up to 85 % of all cases .
But exposure to sunlight , especially UVB light , the principal source of vitamin D for the body , also seemed to have an impact .
We know that vitamin D is essential for good health , but the time in the sun needed to get enough vitamin D is much less than the time it takes to tan or burn
Dr Kat Arney
Cancer Research UK
The amount of UVB light increases with proximity to the equator .
The analysis showed lung cancer rates were highest in those countries furthest away from the equator and lowest in those nearest .
Higher cloud cover and airborne aerosol levels were also associated with higher rates of the disease .
Lead researcher Dr Cedric Garland said lung cancer , in common with many other forms of the disease , usually began in the epithelial cells that line the surface of the tissues in the organ .
Cancer results when cells start to divide in an uncontrolled fashion .
He said vitamin D stimulated the release of chemicals which , in combination with calcium , formed a glue - like substance which bind these cells tightly together , and put a brake on their division .
There was also evidence that vitamin D may also slow the progress of cancer once it develops .
Skin cancer risk
Dr Garland also stressed that moderate exposure to sunlight did not significantly raise the risk of the most serious form of skin cancer , melanoma .
He said the only form of skin cancer that was related to ordinary , moderate exposure to sunlight was squamous cell carcinoma , which killed far fewer people than lung cancer , and other forms of the disease which might also be prevented by moderate exposure to the sun .
Moderate exposure would be five to 15 minutes per day within two hours of midday , on mainly clear days , when season and temperature allow , with 40 % of skin area exposed .
A hat with a wide brim should be worn when in the sun for more than a few minutes , but sunscreen should be skipped during this period , as it prevents vitamin D synthesis .
Dr Kat Arney , of the charity Cancer Research UK , stressed that smoking was by far the biggest cause of lung cancer .
She said : " There is growing evidence that vitamin D could help to reduce the risk of some cancers , such as bowel cancer , but the link between vitamin D and lung cancer is still unclear .
" In this case , the researchers have not actually measured people 's vitamin D levels , and there may be several other factors that need to be taken into account .
" These include differences in sun protection behaviour in various countries , as well as differences in the way that cancer cases are registered .
" We know that vitamin D is essential for good health , but the time in the sun needed to get enough vitamin D is much less than the time it takes to tan or burn . "
YOU need not be a Wall Street chieftain to feel the anxiety that has wrapped its arms around the American economy .
The stock market seems locked in a downward spiral as one bank after another suffers its day of reckoning with bad mortgages .
Companies are sharply cutting profit forecasts as the sense takes hold that American consumers are finally too loaded with debt to buy the next flat - screen television .
The dollar has fallen to inglorious depths , turning Manhattan department stores into something like a Tijuana street market for Germans .
One unpleasant word hovers large : recession .
How bad could things get ?
Pretty bad , say many economists .
Not so bad that your grandfather ’s prescriptions for enduring the Great Depression need dusting off , but nasty enough to force many Americans to get reacquainted with living within their means .
That could make life uncomfortable .
It may also be an unavoidable step toward purging the United States and the global economy of a major source of instability — an unhealthy dependence on the willingness of American consumers to keep buying even as debt mounts .
Concerns that Americans must eventually grow thrifty , leaving factories from Guangzhou to Guatemala City scrambling for buyers , now sows unease around the world .
It is worth bearing in mind that the American economy has a history of unexpected resilience in the face of supposedly grim prospects .
Moreover , some parts of the economy are enjoying good times , notably farmers able to cash in on the making of ethanol .
That said , most economists think the American economy is headed for a significant slowdown , as housing prices keep falling , consumers grow tight , and businesses cut investments .
The Federal Reserve last week said it expected the economy to grow 1.6 percent to 2.6 percent next year , a stark contrast from the 3.9 percent rate registered in the most recent quarter .
Some see signs of a worst - case scenario — a severe recession that would feature a plummeting stock market , a lower dollar and the loss of many jobs .
That would make for an unpleasant year or two for Americans from most walks of life .
It would probably drag down the world economy , as Americans put off purchases of everything from computers made in China to Italian - produced sports cars .
Today , deCODE genetics announced the launch of their consumer genotyping service , deCODEme .
deCODEme is the first personal genomics company to launch , and will provide sequencing information about 1 million SNPs for the introductory price of $ 985 .
The service has two components :
1 . The genotyping of ~ 1 million SNPs ( single nucleotide polymorphisms , or personal differences in the genetic code ) , and ;
2 . A secured website for presenting the data obtained from the sequencing .
The official press release from the parent company deCODE genetics , contains some interesting information about the product :
“ Through your subscription to deCODEme , you can learn what your DNA says about your ancestry , your body –traits such as hair and eye color– as well as whether you may have genetic variants that have been associated with higher or lower than average risk of a range of common diseases .
This information will be continually updated as new discoveries are made .
“ Subscribers will create a secure password - controlled personal account .
Just a few weeks after sending in a simple cheek swab , customers will receive expert analysis of more than a million key variants across their genome , accessible through an easy - to - use and intuitive user interface . ”
What Does This Mean for Genetic Genealogists ?
The SNP chip used by deCODEme – human1 M – tests 40,097 loci on the X chromosome , 2,283 on the Y chromosome ( if there is one ! ) , and 163 mitochondrial SNPs .
The information gleaned from the deCODEme sequencing can be translated into ancestral information .
From Nicholas Wade ’s New York Times article “ Company Offers Genome Assessment “ :
“ Besides information about disease risk and normal physiology , Decode will also examine the Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA , the only two elements of the genome that are always passed down essentially unchanged from one generation to the next .
SNPs on the Y chromosome reflect the origin of a man ’s ancestors back to 50,000 years ago when modern humans first left their ancestral homeland in northeast Africa .
Those on the mitochondrial DNA reflect the wanderings of women throughout the globe . ”
The deCODEme ancestry page states the following :
“ Your DNA has been passed between generations for hundreds of centuries .
deCODEme allows you to virtually reconstruct the geographical distribution of your ancestors back hundreds and even thousands of generations .
Through an intuitive interface you will be able to view how your mother and father and their ancestors contributed to your genome and how much of your genome is derived from people from Africa , Europe or Asia .
We offer a clear and concise analysis of this information with user - friendly explanations and graphics . ”
SEQanswers , who has registered for an account and provided a length , information - packed review post , provides the analysis options available on a post - registration landing page :
“ These options are “ my GENE profile ” , “ my PHYSICAL attributes ” , “ my ANCESTRY ” , and “ COMPAREme ” . ”
Thus , it appears that deCODEme is planning to translate the results of their genotyping into a easy - to - use format for anyone interested in their genetic genealogy , under “ myANCESTRY . ”
The Ethical Concerns Associated With Genomic Sequencing
The problem , of course , is that genetic sequencing has the potential to raise numerous ethical concerns .
The New York Times article presented the following quote :
“ If people can go into this testing knowing what its limits are , and can take it with a grain of salt , that ’s fine , ” said Angela Trepanier , incoming president of the National Society of Genetic Counselors .
“ But you have to be really careful about what you know and do n’t know . ”
deCODE is also careful to state that the assessment should not replace proper medical care :
“ Dr. Kari Stefansson , chief executive of Decode Genetics , said the genotyping information his company would provide was not the same as a genetic test .
If customers felt they were at particular risk of a disease , they should get a proper test from their physician , he said . ”
Also , some State laws prevent elements of the deCODEme process .
After registering , the applicant must testify that :
“ I am not a citizen of any of the following states : Arizona , California , Connecticut , Georgia , Maryland , Michigan , New Jersey , New York , Rhode Island , and Wyoming .
As a resident of any of the above states , you will not be allowed to use the deCODEme.com genetic risk calculations part of this website , as mentioned in the Genetic Scan customer agreement . ”
This could create a problem for people who live in these states and wish to purchase this product .
As with any product that can reveal medically - relevant information , there are also privacy concerns .
The deCODEme website does has a lengthy privacy page which addresses some of these concerns .
For More Information :
A webcast of the announcement is available at deCODE ’s website .
I would recommend spending a few minutes to watch it .
In addition to providing useful information , it showed numerous shots of beautiful Iceland .
GenomeWeb Daily News has a story entitled “ Decode Throws Hat into Consumer Genomics Ring . ”
Forbes has an article at “ Personal Genome Race Goes Into Overdrive . ”
There ’s already a lengthy discussion at RootsWeb ’s GENEALOGY - DNA mailing list .
The Wall Street Journal has a blog post at “ Decode Me? Personal DNA Sleuthing on a Q - tip . ”
I recently posted a blog post entitled Why GData / APP Fails as a General Purpose Editing Protocol for the Web which pointed out some limitations in the Atom Publishing Protocol ( APP ) and Google 's implementation of it in GData with regards to being a general purpose protocol for updating data stores on the Web .
There were a lot of good responses to my post from developers knowledgeable about APP including the authors of the specification , Bill de hÓra and Joe Gregorio .
Below are links to some of these responses
There was also a post by Tim Bray entitled So Lame which questions my motives for writing the post and implies that it is some sinister plot by Microsoft to make sure that we use proprietary technologies to lock users in .
I guess I should have given more background in my previous post .
The fact is that lots of people have embraced building RESTful Web Services in a big way .
My primary concern now is that we do n't end up seeing umpteen different RESTful protocols from Microsoft [ thus confusing our users and ourselves ] and instead standardize on one or two .
For example , right now we already have Atom +SSE , Web3S and Project Astoria as three completely different RESTful approaches for updating or retrieving data from a Microsoft data source on the Web .
In my mind , that 's two too many and that 's just the stuff we 've made public so there could be more .
I 'd personally like to see us reduce the set of RESTful protocols coming out of Microsoft to one and even better end up reusing existing Web standards , if possible .
Of course , this is an aspiration and it is quite possible that all of these protocols are different for a reason ( e.g. we have FTP , SMTP , and HTTP which all can be used to transfer files but have very different use cases ) and there is no hope for unification let alone picking some existing standard .
My previous post was intended to point out the limitations I and others had noticed with using the Atom Publishing Protocol ( APP ) as a general protocol for updating data stores that did n't primarily consist of authored content .
The point of the post was to share these learnings with other developers working in this space and get feedback from the general developer community just in case there was something wrong with my conclusions .
Anyway , back to the title of this post .
In my previous post I pointed out to the following limitations of APP as a general purpose protocol for editing Web content
Mismatch with data models that are n't microcontent Lack of support for granular updates to fields of an item Poor support for hierarchy
I have to admit that a lot of my analysis was done on GData because I assumed incorrectly that it is a superset of the Atom Publishing Protocol .
After a closer reading of the fifteenth most recent draft APP specification spurred by the responses to my post by various members of the Atom community it seems clear that the approaches chosen by Google in GData run counter to the recommendations of Atom experts including both authors of the spec .
For problem # 1 , the consensus from Atom experts was that instead of trying to map a distinct concept such as a Facebook user to an Atom entry complete with a long list of proprietary extensions to the atom : entry element , one should instead create a specific data format for that type then treat it as a distinct media type that is linked from atom : entry .
Thus in the Facebook example from my previous post , one would have a distinct user.xml file and a corresponding atom : entry which linked to it for each user of the system .
Contrast this with the use of the gd:ContactSection in an atom : entry for representing a user .
It also seems that the GData solution to the problem of what to put in the elements such as atom : author and atom : summary which are required by the specification but make no sense outside of content / microcontent editing scenarios is to omit them .
It is n't spec compliant but I guess it is easier than putting in nonsensical values to satisfy some notion of a valid feed .
For problem # 2 , a number of folks pointed out that conditional PUT requests using ETags and the If - Match header are actually in the spec .
This was my oversight since I skipped the section since the title " Caching and Entity Tags " did n't imply that it had anything to do with dealing with the lost update problem .
I actually have n't found a production implementation of APP that supports conditional PUTs this should n't be hard to implement for services that require this functionality .
This definitely makes the lost update problem more tractable .
However a model where a client can just say " update the user 's status message to X " still seems more straightforward than one where the client says " get the entire user element " , " update the user 's status message to X on the client " , " replace the user on the server with my version of the user " , and potentially " there is a version mismatch so merge my version of the user with the most recent version of the user from the server and try again " .
The mechanism GData uses for solving the lost update problem is available in the documentation topic on Optimistic concurrency ( versioning ) .
Instead of using ETags and If - Match , GData appends a version number to the URL to which the client publishes the updated atom : entry and then cries foul if the client publishes to a URL with an old version number .
I guess you could consider this a different implementation of conditional PUTs from what is recommended in the most recent version of the APP draft spec .
For problem # 3 , the consensus seemed to be to use a atom : link elements to show hierarchy similar to what has been done in Atom threading extensions .
I do n't question the value of linking and think this is a fine approach for the most part .
However , the fact is that in certain scenarios [ especially high traffic ones ] it is better for the client to be able to make requests like " give me the email with message ID 6789 and all the replies in that thread " than " give me all the emails and I 'll figure out the hierarchy I 'm interested in myself by piecing together link relationships " .
I notice that GData completely punts on representing hierarchy in the MessageKind construct which is intended for use in representing email messages .
Anyway I 've learned my lesson and will treat the Atom Publishing Protocol ( APP ) and GData as separate protocols instead of using them interchangeably in the future .
You all know the slogan : " Guns do n't kill people , people kill people . "
At the Digital Rights Strategies conference in New York City , a similar message could be heard : " DRM does n't anger consumers , content owners abusing DRM anger consumers . "
Few , of course , would argue that the mere existence of DRM is a bad thing .
Locked away in a vault somewhere or trapped in one of those nifty mirrors featured in Superman , DRM can do little harm .
Such assertions are merely academic , of course .
Tools are designed to be used , and DRM is being used to do what it was designed to do : control how consumers interact with content .
But the growing backlash against DRM is causing dissension in the pro-DRM ranks .
Paul Sweeting 's excellent report on the DRS conference records the frustrations of the DRM community at the tactics of the content industry .
They apparently feel that an overzealous content industry is abusing DRM ; this is a bit like Smith & Wesson complaining that bullets can kill .
When DRM proponents start pointing fingers and attempting to separate the theory ( really , the ideology ) from the practice , we have to stop and ask : what 's going on here ?
It appears that players in the DRM ecosystem know the tide is turning against them because DRM is punishing the wrong people , namely the folks who are buying DRM - laden content .
This is bad for their business , because a DRM backlash could harm DRM peddlers .
Then , of course , there 's the hypocrisy .
At a conference convened by the overlords of DRM , Sony vice president Scott Smyers admits that he circumvents the copy protection on DVDs ( CSS ) in order to make backups for personal use .
Apparently Mr. Smyers does n't agree with Hollywood or the Register of Copyrights , both of which argue that " backups " can readily be had in the form of new copies you can buy at the store .
The corporate hypocrisy is obvious : what the corporate parent demands ( DRM that prevents DVD copying ) , even its own employee disregards .
We can't blame him .
Among DRM peddlers , there 's also a bit of jealously because some DRM systems are " successful . "
Take the comments made by Talal Shamoon , CEO of InterTrust ( a company working on interoperable DRM schemes , among other things ) :
" Apple is using encryption to try to do what Ma Bell used to do with the phone network : wall people in , " he said .
" It frustrates consumers and ultimately feeds piracy . "
Such views are nonsense , of course , when you 're trying to pin them on just one proponent of DRM .
Re-read that quote , and replace " Apple " with " DRM . "
It 's every bit as true .
While proponents of universal or interoperable DRM schemes might say that they do n't want to wall people in around any given manufacturer 's products , the " Cask of Amontillado " aspects remain : interested consumers can only utilize DRM'd products on devices that support that DRM system ( interoperable or not ) .
Take the widest , most universal DRM implementation to date : CSS for DVDs .
A properly equipped computer still cannot legally play DVDs in countries like the US if it runs an operating system or carries components not blessed by the " powers that be " ( in this case , the DVD - CCA and friends ) .
Then look at the next - gen version of CSS , known as AACS .
The implementation requirements for AACS are even more stringent , even more exclusive .
If you do n't have a team of engineers available to make your new product work with AACS , then you 're out of luck .
The consumer electronics world is well aware of the devastating effects of DRM on innovation .
Take the comments of Jim Helman , CTO of Hollywood - backed MovieLabs .
Helman says that if he were in the hardware business , he'd be focusing his attention on building a DVD - ripping movie jukebox .
Yet this is something that is currently illegal and scares the DVD - CCA to death .
The same activity that gave birth to the MP3 player and revolutionized the music industry is anathema to the content owners in Hollywood .
MPAA VP Fritz Attaway even suggested that without DRM in place , Hollywood would n't have any other option than to simply not release its movies .
DRM - free is apparently unthinkable at the MPAA , despite an acknowledgment from Attaway that current implementations cause problems for fair use !
The message is , essentially : yes , we know this CSS stuff stomps on fair use , but better that than we release products without encryption .
The DRM backlash is indeed coming , and kudos to these industry players for realizing it .
Heck , the backlash is already here and has been for years .
Now that major players like Apple and even labels like EMI and Universal are starting to realize it , it 's only a matter of time before it turns into a full - scale revolt .
Whether or not there will be a revival of interoperable DRM cure - all theories remains to be seen , but backers have at least figured one thing out : when DRM does what it is designed to do — namely inconvenience and control end user behavior — users bite back .

Gillian Gibbons was teaching at a school in Khartoum
Teacher 's statement
Gillian Gibbons , 54 , from Liverpool , was freed after eight days in custody .
She had been given a 15 - day jail term .
Sudan 's President Omar al - Bashir pardoned her after talks with two British Muslim peers .
In a statement , Mrs Gibbons apologised for " any distress " .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown said he was " delighted " .
Mother - of - two Mrs Gibbons has been released into the care of the British embassy in Khartoum , but her exact location has not been disclosed .
She was released four days after receiving a 15 - day sentence for insulting religion .
Following her release , Foreign Secretary David Miliband said the teacher was " a little overwhelmed " at the attention her case had attracted , but was in " remarkably good spirits " and " elated to be back on her way home " .
Mr Miliband also hailed the " team effort " which led to Mrs Gibbons 's release , praising diplomatic staff and saying that the intervention of Baroness Warsi and Lord Ahmed had been " an important contribution " .
Earlier , a demonstration of about 30 or 40 people was held outside the embassy in Khartoum , with banners protesting about the decision to release her .
' Very sorry '
Mrs Gibbons was arrested on 25 November and jailed on 29 November after allowing her pupils to name a teddy bear Muhammad .
She was arrested after another member of staff at Unity High School complained to the Ministry of Education about the incident in September .
The press office of President al - Bashir announced that he had pardoned Mrs Gibbons following his meeting with Baroness Warsi and Lord Ahmed , and that she had been " released after their mediation " .
TEDDY ROW TEACHER TIMELINE Sept : Gillian Gibbons ' class votes to name a teddy bear Muhammad 25 Nov :
She is arrested for allegedly insulting Islam 's Prophet 27 Nov : Gordon Brown says efforts are being made to release her 28 Nov : Mrs Gibbons is charged with insulting religion and inciting hatred 29 Nov : A Sudanese court finds her guilty of insulting Islam and sentences her to 15 days in prison and deportation 30 Nov : Angry protesters in Khartoum demand a harsher sentence 1 Dec : Two British Muslim peers press Sudanese officials to pardon her 3 Dec : Mrs Gibbons is pardoned by Sudan 's president and freed from prison

In a statement read out by Baroness Warsi , Mrs Gibbons said : " I have great respect for the Islamic religion and would not knowingly offend anyone and I am sorry if I caused any distress .
" I am looking forward to seeing my family and friends but I am very sorry that I will be unable to return to Sudan and work in Unity High School as the teacher of 2X . "
Lord Ahmed thanked the president for granting the pardon and said both he and Baroness Warsi were proud to have been able to help Mrs Gibbons .
" This is a case which is unfortunate , unintentional , innocent misunderstanding , and as British Muslim parliamentarians we , Baroness Warsi and myself , we feel proud that we 've been able to secure Gillian Gibbons 's release . "
Speaking later , Baroness Warsi said that when she and Lord Ahmed had visited Mrs Gibbons in custody , all three had made " lots of Yorkshire jokes " .
All three were brought up in the county .
Asked how she and Lord Ahmed had helped to win freedom for Mrs Gibbons , Baroness Warsi said : " We played very different roles but complementary roles with different negotiation skills which had to be used . "
Efforts applauded
Mr Brown said it was " completely wrong " that Mrs Gibbons had been detained , and described her imprisonment as " completely unacceptable " .
The peers met Sudanese President Omar al - Bashir
He said : " Through the course of Mrs Gibbons 's detention I was glad to see Muslim groups across the UK express strong support for her case .
" I applaud the particular efforts of Lord Ahmed and Baroness Warsi in securing her freedom .
I am also grateful to our officials for all their work behind the scenes . "
Speaking to reporters outside his home in Liverpool , Mrs Gibbons 's son John said he was " very pleased " .
He said : " I 'd like to thank the government for all they have done , the hard work behind the scenes , especially the two peers who went out there .
" Everyone 's been really great .
Obviously it 's a great feeling today , we 're very pleased , we have been under a lot of pressure . "
I have not come across one single Muslim in our country who has supported what has happened
Ibrahim Mogra
Muslim Council of Britain
Reaction in quotes Teacher freed - your views
He said his mother would be " very pleased , although quite embarrassed to be on the news permanently " .
Dr Khalid al - Mubarak , of the Sudanese embassy in London , said he hoped the affair would not damage relations between Sudan and the UK .
" I think this is the correct resolution - pardoned and released early , " he told BBC News .
" The word pardoned also means that the original mistake has been - not forgotten - but behind us now . "
Ibrahim Mogra from the Muslim Council of Britain told BBC News 24 that the whole saga had been very damaging for the image of the Muslim faith .
" Each time we have stories like these , that distort what Islam stands for or misrepresents what the compassion of Muslim law stands for , then we have repercussions and people begin to feel that Islam has no place in modern society ...
" I have not come across one single Muslim in our country who has supported what has happened . ''
President Omar al - Bashir had been under pressure from Sudanese hardliners to ensure Mrs Gibbons served her full sentence .
There had been a protest , and calls for a retrial and for the sentence to be increased .
BBC Islamic affairs analyst Roger Hardy said the row over Mrs Gibbons had strained relations between Britain and Sudan - and , beyond that , between the West and Islam .
And even if intervention by two prominent British Muslims had succeeded in limiting the damage , the fact remained that damage had been done , he added .
There is nothing illegal about such dealings , and Russia is an attractive emerging market .
The country has drawn $ 45 billion in Western capital so far this year .
And as Mr. Shvartsman ’s foray into Silicon Valley , presumably in search of investment opportunities for his funds , showed , Russians are also stepping up their investment abroad of tens of billions of dollars , part of the country ’s windfall from high oil prices .
It could also be argued that the role former members of the intelligence services play in business here is similar to the outsize role the Chinese Army plays in businesses there .
Currently serving security service employees are prohibited from working outside the service , according to Gennadi V. Gudkov , a member of parliament and a former K.G.B. agent .
Only , according to an old Russian axiom , no one ever leaves the service .
Mr. Putin himself said in his 2000 presidential campaign , using a post - 1917 revolution name for K.G.B. precursors , that “ there is no such thing as a former Chekist . ”
In the interview published in the newspaper Kommersant , Mr. Shvartsman described other fund investors as “ not the leadership of the presidential administration , but members of their families . ”
And he boasted that his ties to the secret police helped his company , the FinansGroup , buy businesses in Russia at knock - down prices because business owners , he said , “ know where we come from . ”

Mr. Shvartsman suggested that he had F.S.B. backing for corporate raiding , a term that is often more than just a figure of speech in Russia ’s bare - knuckle business world .
OTTAWA , Nov. 15 — A video recording showing an emotionally wrought immigrant dying after being hit with a police Taser at an airport last month has touched off a fierce debate in Canada on police actions in the case and the rules governing use of the weapon .
The 10 - minute recording , which was widely broadcast Wednesday night , was made last month by another passenger and initially seized by the police .
It shows a Polish immigrant , Robert Dziekanski , being hit just 46 seconds after four members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police arrived to subdue him at the airport in Vancouver , British Columbia .
The recording also supports accounts from witnesses who said the police officers did not appear to be in danger when the weapon was fired at least twice .
Mr. Dziekanski was the 18th person to die since July 2003 after being hit by a Taser in Canada , a country where the weapons may be owned only by police forces .
Amnesty International estimates that in the United States , a country with roughly nine times the population of Canada , 280 people have died after being struck by police Tasers since 2001 .
Tasers can also be used by civilians in many states .
Alex Neve , the secretary general of Amnesty International in Canada , which has called for a suspension of Taser use , said , “ There is a very good likelihood that the Taser was used well before the situation called for it . ”
Wingnuttia is " fact - checking " again , hooray .
This time we go from Insty to Steyn to , naturally enough , some Freeper .
And all the idiots start crowing about Citizen Journalism and so forth , blah blah blah world without end .
[ UPDATE : A good example :
A Freeper took the trouble to investigate the 12 - year - old who gave the Democrats ' weekly radio address last week , and whose family ostensibly is too poor to pay for medical insurance , and therefore wants to use your money instead .
The results are hilarious .
I 'll say !
Carry on ...]
This is one of the stories they 're sniveling about ; here 's the other .
And the results of the freepy investigations ?
Graeme Frost , who gave the democrat rebuttal to George Bush ’s reasons for vetoing the SCHIP Bill , is a middle school student at the exclusive $ 20,000 per year Park School in Baltimore , MD .
Graeme was in a severe car accident three years ago , and received care paid for by the government program known as SCHIP -( State Children 's Health Insurance Program )
" I was in a coma for a week and could n't eat or stand up or even talk .
My sister was even worse , " Graeme wrote .
" My parents work really hard and always make sure my sister and I have everything we need , but we can't afford private health insurance . " [ their emphasis ]
His sister Gemma , also severely injured in the accident , attended the same school prior to the accident meaning the family was able to come up with nearly $ 40,000 per year for tuition for these 2 grade schoolers .
Wow , that sure sounds like a lot of money .
Especially when we read down a bit and find out that the family 's income is only $ 45,000 .
Presumably the Frosts are making the remaining $ 5,000 go a long way in meeting their remaining expenses .
Or not .
The always eagle - eyed Don Surber speculates " they may be subsidized . "
Ya think ?
Hmmm , could be .
After all , the freeper 's iron - clad proof that they 're paying 40 K a year for private school tuition contains a link to the school 's payment information page , which does indeed explain what tuition costs ... and which also explains their financial assistance program :
Park enrolls students based on their talents and capabilities .
Families who are unable to meet the full cost of tuition may apply for the Financial Assistance Program , which supplements tuition payments .
Financial assistance does not need to be repaid .
In 2007 , 18 % of Park students in grades 1 - 12 received over $ 2 million in financial assistance that ranged from $ 1,000 per year to full tuition .
Tuition remission for children of our faculty brings that total to 25 % of the student body .
Because each family 's situation is unique , it is impossible to predict the amount of funding awarded based solely on income .
For example , the number of children attending tuition - charging institutions is an important factor .
As a guide , families with incomes up to $ 160,000 received financial assistance during this past school year .
If the school is giving assistance to families making $ 160 K , they are offering pretty substantial assistance to those making $ 45 K .
I 'm just guessing here , but it sure does seem plausible !
Adding to the fun , the freep includes this nugget :
Confirmation both attended Park found here using edit - " find on this page " - Gemma .
It will take you to an article in the schools newspaper about a fundraiser for Gemma class of 16 , and Graeme class of 13 .
Needing a fundraiser thrown for them sure is good evidence of their impressive wealth .
And it sure is classy to see this evidence of a personal tragedy introduced as evidence against them .
Moving on .
What the article does not mention is that Halsey Frost has owned his own company " Frostworks " , since this marriage announcement in the NY Times in 1992 so he chooses to not give himself insurance .
He also employed his wife as " bookkeeper and operations management " prior to her recent 2007 hire at the " medical publishing firm " .
As her employer , he apparently denied her health insurance as well .
Maybe because it was too expensive ?
His company , Frostworks , is located at 3701 E BALTIMORE ST .
A building that was purchased for $ 160,000 in 1999 .
The buildings owner is listed as DIVERSIFIED INDUSTRIAL DESIGN CENTER , LLC whose mailing address is listed as 104 S Collington Ave which is the Frost 's home .
Omigod !
So ?
Is the implication here that he paid $ 160 K out of pocket for his business property ?
Perhaps he had this wacky thing known as " financing , " and that he 's able to pay the nut for the financing out of the proceeds of his business , and then after he 's paid all his other business expenses , he takes home a modest personal income ?
SHOCKING behavior , I tell you .
But wait , it gets worse :
The current market value of their improved 3,040 SF home at 104 S Collington
Ave is unknown but 113 S COLLINGTON AVE , also an end unit , sold for $ 485,000 this past March and it was only 2,060 SF .
A photo taken in the family 's kitchen shows what appears to be a recent remodeling job with granite counter tops and glass front cabinets
My Lord !
Not glass - front cabinets !
What a fop !
Or , the guy 's a woodworker who owns his own woodworking business , who probably did the work himself using materials he was able to get himself at a very reasonable price ?
The upshot is that this is a guy with a family of 6 : is it a mystery why he wants to own a 3,000 - ft house ?
is it wrong of him to drive , gasp , an SUV ( for 4 kids and a mom and dad ) ?
And to do all this on $ 45 K -- sounds like he ' and his wife are pretty hard working , actually , paying their own way -- until their kids get into a horrible car accident and need incredibly expensive medical care .
And what does the freeper say about him ?
One has to wonder that if time and money can be found to remodel a home , send kids to exclusive private schools , purchase commercial property and run your own business ... maybe money can be found for other things ... maybe Dad should drop his woodworking hobby and get a real job that offers health insurance rather than making people like me ( also with 4 kids in a 600sf smaller house and tuition $ 16,000 less per kid and no commercial property ownership ) pay for it in my taxes .
That 's the spirit !
People who own their own small businesses are freeloaders .
And our pal Surber ?
This business of “ affordable insurance ” is socialistic .
The Frosts found an “ affordable ” business building and an “ affordable ” 3,000 - square foot house and an “ affordable ” private school .
Why could n’t these yuppies afford to cover their own damned kids ?
Because healthcare is hellishly expensive .
And yes , guys who own their own small businesses and clear 45 K are " yuppies . "
Don Surber is quite the specimen .
And then we have this :
$ 1200 per month for a family of 6 in Baltimore .
Really ?
What are they smoking ?
A check of a quote engine for zip code 21250 ( Baltimore ) finds a plan for $ 641 with a $ 0 deductible and $ 20 doc copays .
Adding a deductible of $ 750 ( does not apply to doc visits ) drops the premium to $ 452 .
That 's almost a third of the price quoted in the article .
Does n't anyone bother to check the facts ?
Ah , a quote engine .
One that presumably tells us everything about the family and their existing medical conditions that might affect what they would pay for health insurance .
Amazing what you can find out online these days .
Yes , clearly the Frosts are drug abusers .
That 's a perfectly reasonable inference .
There 's something pretty mean - spirited about the wingnut Citizen Journalists here : they do n't know a thing about this family , really , but are trying to portray them as " yuppie " freeloaders while screeching their jackass heads off about " socialism . "
The point is , healthcare costs can make it impossible for hardworking middle class families to have a decent life .
This is a problem .
SCHIP expansion would help to solve it at a moderate cost .
Greater Wingnuttia may think they 've struck another blow for Freedom , or whatever , but they 're pretty far out there on this .
They just look like a pack of assholes .
The International Organization for Standardization has voted against a proposal to fast - track Microsoft 's Office Open XML format as an international standard .
Here 's how the vote went : all 41 of the of the countries that had worked on the proposal participated in the vote .
There were 17 " yes " votes , 15 " no " votes , and 9 abstentions .
Without counting the abstentions , that works out to 53.12 percent approval , far short of the two - thirds majority needed .
Of the 87 national standards bodies voting , 18 voted against OOXML , leaving OOXML just shy of the 75 percent threshold for that vote .
The run up to the vote had been long and contentious , with allegations that Microsoft had tried to stack the vote in its favor aired last week .
In Sweden , 20 new companies joined the Swedish Standards Institute after receiving assurances from the software giant that they would receive " market assistance " and " extra support in the form of Microsoft resources " for joining and voting to approve OOXML .
There have also been arguments against OOXML based on the format 's technical merits .
Linux Foundation initiative manager John Cherry said last week that there were still a number of technical issues with the format that have yet to be addressed .
Microsoft is putting a positive spin on the results , noting that 74 percent of the member countries supported OOXML 's ratification .
The company notes that the standardized Open Document Format used in OpenOffice.org 's office suite had a similar level of support at the same stage of development and that it expects OOXML to gain approval at the next round of voting .
" We are extremely delighted to see that 51 ISO members , representing 74 percent of the qualified votes , have already voiced their support for ISO ratification of Open XML , and that many others have indicated they will support ratification once their comments are resolved in the next phase of the ISO process , " said Tom Robertson , general manager for Interoperability and Standards at Microsoft in a statement .
" The high quality of the Open XML format will be improved as a result of this process , and we take seriously our role in working within the Ecma technical committee to address the comments received . "
With the vote going against Microsoft , the proposed standard for OOXML will have to revised in order to take into account the " with comments " votes .
This could entail changes to the file format itself , which would then require updates to Office 2007 in order to make it fully compliant with any revisions to the OOXML format .
There will be a week - long Ballot Resolution Meeting held in February or March of 2008 where further work on the standard will take place .
Another vote on OOXML will then be held at the end of the meeting .

We have an animal attraction .
If I happen to want some good sex , I 'll call you .
Sometimes you 're free , sometimes not .
Sometimes you call me .
Sometimes I 'm free , sometimes I 'm not .
You are good in bed ; we are good in bed together .
The only irritating thing in this otherwise perfect arrangement is that big fat ego of yours .
While you have made it clear that you do not want a relationship , you reeeeealllly do n't seem to buy the fact that I 'm not emotionally attached to you .
You are puzzled that I do n't call you more often , and even more shocked when I do n't want to spend the whole night together .
Get over it .
A few reasons why this is : 1. I CONSIDER YOU A PIECE OF MEAT .
Know how you just want to fuck ?
Yep , that 's right ... I just want to fuck too .
I know you think you are god 's gift and the smartest person alive , but you are not .
The bonus of a booty call ?
Less talking .
More fucking .
2 . Personally , I do n't really like you .
You are n't that interesting , or very nice .
You are good looking and have good * assets * .
Perfect for what I need you for .
Done deal .
2 . I like my space .
I like it better with only me in it .3 .
My bed is fucking awesome , and I do n't like to share .
Especially with someone who snores , steals the covers , and sweats profusely .
Do n't get me wrong - a little sleep sweat is fine .
Enough sweat to cover us both AND make me think you pissed on the sheets ?
Not acceptable .
Please exit the premises when activities have come to a full and complete stop .
FYI - If I wanted a relationship , I would stop sleeping with you and find someone I can actually tolerate outside of the bedroom .
Sincerely , Your fuck buddy
Throughout time , scientist of one school or another have contributed great innovations to the world of medicine , alchemy , chemistry , physics , and more .
Most of these gifts have been exceedingly useful and set the stage for even greater advances in the field .
However , the coin has another side … a far more sinister and selfish side that somehow twists the very minds of the scientists making them want to do more harm than help .
Granted , said scientific minds often believe that the evils that they are ultimately performing are doing good , and this is what truly makes these individuals mad .
Here are ten of the most diabolical scientific minds in history .
10 . Paracelsus 1493 -1541
Switzerland , Paracelsus ’ contributions to toxicology were based heavily in astrology and he is quite well known for offering the community a wide array of useful ideas and innovations .
However , for all of his use , he also thought he might be able to create homunculi , or small humans , who stood no more than a foot or so hight and performed actions very similar to Golems .
His are said to have run away after turning on their master .
The homunculus creation used bits of people including semen and hair .
9. Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer 1904 - 1967
Heading up the Manhattan Project , the very group responsible for the creation and use of the atomic bomb , Dr. Oppenheimer was a brilliant nuclear physicist .
Oppenheimer said he was “ a member of just about every Communist Front organization on the West Coast , ” a subscriber to the People ’s World , a Communist Party organ , and , he testified , “ I was associated with the Communist movement . ”
He claimed to be horrified by the result of the project ’s work .
A co-worker , Victor Weisskopf said :
He did not direct from the head office .
He was intellectually and even physically present at each decisive step .
He was present in the laboratory or in the seminar rooms , when a new effect was measured , when a new idea was conceived .
It was not that he contributed so many ideas or suggestions ; he did so sometimes , but his main influence came from something else .
It was his continuous and intense presence , which produced a sense of direct participation in all of us ; it created that unique atmosphere of enthusiasm and challenge that pervaded the place throughout its time .
8. Alfred Nobel
1833-1897
Discovering the use of nitroglycerine in his invention of dynamite , Nobel gave the world its first mass - produced use of deadly explosives .
Killing first his own brother Emil and several others in a factory accident , the future death toll from his creation will number in the hundreds of thousands .
Eventually he used his significant earned wealth to fund the yearly Nobel Prize to distract people from his invention , after reading his own obituary ( mistakenly printed as he was not actually dead ) which called him the “ Merchant of Death ” .
7. Trofim Lysenko
While his experiments did not result in mass deaths , Lysenko needs to be on this list for his utter dishonesty in the field of Science that ultimately set the Soviet Union back decades in research .
Lysenko was director of the Institute of Genetics and specialized in agricultural research .
Lysenko ’s habit was to report only successes .
His results were based on extremely small samples , inaccurate records , and the almost total absence of control groups .
There can be no doubt that there has never been such an abuse of the name of science as that of Lysenko .
Here is a quote :
“ In order to obtain a certain result , You must want to obtain precisely that result ; if you want to obtain a certain result , you will obtain it ….
I need only such people as will obtain the results I need . ”
Lysenko
6. Dr. Jack Kevorkian 1928
Kevorkian is most noted for publicly championing a terminal patient ’s right to die via physician - assisted suicide and claims to have assisted at least 130 patients to that end .
Imprisoned in 1999 , he served eight years out of his 10 - to - 25 - year prison sentence for second - degree murder in the 1998 poisoning of Thomas Youk , 52 , of Oakland County , Michigan .
The judge that convicted him said :
“ You were on bond to another judge when you committed this offense , you were not licensed to practice medicine when you committed this offense and you had n’t been licensed for eight years .
And you had the audacity to go on national television , show the world what you did and dare the legal system to stop you .
Well , sir , consider yourself stopped . ”
Regardless of your views on euthanasia , the fact remains that Kevorkian swore an oath to save lives , not to take them .
5. Members of the Tuskegee Study
For forty years between 1932 and 1972 , the U.S. Public Health Service ( PHS ) conducted an experiment on 399 black men ( mostly impoverished and poorly educated share - croppers ) in the late stages of syphilis .
The essence was to gather data on the course of the disease when left untreated .
The researchers understood from the outset that test subjects would provide most of their useful information in the form of autopsies , so great pains were taken to insure that subjects did n’t obtain medical care elsewhere .
The program came to an abrupt halt in 1972 when its existence was made public by the Washington Star .
It would be easy to dismiss this as a case of simple racism by a public institution , but that is not the case :
The project was enthusiastically hosted by the Tuskeegee Institute , a historically black college , and many key researchers and staff on the project were , themselves , black .
4. Johann Konrad Dippel 1673 - 1734
Dippel was born at Castle Frankenstein and is rumored to be the inspiration for Shelley ’s vile doctor .
This is disputable , but what is n’t is the fact that this brilliant doctor performed vivisections on many recipients .
Working with nitroglycerin he destroyed a tower , but also detected the medicinal use of it .
It is rumored that he also preformed gruesome experiments within this tower with so called “ cadavers ” .
Though the actual details of the experiments have never been truly confirmed it is rumored that he attempted to transfer the soul of one cadaver into another .
Interestingly , his greatest contribution to the world was his animal oil ( Dippel ’s oil : a nitrogenous by - product of the destructive distillation manufacture of bone char ) commonly known as a base product in Prussian blue – the low cost blue dye that is used to this day by artists ; previously , blue dies were extremely expensive to create .
3. Dr. Sigmund Rascher 1909 - 1945
Rascher was a despicable scientist during the Nazi use of concentration camps during WWII .
Rascher ’s infamous medical experiments at the Dachau concentration camp included hypothermia research in which three hundred test subjects were used against their will ( one third of them perished ) , in high - altitude , malaria and medication experiments .
At Dachau , Rascher also developed the standard cyanide capsules , which could be easily bitten through , either deliberately or accidentally .
Ironically , this became the means by which Himmler ( Rascher ’s friend ) committed suicide .
2. Dr. Joseph Mengele 1911 - 1979
Mengele gained notoriety chiefly for being one of the SS physicians who supervised the selection of arriving transports of prisoners , determining who was to be killed and who was to become a forced laborer , and for performing human experiments on camp inmates , amongst whom Mengele was known as the Angel of Death .
On several occasions he killed subjects simply to be able to dissect them afterwards .
1. Shir ? Ishii 1892 -1959
Ishii was a microbiologist and the lieutenant general of Unit 731 , a biological warfare unit of the Imperial Japanese Army during the Second Sino - Japanese War .
He was born in the former Shibayama Village of Sanbu District in Chiba Prefecture , and studied medicine at Kyoto Imperial University .
In 1932 , he began his preliminary experiments in biological warfare as a secret project for the Japanese military .
In 1936 , Unit 731 was formed .
Ishii built a huge compound — more than 150 buildings over six square kilometers — outside the city of Harbin , China .
Some of the numerous atrocities committed by Ishii and others under his command in Unit 731 include : vivisection of living people ( including pregnant women who were impregnated by the doctors ) , prisoners had limbs amputated and reattached to other parts of their body , some prisoners had parts of their bodies frozen and thawed to study the resulting untreated gangrene .
Humans were also used as living test cases for grenades and flame throwers .
Prisoners were injected with inoculations of disease , disguised as vaccinations , to study their effects .
To study the effects of untreated venereal diseases , male and female prisoners were deliberately infected with syphilis and gonorrhea via rape , then studied .
A complete list of these horrors can be found here .
Having been granted immunity by the American Occupation Authorities at the end of the war , Ishii never spent any time in jail for his crimes and died at the age of 67 of throat cancer .
Bonus : Daedalus
Granted he is a character of legend , but Daedalus deserves a place on any list of this type because he is probably the first recorded mad / evil scientist .
Daedalus is often credited with inventing the very first labyrinth in which he imprisoned the step - son of King Minos , a minotaur .
He is also , sadly , charged with killing his own son , though inadvertently , by creating Icarus and himself a set of wings used to escape his very own labyrinth .
Icarus did n’t heed his father ’s warnings about flying too close to the sun , thus melting his wings and plummeting to the earth .

Science and technology reporter , BBC News
The silicon industry has already introduced new materials such as Hafnium
The advances have underpinned everything from the rise of mobile phones to digital photography and portable music players .
Chip - makers have been able to deliver many of these advances by shrinking the components on a chip .
By making these building blocks , such as transistors , smaller they have become faster and firms have been able to pack more of them into the same area .
But according to many industry insiders this miniaturisation cannot continue forever .
MOORE'S LAW
The number of transistors it is possible to squeeze in to a chip for a fixed cost doubles every two years First outlined by Gordon Moore , co-founder of Intel Published in Electronics Magazine on 19 April , 1965
" The consensus in the industry is that we can do that shrink for about another ten years and then after that we have to figure out new ways to bring higher capability to our chips , " said Professor Stanley Williams of Hewlett Packard .
Even Gordon Moore , the founder of Intel and the man that gave his name to the law that dictates the industry 's progression , admits that it can only go on for a few more years .
" Moore 's Law should continue for at least another decade , " he recently told the BBC News website .
" That 's about as far as I can see . "
Tiny tubes
As a result , researchers around the world are engaged in efforts to allow the industry to continue delivering the advances that computer users have come to expect .
Key areas include advanced fabrication techniques , building new components and finding new materials to augment silicon .
Already new materials are creeping into modern chips .
As components have shrunk critical elements of the transistors , known as gate dielectrics , do not perform as well allowing currents passing through the transistors to leak , reducing the effectiveness of the chip .
To overcome this , companies have replaced the gate dielectrics , previously made from silicon dioxide , with an oxide based on the metal hafnium .
The material 's development and integration into working components has been described by Dr Moore as " the biggest change in transistor technology " since the late 1960s .
But IBM researchers are working on materials that they believe offer even bigger advances .
" Carbon nanotubes are a step beyond [ hafnium ] , " explained Dr Phaedon Avouris of the company .
' Superior ' design
CARBON NANOTUBES
Sheets of carbon atoms folded into a cylinder Unusual strength and electrical properties Promise to revolutionise electronics , computers , chemistry and materials science
" They are a more drastic change but still preserve the basic architecture of field effect transistors . "
These transistors are the basic building blocks of most silicon chips .
Dr Avouris believes they can be used to replace a critical element of the chip , known as the channel .
Today this is commonly made of silicon and is the area of the transistor through which electrons flow .
Chip makers are constantly battling to make the channel length in transistors smaller and smaller , to increase the performance of the devices .
Carbon nanotube 's small size and " superior " electrical properties should be able to deliver this , said Dr Avouris .
Crucially , he also believes the molecules can be integrated with traditional silicon manufacturing processes , meaning the technology would more likely be accepted by an industry that has spent billions perfecting manufacturing techniques .
The team have already shown off working transistors and are currently working on optimising their production and integration into working devices .
Tiny improvement
Professor Williams , at Hewlett Packard is also working on technology that could be incorporated into the future generations of chips .
As well as exploring optical computing - using particles of light instead of electrons to significantly increase the speed of today 's computers - he is building new electronic components for chips called memristors .
" Now we have this type of device we have a broader palette with which to paint our circuits , " said Professor Williams .
Professor Williams and his team have shown that by putting two of these devices together - a configuration called a crossbar latch - it could do the job of a transistor .
" A cross bar latch has the type of functionality you want from a transistor but it 's working with very different physics , " he explained .
Crucially , these devices can also be made much smaller than a transistor .
" And as they get smaller they get better , " he said .
Professor Williams and his team are currently making prototype hybrid circuits - built of memristors and transistors - in a fabrication plant in North America .
" We want to keep the functional equivalent of Moore 's Law going for many decades into the future , " said Professor Williams .
It 's no secret that Michael " Transformers " Bay prefers his high definition optical discs in the Blu variety , but what we did n't know was how convinced the man is that the whole format war is nothing but a stalling tactic , with Microsoft pulling all the strings .
Responding to a commenter angry over Paramount 's decision to burn Optimus and friends onto HD DVD only , Bay claims to have the inside track on the " corporate politics " at play here , suggesting that " Microsoft wants both formats to fail so they can be heroes and make the world move to digital downloads . "
He goes on to claim that Redmond has only been financially backing HD DVD over " superior Blu-ray " to create " confusion in the market " until such time as high def digital downloading goes prime time .
In other words , if you believe Bay , Microsoft is backing a known loser in order to prolong a war it does n't want anyone to win .
Pretty wild theory , if you ask us -- hey , this guy should make movies .

A giant fossilized claw discovered in Germany belonged to an ancient sea scorpion that wasmuch bigger than the average man , an international team of geologists and archaeologists reported Tuesday .
A computer - generated image shows a size comparison between a human and an ancient sea scorpion .
( ( University of Bristol / Associated Press ) )
The 46 - centimetre - long claw was discovered by report co-author Markus Poschmann , from Germany , in a quarry near Pruem , a city about 200 kilometres east of Frankfurt .
The researchers said the scorpion lived between 460 and 255 million years ago and would have been among the top predators in its environment , feeding on early vertebrates and smaller arthropods .
The report saidthe creature likely only lived in the water because with the construction of its body , " it is hardly imaginable how such a huge arthropod could effectively walk on land . "
In a report in the Royal Society 's journal Biology Letters , the team said the claw indicates that sea scorpion Jaekelopterus rhenania was almost 2.5 metres long , making it the largest arthropod — an animal with a segmented body , jointed limbs and a hard exoskeleton — ever found .
In the report , the authors said the scorpion exceeds previous size records for arthropods by almost half a metre .
The fossil , found in a 390 - million - year - old rock , suggests that spiders , insects , crabs and similar creatures were much larger in the past than previously thought , the researchers said .
This claw belonged to a giant sea scorpion , estimated to be 2.5 metres long .
( ( Markus Poschmann ) )
" This is an amazing discovery .
We have known for some time that the fossil record yields monster millipedes , super - sized scorpions , colossal cockroaches , and jumbo dragonflies , but we never realized , until now , just how big some of these ancient creepy - crawlies were , " said co-author Dr. Simon Braddy from the University of Bristol .
Some geologists believe that the giant arthropod evolved due to high oxygen levels , while others argue that they evolved in an " arms race " alongside their prey , the early armoured fish .
The personal website of Terrill Dent , a software developer in Waterloo Ontario .
AquaDom , located inside Berlin ’s Radisson SAS hotel , is touted as the world ’s largest cylindrical fish aquarium .
It stands 82 - feet tall , and houses 2600 fish of 56 species .
Unlike other fish aquariums , this one has a built - in elevator .

Washington Post details Gonzales 's ' decade of dishonesty '
Nick Juliano
Published : Monday July 30 , 2007
Print This Email This Attorney General helped cover up Bush drunken driving conviction Alberto Gonzales 's difficult relationship with the truth has led to calls for a special prosecutor to investigate claims that the attorney general perjured himself during Senate testimony .
But as the Washington Post points out Monday , Gonzales and honesty have had a shaky relationship stretching back more than a decade .
" Whether Gonzales has deliberately told untruths or is merely hampered by his memory has been the subject of intense debate among members of Congress , legal scholars and others who have watched him over the years , " report the Post 's Dan Eggen and Amy Goldstein .
" Some regard his verbal difficulties as a strategic ploy on behalf of a president to whom he owes his career ; others see a public official overwhelmed by the magnitude of his responsibilities . "
Gonzales 's apparent willingness to dissemble in order to protect himself or President Bush stretches back to at least 1996 , when he intervened to prevent then - Gov .
Bush from serving jury duty in Texas , the Post notes .
Not until its second - to - last paragraph , however , does the Post article remind readers that by not serving jury duty in the drunken driving case Bush was able to keep his own drunken driving conviction a secret for several more years .
" He 's a slippery fellow , and I think so intentionally , " University of Texas public affairs professor Richard L. Schott told the Post .
" He 's trying to keep the president 's secrets and to be a team player , even if it means prevaricating or forgetting convenient things . "
Questions about Gonzales willingness to protect Bush in relation to the drunken driving case were first raised last year by Newsweek investigative reporter Michael Isikoff .
If Bush had served on the jury he would have had to reveal his own past conviction , but Gonzales convinced the defense attorney to ask that Bush be kept from the jury on the grounds that he may be called on to pardon the defendant .
The Post outlines Gonzales 's recently disputed testimony regarding the Bush Administration 's warrantless wiretapping program , which has led four senators to request a special prosecutor 's investigation , and his involvement in last year 's dismissal of nine US Attorneys .
Schott told the Post that Gonzales ' " almost subconscious bond of loyalty " to Bush might be behind his dissembling .
" It 's obvious that Gonzales owes Bush his career , " Schott said .
" Part of his behavior comes from this gratitude and extreme loyalty to Bush . "
Testifying in April about the US Attorney firings , Gonzales said more than 60 times that he could not remember events or facts related to the dismissals , including a high - level meeting in his office when the firings were approved .
Gonzales has few friends left in the Capitol , on either side of the aisle .
Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham ( SC ) , Arlen Specter ( PA ) and Jeff Sessions ( AL ) all scolded Gonzales when he testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week .
" The grilling he 's enduring right now is beyond anything he had ever experienced in his life .
He was ill prepared for it , " Bill Minutaglio , who has written biographies of Gonzales and Bush , told the Post .
Minutaglio notes that Gonzales kept a low profile when he worked for Bush in Texas .
The attorney general is facing accusations of perjury over his testimony regarding the National Security Agencies wiretap program , referred to by administration officials as the Terrorist Surveillance Program .
Gonzales testified that there was no " serious disagreement " about the program , and he claimed that his bizarre late - night visit to then Attorney General John Ashcroft 's hospital bed focused on " other intelligence activities . "
Both claims were undercut last week when FBI Director Robert S. Mueller testified that the NSA program was subject to fierce debate and was discussed at Ashcroft 's bedside .
The New York Times on Sunday reported that Gonzales was referring to data - mining , not wiretapping , aspects of the program in his testimony .
The " narrowly crafted " and " legalistic " answers Gonzales gave in congressional testimony were technically correct , his defenders argue , and may save him from prosecution .

Here is a brief guide to some unfortunate explosions of a particular type .
The details sit quietly in back issues of medical journals .
Only occasionally does anyone come to see them .
The visitor is , in most cases , either a doctor in sudden need of information or a scholar in search of violent titillation .

Finally tonight , as promised , a Special Comment on the meaning of the story of former U.S. Acting Assistant Attorney General Daniel Levin .
It is a fact startling in its cynical simplicity and it requires cynical and simple words to be properly expressed :
The presidency of George W. Bush has now devolved into a criminal conspiracy to cover the ass of George W. Bush .
All the petulancy , all the childish threats , all the blank - stare stupidity ;
All the invocations of World War Three , all the sophistic questions about which terrorist attacks we wanted him not to stop , all the phony secrets ; all the claims of executive privilege , all the stumbling tap - dancing of his nominees , all the verbal flatulence of his apologists …
All of it is now — after one revelation last week — transparently clear for what it is : the pathetic and desperate manipulation of the government , the re-focusing of our entire nation , towards keeping this mock president , and this unstable vice president , and this departed wildly self - over - rating Attorney General — and the others — from potential prosecution for having approved or ordered the illegal torture of prisoners being held in the name of this country .
“ Waterboarding is torture , ” Daniel Levin was to write .
Daniel Levin was no theorist and no protestor .
He was no troublemaking politician .
He was no table - pounding commentator .
Daniel Levin was an astonishingly patriotic American , and a brave man .
Brave not just with words or with stances — even in a dark time when that kind of bravery can usually be scared — or bought — off .
Charged — as you heard in the story from ABC News last Friday — with assessing the relative legality of the various nightmares in the Pandora ’s box that is the Orwell - worthy euphemism “ Enhanced Interrogation , ” Mr. Levin decided that the simplest , and the most honest , way to evaluate them … was to have them enacted upon himself .
Daniel Levin took himself to a military base and let himself be water - boarded .
Mr. Bush — ever done anything that personally courageous ?
Perhaps when you ’ve gone to Walter Reed and teared up over the maimed servicemen ?
And then gone back to the White House and determined that there would be more maimed servicemen ?
Has it been that kind of personal courage , Mr. Bush , when you ’ve spoken of American victims and the triumph of freedom and the sacrifice of your own popularity for the sake of our safety ?
And then permitted others to fire or discredit or destroy anybody who disagreed with you — whether they were your own Generals , or… Max Cleland , or… Joe Wilson and Valerie Plame … or Daniel Levin ?
Daniel Levin should have a statue in his honor in Washington right now .
Instead , he was forced out as Acting Assistant Attorney General , nearly three years ago , because he had the guts to do what George Bush could n’t do in a million years : actually put himself at risk for the sake of his country , for the sake of what is right .
And they water - boarded him and he wrote that even though he knew those doing it meant him no harm , and he knew they would rescue him at the instant of the slightest distress , and he knew he would not die — still , with all that reassurance , he could not stop the terror screaming from inside of him , could not quell the horror , could not convince that which is at the core of each of us — the entity who exists behind all the embellishments we strap to ourselves , like purpose and name and family and love — he could not convince his being … that he was n’t drowning .
Water - boarding , he said , is torture .
Legally , it is torture !
Practically , it is torture !
Ethically , it is torture !
And he wrote it down .
Wrote it down somewhere , where it could be contrasted with the words of this country ’s 43rd President : “ The United States of America does not torture . ”
Made you into a liar , Mr. Bush .
Made you into , if anybody had the guts to pursue it , a criminal , Mr. Bush .
Water - boarding had already been used on Khalid Sheik Mohammed and a couple of other men none of us really care about — except , Sir , for the one detail you ’d forgotten — that there are rules , and even if we just make up these rules , this country observes them anyway , because we ’re Americans , sir , and we ’re better than that .
We ’re better than you .
And the man your Justice Department selected to decide whether or not water - boarding was torture , had decided , and not in some phony academic fashion , nor while wearing the Walter Mitty poseur attire of flight - suit and helmet .
He had put his money , Mr. Bush , where your mouth was .
So , your sleazy sycophantic henchman Mr. Gonzales had him append an asterisk suggesting his black - and - white answer was n’t black - and - white , that there might have been a quasi- legal way of torturing people , maybe with an absolute time limit and a physician entitled to stop it , maybe , if your administration had ever bothered to set any rules or any guidelines …
And then when your people realized that even that was too dangerous , Daniel Levin was branded “ too independent ” and “ someone who could ( not ) be counted on . ”
In other words , Mr. Bush , somebody you could n’t count on to lie for you .
So , Levin was fired .
Because if it ever got out what he ’d concluded , and the lengths to which he went , to validate that conclusion , anybody who had sanctioned water - boarding , and who - knows - what - else … anybody — you yourself , sir — you would have been screwed .
And screwed you are .
It ca n’t be coincidence that the story of Daniel Levin should emerge from the black hole of this secret society of a presidency just at the conclusion of the unhappy saga of the newest Attorney General Nominee .
Another patriot somewhere , listened as Judge Mukasey mumbled like he ’d never heard of water - boarding , and refuse to answer in words that which Daniel Levin answered on a water - board somewhere in Maryland or Virginia three years ago .
And this someone also heard George Bush say “ The United States of America does not torture ” and realized either he was lying or this was n’t the United States of America any more , and either way , he needed to do something about it .
Not in the way Levin needed to do something about it , but in a brave way nonetheless .
We have United States Senators who need to do something about it , too .
Chairman Leahy of the Judiciary Committee has seen this for what it is and said “ enough . ”
Senator Schumer has seen it , reportedly , as some kind of puzzle piece in the New York political patronage system and he has failed .
What Senator Feinstein has seen , to justify joining Schumer in rubber - stamping Mukasey , I can not guess .
It is obvious that both those Senators should look to the meaning of the story of Daniel Levin and recant their support for Mukasey ’s confirmation .
And they should look into their own committee ’s history and recall that in 1973 , their predecessors were able to wring even from Richard Nixon , a guarantee of a Special Prosecutor ( ultimately a Special Prosecutor of Richard Nixon ! ) , in exchange for their approval of his new Attorney General , Elliott Richardson .
If they could get that out of Nixon , you — before you confirm the President ’s latest human echo tomorrow — you better be able to get a “ yes ” or a “ no ” out of Michael Mukasey .
Ideally , you should lock this government down financially until a special prosecutor is appointed — or fifty of them — but I ’m not holding my breath .
The “ yes ” or the “ no ” on water - boarding will have to suffice .
Because , remember if you ca n’t get it , or you wo n’t with the time between tonight and the next presidential election likely to be the longest year of our lives , you are leaving this country , and all of us , to the water - boards — symbolic and otherwise — of George W. Bush .
Ultimately , Mr. Bush , the real question is n’t who approved the water - boarding of this fiend Khalid Sheik Mohammed and two others .
It is : why were they water - boarded ?
Study after study for generation after generation , sir , has confirmed that torture gets people to talk , torture gets people to plead , torture gets people to break , but torture does not get them to tell the truth .
Of course , Mr. Bush , this is n’t a problem if you do n’t care if the terrorist plots they tell you about , are the truth or just something to stop the tormentors from drowning them .
If , say , a President simply needed a constant supply of terrorist threats to keep a country scared …
If , say , he needed phony plots to play hero during , and to boast about interrupting , and to use to distract people from the threat he did n’t interrupt …
If , say , he realized that even terrorized people still need good ghost stories before they will let a President pillage the Constitution …
Well , heck , Mr. Bush , who better to dream them up for you … than an actual terrorist ?
He ’ll tell you every thing he ever fantasized doing , in his most horrific of daydreams — his equivalent of the day you “ flew ” onto the deck of the Lincoln to explain you ’d won in Iraq .
Now if that ’s what this is all about — you tortured not because you ’re so stupid you think torture produces confession — but you tortured because you ’re smart enough to know it produces really authentic - sounding fiction — well , then you ’re going to need all the lawyers you can find because that crime would n’t just mean impeachment , would it , sir ?
That crime would mean George W. Bush is going to prison .
Thus the master tumblers turn , and the lock yields , and the hidden explanations can all be perceived , in their exact proportions , in their exact progressions .
Daniel Levin ’s eminently practical , eminently logical , eminently patriotic way of testing the legality of waterboarding has to vanish — and him , with it .
Thus Alberto Gonzales has to use that brain that sounds like an old car trying to start on a freezing morning , to undo eight centuries of the forward march of law and government .
Thus Dick Cheney , has to ridiculously assert that confirming we do or do not use any particular interrogation technique , would somehow help the terrorists .
Thus Michael Mukasey , on the eve of the vote that will make him the high priest of the law of this land , cannot and must not answer a question , nor even hint that he has thought about a question , which merely concerns the theoretical definition of water - boarding as torture .
Because , Mr. Bush , in the seven years of your nightmare presidency , this whole string of events has been transformed from its beginning as the most neglectful protection ever , of the lives and safety of the American people into the most efficient and cynical exploitation of tragedy for political gain in this country ’s history .
And , then , to the giddying prospect that you could do what the military fanatics did in Japan in the 1930 ’s and re-make a nation into a fascist state so efficient and so self - sustaining , that the fascism would be nearly invisible .
But at last this frightful plan is ending with an unexpected crash , the shocking reality that no matter how thoroughly you might try to extinguish them , Mr. Bush , how thoroughly you tried to brand disagreement as disloyalty , Mr. Bush , there are still people like Daniel Levin who believe in the United States of America as true freedom , where we are better , not because of schemes and wars , but because of dreams and morals .
And ultimately , sir , these men , these patriots , will defeat you and they will return this country to its righteous standards , and to its rightful owners , the people .
Good night , and good luck .
The US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , today ruled out a ceasefire as a solution to the conflict in the Middle East .
Ahead of her weekend trip to the troubled region , she dismissed a ceasefire - proposed by the UN secretary general , Kofi Annan , among others - as a " false promise " .
" An immediate ceasefire without political conditions does not make sense , " she said .
With tensions rising at the Israeli - Lebanese border , Ms Rice said she hoped her trip would create conditions for a lasting Middle East peace , but admitted the diplomatic work would be difficult .
Outlining US plans for a diplomatic solution to the current crisis in Lebanon , the secretary of state also defended her decision not to talk to officials from Hizbullah or Syria .
" Syria knows what it needs to do and Hizbullah is the source of the problem , " she said at the state department in Washington .
Ms Rice said she would work with US allies in the region to help create conditions for " stability and lasting peace " .
She said she was meeting both the Israeli prime minister , Ehud Olmert , and the Palestinian president , Mahmoud Abbas .
She will also meet US allies and Lebanese officials at a gathering in Rome .
The secretary of state said the Lebanese government would need " robust " international assistance to take control of the south of the country from Hizbullah .
But she said US ground forces were not likely to be part of any expanded international peace force in Lebanon .
At least 319 people have been killed in Lebanon by the Israeli campaign , according to Lebanese security officials .
At least 34 Israelis have been killed , including 19 soldiers .
Early today , one air force officer died and three were injured when two Israeli helicopters collided near the Lebanese border .
Asked why she had not gone to the Middle East earlier to try to end the death and destruction in the region , Ms Rice said : " I could have gotten on a plane and rushed over and started shuttling , and it would n't have been clear what I was shuttling to do . "
Despite Israel 's ongoing preparations for a ground offensive , she said she took the Israeli government at its word when it said it had no desire to widen the conflict .
The Israeli military earlier warned hundreds of thousands of people in southern Lebanon to flee .
Its planes dropped leaflets telling residents to clear the area after officials met to decide how big a force to send in , according to senior military officials .
The officials said Israel would not stop its offensive until Hizbullah was forced behind the Litani river , 20 miles north of the border , creating a new buffer zone in a region that saw Israeli occupation between 1982 and 2000 .
Reservists in northern Israel were ordered to report for duty .
Daniel Ayalon , the Israeli ambassador to Washington , said Israel would not rule out an international peacekeeping force in Lebanon .
But he said Israel was first determined to take out Hizbullah 's command and control centres and weapons stockpiles .
He described the conflict as a " mop - up " operation and said that Israel had no desire to repeat its 18 - year occupation of southern Lebanon that ended in 2000 .
" They overplayed their hand , they miscalculated , " Mr Ayalon said of Hizbullah militants based in southern Lebanon .
Israel 's military chief said today the country 's forces had killed nearly 100 Hizbullah fighters in Lebanon during the 10 - day offensive .
Lieutenant - General Dan Halutz said at least 13 Hizbullah guerrillas were killed yesterday alone in fierce fighting just inside southern Lebanon .
Four Israeli soldiers were killed in those clashes .
Hizbullah , on the other hand , said earlier today that two of its fighters had been killed in the latest fighting with Israeli troops , bringing to five the number of guerrillas killed .
Israel launched its military campaign against Lebanon and the militant Shia Muslim group on July 12 .

ANCHORAGE , Alaska ( Reuters ) -
Two centuries after rats first landed on a remote Aleutian island from a shipwreck , wildlife managers in Alaska are plotting how to evict the non-native rodent from the island that bears their name .

Rat Island , like many other treeless , volcanic islands in the 1,000 - mile ( 1,609 - km ) long Aleutian chain , is infested with rats that have proved devastating to wild birds that build nests in the earth or in rocky cliffs .
“ They pretty much made the island worthless for a lot of wildlife , ” said Art Sowls , a biologist with the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge , which sprawls across the Aleutians and other Alaska islands .
Rodents have reigned at Rat Island at the western end of the Aleutians since the 1780 shipwreck of a Japanese sailing ship , wreaking havoc on millions of seabirds with no natural defenses against land predators .
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , which manages the Maritime refuge , is drawing up plans to wipe out Rat Island ’s rats .
A formal proposal is expected in about a month , according to Sowls .
The agency is trying to find an effective way to wipe out rat populations without harming other wildlife .
Rat Island is a good starting point , according to biologists , for a removal program because it is small without much other wildlife .
Rats are a problem shared by remote islands all around the world .
Biologists said successful rat removal programs have taken place in more than 250 islands including Campbell Island south of New Zealand and Langara Island in British Columbia .

“ A lot of people go , ‘ Oh they ’re just rats , what ’s the big deal ? ’ , ” said Ron Clarke , assistant wildlife conservation director at the Department of Fish and Game .
Once informed about the environmental destruction wrought by rats , citizens are generally determined to avoid them .
Rats are blamed for causing about half the extinctions of various species worldwide since the 1600s and are persistent nuisances once established , said Clarke .
“ They ’re very good swimmers .
They ’ll eat anything .
They ’re just very good at surviving , ” Clarke said .
SWEEPING RAT MANDATES
Alaska state officials have issued sweeping new regulations that slap rat- prevention mandates on Alaska ports and harbors that have served as entry points for invading rodents .
The removal plan and new state regulations are extensions of previous anti-rat policies in Alaska .
Since the early 1990s , wildlife refuge managers have maintained a “ rat - spill ” program -- in which emergency responders prevent the spread of rats from shipwrecks -- similar to oil - spill contingency plans maintained by state and federal agencies .
“ It ’s entirely possible that in a shipwreck situation , the environmental damage created by the introduction of rats into the environment would be even worse than that of a major oil spill , ” Sowls said .
He cited the situation on the Aleutian island of Kiska , which still holds a colony of millions of auklets , a small seabird , but where introduced rats are decimating that natural population .
Researchers commonly find vast stretches on Kiska with no live birds , only rotting bodies stuffed into burrows .
“ A lot of the birds you find , the only parts the rats eat are the eyeballs and the brains , ” Sowls said .
“ It looks like , unless something is done in the next 20 to 40 years , that the rats will probably eliminate that colony . ”
A while ago I wrote about Bush cutting funding for the National Renewable Energy Lab , while at the same time highlighting it as a step towards our renewable future .
I also postulated that without the rubber stamp congress of yesteryear that this budget cut would be temporary .
Well it seems I was right .
I have no idea why Bush thought it would be a good idea to cut funding to the lab that presumably would be needed to meet the goals Shrub himself laid out in the State Of The Union .
Could it be that the government is run by a bunch of old oil men ?
No I am sure that has nothing to do with it .
I am just glad the congress kept him honest .
Opera Software , the Norwegian maker of the Opera web browser , filed a complaint with the European Commission alleging that Microsoft engages in anticompetitive practices by tying its browser to the Windows operating system and by not following accepted web standards .
( Have n't we heard this song before ? )
" We are filing this complaint on behalf of all consumers who are tired of having a monopolist make choices for them , " said Jon von Tetzchner , CEO of
Opera , in a prepared statement .
It 's not clear , though , that we really need Opera to speak on our behalf .
Even if Microsoft is a big bully , why does Mozilla Firefox continue to steal share away from Microsoft if it's if it 's so difficult for other software makers to break into the browser market ?
As of June 2007 , Mozilla had 12.7 percent market share of the browser market , and gained 1 percent in the first six months of the year , while Internet Explorer lost 1.2 percent market share , according to OneStat.com .

Olbermann : Does Bush want to remake US into ' invisible fascist state ' ?

Print This Email This MSNBC's Keith Olbermann delivered a blistering special comment on Monday concerning the true significance of the dispute over waterboarding and the essential role played by torture in maintaining the George W. Bush presidency .
" The presidency of George W. Bush has now devolved into a criminal conspiracy to cover the ass of George W. Bush , " Olbermann began .
" All of it is now , after one revelation last week , transparently clear for what it is ... the refocusing of our entire nation towards keeping this mock president ... and all the others from potential prosecution for having approved or ordered the illegal torture of prisoners being held in the name of our country . "
The revelation to which Olbermann referred was the account of former acting assistant attorney general Daniel Levin , who , when assigned to assess the legality of the administration 's " enhanced interrogation techniques , " decided the most direct method was to have himself waterboarded .
" Have you , Mr. Bush , ever done anything that personally courageous ? "
Olbermann asked .
" Perhaps when you 've gone to Walter Reed and teared up over the maimed servicemen and then gone back to the White House and confirmed and determined that there would be more maimed servicemen ? "
" Daniel Levin should have a statue in his honor in Washington , right now , " Olbermann stated .
" Instead , he was forced out as acting assistant attorney general nearly three years ago because he had the guts to do what George Bush could not do in a million years .
...
They waterboard him , and he wrote that even though he knew those doing it meant him no harm ... he could not stop the terror screaming from inside him , could not quell the horror . "
" Waterboarding , he said , is torture , " Olbermann continued .
" And he wrote it down ... somewhere where it could be contrasted with the words of this country 's 43rd president , ' The United States of America does not torture . ' "
According to Olbermann , Levin was forced to modify his report to suggest that waterboarding might not be torture if it was done carefully and then was fired because of his inability to lie to protect the president .
" If it ever got out , " Olbermann noted , once more addressing Bush directly , " you would have been screwed .
And screwed you are . "
Olbermann then went on to ask why waterboarding was even used on terrorists when it's well documented that " torture does not get them to tell the truth . "
" Of course , Mr. Bush , " Olbermann stated , " this is n't a problem , is it , if you do n't care if the terrorist plots they tell you about are the truth .
...
If , say , a president simply needed a constant supply of terrorist threats to keep the country scared ... if , say , he realized that even terrorized people still need good ghost stories before they will let a president pillage the Constitution -- well , heck , Mr. Bush , who better to dream them up for you than an actual terrorist .
He 'll tell you everything he ever fantasized of doing . "
" Now , if that 's what this is all about -- you tortured not because you 're stupid ... but you tortured because you 're smart enough to know it produces really authentic - sounding fiction -- well then , you 're going to need all the lawyers you can find , because that crime would n't just mean impeachment , would it , sir ?
That crime would mean George W. Bush is going to prison . "
That , Olbermann asserted , is the real explanation for the peculiar inability on the part of Gonzales , Cheney , and Mukasey to agree on a definition of torture -- along with " the giddying prospect that maybe you could ... remake a nation into a fascist state so efficient and so self - sustaining that the fascism itself would be nearly invisible .
" But ultimately , " Olbermann concluded , speaking of men like Levin , " these patriots will defeat you , and they will return this country to its righteous standards and to its rightful owners -- the people . "

If you pay your restaurant bills with with a credit card , there 's a small chance a crooked waiter will jack up the tip by scribbling the amount you added .
If you do n't go over your receipts and compare them to your credit card statement each month , you 'll never know if you 've been a victim of this form of fraud .
I know for a fact this has happened to me at least once .
I had a meal at Mexicali Concina Cantina in Studio City , CA .
I paid with a credit card and left a cash tip .
When I got my credit card statement , I happened to have the receipt handy , and I discovered that I had been overcharged by exactly ten dollars .
I called my credit card company , and they reversed the charge .
Punny Money has a way to help you catch tip fraud without having to compare your receipts to your statements ( you do need to save your receipts , though ) .
You use a checksum method .
Adjust the pennies in your tip so the last digit to the right of the decimal point equals the sum of the digits to the left of the decimal point of the total bill .
When you get your statement , the fraudulent tips are easy to spot :

The old School Virus writers ( VXers ) scene is dying a death , according to Symantec .
Key members of long - established VXers groups are drifting away while others are struggling to get enough material together for underground malware magazines .
" There should be no question anymore that the VX scene is dying , " Symantec reports .
Roy g biv has officially left the 29A group while prominent member Vallez has been silent for over a year .
29A , Hexadecimal for 666 , is a virus writer group known for creating the first Win 2000 virus and early examples of mobile malware that infected PDAs and the like .
Meanwhile neither EOF or DoomRiderz , other loose - knit VXer groups , have enough material for a new zine .
The two are planning to throw in the lot with another group , rRlf , in an attempt to get together enough material for a magazine .
" Even those three groups combined might not have enough material for a zine , " notes Symantec researcher Peter Ferrie .
Profit has replaced mischief , intellectual curiosity or a desire to make a name for yourself as the motive for creating malware over recent years .
Traditional virus writers have drifted away from the scene to be replaced by more shadowy coders creating sophisticated Trojans aimed at turning an illicit profit .
Enforcement action against virus writers has acted as a further disincentive for hobbyists though not , unfortunately , for those that make their livelihood from cybercrime .
Virus writing has changed from a cottage industry to a commercial enterprise .
So instead of getting proof of concept malware from hobbyists we 're dealing with the Storm worm Trojan and other sophisticated " professionally developed " botnet clients , such as Nugache , a new malware strain that can be controlled without use of a command and control server .
The days of malware that deletes Romanian gypsy music , talks to victims or creates a game that allows users of infected PCs to throw coconuts at anti-virus expert Graham Cluley have become relics of another era . ®

( CNN ) --
There 's a petite new contender ready to tackle America 's problems of foreign oil dependency and urban congestion .
A Smart car negotiates traffic in Rome , Italy .
The tiny vehicles go on sale in the U.S. in January .
Meet the Smart car :
An ultra -compact , Mercedes - designed , head - turning little vehicle that 's been negotiating traffic and squeezing into impossibly tiny spaces in Europe for almost a decade .
Now , it 's about to go on sale in the United States .
One reason the company waited so long to introduce it to Americans was that the U.S. was n't ready for such a small car , said Jessica Gamarra , marketing specialist for Smart USA .
But choking traffic and rising gas prices have changed that , she said .
" I think we 've finally gotten into a mindset where we are starting to look at conserving rather than consuming , and I think that especially makes this car the right car at the right time , " Gamarra said .
The Smart is expected to get at least 40 miles per gallon .
But fuel - economy may be an afterthought for some buyers .
Many are simply expected to purchase the car for the " wow factor " once it hits dealerships in January .
" You get something that looks totally different than anything else on the road , " said Csaba Csere , editor - in - chief of Car and Driver magazine .
" So if you kind of want to be looked at and want to be the first on your block with the new hardware , the Smart does that . "
But Csere advised prospective Smart car buyers to take a realistic look at their driving habits .
" I would make sure that a car this small will meet your needs , " Csere said .
" If your driving is mostly on city streets or maybe city freeways , the car is going to be fine .
But this is not a car that you want to do long distances in on the highway . "
The automotive Web site Edmunds.com had a similar verdict .
It praised the Smart for its styling , economy , " zippy " handling and ability to park almost anywhere .
SMART STATS  770,000 Smart cars have been sold in 36 countries
 The Smart car began in the early 1990s as a joint venture between Mercedes - Benz and Swatch
 Swatch inventor Nicolas Hayek wanted to design an " ultra-urban " car
 Smart stands for Swatch Mercedes Art
 Swatch is no longer involved in the project
 The Smart " fortwo " debuted at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 1997
 Production began in Hambach , France , in 1998
 The Smart car has been one of six cars exhibited in the Museum of Modern Art in New York

But it raised concerns about the Smart's " anxiety - causing " size and -- with prices starting at about $ 11,600 -- it found the vehicle expensive compared with bigger cars in its class .
" As a second , commuting - only car , it 's wonderful , but those with room for only one vehicle in the garage may want to consider a larger subcompact or compact car , " the Edmunds.com review said .
' Neat gadget '
Many Americans got their first look at the Smart car during the " street smart " road show , which brought the tiny vehicles to more than 50 cities across the country during the summer and fall .
In all , about 70,000 people showed up to check out the Smart and more than 40,000 took a test drive , Gamarra said .
Some stood in line for hours .
The tour was part of what the company calls " discovery marketing . "
" We really like to give people the chance to see , touch , feel and drive the car versus just showing them a television ad , " she said .
" Because it 's so new ... it 's something that you really need to wrap your head around by experiencing it . "

The road show 's recent stop in New York generated many comments .
One fan called it a " cool , little , neat gadget ; " another declared : " I just want to buy one immediately . "
But other people were nervous about the size of the car .
" They 're a little too small for this country , and I think people will think they 're kind of flimsy , " one man remarked .
" I do n't know if I 'd want to be on the [ highway ] doing 60 miles an hour and have a car run into me , " another said .
It 's a common concern as people consider the car 's petite dimensions and wonder about its safety .
Questions about size
At just under 9 feet long , the Smart car is about 3 feet shorter than the Mini Cooper and 7 feet shorter than the Ford Explorer .
At 1,800 pounds , it 's about 4,500 pounds lighter than an empty Hummer H2 .

Smart USA insists concerns about safety are easily overcome once people learn more about the vehicle .
" It 's basically built to be like a race car , with the steel cage technology that protects the occupants , " Gamarra said .
In addition , the Smart comes equipped with safety features including anti-lock brakes and front and side airbags .
The car is designed to achieve a four - star rating out of a possible five stars in government crash tests , according to Smart USA .
It has done " very well " in standard tests that would be done in the U.S. and that the company has replicated in Europe , Gamarra said .
But official results wo n't be out for a while .
The Smart car has not yet been crash tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , which waits until vehicles go on sale to the public before evaluating them , NHTSA spokeswoman Karen Aldana said .
Experts caution that people for whom safety is a priority should avoid the smallest cars .
" You can't repeal the laws of physics , " said Russ Rader , media relations director for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety , which conducts its own car crash tests .
" Size and weight are very important aspects of safety . "
" You can do things to a small vehicle to make it safer , but it will never be as safe as a bigger heavier vehicle , " he said .
The IIHS -- a nonprofit group funded by auto insurers -- has also not yet crash tested a Smart car , but Rader expressed concern about the number of small cars hitting U.S. roads .
" There are potential public health consequences in a switch to small , lightweight vehicles and consumers need to know that there is a trade - off for getting better fuel economy , " Rader said .
" The death rate for drivers in the smallest cars is twice as high as it is for people in large cars , " he said .

[ This essay originally appeared in Whole Earth Review # 57 ( Winter 1987 ) .
It is now both terribly dated and still apt .
It can be viewed , perhaps , as ahead of its time .
It earned hate mail when it first appeared . ]
The Shmoo has returned .
You remember the Shmoo , do n't you ?
It was a cute little white colored , squash - shaped cartoon character created by Al Capp in his comic strip " Li'l Abner , " in 1948 .
Shmoos bred like rabbits and could produce any object at the drop of a hat .
Since they loved to please humans , they would willingly pump out milk , eggs , filet mignon , caviar , or anything else if requested .
At first glance Shmoos seemed to herald the arrival of Utopia .
Unfortunately , a plethora of Shmoos meant that people quit their jobs , stopped paying taxes , and civilization as we know it began to degenerate quickly - or so Al Capp sought to demonstrate in his mildly didactic way .
In other words , there is such a thing as too much of a good thing .
The great funnies - reading public was not so sure .
Shmoos were enormously popular and thousands of Shmoo products were bought and sold before the Shmoo fad ran its course .
Al Capp supposedly became so sick of Shmoos that he killed them off and banished them from the strip .
They popped up again for another short appearance in " Li'l Abner " ten years later , were killed off again and this time were gone for good .
Or so it seemed until recent rumblings about software piracy in the computer trade press convinced me that the Shmoo has snuck back - in real life this time .
The source of the rumbling is the simple fact that most computer software is nothing more than an array of bits magnetically recorded on thin , plastic floppy disks .
This is true of both commercial software ( which often retails for hundreds of dollars ) and the file disks that store all the information and writing produced by the computer user .
That these arrays of bits are easily copied from disk to disk - with a copied disk being virtually indistinguishable from the original - is one of the much - touted selling points for the personal computer revolution .
Where the shmoo - factor comes in and software executives begin to grit their teeth is when a PC user decides to make a copy of a commercially - produced program for a friend .
Suddenly there are two programs where there once was one , and there 's a good cha nce that the recipient of the copied disk will never break down and buy his own legitimate copy .
This scenario , which is repeated daily all over the world , is the bane of the software industry , which contends it is losing millions of dollars in potential sales through this penny - ante thievery .
All sorts of copy - protection methods are in use to prevent software customers from making illegitimate copies , but nearly every protection method can be circumvented with some patience , cleverness , and one of numero us commercially available copying programs .
When similar concerns over rampant copying tore through the music industry a few years back the solution that developed was the levying of a tax on the sale of all blank cassette tapes .
The proceeds from this tax are distributed amidst the record compa nies in compensation for lost income .
A bizarre form of corporate socialism , perhaps , but it probably beats having stereo - cops busting through our doors in search of home - recorded audio cassettes .
The advent of affordable VCRs on a mass scale introduced this now - familiar dilemma into the realm of video .
The Supreme Court concluded in this case that folks at home could legally make personal video - tapes of programs and movies that were broadcast o ver the air .
However , making unauthorized duplicates of commercially produced video tapes is a violation of copyright and punishable by law , as big FBI notices at the start of most movie tapes remind us .
( That this , in effect , makes the FBI into an enforcer for the Mafia , which is reputedly knee - deep in the video - porn business , is just one of life 's little ironies , I suppose . )
With software the issue at hand is hazier still , since there is no single agreement on matters as elementary as defining exactly what software is .
On the one hand , most software programs consist of thousands of lines of coded instructions which tell one 's computer to perform in a certain manner .
This code , which is written by programmers and consists of a mixture of words , letters , and numbers , is covered by the same copyright laws that apply to other published material .
On the other hand , the words , letters and numbers that make up software code are generally combined into algorithms that describe mathematical procedures .
Considered separately each algorithm can no more be taken as private property than can phrases like " 2+2=4 " or E=mc2 .
Among programmers an elegant algorithm or set of algorithms that address common programming tasks are likely to become community property , and justifiably so .
Definitive mathematical answers to recurring questions have traditionally become the property of everyone since they represent an advance in general human knowledge .
Be that as it may , unique sequences of coded algorithms have tended to fall under the rubric of intellectual property fostering their controlled dissemination and retailing by the individuals or corporations that own them .
In an information economy it is information that becomes the most precious commodity .
Where things begin to get weird , however , is with the subtle redefining of both economic and wider social relations that the present software situation introduces .
This redefinition , which is subtle yet far - reaching , is almost never acknowledged by the software industry or computer press despite the fact that it is at the root of the so - called software piracy problem .
In making copies of software programs for their friends , thousands of normal citizens have not suddenly become moral degenerates and lawless nihilists .
Rather , they 've been resisting the encroachment of a new form of property relations which runs counter to common sense and the best human instincts .
In their desire to have their cake and eat it too , software companies are actually lobbying for a new form of legalistic capitalism whose overt operating principle would be Caveat Emptor .
What would life be like if software companies ran the country ?
Perhaps the following little drama may offer a clue :
Having recently noticed that the bushes outside your living room window have grown unruly you decide to trim them .
Your old hedge - clippers having long since succumbed to rust , you decide to run over to the nearest hardware store and buy a new pair .
At the store the following dialog ensues with the eager salesman .
" How are these hedge - clippers ?
Pretty good ? "
" Oh yes sir !
They are the best on the market .
They are twice as sharp as any other clippers and are greased at the joint to work faster than any clippers ever made ! "
" Well , that sounds pretty impressive .
How much are they ? "
" Just $ 450.00 , sir ! "
" Hmm . A bit pricey perhaps .
I presume they have a good warranty ? "
" The best , sir !
You 'll be excited to know that their warranty offers absolutely no guarantee that they will perform as described .
But that 's not all !
Should you be dissatisfied with these clippers you cannot get your money back !
And best of all , you cannot legally resell these clippers to anyone else !
In fact , your $ 450.00 merely buys you a license to use these clippers .
Should you violate any of the other terms of the warranty contained in this sheet of tiny print , ownership of the clippers will revert to the manufacturer and you will be liable to prosecution . "
" By jove , that sounds like the best deal I 've been offered since I purchased the Brooklyn Bridge a few years back !
I 'll take them ! "
Back home again you set out to trim the bushes .
Things are going along smoothly until the clippers let out an unexpected series of beeps and collapse in upon themselves .
Consulting the 100 - page manual which you had been hoping to ignore up ' til now you discover that you may have run into a " bug " which resides in this series of clippers .
Phoning the manufacturer you discover that by sending back the clippers along with an additional $ 25 they will send you an updated pair of clippers without the " bug " .
A llow 6 to 8 weeks for delivery .
This is less than thrilling but you have little choice it seems , so you send in the clippers along with a check and wait a couple of months .
Once the new clippers arrive you return to trimming bushes that have begun looking like mutant growths from Venus .
Within an hour or two the job is done and you are about to go hang up the clippers in the garage when your neighbor , Joe , stops by .
" Hey hey !
New clippers I see ! "
" Do n't ask . "
" Eh ?
I was thinking that I ought to trim those shrubs of mine that have been hanging over onto your driveway for months now .
If you 'll lend me your new clippers I ought to have them polished off in a jiffy .
Okay ? "
" Sorry , Joe .
But it says in my clipper - owner agreement that went into effect the moment I began using the clippers that these clippers can't be used by anyone besides me .
If I let you use them we 'll both be taking food out of the mouths of the company that makes these clippers and turning ourselves into felons in the process ! "
" Gee , sorry I asked !
But , hey , what if I buy the clippers from you for five cents and when I 'm done with them sell them back to you for five cents ?
Surely there 's no harm in that ? "
" I 'm afraid there is , Joe .
Any change in ownership violates the warranty and I 'd never be able to obtain a future update if the clippers unexpectedly collapse .
Besides , I do n't really " own " these clippers I only have the right to " use " them and that right is non-transferable .
C'mon , be a good American and buy your own pair ! "
" Thanks for setting me straight , pal !
If it were n't for honest citizens like you I can see how we 'd rapidly slip into a state of criminal anarchy with uncontrolled sharing of commodities !
Well , I 'm off to the hardware store to purchase one of those beauties ! "
While most software companies may howl about the illegality and injustice of unauthorized copying of programs - a complaint that is not entirely without merit - they are simultaneously engaged in a anti-consumer campaign of guerrilla warfare worthy of the Contras at the Nicaraguan border .
Computer software ( and hardware ) warranties are among the least protective in the marketplace ; in fact , they are mostly legal documents designed to disengage the companies from any but the most minimal responsibilities to their customers .
The disjunction between the claims of most software advertising and the terms of the actual license agreements is almost total .
Note the following verbatim quote from a typical agreement : " Limited Warranty :
The program is provided " as is " without warra nty of any kind .
The entire risk as to the results and performance of the program is assumed by you .
Should the program prove defective , you ( and not [ Software company name ] or its dealers ) assume the entire cost of all necessary servicing , repair or correction .
Further , [ company name ] does not warrant , guarantee or make any representations regarding the use of , or the results of the use of , the program in terms of correctness , accuracy , reliability , currentness , or otherwise ; and you rely on the program and results solely at your own risk . "
Were most of us to be handed such a " limited warranty " for any other product or industry we 'd consider ourselves the victims of a crass practical joke or worse .
Yet this is the norm with software companies .
In similar fashion , the companies ' heated opposition to shared ownership — or just plain sharing — of programs is a new wrinkle in the evolution of capitalism .
The advent of private property at the beginning of capitalism 's reign tended to gobble up pre-capitalist forms of property such as the village commons or peasant communal land , but it still allowed for numerous grey zones of shared property use .
Laundromats , taxi companies , mass transit , furniture rental firms , and many other enterprises are all predicated on the assumption that it is both socially valuable and personally profitable to provide access to products and services that people might not be able to afford individually .
When was the last time you heard Maytag wringing their hands over how many washing machines sales have been lost due to the prevalence of laundromats ?
And despite the apparent fact that a Hertz car that is rented out to one hundred patrons in the cours e of a year has , in effect , been " copied " a hundred times , there have been no overt moves by GM to shut down Hertz .
However , firms that rent software are coming under increasing fire from software companies whose new model for consumption seems to be " one person per commodity . "
My observations have led me to conclude that most unauthorized copies of programs are made on the spur of the moment between friends and more often than not are tried a few times out of curiosity and put on the shelf to gather dust ( or simply erased al together ) .
Since this is the moral equivilent of taking a friend 's new car out for a spin most people do n't think twice about it .
Estimates of massive software sale losses in such cases are largely specious .
Where software publishers may have a legitimate gripe is in the practice at some of our biggest corporations of buying one copy of a program , such as Lotus 1 - 2 - 3 , and making dozens of copies for clerks in dozens of departments , who then use the program daily .
This does represent a significant loss of income in a context far from that of friendly disk - sharing over the backyard fence .
While the computer industry may cast itself in the roll of staunch protector of private property — particularly its own — it has few misgivings about profiting from other kinds of unauthorized copying .
The burgeoning growth of image digitizers and OCRs ( optical character readers ) which allow anyone to capture the pictures or words of someone else onto disk , regardless of copyright , is one instance .
Commercial on - line databases that are accessible from any modem - equipped computer represent another .
This immediate access to others ' information is the stuff with which recent dreams of an amazing computerized future have been spun .
And it does have its allure .
As our culture increasingly moves from print to electronic media - with computers as central processing and distribution channels — all writing , images , coding , or other forms of " information " will begin to shift to a new realm of social ownership where old concepts of property and copyright will be turned inside out .
This trend is inherent in the technology itself .
Attempts to enforce the old forms of ownership and profit - extraction in the face of this technological drift entail retooling corporations into autonomous intelligence agencies while simultaneously redefining the better human impulses such as generosity and sharing to be criminal acts .
One recently developed copy - protection scheme which illustrates this mentality at work would cause destructive software " worms " to be released into one 's computer if one tried to make an unauthorized copy of the protected disk .
These worms could pop up unexpectedly at later dates randomly destroying other unrelated data and software .
Welcome to the era of software publisher as sniper !

August was a disastrous month for Republicans and the Romney campaign took a huge hit when it 's national finance committee co-chairman , Alan B. Fabian was charged in a 23 count indictment , including charges of money laundering , mail fraud , perjury and obstruction of justice .
It 's reported Fabian , a former Bush Pioneer , allegedly ran a scheme that netted him millions of dollars which were used to purchase beach front property and travel .
The Romney campaign said they would return Fabian 's $ 2,300 campaign donation , but not funds donated by others through him .
Fabian stepped down from Romney 's campaign shortly after his August 9th indictment -- but you may not have heard much about this scandal .
However , you may have heard of a scandal involving Senator Hillary Clinton 's campaign and a less - than savory character named Norman Hsu .
According to reports from the LA Times , Hsu skipped out on a 1991 plea agreement in San Mateo Co. CA , in which he was to serve three years for grand theft .
Hsu , who turned himself in to authorities in CA on Friday and awaits a September 5th bail hearing , became a top Democratic fundraiser and contributor to Hillary Clinton 's campaign as well as other Democratic candidates , including Senator Barack Obama , much of which was laundered through others .
The Clinton campaign has agreed to return $ 23,000 in campaign donations from Hsu , and Obama has agreed to donate his $ 2,300 donation to charity .
While both scandals hold equal potential for damage to the respective candidates involved , the media , for unknown reasons , gave Mitt Romney a pass , while devoting ample time to Hsu and the Clinton campaign .
According to Media Matters , NBC , CNN and FOXNews all covered the Hsu scandal , but none of the aforementioned networks dedicated any time to the Romney / Fabian scandal that can be found in the Nexis database .

Yossi Melman is one of the most interesting intelligence correspondents around .
He covers intelligence and national security issues for the Israeli newspaper Ha’aretz and is the coauthor , with Meir Javedanfar , of The Nuclear Sphinx of Tehran : Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the State of Iran ( Carroll & Graf , 2007 ) .
In their book , Melman and Javedanfar provide an in - depth look at the personality of Ahmadinejad , his religious beliefs , and the continuous cat - and - mouse game being played by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) and Iran .
Their book also describes how IAEA inspectors came to the realization that Iran utilized technology provided by the renegade Pakistani nuclear scientist Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan .
Previously , Melman wrote ( with CBS reporter Dan Raviv ) a book about the history of the Israeli Intelligence community including Mossad , Every Spy a Prince .
Melman answered Laura Rozen ’s questions about Israeli thinking about Iran , Iranian president Ahmadinejad , and the mystique of Israeli intelligence .
Mother Jones :
What about Ahmadinejad did you learn that most surprised you , or that is not widely known ?
Who really is Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ?
Yossi Melman :
There is no one Ahmadinejad .
There are several of them .
One is devoted to his working - class roots with social vision and denouncing corruption .
The other is rubbing shoulders with Iran ’s richest people , turning a blind eye to the thievery by his allies from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps and allowing his immediate relatives including his brother to be corrupted .
But above all I was astonished to learn about the religious depth and convictions of his beliefs in the cult of the Shiite messiah , the Mahdi .
This cult is led by his mentor , the radical Shiite cleric Ayatollah Mesbah Yazdi , who believes that Muslims “ should strive to hasten ” the Mahdi ’s return .
Since the election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as president he nominated other devout disciples of Mesbah Yazdi as cabinet ministers and as senior officials of Iran ’s National Security Council .
MJ : How much power does Ahmadinejad really have ?
What do you make of recent reports that his power is waning ?
YM : He is number two .
The leader who is calling the shots in Iran is the Supreme Leader , Ali Khamenei .
Nevertheless , the relations between the two are not as a rider and his horse .
The president has his power and has room for maneuvering .
The fact that the Supreme Leader allows Ahmadinejad to speak up his mind and heart–to deny the Holocaust for example–means that Khamenei ’s ability to restrain him is limited .
The world will be able to judge if the president ’s power is indeed waning only before Iran ’s next presidential election to be held in May 2009 .
In terms of making decisions how to deal with Iran ’s nuclear policy , it may be too late .
MJ : Some analysts here have described the Iranian regime as a bit like the American government , of being divided between conservative hard - liners and conservative pragmatists .
Did you find this in your reporting ?
YM : Not really .
Iran is indeed divided between those who have and those who have not , which are the majority of the people .
It is divided between moderates and conservatives and ultraconservatives .
There are many who are fed up with Islamic Revolutions policies and are aspiring for a change .
It is a nation in deep troubles of economic , social , and cultural contradictions .
It is made up of ethnical minorities — Arabs , Kurds , Azeris — which distrust each other .
Sixty percent of Iranians are illiterate .
Fifty to sixty percent of the country does n’t have running water and electricity .
It has one of the largest numbers of drug addicts and one million prostitutes .
Unlike America , Iran does n’t have an “ Iranian way of life . ”
MJ : What is the thinking inside Israeli government circles about what should be done about Iran ?
Is there any confidence that traditional tough international diplomacy such as that currently led by Rice and Solano could succeed in convincing Iran to curtail its nuclear program ?
YM : The Israeli government hopes that maybe Iran will be stopped through the U.N. ’s official sanctions and by more practical measures , which are a series of financial strikes on Iran by the West and Japan .
There is also the interesting position of Russia , which is unwilling to provide Iran with fuel to the nuclear reactor in Bushehr ( nuclear power facility ) , which Russia has built , and which in effect has been completed .
The Russian attitude reminds me of a car dealer who sold a car without an engine .
But without imposing sanctions on Iran ’s soft belly — the oil industry and oil export — the chances of stopping Iran ’s nuclear program are no more than around 30 percent .
Successful financial sanctions can prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons by a few months to two or three years .
Only a military strike can totally prevent Iran from achieving its aim .
MJ : If diplomacy does n’t succeed in persuading Iran to agree to suspend uranium enrichment , say , a year from now , what do you anticipate the Israeli government will be advising the Bush administration to do ?
YM : To use military force .
If the U.S. does n’t do it , Israel will have to do it .
Otherwise , we will indeed have to live in the shadow of the Iranian nuclear mushroom .
MJ : How good is Israeli intelligence on Iran ?
YM : Israeli intelligence on Iran ’s nuclear capabilities is not bad at all .
It has improved in the last five years .
Unfortunately the intelligence is less updated and tuned in to Iran ’s internal questions .
Israeli intelligence on Iran led by the military intelligence is no longer talking about the point of no return .
It believes that there is such a point .
You can always reverse trends and events .
The military intelligence and Mossad are now talking about the “ technological threshold ” which Iran may cross .
It may happen in April 2008 .
MJ : At least until recently , a small group of Israeli advisors close to Israeli defense advisor Uri Lubrani advocated that the U.S. should support democratic regime change in Iran .
You have reported on the Lubrani group .
What can you tell readers about them ?
YM : There is a general acceptance by most Iranian experts and observers here that regime change in the Iraqi sense does n’t exist and applies to Iran .
The change can happen only from within without a visible foreign intervention .
And the chance for such a change to occur is very slim .
The more realistic hope is that the leaders of Islamic Iran will understand that if they do n’t fix the economy , adopt a more accommodating approach to foreign policy and especially toward the West , the Iranian people will turn against them .
In other words the hope is that Iran ’s clerical establishment will reform itself in the right and desirable direction .
MJ : What is the current Israeli government thinking about the U.S. situation in Iraq ?
Is it considered hopeless ?
YM : Yes .
It is a lose - lose situation , whatever is done .
A full withdrawal will be a recipe for a disaster to U.S. interests and allies in the region and the continued presence of U.S. troops is as bad as the first option .
MJ : Last summer , Israel suddenly found itself fighting a war against Hezbollah in Lebanon — a situation that came as a surprise at least to many in the U.S.
How much do you think that war demonstrated that the U.S. and Iran are already fighting a proxy war in the region ?
YM : Indeed Iran and the U.S. are on a confrontational course because of Iran ’s desire to have nuclear weapons and its involvement in arming militias in Iraq .
The U.S. is trapped .
It may reach an agreement with Iran over Iraq — to stabilize Iraq and reduce terrorism and political violence — but the U.S. will have to pay a heavy price for it .
It will cost the U.S. to accept nuclear Iran .
MJ : Do you believe President Bush has decided to opt for a military strike ?
YM : This is a difficult question .
I doubt there is an answer at this stage .
President Bush , in my view , is continuing to think it over .
I can only say the following :
In 2001 , Richard Perle , an advisor to the U.S. Department of Defense and an associate of President Bush and Vice President Cheney , and a neoconservative , said that Bush would set out for a war in Iraq .
The comments , after September 11 , 2001 , sounded delusional .
In retrospect , he was right of course .
While interviewing him for the book , Perle claimed to us a few months ago that he believed that President Bush would give the order to strike Iran , without much difficulty , if he reached the conclusion that Iran was about to obtain nuclear weapons .
His estimate has been strengthened by recent comments made by a senior U.S. military officer who visited Israel .
He said the U.S. military was preparing for and making plans for the possibility that it would receive an order to attack Iran .
Connecting the iPhone to a laptop through a USB write - blocker is one way to forensically examine the device . *

Watch out .
The iPhone may reveal more about your misdeeds than you realize .
Derrick Donnelly , chief technology officer of Blackbag Technologies , a Silicon Valley - based company specializing in Apple forensic solutions , is tempted by the rich array of potential evidence an iPhone might contain .
Will its data favor the defense or the prosecution ?
" There is more information in there than your average cell phone , " explains Donnelly .
" The ease of use lends itself to more use … and more use creates more artifacts . "
The iPhone 's web , e-mail and phone functionality – combined with its 4 - or 8 - GB storage capacity – means it can serve as a window into the personality , lifestyle , social circle and actions of the user .
" Even though there might not be a smoking gun right in there , " explains Donnelly , " a lot of these smaller pieces could add up to a bigger piece that could lead you to further evidence . "
But not every forensics expert is convinced .
" The iPhone is evil , " says Amber Schroader , CEO of Utah - based Paraben , a leader in digital - forensics software development .
" It 's Mac OS X , and it 's a completely closed system . "
In other words , it 's not easy for a forensics team to guarantee that the data extracted from an iPhone has not been tampered with .
The result is that juries may find reasonable doubt in how that data was extracted .
The digital - forensics industry is dominated by PC experts , mirroring the larger percentage of PC users in the marketplace .
Mac forensic analysis is considered a highly specialized service .
" To know the iPhone is to know the Mac or vice versa , " explains Donnelly .
" Because it 's a different file system and a different operating system , right off the bat the things you 're usually looking for are not in the same places and they are in a very , very different format . "
But even Mac experts like Donnelly are struggling with how to get the data off the iPhone 's closed system without altering the data by turning on the device .
Currently , the iPhone is not compatible with existing forensic software and data - extraction systems .
Forensic experts may be left with old - school techniques like photographing data as it is displayed on the screen itself – as if it were a yellow - taped crime scene .
Finding a laptop or desktop computer on the scene could help significantly .
" You might not be able to get the information off the iPhone , " says Donnelly , " but you may be able to get other devices that the iPhone was connected to . "
If the user had uploaded their phone 's data , analysts may find copies on the linked computer .
The vast amount of personal data the iPhone can store and personal habits it can track means it has the potential to say a lot about the user .
But the first challenge may be getting this closed - mouthed phone to talk .

Nine Hacks That Will Make You the Master of Your IPhone
Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama would reverse most of the Bush Administration 's technology policies and make Net Neutrality a priority under his administration , according to a sweeping tech policy agenda that the candidate unveiled today ahead of a visit to Google 's campus in Mountain View .
" I will take a backseat to no one in my commitment to network neutrality , " reads an excerpt of Obama 's prepared remarks released Wednesday .
" Because once providers start to privilege some applications or web sites over others , then the smaller voices get squeezed out , and we all lose .
The Internet is perhaps the most open network in history .
We have to keep it that way . "
Obama , as well as his rival New York senator and Democratic presidential front runner Hillary Rodham Clinton , are both co-sponsors of S. 215 , a Senate bill introduced earlier this year that would amend the 1934 Communications
Act to " ensure Net Neutrality . "
The Obama campaign has more detail about his tech agenda here .
Obama has previously stated his support for the concept , but today was the first time that he unveiled a laundry list of tech policies that he would implement as president .
The list looks like a Silicon Valley wish - list , ranging from the Net Neutrality item to an unusual comprehensive immigration reform policy that calls for the examination of " our ability to increase the number of permanent visas we issue to foreign skilled workers . "
Here are the areas it addresses :
IMMIGRATION :
The immigration policy also calls for more flexibility for those workers , suggesting that the visas , which are usually tied to an employer , allow those workers to have more freedom .
" Obama will work to ensure immigrant workers are less dependent on their employers for their right to stay in the country and would hold accountable employers who abuse the system and their workers , " reads the agenda .
Obama 's also calls for boosting the education levels of domestic workers so that they can fill the positions .
BROADBAND : Obama wants the Federal Communications Commission to redefine " broadband . "
But he fell short of providing any more detail apart from saying that " 200 kbps " is an " astonishingly low " speed definition for broadband .
Other than the revamped definition , Obama 's agenda says that " he will create incentives for smarter , more efficient and more imaginative use of government spectrum and new standards for commercial spectrum to bring affordable broadband to rural communities that previously lacked it . "
Vigorous antitrust enforcement and funding
Updated and interoperable radio networks for public safety officials
Tougher trade agreement enforcement policy under World Trade Organization agreements
Patent reform
Protecting US intellectual property abroad
Making the R&D tax credit permanent
Implementation of new tools and processes to bring more transparency to the executive branch
A mandate to build technology to protect children from inappropriate content online
Reforming health care information technology
Creation of a fund to explore green energy .
While covering much of the same ground as Clinton , Obama 's Wednesday announcement is less sharp in its rhetoric against the current administration over the issue of science and technology .
Many in the science and technology community have criticized the Bush administration for several of its science and tech policies ( or lack thereof ) – especially in the realms of global warming , lax anti-trust enforcement and roll - out of affordable universal broadband .
Obama 's positions on privacy in the digital age are far less detailed than Clinton 's , although he has been slightly more prominent as a senator on key privacy issues such as opposing renewal of the USA PATRIOT Act in the form advocated by the Bush administration at the end of 2005 .
Obama proposed using Web 2.0 applications to increase government transparency , and appointing a chief technology officer to head its e-government initiatives .
Apart from the use of the applications , the appointment of a CTO is n't a new idea .
These kinds of issues are currently handled in the White House ' Office of Management and Budget .
Karen Evans handles those issues .
The Illinois senator is scheduled to speak on these issues Wednesday afternoon on the Google campus , where Google CEO Eric Schmidt will moderate questions in a town hall meeting with Google employees .
He received a slew of endorsements Wednesday from those in the policy community whose ideas and policy positions he has adopted .
They include former Clinton administration FCC chiefs Bill Kennard and Reed Hundt , Google 's Schmidt , AOL 's former chief Jonathan Miller and progressive tech policy advocates such as Public Knowledge 's head honcho Gigi Sohn , Stanford Law School professor Larry Lessig , New York Law School 's Beth Noveck and the UC Berkeley economics professor and former Clinton Administration FCC and DOJ antitrust economist Joseph Farrell .
Obama has the support of his former Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe , whose work ironically played a key role in merger review proceedings between AT&T , SBC and MCI in 2006 .
Tribe , along with Kirkland & Ellis ' Kenneth Starr , did an analysis challenging the constitutionality of the Tunney Act .
That work was used by telecom company lawyers to persuade DC District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan to quickly approve the merger .
__Update : __Here 's an interesting commentary on Tribe and Network Neutrality .

Eight GOP presidential candidates meet in St. Petersburg , Florida , for the CNN / YouTube debate .
ST . PETERSBURG , Florida ( CNN ) --
The eight candidates vying to be the Republican nominee for president in the 2008 elections answered questions submitted by CNN and YouTube users in a debate Wednesday night .
Here is a full transcript of the event :
Florida Republican Party Chairman Jim Greer : Welcome to tonight 's presidential debate , co-sponsored by the Republican Party of Florida .
It is my pleasure tonight to introduce the man who has brought new ideas to state government , and whose leadership has been embraced by the voters of Florida , and who has become the nation 's most popular governor .
Ladies and gentlemen , Governor Charlie Crist .
Charlie Crist : Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Thank you .
And welcome to the Sunshine State .
It 's great to have this debate in Florida , in my home town of St. Petersburg .
It 's an important evening .
We 're going to hear from some great candidates , great Republicans .
And we should have fun with it .
The questions come from the people , as Anderson said .
This is truly the people 's debate .
But it 's also important to understand what we 're talking about : the future of America ; about integrity ; about honor ; about duty ; and about loyalty .
That 's what America always has stood for and always will .
So let 's meet some of these great candidates .
First , Congressman Duncan Hunter .
Congressman Ron Paul. Senator John McCain .
Senator Fred Thompson .
Mayor Rudy Giuliani .
Governor Mitt Romney .
Governor Mike Huckabee .
And Congressman Tom Tancredo .
Anderson Cooper : OK , John King is standing by , as well as Gloria Borger .
Gloria , a lot of elbows being thrown on the campaign trail the last couple of days .
What are you expecting tonight ?
Gloria Borger :
Well , I think tonight you might see a lot of elbows being thrown at Mitt Romney .
He 's really the guy to beat out there .
He 's been ahead in Iowa and New Hampshire .
He 's looking in his rearview mirror now .
He sees Mike Huckabee moving up on him in Iowa , and every other candidate has a shot in New Hampshire , so he 's the target .
Cooper : John King , this Rasmussen poll shows Mike Huckabee right now in the lead in Iowa .
John King :
He is moving up in Iowa , Anderson .
And that is part of the debate , about which Republican Party -- what will the Republican Party look like when it picks its new leader ?
Mike Huckabee is someone who is running on the anti-abortion agenda , as are so many of the other candidates tonight .
But the national frontrunner is Rudy Giuliani , who favors abortion rights .
Not since Ronald Reagan won in 1980 has the Republican Party even brokered the notion of having a nominee who supported abortion rights .
You also have a Republican president at this moment and one of the candidates on stage , Senator McCain , who were behind that big so - called comprehensive immigration reform that would give legal status to 12 million or more illegal immigrants in the United States .
Well , now opposition to that legislation is one of the defining debates in the Republican Party .
So , from a personality standpoint and a substantive standpoint , this is a fascinating time as the Republican Party decides who its leader will be and what its agenda will be after George W. Bush passes from the stage , Anderson .
Cooper : Gloria , the clock is ticking toward Iowa .
Borger : Absolutely .
And they know that right now , starting with this debate , they 've really got to define themselves , differentiate themselves , because the voters in Iowa still pretty much are undecided .
So , it 's anyone 's game right now .
The holidays are coming up .
And this is one opportunity for each of these candidates to tell the voters who he is and why he 's different from the other guy .
Cooper :
We are just watching the traveling press pool leave the auditorium .
We 'll get started in just a moment .
Welcome , candidates .
Good to have you all on the stage .
Thanks for being here .
Now , as there was last time with the Democratic candidates , there 's been some concern among the campaigns about what kind of questions are going to be asked tonight .
And with 5,000 questions to choose from , we certainly had a lot of options .
Take a look .
( Begin videotape )
Cooper ( voice over ) : Many groups tried to organize submissions .
Will Dick Armey 's question be seen tonight ?
Dick Armey : I will put that together as a YouTube ...
Snowman cartoon character :
And this is a question for Mitt Romney ...
Cooper : How about the much maligned snowman ?
Will he rear his frozen head here in sunny Saint Pete ?
UFO cartoon character :
So he wants to know what you would do about me and other kids like me -- the unwitting children of illegal -- well , you know .
Cooper : Dennis Kucinich may have seen a UFO , but we 'll have no little green men here in Florida .
Actor as " The Ghost of Richard Nixon " : I am the ghost of Richard Nixon !
We wo n't be seeing Richard Nixon , or little kids used to make adult points .
Though , there is one question where kids may make an appearance .
And do n't worry , we tried to keep out of most of the Abe Lincolns and Ben Franklins , and all the animals , both stuffed ...
Sparky :
My name is Sparky .
Cooper : ... and real .
Schmoopsy : Schmoopsy here with a question for the Republican candidate .
( End videotape )
Cooper : Sadly , Schmoopsy will not be heard from tonight .
The candidates will have 90 seconds to answer the YouTube questions , the questions that are asked direct to them , 30 seconds for any follow - up questions that I may ask .
There are no lights , no bells , no buzzers , no electric shocks .
We prefer the honor system here .
We 'll warn the candidates when they need to wrap things up .
We also will insist that candidates stay on the question that was being asked and not stray off to an earlier or another topic .
Americans put a lot of time into submitting these questions .
We think they deserve direct answers .
Finally , tonight we are not in the business of discouraging applause from our audience here , or passion , but please , if it gets out of control , we will ask the crowd here to keep it down just a little bit .
All right , let 's begin .
( The governor introduced the candidates . )
Cooper :
He did a very good job of it , but one Republican wanted to do that also , and he does it in a way that reminds us this is definitely a new kind of a debate .
Here is Chris Nandor from Snohomish , Washington .
Chris Nandor ( singing ) :
The grand old party 's looking for somebody who can lead , someone who is electable and adheres to our creed .
Some say the group is not diverse ; they 're white , they 're men , but wait .
The Dems have just one candidate , Republicans have eight .
Rudy 's leading all the polls , but can he win the base ?
Mitt changed on abortion ; history he can't erase .
Ron Paul would end the FDA and that is just a start .
Fred has just begun to run , but sure does look the part .
Hunter tells us what to do in foreign policy debates .
Huckabee 's compassionate and lost a lot of weight .
Tancredo says let 's build a fence across the whole Southwest .
McCain is loved by many and hated by the rest .
We do n't know who we 're voting for ; we do n't know who will win .
That 's why we use YouTube to ask our questions of these men .
Time is short , we 're voting soon , and I just thought I 'd mention .
If we do n't reach consensus , then we 'll decide at convention .
Cooper :
All right , enough of the singing , enough of the snowmen .
Let 's begin the debate .
From one tough - talking New Yorker , a question to another tough - talking New Yorker .
Ernie Nardi :
This is Ernie Nardi from Dyker Heights in Brooklyn , New York , with a question for the ex-Mayor Giuliani .
Under your administration , as well as others , New York City was operated as a sanctuary city , aiding and abetting illegal aliens .
I would like to know , if you become president of the United States , will you continue to aid and abet the flight of illegal aliens into this country ?
Cooper : Mayor Giuliani ?
Giuliani : Ernie , that was a very good question .
And the reality is that New York City was not a sanctuary city .
( OFF - MIKE ) single illegal immigrant that New York City could find that either committed a crime or was suspected of a crime .
That was in the executive order originally done by Ed Koch , continued by David Dinkins and then done by me .
The reason for the confusion is , there were three areas in which New York City made an exception .
New York City allowed the children of illegal immigrants to go to school .
If we did n't allow the children of illegal immigrants to go to school , we would have had 70,000 children on the streets at a time in which New York City was going through a massive crime wave , averaging 2,000 murders a year , 10,000 felonies a week .
The other two exceptions related to care -- emergency care in the hospital and being able to report crimes .
If we did n't allow illegals to report crimes , a lot of criminals would have gone free because they 're the ones who had the information .
But , most important point is , we reported thousands and thousands and thousands of names of illegal immigrants who committed crimes to the immigration service .
They did not deport them .
And what we did , the policies that we had , were necessary because the federal policies were n't working .
The federal policies were n't working , stopping people coming into the United States .
If I were president of the United States , I could do something about that by deploying a fence , by deploying a virtual fence , by having a BorderStat system like my COMSTAT system that brought down crime in New York , and just stopping people from coming in , and then having a tamper - proof ID card .
Cooper : Time .
Governor Romney , was New York a sanctuary city ?
Romney : Absolutely .
It called itself a sanctuary city .
And as a matter of fact , when the welfare reform act that President Clinton brought forward said that they were going to end the sanctuary policy of New York City , the mayor actually brought a suit to maintain its sanctuary city status .
And the idea that they reported any illegal alien that committed a crime -- how about the fact that the people who are here illegally have violated the law ?
They did n't report everybody they found that was here illegally .
And this happens to be a difference between Mayor Giuliani and myself and probably others on this stage as well , which is we 're going to have to recognize in this country that we welcome people here legally .
But the mayor said -- and I quote almost verbatim -- which is if you happen to be in this country in an undocumented status -- and that means you 're here illegally -- then we welcome you here .
We want you here .
We 'll protect you here .
That 's the wrong attitude .
Instead , we should say if you 're here illegally , you should not be here .
We 're not going to give you benefits , other than those required by the law , like health care and education , and that 's the course we 're going to have to pursue .
Cooper : Mayor Giuliani ?
Giuliani :
It 's unfortunate , but Mitt generally criticizes people in a situation in which he 's had far the -- worst record .
For example , in his case , there were six sanctuary cities .
He did nothing about them .
There was even a sanctuary mansion .
At his own home , illegal immigrants were being employed , not being turned into anybody or by anyone .
And then when he deputized the police , he did it two weeks before he was going to leave office , and they never even seemed to catch the illegal immigrants that were working at his mansion .
So I would say he had sanctuary mansion , not just sanctuary city .
Cooper : All right .
I have to allow Governor Romney to respond ...
Romney : Mayor , you know better than that .
( Laughter )
Giuliani : No ...
Romney : OK , then listen .
All right ?
Then listen .
First of all ...
Giuliani :
You did have illegal immigrants working at your mansion , did n't you ?
Romney : No , I did not , so let 's just talk about that .
Are you suggesting , Mr. Mayor -- because I think it is really kind of offensive actually to suggest , to say look , you know what , if you are a homeowner and you hire a company to come provide a service at your home -- paint the home , put on the roof .
If you hear someone that is working out there , not that you have employed , but that the company has .
If you hear someone with a funny accent , you , as a homeowner , are supposed to go out there and say , " I want to see your papers . "
Is that what you 're suggesting ?
Giuliani :
What I 'm suggesting is , if you ...
( Crosstalk )
Giuliani :
If you 're going to take this holier than thou attitude , that your whole approach to immigration ...
Romney : I 'm sorry , immigration is not holier than thou , Mayor .
It 's the law .
Giuliani :
If you 're going to take this holier than thou attitude that you are perfect on immigration ...
Romney : I 'm not perfect .
Giuliani : ... it just happens you have a special immigration problem that nobody else up here has .
You were employing illegal immigrants .
That is a pretty serious thing .
They were under your nose .
( Applause )
And ...
Romney : I ask the mayor again .
Are you suggesting , Mayor , that if you have a company that you hired who provide a service , that you now are responsible for going out and checking the employees of that company , particularly those that might look different or do n't have an accent like yours , and ask for their papers -- I do n't think that 's American , number one .
Number two ...
Cooper : We got to move on .
Romney : Let me tell you what I did as governor .
I said no to driver 's licenses for illegals .
I said , number two , we 're going to make sure that those that come here do n't get a tuition break in our schools , which I disagree with other folks on that one .
( Applause )
Number three , I applied to have our state police enforce the immigration laws in May , seven months before I was out of office .
It took the federal government a long time to get the approvals and we enforced the law .
And Massachusetts is not a sanctuary state , and the policies of the mayor of pursuing a sanctuary nation or pursuing a sanctuary city ...
Cooper :
We 've got a number ...
Romney : ... are , frankly , wrong .
Cooper :
We 've got a number of questions from our viewers on this topic , so we have a lot more to talk about on this .
You will have another chance to respond .
( Applause )
Giuliani :
And it 's really hard -- it 's really hard to have employer sanctions ...
( Audience booing )
Cooper : All right .
Let 's play this next video from the same topic .
( Begin video clip )
Michael Weitz : Good evening .
There are thousands of people in Canada and Mexico waiting to come to America legally .
They want to become American citizens .
They want to be part of the American dream .
Yet , there are those in the Senate that want to grant amnesty for those that come here illegally .
Will you pledge tonight , if elected president , to veto any immigration bill that involves amnesty for those that have come here illegally ?
Thank you .
Cooper : Senator Thompson ?
( Applause )
Thompson : Yes , I pledge that .
A nation that cannot and will not defend its own borders will not forever remain a sovereign nation .
And it 's unfair ...
( Applause )
We have -- we have thousands of people standing in line at embassies around the world to become United States American citizens , to come here to get a green card , to come here and to assimilate and be a part of our culture .
They are part of what has made our country great .
Some of our better citizens .
We all know them and love them .
Now , it 's our country together -- their 's and ours , now together .
It 's our home .
And we now get to decide who comes into our home .
And to place somebody above them or in front of them in line is the wrong thing to do .
We 've got to strengthen the border .
We 've got to enforce the border .
We 've got to punish employers -- employers who will not obey the law .
And we 've got to eliminate sanctuary cities and say to sanctuary cities , if you continue this , we 're going to cut off federal funding for you , you 're not going to do it with federal money .
( Applause )
Now , there are parts of what both of these gentlemen have just said that I would like to associate myself with .
First of all , of course , Governor Romney supported the Bush immigration plan until a short time ago .
Now he 's taken another position , surprisingly .
( Laughter )
As far as Mayor Giuliani is concerned , I am a little surprised the mayor says , you know , everybody 's responsible for everybody that they hire , but we 'll have to address that a little bit further later .
I think we 've all had people probably that we have hired that in retrospect probably is a bad decision .
( Laughter )
He did have a sanctuary city .
In 1996 , I helped pass a bill outlawing sanctuary cities .
The mayor went to court to overturn it .
So , if it was n't a sanctuary city , I 'd call that a frivolous lawsuit .
( Applause )
Cooper :
All right , because this was a direct ...
( Applause )
Cooper : Because this was a direct mention of Mayor Giuliani , we have to allow you to respond .
Thirty seconds , please .
Giuliani : New York City was not a sanctuary city .
New York City did three exceptions .
The three exceptions were to allow children to go to school , to allow those illegal immigrants who were the victims of crime to report the person who assaulted them , beat them up , mugged them .
And third , to allow emergency care in the hospitals , which we were required to do by federal law .
We had a policy of reporting every single illegal immigrant other than those three who commit any kind of crime or were suspected of crime , and we reported thousands of them to immigration service .
Few of them were deported .
Cooper : Senator McCain , let me bring you back to the question that was asked by the YouTube user .
Would you willing to veto any immigration bill that involved amnesty for those who have come here illegally ?
McCain : Yes , of course , and we never proposed amnesty .
But you know , this whole debate ...
Cooper : Come on , please .
Let him answer .
McCain :
You know , this whole debate saddens me a little bit because we do have a serious situation in America .
In 1986 , we passed a law that said we would enforce our borders , and gave amnesty to a couple of million people .
We gave the amnesty .
Now we have 12 million people and still borders that are not enforced .
I came to the Senate not to do the easy things , but to do the hard things .
Mel Martinez and I knew this was going to be a tough issue , but we thought the status quo was unacceptable : broken borders ; 12 million people here illegally ; a need for a temporary worker program , certainly in my state in the agricultural section , certainly in this state of Florida .
And we tried to get something done .
We said we 'd enforce the borders .
The American people did n't believe us .
They do n't believe us because of our failure in Katrina , our failure in Iraq , our failures in reining in corruption and out of control spending .
So we tried and we failed .
And I appreciate the president 's efforts .
He comes from a border state too .
And what we 've learned is that the American people want the borders enforced .
We must enforce the -- secure the borders first .
But then you 've still got two other aspects of this issue that have to be resolved as well .
And we need to sit down as Americans and recognize these are God 's children as well .
( Applause )
And they need some protection under the law .
And they need some of our love and compassion .
Cooper : Thank you , Senator .
McCain :
And I want to assure you that I 'll enforce the borders first , that as president of the United States , we 'll solve this immigration problem .
And we wo n't demagogue it .
And we wo n't have sanctuary cities .
Cooper : OK .
McCain :
And we wo n't have all this other rhetoric that unfortunately contributes nothing to the national dialogue .
Cooper : Thank you , senator .
Michael Weitz who actually asked that question is here in the audience .
Michael , do you feel you got an answer ?
Weitz :
Am I happy with the answer ?
Cooper : Yes .
Weitz :
One yes , one no and one sort of .
( LAUGHTER )
Cooper : All right .
Well , let 's -- Congressman Tancredo ?
Tancredo : Yes .
Well , I tell you , this has been wonderful .
Senator McCain may not be happy with the spirit of this debate .
For a guy who usually stands on the bookend here , aside , and just listens all the time , that 's kind of frustrating , you know , in other debates .
I have to tell you , so far , it 's been wonderful .
( Laughter )
Because all I 've heard is people trying to out - Tancredo Tancredo .
It is great .
I am so happy to hear it .
It is a wonderful thing .
It 's a good message , yes .
We want to secure the borders .
Cooper :
Our next question is actually directly to you , so let 's bring it up .
Tancredo :
Let me go ahead and answer that next question .
Jack Brooks : Hammered by competition with imports , our family - owned business struggles each year to find seasonal workers .
We 've been working with a seasonal guest - worker program , the H2B program , bringing in and sending home workers every year .
But with Congress failing to enact a comprehensive immigration and guest worker bill , I want to know whether I 'll have a job next year .
What are you going to do to keep these guest workers coming to the U.S. to save our business ?
Cooper : Congressman Tancredo ?
Tancredo : OK , the gist of the question , as I understand it , is , what I 'm going to do stop guest workers from coming in here ?
Cooper : No , no , to help .
This small business needs guest workers .
Tancredo : I 'm sorry .
I could not hear that .
I 'm sorry .
Well , I 'll tell you , I 'm not going to aid any more immigration into this country , because in fact , immigration ...
( Applause )
... massive immigration into the country , massive immigration , both legal and illegal , does a couple of things .
One of it is , makes it difficult for us to assimilate .
The other thing is that it does take jobs .
I reject the idea -- I reject the idea , categorically , that there are jobs that , quote , " No American will take . "
I reject it .
( Applause )
Now , what they will do ...
( Applause )
... what you can say -- what you absolutely can say to these people is that there are no -- there are some jobs Americans wo n't take for what I can get any illegal immigrant to do that job for .
Yes , that 's true .
But am I going to feel sorry if a business has to increase its wages in order for somebody in this country to make a good living ?
No , I do n't feel sorry about that and I wo n't apologize for it for a moment .
And there are plenty of Americans who will do those jobs .
( Applause )
Cooper : Congressman Hunter ?
Hunter : Yes .
Cooper , a great debate .
It 's nice to listen to lots of statements about what the other candidates will do with respect to the borders .
I built that border fence in San Diego and it does work .
It 's a ...
( Applause )
You know , we built a double fence .
We had the number one smuggler 's corridor in America with most of the illegal aliens and most of the drugs that came into the entire country coming in through that number one corridor between Tijuana , Mexico , and San Diego , California .
We built the double - border fence with a road in between , and we reduced the smuggling of people and drugs by more than 90 percent .
And as a result of that , the crime rate ...
( Applause )
... the crime rate in the city of San Diego went down by 53 percent by FBI statistic .
And as a result of that , I wrote the law that the president signed last October 26 , incidentally , passed the Senate 80 - 19 , that mandates 854 miles of double - border fence across Arizona , New Mexico and Texas .
Now , the administration has $ 800 million on hand right now , cash on hand .
They have n't built a linear inch of that fence in Texas .
As president of the United States , I would bill the double - border fence , all 854 miles , in six months .
Cooper : Next question is ...
( Applause )
Hunter :
That is my commitment .
( Applause )
Cooper : ... on immigration as well is going to go to Governor Huckabee .
( Applause )
Ashley : Governor Huckabee , while governor of Arkansas , you gave a illegal aliens a discount for college in Arkansas by allow them to pay lower in - state tuition rates .
However , we have thousands of military members currently serving our country in Iraq with children at home .
If these children chose to move to Arkansas to attend college , they would have to pay three times the tuition rate that illegal aliens pay .
Would you support a federal law which would require any state that gives these tuition rates to illegal aliens to give the same rates to the children of our military members ?
Cooper : Governor Huckabee , you have 90 seconds .
Huckabee : Thank you very much .
Ashley , first of all , let me just express that you 're a little misinformed .
We never passed a bill that gave special privileges to the children of illegals to go to college .
Now , let me tell you what I did do .
I supported the bill that would 've allowed those children who had been in our schools their entire school life the opportunity to have the same scholarship that their peers had , who had also gone to high school with them and sat in the same classrooms .
They could n't just move in in their senior year and go to college .
It was n't about out of state tuition .
It was an academic , meritorious scholarship called the Academic Challenge Scholarship .
Now , let me tell you a couple of provisions of it .
And , by the way , it did n't pass .
It passed the House but got in the Senate and got caught up in the same kind of controversy that this country is caught up in .
And here 's what happened .
This bill would 've said that if you came here , not because you made the choice but because your parents did , that we 're not going to punish a child because the parent committed a crime .
That 's not what we typically do in this country .
It said that if you 'd sat in our schools from the time you 're five or six - years old and you had become an A - plus student , you 'd completed the core curriculum , you were an exceptional student , and you also had to be drug and alcohol - free -- and the other provision , you had to be applying for citizenship .
It accomplished two things that we knew we wanted to do , and that is , number one , bring people from illegal status to legal status .
And the second thing , we wanted people to be taxpayers , not tax - takers .
And that 's what that provision did .
And finally , would we give that provision to the children of veterans , personally ?
What we 've done with not just the children of veterans , but most importantly , veterans is disgraceful in this country .
And that 's why I proposed a veterans bill of rights that , if anything , would give our veterans the most exceptional privileges of all , because they are the ones who have earned all of our freedom -- every single one of them .
Cooper : Governor , you called Governor Huckabee a liberal on immigration .
( Applause )
Romney : Well , you know , I like Mike .
And I heard what he just said .
But he basically said that he fought for giving scholarships to illegal aliens .
And he had -- he had a great reason for doing so .
It reminds me of what it 's like talking to liberals in Massachusetts , all right ?
They have great reasons for taking taxpayer money and using it for things they think are the right thing to do .
Mike , that 's not your money .
That 's the taxpayers ' money .
( Applause )
And the right thing here is to say to people that are here legally as citizens or legal aliens , we 're going to help you .
But if you 're here illegally , then you ought to be able to return home or get in line with everybody else .
But illegals are not going to get taxpayer - funded breaks that are better than our own citizens , those that come from other states or those that come from your state .
Cooper : You have 30 seconds to respond .
Huckabee : Well , but they did n't get something better .
They had to earn it .
And , you know something , I worked my way through college .
I started work when I was 14 and I had to pay my own way through .
I know how hard it was to get that degree .
I am standing here tonight on this stage because I got an education .
If I had n't had the education , I would n't be standing on this stage .
I might be picking lettuce .
I might be a person who needed government support , rather than who was giving so much money in taxes I want to get rid of the tax code that we 've got and make it really different .
Romney : Well ...
Huckabee : Mitt , let me finish .
Let me finish , Mitt .
In all due respect , we are a better country than to punish children for what their parents did .
We 're a better country than that .
( Applause )
Cooper : Another question -- we have one more question for ...
Romney : I get a chance to just respond to that .
We are not punishing children for what their parents did .
I respect the fact that you worked your way through college .
That 's the way you are .
That 's wonderful .
A lot of people in this country do tremendous things to get their education .
But the question is , are we going to give taxpayer - funded benefits to kids that are here illegally and put them ahead of kids that are here legally ?
There is only so much money to go around , and ...
Huckabee : No , there is ...
Romney : Let me finish , too .
Huckabee : Well , but let 's just be factual .
Cooper : You 've got 30 seconds .
Your time is up .
Romney :
There 's only so much money .
Are we going to say that kids that are here illegally are going to get a special deal ?
Are they going to get a deal better than other kids ?
Do they get benefits by virtue of coming here illegally ?
And the answer is no .
Huckabee : Because they 're earning it .
That was the difference .
They had to earn it by their ...
Cooper :
We 've got another question from a YouTube watcher .
Let 's watch , please .
YouTube question : Good evening , candidates .
This is ( inaudible ) from Arlington , Texas , and this question is for Ron Paul .
I 've met a lot of your supporters online , but I 've noticed that a good number of them seem to buy into this conspiracy theory regarding the Council of Foreign Relations , and some plan to make a North American union by merging the United States with Canada and Mexico .
These supporters of yours seem to think that you also believe in this theory .
So my question to you is :
Do you really believe in all this , or are people just putting words in your mouth ?
Cooper : Congressman Paul , 90 seconds .
Paul :
Well , it all depends on what you mean by " all of this . " the CFR exists , the Trilateral Commission exists .
And it 's a , quote , " conspiracy of ideas . "
This is an ideological battle .
Some people believe in globalism .
Others of us believe in national sovereignty .
And there is a move on toward a North American union , just like early on there was a move on for a European Union , and it eventually ended up .
And there is a move on toward a North American Union , just like early on there was a move on for a European Union , and eventually ended up .
So we had NAFTA and moving toward a NAFTA highway .
These are real things .
It 's not somebody made these up .
It 's not a conspiracy .
They do n't talk about it , and they might not admit about it , but there 's been money spent on it .
There was legislation passed in the Texas legislature unanimously to put a halt on it .
They 're planning on millions of acres taken by eminent domain for an international highway from Mexico to Canada , which is going to make the immigration problem that much worse .
So it 's not so much a secretive conspiracy , it 's a contest between ideologies , whether we believe in our institutions here , our national sovereignty , our Constitution , or are we going to further move into the direction of international government , more U.N .
You know , this country goes to war under U.N. resolutions .
I do n't like big government in Washington , so I do n't like this trend toward international government .
We have a WTO that wants to control our drug industry , our nutritional products .
So , I 'm against all that .
But it 's not so much as a sinister conspiracy .
It 's just knowledge is out there .
If we look for it , you 'll realize that our national sovereignty is under threat .
Cooper : Congressman Paul , thank you .
( Applause )
Cooper :
We 've got a question -- moving on to another topic , the economy , money .
Next question .
Sarah Lederach : My name is Sarah Lederach .
I 'm 18 years old .
I 'm from Scarsdale , Pennsylvania .
And I 'm a student at Penn State University .
Often , I 've heard both politicians and voters express their concern with providing a better future for their children .
A concern of my generation is the trillions of dollars of national debt and what kind of responsibility we will have for that in the future .
My question for you all is , if elected , what measures will you take to tackle the national debt and control spending ?
Cooper : Senator McCain , have Republicans forgotten how to control spending ?
McCain : Absolutely .
Absolutely .
When we came to power in 1994 , the government ...
( Applause )
... changed government and the government changed us .
We let spending lurch completely out of control .
We spent $ 3 million to study the DNA of bears in Montana -- I do n't know if that was a paternity issue or a criminal issue .
( Laughter )
We presided over a great expansion of government , the latest being the SCHIP , which was going to be paid for , supposedly , with a dollar - a- pack in increase in the tax on a pack of cigarettes .
So , we 're going to help children with their health insurance and hope that they continue to smoke .
( Laughter )
So , I have the record of fighting against wasteful spending .
I have a clear record of winning .
I saved the taxpayers $ 2 billion on a bogus Air Force Boeing tanker deal , where people went to jail .
I led in the Abramoff hearings in the -- in the obscure Indian Affairs Committee , for which people are still testifying and going to jail .
As president of the United States , I 'd take an old veto pen that Ronald Reagan gave me , and I 'd veto every single pork barrel bill that comes across my death .
I 'd make the authors famous .
And we 've got to stop it and stop it now .
And I can do it .
And I 've done it .
And I 've got the record .
( Applause )
And I know how Washington works .
And I look forward to it .
Cooper : Governor Romney , what would you do to the pork spending ?
Romney : Well , the senator is absolutely right .
Every bill that comes forward that 's got pork in it and earmarks that are unnecessary , we 've got to veto them and send them back .
And that 's a -- that 's a lesson that 's going to have to be done .
But it 's gotta be broader than that .
We 're going to have to see fundamental change in the way Washington works .
We 're just -- we 're just not going to get out - of - the - box thinking with inside - the - Beltway politics .
And we 're going to have to fundamentally go at something like our entitlements and say we 've got to reform those .
I took on a major issue , which was health care , found a way to get people health insurance without having to expand government , without having to raise taxes .
We are going to have to after entitlements .
We are going to have to set a cap , as I have proposed , on all nonmilitary discretionary spending , and inflation less 1 percent .
Anything above that , we veto it .
Cooper : Mayor Giuliani ?
Giuliani : I think you have to across - the - board spending cuts the way Ronald Reagan did , a 5 , 10 percent per civilian agency should be done right now , actually .
President Bush should do it to strengthen the dollar .
We should commit not to rehire half of the civilian employees that will retire in the next 10 years .
That is 42 percent of the federal workforce that will retire in the next 10 years .
Do n't rehire half of them .
Use technology , one person doing the job of two or three .
Every businses has done it .
The government has to do it .
And we should look at those programs .
There are about 3 percent of programs that OMB finds every year are failing .
They should be zeroed out .
Twenty - two pecent are found to be not able to be evaluated .
They should be looked at .
We need that kind of approach .
Cooper :
The next question is going to go to Senator Thompson , as well as Ron Paul .
Emily : Hi , I am Emily and I am from Los Angeles .
The Republican Party once stood for limited government , which meant reduced federal spending because we tax less and we spent less .
However , over the past decade , real discretionary federal spending has in fact increased 40 percent , more than half of which has been non-defense related .
So my question is :
What are the names of the top three federal programs you would reduce in size in order to decrease ...
( Applause )
Cooper : Senator Thompson ?
Thompson :
Well , it 's a target - rich environment , there 's no question about it .
What most of these gentlemen have said absolutely correct .
The difficulty is , most of the programs that we talk about , most of the ones get the headlines , would not begin to solve the problem .
Mitt 's right when he mentions entitlement .
That 's why I have laid out a program to not attack entitlements , but to save Social Security .
Everybody talks about wanting to do something about it .
Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid are the ones that we 're really going to have to reform if we 're going to make any headway into spending .
Cooper :
So of the top three you would say Social Security ?
Thompson : No . I did n't say that .
There is -- the OMB has come out with a list of over 100 programs .
I would take all 100 of them , the ones that are full of waste , fraud and duplication .
I filed a report in 2001 , when I was chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee , and identified billions of dollars that we should be saving .
But my point is that we 're going to have to reform Social Security , we 're going to have to reform Medicare .
I 've laid out a detailed plan that will give individual retirement accounts for people , matched by the government , and also re-index the way benefits are calculated initially when a person retires .
And together , that program has been said by the experts already -- to say that -- have said that it would , after 75 years , make Social Security actuarily sound .
I 've got the only program out there that really addresses specifically one of the programs that 's going to have to be reformed .
Cooper : Congressman Paul , the question was three programs .
Can you name three ?
Paul : Yes , and I would like to state that , to the statement earlier made that we all went to Washington to change Washington and Washington changed us , I do n't think that applies to me ; Washington did not change me .
( Applause )
I would like to change Washington , and we could by cutting three programs , such as the Department of Education -- Ronald Reagan used to talk about that -- Department of Energy , Department of Homeland Security is the biggest bureaucracy we ever had .
( Applause )
And besides , what we can do is we can have a stronger national defense by changing our foreign policy .
Our foreign policy is costing us a trillion dollars , and we can spend most of that or a lot of that money home if we would bring our troops home .
( Applause )
Cooper : Governor Huckabee , 30 seconds , three programs .
Huckabee : Anderson , the first thing that I would get rid of would be the Internal Revenue Service .
( Applause )
We 'd have a complete -- getting rid of a $ 10 - billion - a - year industry .
I 'm not being facetious .
If we enacted the fair tax , one of the most researched ways to revive our economic future ...
( Applause )
... we will get rid of the IRS .
Secondly , I agree we need to revamp homeland security .
It 's a mess , and we have a real problem with the way that it 's currently structured .
And the third ...
Cooper : Thirty seconds is up .
Huckabee :
What 's that ?
Cooper : Thirty seconds is up .
Huckabee : Oh , OK .
Get rid of the IRS , and that would account for most of the problems .
Most people in this country are more afraid of an audit than they are of a mugging , and there 's a reason why .
Cooper :
We 've got more questions on this topic .
( Laughter )
( Applause )
Cooper : This next question is for Senator McCain .
Ronald Lanham : My name is Ronald Lanham from Mobile , Alabama .
And I want you to tell me , do you support the elimination of the federal income tax in favor of a national retail sales tax , also known as the fair tax ?
Thank you .
Cooper : Governor Huckabee supports it .
Do you ?
McCain : I do not , and I think we should look very carefully at it .
And I think we should look very carefully at some of the provisions , which according to The Wall Street Journal would increase an individual 's tax rate up into the 30s .
Obviously , we need a simpler , fairer tax code .
Everybody knows that .
We need to have a commission that reports out a credible proposal .
And then we do what we do with the base closing commissions .
Congress can't fool around , they either vote yes or no .
If Congress can't fix the tax code , give me the job and I 'll fix it .
I just want to also say that Congressman Paul , I 've heard him now in many debates talk about bringing our troops home , and about the war in Iraq and how it 's failed .
( Applause )
And I want to tell you that that kind of isolationism , sir , is what caused World War II .
We allowed ...
( Applause )
We allowed ...
( Audience booing )
Cooper : Allow him his answer .
Allow him his answer , please .
McCain :
We allowed -- we allowed Hitler to come to power with that kind of attitude of isolationism and appeasement .
( Audience booing )
And I want to tell you something , sir .
I just finished having Thanksgiving with the troops , and their message to you is -- the message of these brave men and women who are serving over there is , " Let us win .
Let us ...
( Applause )
Cooper :
We will -- please .
We will get to Iraq ...
( Applause )
All right .
Let me just remind everyone that these people did take a lot of time to ask these questions , and so we do want direct questions to -- the answers .
We will get to Iraq later , but I do have to allow Congressman Paul 30 seconds to respond .
Paul : Absolutely .
The real question you have to ask is why do I get the most money from active duty officers and military personnel ?
( Applause )
What John is saying is just totally distorted .
( Protester shouts off - mike )
Paul :
He does n't even understand the difference between non- intervention and isolationism .
I 'm not an isolationism , ( shakes head ) em , isolationist .
I want to trade with people , talk with people , travel .
But I do n't want to send troops overseas using force to tell them how to live .
We would object to it here and they 're going to object to us over there .
( Applause )
Cooper : All right .
We will have a lot more on Iraq coming up .
It is obviously a very heated topic .
Sticking on the economy , though , a familiar face asking a very simple question .
Governor Norquist : President Bush made a commitment when he ran for president in 2000 an 2004 that he would oppose and veto any tax increase that Congress sent him .
My question to each of the candidates is :
Would you promise to the people watching this right now , that you will oppose and veto any efforts to raise taxes as long as you 're president ?
Cooper : I doubt you can do it , but very short answers .
Congressman Tancredo ?
Tancredo : Yes , I can .
I have the highest rating , by the way , from the American Conservative Union of anybody on this stage , and yes to Grover because he knows I have the highest rating from the Americans for Tax Reform .
( Applause )
Tancredo :
Thank you very much , Grover .
Appreciate it .
Cooper : Governor Huckabee ?
Huckabee : I would , Anderson .
In fact , I signed a pledge to that effect and would keep that pledge .
Cooper : Governor Romney ?
Romney : I 've signed Grover 's pledge as well .
I believe I was the first person on this stage to do so .
Cooper : Mayor Giuliani ?
Giuliani : Yes , I would .
I did it as mayor .
I would do it as the president .
I had one of the best records in the country for lowering taxes while I was mayor .
I expect to have a great record as president .
Cooper : Senator Thompson ?
Thompson : Cut -- tax cuts for eight years when I was in the United States Senate .
Never met a tax I liked .
I 've got a tax - cut bill on the table .
But I do n't do pledges to anybody but the American people .
Audience : Go , Fred , go .
( Applause )
Cooper : Senator McCain ?
McCain : I have a 24 - year record of opposing tax increases and supporting tax reductions .
And , no , I 'm like Fred .
My pledge and my record is up to the American people , not up to any other organization .
Cooper : Congressman Paul ?
Paul : I have never voted for a tax increase ; never will .
But the tax issue is only one - half of it .
You can easily pledge not to raise taxes , but you have to cut spending .
( Applause )
Cooper : Congressman Hunter ?
Hunter :
You know , I came in with Ronald Reagan in 1980 to cut taxes , and I probably voted for more tax cuts than anybody here .
But you could have an emergency , a time of war , and I think it would be wrong to say , " Absolutely , I would pledge to Grover Norquist that I would never raise taxes . "
Could have a national emergency .
Cooper :
All right , next question .
Ted Faturos : Hi , I 'm Ted Faturos from Manhattan Beach , California .
Mmmmmm , nothing says delicious like cheap corn subsidized by the American taxpayer .
For a lot of Americans , however , a bitter taste is left in their mouth when they learned about how the U.S. taxpayer bankrolls billions of dollars in farm subsidies that mostly go to large item business interests .
I 'm curious which candidate could label themselves fiscally responsiblee , will endorse the elimination of farm subsidies if they are elected president in 2008 .
Cooper : Governor Romney , a lot of folks in Iowa interested in this answer .
( Laughter )
So I hear .
Romney : Not to mention Kansas , Missouri , North Dakota , South Dakota and so forth .
We do n't want to find ourselves , with regards to our food supply , in the same kind of position we 're in with regards to our energy supply .
And so it 's important for us to make sure that our farmers are able to stay on the farm and raise the crops that we need to have a secure source of food .
And so I believe in supports that will allow us to do that .
And the same time , I recognize that we 're also investing in new technologies to get ourselves energy independent .
And I happen to believe that some of the best sources for having renewable energy come from the farm .
And so we 're investing with subsidies in those areas to create new technology that otherwise would n't be ready for the market yet .
So I support these programs .
And finally , I 'd say this .
We have , in our nation , about one out of three acres that are planted are for sale overseas .
We send products around the world .
We 're competing with European and Brazilian and other farmers , and we 're competing in a marketplace where they are heavily subsidized , at great disadvantage for our farmers .
And so , if we 're going to change our support structure , we want to make sure that they change their support structure .
And we do this together , as opposed to unilaterally saying :
We 're going to put our farmers in a tough position and have the farmers in the rest of the world continue to be subsidized .
So , open markets , let our goods go around the world and secure our source of food .
Cooper : Mayor Giuliani , 30 seconds .
Giuliani :
The governor 's right .
It is n't a level playing field .
The subsidies in Europe are far higher than they are in the United States .
We could reduce subsidies here if they would do it there .
But we should n't do it on our own .
And also , we have to be very aware of the fact that we have to have our own supply of food .
We can't be dependent on foreign countries for our food .
So , both of those reasons would say that although simplistically , it might seem like you 'd want to get rid of all the subsidies , you 've got to do this very carefully , and you have to do it in concert with these free - trade agreements and other agreements you 're making so that European countries reduce their much heavier subsidies .
Cooper : Since we 're on fiscal matters , I would be remiss if I did n't ask this question , since it did just break a couple hours ago .
This is to Mayor Giuliani .
Politico broke a story a few hours ago questioning your accounting of taxpayer dollars as mayor .
They say that as mayor , the report says you took trips to the Hamptons and expensed the cost of your police detail to obscure city offices .
One , is that true ?
And , if so , was it appropriate ?
Giuliani : First of all , it 's not true .
I had 24 - hour security for the eight years that I was mayor .
They followed me everyplace I went .
It was because there were , you know , threats , threats that I do n't generally talk about .
Some have become public recently ; most of them have n't .
And they took care of me , and they put in their records , and they handled them in the way they handled them .
I had nothing to do with the handling of their records , and they were handled , as far as I know , perfectly appropriately .
Cooper :
We have asked all the campaigns , we should point out , to submit 30 - second or so campaign - style videos , YouTube - style videos .
It was open to them to do it in any format they wanted .
Our first video -- and we 're going to be playing them throughout the night , some of them out of commercials , some of them during the program -- is from Congressman Tancredo .
( Begin videotape )
Tancredo :
This issue of immigration is one of the most serious public policy issues we face .
Sen. Hillary Clinton :
What do we do now ?
Tancredo :
We have got to actually begin the process of assimilating people .
Clinton :
They may not talk to you if they think you are also going to be enforcing the immigration laws .
Tancredo :
We are obfuscating and using words like :
Well , I am not for amnesty , but I am for letting them stay .
Clinton :
Well , I do n't have enough time to tell you all the mistakes I have made .
Tancredo : The Republicans can stop this .
( End videotape )
( Applause )
Cooper :
All right , let 's have our next question from a YouTube viewer .
LeeAnn Anderson :
My name is LeeAnn Anderson and I am from Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , and these are my kids Evan and May .
Maya is from China and we adopted him to give her a better life .
We never dreamed that she would that she'd be exposed to lead after leaving China , and now we find trains like this that are covered with lead in our home .
My question for the candidates are , what are you going to do to make sure that these kind of toys do n't make their way into our homes and that we have safe toys that are made in America again and we keep jobs in America ?
Cooper : Congressman Tancredo , you have 90 seconds .
Tancredo :
It is illegal to import that kind of thing .
The problem is , of course , no one really pays a lot of attention to a lot of our laws , with regard to immigration of both people and , now in this case , of course , items , goods and services .
I voted against permanent normalized trade relations with China -- this is one reason why .
It was n't -- that was never devised simply to be a place for us to sell our products ; it was devised to be a place where we could get cheap labor to then import products to the United States .
So , one of the things you 'd have to do , and I certainly would intend to do , is to change our trade arrangement entirely -- with China , by the way , in particular , but with other countries , as well , that violate those agreements .
Cooper : Congressman Hunter , you have 30 seconds .
( Applause )
Hunter : China is cheating on trade , and they 're using that $ 200 billion trade deficit over the United States to buy ships , planes and missiles .
They are clearly arming .
And it's in the interest of the United States ...
( Applause )
... to stop China 's cheating .
My bill , incidentally , that 's up right now would do that .
But what we all ought to do in this Christmas season , with about a month to go before Christmas is buy American .
That might hire the young person .
That 'll result in a ...
( Applause )
You know , that just might keep your neighbor from losing his job , and it might help that young person coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan in uniform to have a job when they get back .
Let 's buy American this Christmas season .
Cooper : All right .
We 're going to have three commercial breaks throughout this entire debate .
This is the first one .
And as we go to it , we go to another campaign - style video , this one from Senator Fred Thompson .
( Begin videotape )
Romney : I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country .
I believe that since Roe v.
Wade has been the law for 20 years , that we should sustain and support it .
Huckabee : Others have suggested a surcharge on the income tax .
That 's acceptable .
I 'm fine with that .
Others have suggested , perhaps , a sales tax .
That 's fine .
( End videotape )
Cooper : Actually , given the nature of that video , we 're not going to go to break right now .
( Laughter )
I think it 's something we should talk about .
Senator Thompson , what 's up with that ?
( Laughter )
Thompson : I just wanted to give my buddies here a little extra airtime .
( Laughter )
( Applause )
Listen , I mean , what do you mean what 's up with it ?
These are their words .
Cooper : OK .
I should allow time to respond .
Governor Romney ?
Romney : I 'm not sure who that young guy was at the beginning of that film , but I can tell you this , which is , I do n't know how many times I can tell it .
I was wrong .
All right .
I was effectively pro- choice when I ran for office .
( Applause )
If people in this country are looking for someone who 's never made a mistake on a policy issue and is not willing to admit they 're ever wrong , why then they 're going to have to find somebody else , because on abortion I was wrong .
( Applause )
And I changed my mind as the governor .
This did n't just happen the last couple of weeks or the last year .
This happened when I was governor the first time a bill came to my desk that related to life .
I could not sign a bill that would take away human life .
I came down on the side of life every single instance as governor of Massachusetts .
I was awarded by the Massachusetts Citizens for Life with their leadership award for my record .
I 'm proud to be pro-life , and I 'm not going to be apologizing for people for becoming pro-life .
( Applause )
Cooper : Governor Huckabee , 30 seconds to respond .
Huckabee :
Well , I was governor nearly 11 years , and in that time I cut 90 taxes .
Over that period of time , the income tax remained exactly what it was .
The sales tax is one penny higher .
But I did do a number of tax cuts that helped a lot of people all over the place , like eliminating the marriage penalty , doubling the child care tax credit , getting rid of capital gains on the sale of a home , cutting capital gains on other things .
I have a great record on fiscal conservativism .
But one thing I 've learned , you know , when you get attacked , it 's not always bad .
It 's like my old pastor used to tell me , when they 're kicking you in the rear , it 's just proving you 're still out front .
( Applause )
Cooper : I 'm sure there 's some campaign chair who might want to change their videos that they 've given us after seeing Senator Thompson's , but it 's too late to do that .
We 're going to take a short break .
We 'll be right back .
( Commercial break )
Jay Fox : I 'm Jay Fox , lifetime member of the NRA .
Now , I am from a small town and as in any small time , we like our big guns .
My question to you is :
What is your opinion of gun control ?
And do n't worry , you can answer however you like .
( Laughter )
( Applause )
Cooper : Congressman Hunter ?
You have 90 seconds .
Hunter :
Well , first I 've got to inform Jay that as a guy who got his first hunting license at the age of 10 and really believes in the right to keep and bear arms , and used them in the military , as my son did in Fallujah , you should never throw a gun to a person .
He should have taken that gun handed - off from his fellow hunter .
So you have to be safe with guns , Jay .
But the right to keep and bear arms is an important element of community security , home security , and national security .
I think it is a tradition of the American soldier .
From Bunker Hill to New Orleans to the rooftops of Fallujah , the right to keep and bear arms and use them effectively is an important part of America 's security .
And I will strongly enforce the Second Amendment as president of the United States .
Cooper : All right .
On the same topic , another question .
Let 's watch .
Andrew Fink : Hello .
My name is Andrew Fink , and I have a question for Rudy Giuliani .
Mr. Giuliani , at a recent NRA convention , you stated that it 's every American 's right to be secure .
Yet , on March 21 of the year 2000 , The Boston Globe quoted you as saying , " Anyone wanting to own a gun should have to pass a written exam . "
Considering the Constitution grants us the right to bear arms as a means of protection , why do you believe that citizens should be required to pass an exam in order to exercise their right to protect themselves and their families ?
Thank you .
Cooper : Mayor Giuliani , 90 seconds .
Giuliani : Andrew , what I believe is that we have to be very aggressive about enforcing the gun laws that exist .
I had a city in which , when I took over , there were 2,000 murders a year , 10,000 felonies a week .
And I enforced the gun laws very aggressively .
I enforced all laws very aggressively .
And that 's the reason we reduced shootings by 74 percent .
We reduced homicide by 67 percent .
And we went from being one of the most dangerous cities in the country to being one of the safest .
As far as that 's concerned , what I believe is , the Second Amendment gives people an individual right to keep and to bear arms .
Government can impose reasonable regulations .
Generally , those reasonable regulations would be about ...
( Audience booing )
Cooper : Let him answer .
Giuliani : Let me finish .
Generally , those reasonable regulations would be about criminal background , background of mental instability , basically the ones that are outlined in the opinion of the judge who wrote the Parker decision , Judge Silverman .
And if those regulations go beyond that , then those are unconstitutional .
I think states can have a little bit of leeway .
New York could have a somewhat stricter rule than , let 's say , Kentucky .
Texas might have different rules than Ohio .
But generally , you 've got to comply with this rule .
Now , the Supreme Court 's going to decide this .
The Supreme Court 's going to decide this , probably within the next six months .
The Parker ( ph ) case has been taken to the Supreme Court .
They 're going to decide whether it's a right that pertains to the militia -- which I do n't believe it is -- or is it a right that is a personal right .
I believe that it is .
And I will live by that .
And people will be allowed to have guns .
I 'm not going to interfere with that .
Generally , decisions are going to be made on a state basis .
And they 're going to have to comply with the Constitution .
Cooper : Senator Thompson , last week you said that you do n't think Mayor Giuliani 's ever been a supporter of the Second Amendment .
Why did you say that -- 30 seconds .
Thompson :
Well , the mayor has supported a wide array of gun control laws .
I 'm not sure there 's ever one that did n't come up for consideration in terms of legislation that he did n't support -- signing ceremonies with people from President Clinton 's Cabinet and that sort of thing when they came up .
The Second Amendment is not a choice thing .
I mean , it's in the Constitution of the United States -- that 's the protection that the people have against ...

The case that the mayor refers to is the Washington D.C. case , and they were taking the same position , basically , the mayor took , as far as the city of New York is concerned .
They said , " You know , it will make a safer city if we outlaw law - abiding citizens having the right to posses a firearm . "
It did n't make them a safer city .
The D.C. Court of Appeals held that it was a violation of their Second Amendment rights and , hopefully , the Supreme Court will uphold the D.C. court .
Cooper : Mayor ?
Giuliani : I agree with the senator that it did n't make it a safer city .
And some of these gun laws do not make a city a safer city .
The things we did in New York , indisputably , made New York City a much safer city .
And the law in the District of Columbia and the law in New York are different .
The law in the District of Columbia made it impossible for you to have a firearm .
And if New York City went that far , it should also be declared unconstitutional .
The Second Amendment clearly gives you the right to carry and to bear arms .
In my reading of it , it 's an individual right , and I believe the Supreme Court will declare that .
And that protection comes from the Constitution , not just a president .
Cooper : Staying on the topic , another question from a viewer .
Eric Bentson :
Hi there .
I 'm Eric Bentson from Phoenix , Arizona .
Got a quick question for all you candidates .
Any of you all want to tell us about your gun collection , roughly how many you own , what your favorite make , model and caliber is , if any of them require a tax stamp ?
Cooper : ( Off - mike ) if you have a machine gun or a silencer .
Senator Thompson ?
Thompson : I own a couple of guns , but I 'm not going to tell you what they are or where they are .
( Laughter )
( Applause )
Cooper : Senator McCain ?
McCain :
For a long time I used a lot of guns , including carrying a .45 as a pilot flying in combat over Vietnam .
I know how to use guns .
I do n't own one now .
Cooper : Congressman Hunter ?
Hunter : I have an old 20 - gauge L.C. Smith that is just like the gun that my dad used to carry when I would walk behind him as a 9 - year - old kid and pick up the shells when he was hunting quail .
I finally got a chance to buy one of those a few years ago , the same gun that he had had and given to me when I was nine or ten year old when I bought my first hunting license .
The right to keep and bear arms in the Second Amendment is a large part protection .
It is also a large part family tradition .
Cooper :
Is there anyone here besides Senator McCain who does not own a gun ?
Mayor Giuliani ?
Governor Romney ?
Romney : I have two guns in my home .
They are owned by my son Josh .
Cooper :
All right , there you have it .
We have another question on a similar topic .
Romney :
He buys expensive things for me .
YouTube question :
Hi , this is me and my son Prentiss .
We 're from Atlanta .
I want to ask you guys a question ( inaudible ) every year .
But what about the war going on in our country , black on black crime ?
Two hundred to 400 black men die yearly in one city alone .
What are you going to do about that war ?
It feels like the ( inaudible ) is right outside .
Cooper :
He 's talking about black - on - black crime , crime in the inner cities .
Governor Romney ?
Romney : Well , first of all , Printes is pretty fortunate because he's got a dad standing next to him that apparently loves him by all appearances there , and that 's probably the best thing you can do for a kid is to have a mom and a dad .
( Applause )
And it 's time in this country that we go back to the kind of values that allow kid to have moms and dads .
In the African - American community today , 68 percent of kids born are born out of wedlock .
And so we 're going to try and once again reinculcate in this country the try of values that have made us so strong : family values .
Secondly ...
Cooper :
The question is , what are you going to do about the war in the inner city ?
Romney : Well , one , about the war in the inner city -- number one is to get more moms and dads .
That 's number one .
And thank heavens Bill Cosby said it like it was .
That 's where the root of crime starts .
Number two , we 've got to have better education in our schools .
I think that the civil rights issue of our time is the failure of inner-city schools to prepare kids in the inner city for the jobs of tomorrow .
And number three , of course , you have to do a better job with our policing .
And I was very proud that I added one state police class after another .
We had the largest state police in the history of our state during my term .
We put in place tough laws related to drunk driving .
Sex offenders , they have their pictures now posted on the Internet .
We took actions to be tough on crime .
And I was pleased that violent crime in my state during my term reduced by 7 percent .
Cooper : Mayor Giuliani , your campaign manager week called Governor Romney a mediocre one - term governor .
On the issue of fighting crime , is he a crime fighter ?
Giuliani :
The governor has a mixed record in fighting crime .
For example , murder went up by 7.5 percent .
Burglary went up .
One other category of violent crime went up .
Some categories of violent crime went down .
So , it would be fair to say it 's a mixed record .
The reality is , I had a very strong record in doing precisely what the young man was asking about .
And that is reducing crime in specifically neighborhoods that would be regarded as poor neighborhoods , the neighborhoods that had the most crime .
For example , in Harlem , we reduced crime by about 80 percent .
We reduced shootings , overall in the city , by 74 percent .
The city of New York was one of the most dangerous cities in America , and particularly in the neighborhoods this young man is worried about , they were really dangerous .
They are not that way anymore and we made the changes with the CompStat program , the broken windows theory and with very , very good leadership .
Cooper : Governor Romney , I have to allow you 30 seconds to respond .
Romney : I think we all recognize that the mayor did a wonderful job at reducing crime in the City of New York .
I 'm not a mayor , I 'm not running for a mayor 's job ; I did n't have a police commissioner .
But I did take the actions that I could , as a state governor , to improve our state police , to strengthen our state police , to be able to put in place the DNA laboratory -- we more than tripled the size of our DNA laboratory -- and did the things we could to improve crime -- our crime enforcement .
And I 'm proud of the fact that we were able to reduce crime during my tenure .
Cooper :
The next topic is abortion .
Next question ?
Journey : Hi .
My name is Journey .
I 'm from Texas .
And this question is for all ( inaudible ) pro-life candidates .
In the event that abortion becomes illegal and a woman obtains an abortion anyway , what should she be charged with , and what should her punishment be ?
What about the doctor who performs the abortion ?
Cooper : Congressman Paul , 90 seconds .
Paul :
You know , it 's not a federal function to determine the penalties for a crime of abortion if it 's illegal in a state .
It 's up to the state , it 's up to the juries .
And it should be up to discretion because it 's not an easy issue to deal with .
But the first thing we have to do is get the federal government out of it .
We do n't need a federal abortion police .
That 's the last thing that we need .
( Applause )
But for the ...
Cooper : Should a woman be charged with a crime ?
Paul : Pardon me ?
Cooper : Should a woman be charged with a crime ?
Paul : I do n't personally think so .
I 'm an O.B. doctor , and I practiced medicine for 30 years , and I of course never saw one time when a medically necessary abortion had to be done .
But so I think it certainly is a crime .
But I also understand the difficulties .
I think when you 're talking about third trimester deliberate abortion and partial birth abortions , I mean , there has to be a criminal penalty for the person that 's committing that crime .
But I really think it 's the person who commits the crime .
And I think that is the abortionist .
Cooper :
So you 're saying a doctor should be punished .
What sort of punishment should they get ?
Paul :
Well , I think it 's up to the states .
I 'm not in the state -- I 'm not running for governor .
And I think it 's different , and I do n't think it should be all 50 states the same way .
So , I do n't think that should be up to the president to decide that .
Cooper : Senator Thompson ?
Thompson : Yes .
The young lady 's question is ...
( Applause )
... the young lady 's question is premised on if abortion becomes illegal .
That presumes Roe v.
Wade is overturned , which I think should be our number one focus right now .
And that has to do with the kind of Supreme Court justices we put on the bench .
( Applause )
I 'm getting there .
I 'm getting there .
That would mean that it goes back to the states , and then the states would have to outlaw it at an earlier stage than they outlaw it now .
Then the question would be , who gets penalized and what should the penalty be .
I think it should be fashioned along the same lines it is now .
Most states have abortion laws pertain and prohibit abortion after viability .
It goes to the doctor performing the abortion , not the girl , or the young girl , or her parents , whoever it might be .
I think that same pattern needs to be followed .
It could just be moved up earlier , or much earlier in the process if the state so determined .
Cooper : Another question .
Questioner : Hello , my name is AJ .
I 'm from Millstone , New Jersey .
I would all of the candidates to give an answer on this .
If hypothetically , Roe v. Wade was overturned , and the Congress passed a federal ban on all abortions and it came to your desk , would you sign it ?
Yes or no ?
Cooper : Mayor Giuliani ?
Giuliani : If Congress passed a ban on all abortions throughout the United States ?
Cooper : If Roe v. Wade was overturned and Congress passed a federal ban on all abortions and it came to your desk , would you sign it , yes or no ?
Giuliani : I probably would not sign it .
I would leave it to the states to make that decision .
( Applause )
I think that that -- the problem with Roe against Wade is that it took the decision away from the states .
If Roe against Wade were overturned because it was poorly decided , if the justices decide that , it would them go back to the states , and it would seem to me that that would be the answer .
The answer is that each state would make a different decision .
I do n't believe , in the circumstance that you asked before , that it should be criminalized .
I think that would be a mistake unless we 're talking about partial birth abortion or late - term abortion .
I think you should have parental consent .
I think we should have access to adoptions instead of abortion .
But , ultimately , I think these decisions should be made on a state - by - state basis .
Cooper : Governor Romney ?
Romney : I agree with Senator Thompson , which is we should overturn Roe v. Wade and return these issues to the states .
I would welcome a circumstance where there was such a consensus in this country that we said , we do n't want to have abortion in this country at all , period .
That would be wonderful .
I 'd be delighted .
Cooper :
The question is : Would you sign that bill ?
Romney : Let me say it .
I 'd be delighted to sign that bill .
But that 's not where we are .
That 's not where America is today .
Where America is is ready to overturn Roe v. Wade and return to the states that authority .
But if the Congress got there , we had that kind of consensus in that country , terrific .
Cooper : All right .
The next question is for Governor Huckabee .
Let 's listen .
Tyler Overman : Hi. This is Tyler Overman from Memphis , Tennessee .
And I have a quick question for those of you who would call yourselves Christian conservatives .
The death penalty , what would Jesus do ?
Cooper : Governor Huckabee ?
Huckabee :
You know , one of the toughest challenges that I ever faced as a governor was carrying out the death penalty .
I did it more than any other governor ever had to do it in my state .
As I look on this stage , I 'm pretty sure that I 'm the only person on this stage that 's ever had to actually do it .
Let me tell you , it was the toughest decision I ever made as a human - being .
I read every page of every document of every case that ever came before me , because it was the one decision that came to my desk that , once I made it , was irrevocable .
Every other decision , somebody else could go back and overturn , could fix if it was a mistake .
That was one that was irrevocable .
I believe there is a place for a death penalty .
Some crimes are so heinous , so horrible that the only response that we , as a civilized nation , have for a most uncivil action is not only to try to deter that person from ever committing that crime again , but also as a warning to others that some crimes truly are beyond any other capacity for us to fix .
( Applause )
Now , having said that , there are those who say , " How can you be pro-life and believe in the death penalty ? "
Because there 's a real difference between the process of adjudication , where a person is deemed guilty after a thorough judicial process and is put to death by all of us , as citizens , under a law , as opposed to an individual making a decision to terminate a life that has never been deemed guilty because the life never was given a chance to even exist .
Cooper : Governor ?
Huckabee : That 's the fundamental difference .
( Applause )
Cooper : I do have to though press the question , which -- the question was , from the viewer was ?
What would Jesus do ?
Would Jesus support the death penalty ?
Huckabee : Jesus was too smart to ever run for public office , Anderson .
That 's what Jesus would do .
( Applause )
Cooper : Congressman Tancredo , 30 seconds .
Tancredo :
The question is : What would Jesus do ?
Well , I 'll tell you this .
I would pray to him for the wisdom and the courage to do the right thing .
And I believe that with prayer , he would give it to me .
And I believe that justice was done in the situations that the governor has explained .
And , as I say , I look to him for guidance in all those kinds of situations .
Cooper : Time .
A similar question .
Let 's watch .
Joseph : I am Joseph .
I am from Dallas , Texas , and how you answer this question will tell us everything we need to know about you .
Do you believe every word of this book ?
Specifically , this book that I am holding in my hand , do you believe this book ?
Cooper : I think we 've got a question .
Mayor Giuliani ?
Huckabee :
Do I need to help you out , Mayor , on this one ?
( Laughter )
( Applause )
Giuliani :
Wait a second , you 're the minister .
You 're going to help me out on this one .
Huckabee : I 'm trying to help you out .
Giuliani : OK .
The reality is , I believe it , but I do n't believe it 's necessarily literally true in every single respect .

Victoria Beckham 's Boys Are Psyched About Spice Girls Tour
, known for keeping her emotions in check , says her household is starting to get worked up over her upcoming " Spice Girls " tour .
The tour , which kicks off on December 3 , will put Posh , Ginger , Sporty , Scary and Baby together again .
Beckham plans to have her family with her and can't wait to have her boys see her on stage .
The normally stoic celebrity is afraid she may get emotional when she sees her children in the audience .
Beckham says the two older boys , Brooklyn 8 and Romeo 5 totally get what is about to happen and are incredibly excited about the whole thing .
The youngest Cruz 2 does n't really understand .
Posh says the Spice Girls have been crazy busy in the past week and she was also pleased to report that the Cavalli designed costumes that were created for the tour look amazing .
She has been running around the house with her iPod in her ear and constantly practicing the routines .
The group have reportedly reworked some of the old routines and have incorporated some new ones as well .
Posh has been blogging on the Spice Girls website but is keeping most of the surprises under wraps .
We 've included pictures below .

The apppointment of Daniel Pipes , whose particular brand of political extremism is documented here , as a top advisor to the Giuliani campaign is about par for the course for Rudy , whose over - the - top pronouncements fit right in with Pipes ’ hate - all - Arabs shtick .
But how far is Rudy willing to take it — as far as Pipes ?
The reason I ask : Pipes is onÂ the “ presidium “ Â of something called “ the Jerusalem Summit , ” which has a “ solution ” to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict : “ A generous relocation and resettlement package to allow them to build a new life for themselves and their families in countries preferably , but not necessarily exclusively , with similar religious and socio- cultural conditions . ”
In short : the wholesale deportation of the Palestinians .
It ’s fair to ask : Â Is this Giuliani ’s Middle East “ peace plan ” ?
And if not , why has he appointed a nut - bag like Pipes to a top position on his foreign policy staff ? Â

Nearly eight months after he was fired for making a racially and sexually disparaging remark about the Rutgers women ’s basketball team , Don Imus went back on the radio at 6 a.m. today and vowed he would not say anything like that again .
He also introduced two new cast members — a black woman , Karith Foster , and a black man , Tony Powell , both of them comedians — and said they would join him in conducting “ an ongoing discussion about race relations in this country . ”
“ I will never say anything in my lifetime that will make any of these young women at Rutgers regret or feel foolish that they accepted my apology and forgave me , ” Mr. Imus told an audience that was listening in person at Town Hall in midtown Manhattan , and at home and in their cars on WABC - AM , his new radio home .
“ And no one else will say anything on my program that will make anyone think I did not deserve a second chance . ”
Still , in many ways , it felt as if the clock had been turned back before last April , when Mr. Imus said what he said and was fired by CBS Radio and MSNBC , which had simulcast his program on cable television .
I was asked recently to help in creating some estimates .
Dates were mentioned , features were requested , but generally the information given was pretty vague , as is common with many estimates .
So , we start digging .
What is needed , when is it needed , in what form is it needed ?
What does success look like ?
There 's lots of estimation tools out there .
Steve McConnell 's Construx Estimate ( even though it 's written in VB6 and was created in 2001 ) is well thought of , and can certainly get one jump - started with an estimate .
Of course , garbage - in , garbage - out still applies .
Patrick 's been using the PlanningPoker technique for estimating lately .
It 's a useful technique that relies on the folks doing the work also doing the estimating .
( Always nice . )
If you take a look at the White Papers section of the Construx website ( free registration required , but it 's worth it ) you 'll find a number of excellent presentations in PDF format that are good reminders and primers when dealing with daunting Software Estimation tasks .
Pick up Steve McConnell 's book " Software Estimation : Demystifying the Black Art " if you want a nice introduction to the voodoo that is estimating .
I 've been reminded of a few important tenets doing this estimating processes .
Know your scope
Negotiating the scope of your project , the features , subsystems , etc. with your business stakeholders is a good first step in getting your head around " what are we really trying to accomplish . "
User stories and complete and accurate Use Cases are invaluable when trying to nail down how large something is .
Targets are not Estimates
Folks sometimes come up with dates , like " February 2008 " as a target for a project to hit .
After a while that target date starts getting treated like an estimated date .
It 's important that everyone on a project remember ( or be reminded regularly ) that targets are not estimates .
If you want to hit a date , you 'll likely not know when if an estimate is good enough to hit a target until you start moving far enough into the Cone of Uncertainty .
Ask for Worst Case - then Double That
Jeff Atwood points out , after reading Steve 's book , that asking for multiple points ( best case , worst case ) when asking folks for an estimate is important .
He quotes Steve , emphasis mine :
Considering that optimism is a near - universal fact of human nature , software estimates are often undermined by what I think of as a Collusion of Optimists .
Developers present estimates that are optimistic .
Executives like the optimistic estimates because they imply that desirable business targets are achievable .
Managers like the estimates because they imply that they can support upper management 's objectives .
And so the software project is off and running with no one ever taking a critical look at whether the estimates were well founded in the first place .
This quote nails it for me .
No one wants to give a realistic estimate .
It 's hard and sometimes it 's potentially career - limiting .
Steve quotes Fred Brooks ( who , as a random aside , is the uncle of a good friend of mine from high - school ) :
It is very difficult to make a vigorous , plausible , and job - risking defense of an estimate that is derived by no quantitative method , supported by little data , and certified chiefly by the hunches of the managers .
— Fred Brooks ( 1975 )
A few companies encourage worst - case estimates in the hopes that you can look like a hero if you make it happen .
A few companies ago I worked somewhere with the philosophy : Underpromise , over - deliver .
It was the founder 's belief that this idea was fundamental to making happy customers .
It seemed like a good idea , except when you actually delivered and things turned out to be simply : Promised , delivered .
Which is n't all that bad , actually , considering that folks say that fewer than 1/4 of projects actually do deliver on time .
Learn From the Past , and Don't Forget It
There 's a great slide in the 10 Keys to Success PDF up at Construx that compares 120 projects at Boeing , juxtaposing those that were estimated with Historical Data and those that were done without .
Seems obvious , but it 's useful to see these kinds of things and " learn from the sins of our fathers . "
When estimating based on historical data , however , sometimes people use the historical estimate rather than the historical actual .
In fact , a lot of companies do n't closely track the actuals .
You 'll be better off if you not only keep the actual datas , but also compare the original estimate with the actual result in a project post - mortem .
How do you estimate your projects ?
Do you estimate ?
If so , what tools do you use ?
Do you use Function Point Counting ?
Do you use other techniques ?
What does success look like for your project ?
What 's your success rate ?

When Asus first announced that it was preparing to ship the " Eee " low - cost laptop , it garnered significant interest from many industry observers and took a bit of the wind out of the sails of the One Laptop Per Child ( OLPC ) project .
Now , ASUS has officially launched the Eee — which stands for " Easy to learn " , " Excellent Internet " , and " Excellent mobile computing experience " — with models scheduled to be available in North America within a few weeks .
The Eee ( rhymes with Wii ) is an ultra -compact notebook with a 7 - inch screen that weighs 2.03 pounds .
It will be available in three different models , starting from $ 299 on up to $ 399 , depending on storage capacity , memory , and presence of a built - in webcam .
The low - end model , called " Surf , " has a 2GB Flash drive for storage and 256MB RAM .
The high - end model , which is available now in Taiwan 's popular 3C computer stores , comes with a 8 GB Flash drive and 1GB of DDR2 RAM .
Both models feature a 900MHz Intel Celeron M processor .
While the initial models will ship with Xandros Linux preinstalled , Microsoft has been anxious to get on the Eee bandwagon .
According to Davis Tsai , general manager of Microsoft Taiwan , Asus is planning to launch an Eee PC running Windows XP before the end of this year .
Windows Vista is out of the question as it would require too much storage space ( a vanilla install of Vista runs at around 14GB ) and has higher RAM and CPU requirements than its predecessor .
At least Microsoft will still be selling XP to OEMs , having extended XP 's cut - off date to June 2008 .
The Asus Eee. Photo courtesy Asus .
The Xandros Linux distro that Asus is currently shipping with the Eee comes with the usual open - source productivity software such as OpenOffice , but the interface is wrapped up in a shell designed both for ease - of - use and to fit naturally on the 7 - inch screen .
The desktop is divided into six tabs at the top of the screen : Internet , Work , Learn , Play , Settings , and Favorites .
Clicking on Internet brings up a web browser , and the other tabs lead to selection screens with oversize icons : Learn currently comes with a list of educational applications including Science , Language , and Math .
Under the " Play " category are options for playing games , a media player , music , photo , and video managers , and using the webcam .
At the bottom of the screen is the usual Start menu and taskbar .
Michelin's Jean - Luc Naret and friend hail Tokyo as top city for fine dining
That distinction now goes to Tokyo , according to the bible for foodies everywhere , the Michelin guide .
In its first ever edition devoted to an Asian city , it awarded restaurants in Tokyo a total of 191 stars .
That was nearly twice as many as Paris can boast , and more than three times New York 's total .
Tokyo is becoming the global city with the finest cuisine , the city in the world with the most stars
Jean - Luc Naret
Michelin Guides
Eight of Tokyo's restaurants won the maximum three stars - only two fewer than Paris itself .
Another 25 got two stars and 117 one star .
To add to Paris 's embarrassment , three of the top eight restaurants in Tokyo serve French food .
Three more offer traditional Japanese fine dining , and the other two are sushi houses .
" Tokyo is becoming the global city with the finest cuisine , the city in the world with the most stars , " said Michelin guide director Jean - Luc Naret .
Michelin 's plans to assess
Tokyo restaurants had caused controversy in Japan , where some commentators had doubted whether it would be up to the job .
As Michael Krauss noted last month , trial lawyers around the country have been pushing the idea that because small - time operators often purchase common over - the - counter drugs such as decongestants as ingredients which they they process into methamphetamine , major drug companies should be held financially liable for the economic costs of meth abuse .
It has n't taken long to get the first state attorney general to jump in on their side : according to the AP , Minnesota 's Mike Hatch has just proposed " going after big pharmaceutical manufacturers to recover the government 's costs for meth - related problems " .
Hatch said he 's working on a lawsuit against about six large companies that make products containing pseudoephedrine or ephedrine -- active ingredients in cold medicines like Sudafed that are broken down by meth cooks ....
Hatch is also pitching legislation to hold pseudoephedrine makers liable for damages caused by meth labs .
The bill would be modeled on a 1994 landfill cleanup law that allowed the state to sue polluters ' insurance companies to recover its costs .

There 's still a week and a half to go before Santa starts his rounds .
But , look up in the sky and you might just get a reminder that the reindeer are on their way .
Scroll down for more ...
This cloud in the shape of Dancer , Prancer and co was spotted by amateur photographer Alan Blacklock on the North Island of New Zealand - which is known by the Maori as the Land of the Long White Cloud .
" It was Sunday afternoon and my attention was drawn to a cloud in the sky , " said Mr Blacklock
" The shape started to look like a moose at the front end and a springbok at the rear .
" As time passed it became the shape you see and because it is nearly Christmas it was n't a great leap of the imagination to see a reindeer .
" I was in the right place at the right time .
It was a fluke , just one of those things . "
The cloud was formed by thin , wispy cirrus clouds more than 20,000 ft up in the atmosphere .
These clouds are often the harbinger of changing weather .
Meteorologist Ross Marsden said that cirrus formations regularly form into tufts , which are nicknamed " mare 's tails " .
He added : " Cirrus clouds often form themselves into unusual patterns but this one is certainly relevant as Christmas approaches . "
Britons hoping to spot something similarly seasonal in the sky should have plenty of opportunity , with today and tomorrow both forecast to be dry and cloudy .
Sadly , this reindeer 's fleeting appearance Down Under was over in a few minutes .
After all , you can't keep Santa waiting .

Editor 's Note :
This following letter was sent to Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi and Senator Harry Reid urging Congressional leaders to reconsider continuing federal investments in abstinence - only funding .
The letter was sent by John S Santelli MD , MPH at Columbia University and signed by nine other prominent researchers in the field of adolescent sexual and reproductive health last Wednesday , Nov 21 .
It was sent to Rewire yesterday and we are thrilled to post it below .
Dear Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi and Senator Harry Reid ,
As a group of leading scientists who have recently conducted research on adolescents , reproductive health , and abstinence - only education , we are writing to express our strong concern about increasing federal support for abstinence - only education ( AOE ) programs .
This federal support includes monies going to states ( Section 510 of the Social Security Act ) and those going directly to community and faith - based organizations ( the Community - Based Abstinence Education program ) .
Recent reports in professional publications by the authors of this letter have highlighted multiple deficiencies in federal abstinence - only programs .
As such , we are surprised and dismayed that the Congress is proposing to extend and even increase funding for these programs .
In this letter we identify key problems with abstinence - only education .
We also have attached recent scientific reports that are pertinent to the debate over these programs .
We note that many of these studies have used nationally - representative data from surveys sponsored by the National Institutes of Health or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
The federal programs promoting AOE have prompted multiple scientific and ethical critiques .
These critiques were summarized in a January 2006 paper by Santelli , Ott and others .
By design , abstinence programs restrict information about condoms and contraception – information that may be critical to protecting the health of young people and to preventing unplanned pregnancy , HIV infection , and infection with other sexually transmitted organisms .
They ignore the health needs of sexually active youth and youth who are gay , lesbian , bisexual , transgendered , and questioning for counseling , health care services , and risk reduction education .
Withholding lifesaving information from young people is contrary to the standards of medical ethics and to many international human rights conventions .
International treaties and human rights statements support the rights of adolescents to seek and receive information vital to their health .
Governments have an obligation to provide accurate information to adolescents and adolescents have a right to expect health education provided in public schools to be scientifically accurate and complete .

Rigorous evaluations of AOE programs find little evidence of efficacy for federally - sponsored abstinence education .
Several weeks ago Dr. Douglas Kirby , working with the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy , released a comprehensive review of prevention programs for youth ( Emerging Answers 2007 ) .
This review found that none of the well - designed evaluations of abstinence - only programs presented strong evidence of an impact on abstinence behaviors .
( By contrast , Kirby finds clear evidence that many comprehensive sexuality education programs , which include information on both abstinence and contraception , do help young people delay initiation of intercourse . )
The large - scale Mathematica evaluation of the Section 510 program , released in April 2007 , found no measurable impact on increasing abstinence or delaying sexual initiation among participating youth or on other behaviors such as condom use .
This well funded and very well conducted evaluation examined four exemplary local programs , tracking youth over four years .
One of the few measurable impacts of the programs was a decrease in adolescent confidence regarding the ability of condoms to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases .
Similar results on program efficacy were found by Underhill , who reviewed abstinence - only programs in a spring 2007 systematic review .
Virginity pledging , one aspect of abstinence programming , appears to have little long - term benefit in preventing outcomes such as sexually transmitted infections , although prevention of these infections is a stated goal of the programs .
A spring 2005 longitudinal study by Bruckner and Bearman found that abstinence pledgers , when compared to non-pledgers , experienced similar rates of sexually transmitted infection .
Pledgers did delay sexual intercourse for a limited period , but when they did start having sex , they were less likely to use condoms .
They were also less likely to seek reproductive health care compared to non-pledgers .
Abstinence until marriage is another stated goal of the federal program ; however , evidence from the past several decades indicates that establishing abstinence until marriage as normative behavior would be a highly challenging policy goal .
Teitler has shown that over the past 40 years , the median age at first intercourse has dropped ( and stabilized ) to age 17 in most developed countries .
At the same time , the median age at marriage has risen dramatically .
Today , sexual intercourse is almost universally initiated during adolescence worldwide .
A January 2007 study by Finer found that almost all Americans initiate sexual intercourse before marriage .
In fact by age 44 , virtually everyone has experienced sexual intercourse but only 3 % have remained abstinent until marriage .
Moreover this is not a new trend ;
Finer 's data suggest this pattern has been true for much of the second half of the 20th century .
Importantly , the emphasis on abstinence - only programs and policies appears to be undermining critical public health programs in the U.S. and abroad , including comprehensive sexuality education and HIV prevention programs .
During the period of increased state and federal emphasis on abstinence , declines have occurred in the percentage of teachers in U.S. public schools who teach about birth control and the number of students who report receiving such education .
In December 2006 , Lindberg and colleagues found that the percentage of teenagers who had received formal instruction about condoms and contraception declined from 89 % in 1995 to 70 % in 2002 .
We also note that a December 2004 Congressional report on federal abstinence programs from the U.S. House of Representatives ' Committee on Government Reform – Minority Staff found that 11 of the 13 most frequently used curricula contained false , misleading or distorted information about reproductive health – including inaccurate information about contraceptive effectiveness , purported health risks of abortion , and other scientific errors .
Recent reviews of these abstinence curricula from Santelli and colleagues at Columbia University have found similar inaccuracies , particularly misinformation about the efficacy of condoms and contraception .
This was the basis of an ACLU declaration on this topic from Santelli in the spring of this year .
Abstinence - only requirements also appear to be harming our foreign aid efforts .
In April 2006 , the U.S. Government Accountability Office issued a report titled " Spending Requirement Presents Challenges for Allocating Prevention Funding under the President 's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief " that concluded that the " …requirement that country teams spend at least 33 percent of prevention funding appropriated pursuant to the act on abstinence - until - marriage programs has presented challenges to country teams ' ability to adhere to the PEPFAR sexual transmission strategy … [ and ] challenged their ability to integrate the components of the ABC model and respond to local needs , local epidemiology , and distinctive social and cultural patterns . "
We would note that all of the mainstream organizations of health professionals that focus on the health of young people have strongly criticized federal support for current abstinence programs .
These include the American Public Health Association , the American Medical Association , the American Academy of Pediatrics , the American Psychological Association , and the Society for Adolescent Medicine .
We have also attached the weblinks to the policy statements from each of these groups .
The recent Congressional testimony of former Surgeon General Richard Carmona underscores these critiques from mainstream health organizations .
Dr. Carmona 's testimony confirms the political motivations behind abstinence funding and the failure to address issues of efficacy and scientific accuracy .
He suggested that ideology and theology have taken priority over women 's health in the current administration .
Dr. Carmona reported that the Bush administration " did not want to hear the science but wanted to , if you will , ‘ preach abstinence , ' which I felt was scientifically incorrect . "
Given these serious scientific and ethical shortcomings , we strongly urge the U.S. Congress to reconsider federal support for abstinence - only education programs and policies .
We would be very willing to advise you on shaping alternatives to the current program .

The Norwich authorities are now looking for a man accused of brutal assault over a homeless person discovered through the online video sharing service YouTube .
It seems like the video was recorded in November and then published on YouTube , attracting a lot of viewers and comments .
The attacker assaults the man and aims an impressive series of punches and kicks into his face as Evening News 24 reported .
According to the same publication , the 30 - second attack was recorded by someone sitting in a car outside the KFC in Norwich 's Prince of Wales Road .
" Now that this has been bought to our attention police officers will make further enquiries .
We would urge anyone who witnesses this type of behavior to contact the police .
The filming of this type of incident is irresponsible and we would hope any witnesses to such crimes would report them as soon as possible , " the police authorities sustained today according to the Evening News 24 .
As you surely know , this is not the first time when YouTube is involved in the police investigations started after numerous clips were published on Google 's video product .
In the past , another policeman posted a surveillance clip on YouTube to require users ' help and identify the suspect .
Although it seems like YouTube is sustained by a huge and impressive community , more and more Internet companies are planning to create new and powerful similar services able to challenge Google 's YouTube .
NBC and Microsoft are now planning to release one of the most powerful online video sharing services especially meant to challenge YouTube but it seems like a group of prayers are also aiming to promote GodTube , a new service trying to lure Christians to their page .

Global warming is a natural event and the effects are not all bad , two respected researchers claimed yesterday .
Authors Dennis Avery and Fred Singer looked at the work of more than 500 scientists and argue that these experts are doubtful the phenomenon is caused by man-made greenhouse gases .
Climate change is much more likely to be part of a cycle of warming and cooling that has happened regularly every 1,500 years for the last million years , they say .
And the doom and gloom merchants , who point to the threat to the polar bear from the melting North Pole , are wrong , the authors say .
Even if our climate is changing , it is not all bad , they suggest , because past cold periods have killed twice as many people as warm periods .
Mr Avery said : " Not all of these researchers who doubt man -made climate change would describe themselves as global warming sceptics but the evidence in their studies is there for all to see .
" Two thousand years of published human histories say that the warm periods were good for people .
" It was the harsh , unstable Dark Ages and the Little Ice Age that brought bigger storms , untimely frost , widespread famine , plagues and disease . "
Scroll down for more ...
Mr Singer said : " We have a greenhouse theory with no evidence to support it , except a moderate warming turned into a scare by computer models whose results have never been verified with real - world events .
" The models only reflect the warming , not its cause . "
The most recent global warming was between 1850 and 1940 , the authors say , and was therefore probably not caused by man-made greenhouse gases .
Historical evidence of the natural cycle includes a record of floods on the Nile going back 5,000 years ; Roman wine production in Britain in the first century AD ; and thousands of museum paintings that portray sunnier skies during what is called the Medieval Warming , and more clouds during the Little Ice Age .
The authors looked at a raft of studies which , they claim , undermine the " scare - mongering " by those blaming man for destroying the planet .
In the current warming cycle , they say there is evidence that storms and droughts have been fewer and milder ; corals , trees , birds , mammals and butterflies have adapted well ; and sea levels are not rising significantly .
Mr Avery is a fellow of the Hudson Institute , an independent U.S. thinktank that tends to side with big business .
He was a senior agricultural analyst at the State Department when Ronald Reagan was president .
Mr Singer is a climate physicist .
The pair spent months analysing scientific reports for their book , Unstoppable Global Warming : Every 1,500 Years , to counter claims made by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore in his film An Inconvenient Truth .
They argue that variations in the Sun 's radiation have far more influence on our climate than humans .
Mr Singer said : " This can all be explained by the Sun 's activity . "
He added : " The number of the Sun 's cosmic rays hitting the Earth affect the number of low , cooling clouds that reflect solar heat back into space , amplifying small variations in the intensity of the Sun . "

Letter from an
Ohio
Board of Elections (
Holmes
County
) on missing 2004 ballots .
“ Letters from the Edge ” - Part 1
By Michael Collins
“ Scoop ” Independent News
Washington , D.C .
Overall this blatant destruction of evidence only reinforces the widespread belief that the 2004 election was stolen .
Bob Fitrakis and Harvey Wasserman ,
Free Press August 2 , 2007
The 2004 presidential election was mired in controversy all over the country .
Candidate Kerry ’s legion of volunteer lawyers was ready to fight anticipated election fraud .
Serious challenges were defused when Kerry conceded the election in the early morning of November 3 , 2004 .
Failing to recognize that candidates cannot concede the votes of citizens , the news media and political parties called it a night .
Ohio was ground zero for charges of election fraud .
These are ably detailed in several articles and wo n’t be repeated here .
One post election event is worth mentioning .
The March 13 , 2007 Toledo Blade ran this headline at the end of a major trial in Cleveland :
2 election workers get 18 months for rigging presidential recount .
The crime took place in the largest voting district in Ohio , Cuyahoga County , which includes Cleveland .
Election workers created the recount that was n’t thus denying the public of vital information about charges of election fraud .
The tale of the lost ballots and destroyed evidence begins with a law suit brought by citizens against Ohio officials : King Lincoln Bronzeville Neighborhood Association ( KLBNA ) v. Blackwell .
The suit charges Blackwell and other Ohio officials with : “ election fraud , vote dilution , vote suppression , recount fraud and other violations . ”
Specific charges include : “ withholding unused ( unvoted ) ballots ” in response to legitimate requests to review these ballots ; violation of Ohio law by “ breaks in the bipartisan chain of custody ; ” and “ tampering with ballots ” by marking Bush ’s name on ballots with no presidential vote and switching ballots from Kerry to a third party candidate .
Amended Complaint October 9 , 2006
In order to prove their case , plaintiff ’s counsel , noted voting rights attorney Cliff Arnebeck , needed all of the ballots from the 2004 election .
Federal law stipulates a 22 month retention period for all federal elections , as does Ohio law for state elections .
The presiding judge in the case , Algenon L. Marbley , issued a court order on September 6 , 2006 extending the retention requirements for an additional 12 months .
Blackwell was instructed to distribute the order to Ohio ’s boards of elections .
The Judge then ordered that the ballots be turned over to the new Secretary of State , Democrat Jennifer Brunner on April 7 , 2007 .
Brunner sent a request out for the ballot evidence two days later
When the Ohio Secretary of State sent requests for delivery of the ballots , 56 of Ohio ’s 88 counties replied that they no longer had some or all of the ballots requested .
Only 41 bothered to provide an explanatory letter as to the missing ballots .
Fifteen counties offered no reason at all for noncompliance .
Counties failing to return complete sets of ballots accounted for a majority of Ohio ’s 2004 presidential votes .
Federal and State Law on Preserving Ballots
In the section on “ Federal Election Records , ” federal law ( United States Code ) clearly states the rule :

Our old friend and headline - maker is back in the news .
Meteorite ALH84001 — the Mars rock that sent the world of astrobiology into a tizzy back in 1996 — has n’t been just sitting around collecting dust .
Researchers have been re-examining the famous meteorite in an effort to learn more about the early history of Mars .
Not only did ALH84001 help determine that the building blocks of life actually did form on early Mars , but also that those same building blocks have the potential to form on a cold rocky planet anywhere in the Universe .
The meteorite , found in the Alan Hills region of Antarctica , grabbed the headlines over 11 years ago when scientists claimed to have found the remains of bacteria - like life forms within the rock from Mars .
The claims have been hotly debated , with both sides still holding firm in their convictions .
But scientists at the Carnegie Institution ’s Geophysical Laboratory took the research into ALH84001 a step further , and have shown for the first time that building blocks of life formed on Mars early in its history .
Organic compounds that contain carbon and hydrogen form the building blocks of all life here on Earth .
Previously , some scientists thought that organic material in ALH84001 was brought to Mars by meteorite impacts , and others felt the material might have originated from ancient Martian microbes , while still others thought any organics in the rock probably were introduced after it arrived on Earth .
The Carnegie - led team made a comprehensive study of the ALH 84001 meteorite and compared the results with data from related rocks found on Svalbard , Norway .
The Svalbard samples came from volcanoes that erupted in a freezing Arctic climate about 1 million years ago — possibly mimicking conditions on early Mars .
“ Organic material occurs within tiny spheres of carbonate minerals in both the Martian and Earth rocks , â€ ? said Andrew Steele , lead author of the study .
“ We found that the organic material is closely associated with the iron oxide mineral magnetite , which is the key to understanding how these compounds formed . ”
“ The results of this study show that volcanic activity in a freezing climate can produce organic compounds , ” said Hans E.F. Amundsen , a co-author in the study from Earth and Planetary Exploration Services .
“ This implies that building blocks of life can form on cold rocky planets throughout the Universe . ”
The organic material in the Allan Hills meteorite may have formed during two different events .
The first , similar to the Svalbard samples , was during rapid cooling of fluids on Mars .
A second event produced organic material from carbonate minerals during impact ejection of ALH84001 from Mars .
“ Our finding sets the stage for the Mars Science Laboratory ( MSL ) mission in 2009 , ” said Steele , who is a member of the Sample Analysis on Mars ( SAM ) instrument team onboard MSL .
“ We now know that Mars can produce organic compounds .
Part of the mission ’s goal is to identify organic compounds , their sources , and to detect molecules relevant to life .
We know that they are there .
We just have to find them . ”
This makes the MSL mission all the more exciting and anticipated .
And perhaps the team of scientists who made the claims about microbes in ALH 84001 back in 1996 have something to strengthen their case .

Petraeus admits to rise in Iraq violence
By Alexandra Zavis , Los Angeles Times Staff Writer
BAGHDAD — Gen. David H. Petraeus , the top U.S. commander in Iraq , acknowledged today that violence had increased since Sunni Arab militants declared an offensive during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan .
“ Certainly Al Qaeda has had its Ramadan surge , ” Petraeus said in his first comments to reporters since he returned from Washington to give lawmakers a status report on the war in Iraq .
But he said the level of attacks was “ substantially lower ” than during the same period last year .
The Army general said he saw no need to revise the projections he presented to Congress this month for a gradual withdrawal of the additional forces deployed to Iraq as part of the troop buildup .
He did not provide figures .
Militants with the extremist group Al Qaeda in Iraq have launched a string of deadly bombings in recent weeks , including one this week that killed at least 24 people at a reconciliation meeting between Sunni and Shiite tribal , religious , political and security leaders in the Diyala provincial capital , Baqubah .
( Original Article )
I have for some time now publicly articulated my sympathy and support for the state of Israel , even while criticizing those cases that I believed constituted poor judgment and bad policy .
My stance was based upon my past experiences with Israel , which began indirectly in 1990 - 1991 when I was involved in counter - SCUD activities during Operation Desert Shield / Desert Storm , and continued in a much more direct fashion as a weapons inspector with the United Nations Special Commission ( UNSCOM ) , charged with disarming Iraqi weapons of mass destruction .
As a weapons inspector I made numerous visits to Israel for the purpose of coordinating with the Israeli intelligence community on matters pertaining to Iraqi WMD .
I was greatly impressed not only with the professionalism of the Israeli intelligence services , but also with the Israeli people and society .
During my time in Israel , I was witness to numerous horrific events , including several terrorist bombings and the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin .
The resilience of the people of Israel in absorbing these blows yet continuing to live life to its fullest was remarkable , and worthy of admiration .
As a firsthand witness to the remarkable vigor of the Israeli state and its people , and as someone who considers himself to be their friend , it saddens me to see just how poorly the current Israeli government returns this friendship , not to me personally , but to my country , the United States of America .
The government of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has embarked on policies that are questionable at best when one examines them from a purely Israeli standpoint ; they are nothing less than a betrayal of the United States when examined from a broader perspective .
The insidious manner in which the current Israeli government has manipulated the domestic political machinery of the United States to produce support for its policies constitutes nothing less than direct interference in the governance of a sovereign state .
The degree to which the current Israeli government has succeeded in this regard can be tracked not only by the words and actions of the administration of President George W. Bush and the American Congress , but also by the extent to which a pro-Israel lexicon has taken hold within the mainstream media of the United States .
Witness the pro-Israel bias displayed when discussing the situation in southern Lebanon , the air strike in Syria , or the Iranian situation , and the retarding of any effort toward a responsible discussion of anything dealing with Israel becomes apparent .
One would expect such efforts to shape the domestic public opinion of a state deemed hostile , but when the target of these Israeli actions is its ostensible best friend , one must begin to question whether or not the friendship is a one - way street .
And if this is indeed the case , then perhaps it is time for the United States to reconsider its decades - old policy of strategic partnership with Israel .
It must be understood that the government of Ehud Olmert is acting in a post - 9/11 environment , with considerable facilitators in the administration of President Bush , including the vice president .
These two factors combine to create a cycle of enablement that allows a purely Israeli point of view to dominate American policy .
If the Israeli point of view were built on logic , compassion , and the rule of law , then this tilt would not constitute a problem .
But the Israeli point of view is increasingly constructed on a foundation of intolerance and irresponsible unilateralism that divorces the country from global norms .
In this day and age of nuclear nonproliferation , the undeclared nuclear arsenal of Israel stands as perhaps the most egregious example of how an Israel - only standard destabilizes the Middle East .
It is the Israeli nuclear weapons program , including its strategic delivery systems , that is the core of instability for this very volatile region .
The statements by Israeli officials concerning the recent National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) on Iran and its nuclear program are perhaps the best manifestation of this reality .
Avi Dichter , Israel ’s public security minister , has condemned the NIE as a flawed document , and in terms that link the American analysis to a cause - and - effect cycle that could lead the Middle East down the path of regional war .
Like many Israelis , including the prime minister , Dichter disagrees with the American NIE on Iran , in particular the finding that Iran ceased its nuclear weapons program in 2003 .
The Israelis hold that this program is still active , despite the fact that the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) has reached a conclusion similar to the NIE ’s based upon its own exhaustive inspection activities inside Iran over the past five years .
In threatening the world with war because America opted for once to embrace fact instead of fiction , Israel , sadly , has become like a cornered beast , lashing out at any and all it perceives to threaten its security interests .
The current Israeli definition of what constitutes its security interests is so broad as to preclude any difference of opinion .
Israel ’s shameless invocations of the Holocaust to defend its actions not only shames the memory of those murdered over 60 years ago , but ironically dilutes the impact of that memory by linking it with current policies that are cruel and intolerant .
The message of Holocaust remembrance should be " never again , " not just in terms of the persecution of Jews , but in terms of man ’s inhumanity to man .
The birth of the Israeli state , as imperfect and controversial as it was , served as a foundation for the pursuit of tolerance .
However , Israel ’s current policies , rooted in ethnic and religious hatred , are the antithesis of tolerance .
Israel at present can have no friends , because Israel does not know how to be a friend .
Driven by xenophobic paranoia and historical grievances , Israel is embarked on a path that can only lead to death and destruction .
This is a path the United States should not tread .
I have always taken the position that Israel is a friend of the United States , and that friends should always stand up for one another , even in difficult times .
I have also noted that , to quote a phrase well known in America , friends do n’t let friends drive drunk , and that for some time now Israel has been drunk on arrogance and power .
As a friend , I have believed the best course of action for the United States to take would be that which helped remove the keys from the ignition of the policy vehicle Israel is steering toward the edge of the abyss .
Now it seems our old friend is holding a pistol to our head , demanding that we stop interfering with the vehicle ’s operation and preventing us from getting out of the car .
This is not the action of a friend , and it can no longer be tolerated .
It is time for what those who are familiar with dependency issues would term an intervention .
Like a child too long spoiled by an inattentive parent , Israel has grown accustomed to American largess , to the point that it is addicted to an American aid package that is largely responsible for keeping the Israeli economy afloat .
This aid must be reconsidered in its entirety .
The day of the free ride must come to an end .
The United States must redefine its national security priorities in the Middle East and position Israel accordingly .
At the very least , American aid must be linked to Israeli behavior modification .
The standards America applies to other nations around the world when it comes to receiving aid must likewise apply to Israel .
Let there be no doubt : Israel and its considerable lobby of supporters here in America will scream bloody murder if their aid is trimmed in any fashion .
But in the greater interest of what will best benefit the security interests of the United States , and indeed the Middle East and the entire world , the grip Israel has on American policymaking must come to an end .
It is up to the American people to make this change , first and foremost by recognizing that a real problem exists in American - Israeli relations , then by electing officials to Congress who will deal responsibly with these problems based not on the behind - the - scenes lobbying of Israel and its proxies , but rather the legitimate interests of the United States .
If Israel decides it wants to be our friend , then it will change its behavior accordingly .
Absent this , America has no choice but to declare its independence from a relationship that has destroyed our credibility around the world and drags us dangerously down the path toward another irresponsible military misadventure in the Middle East .
If , in the future , Israel desires to reestablish a relationship with the United States built upon the principles of mutual trust and benefit , then so be it .
Such a relationship is something I could embrace without hesitation .
But one thing is certain : no such friendship can truly exist under the conditions and terms that are in place today , and for that reason the entirety of the American - Israeli relationship must be reexamined .
A new weapon in the Bay Area 's fight to preserve its military history was unveiled Sunday afternoon .
It 's called Battery Townsley - a refurbished World War II underground fort in the Marin Headlands .
About 200 volunteers , history buffs , hikers passing by and relatives of those who were stationed atop this wind - swept hill overlooking Fort Cronkhite soldiered through the chilly weather for a ribbon - cutting ceremony and re-opening of the once top secret military big - gun emplacement .
Battery Townsley was built between 1938 and 1940 while war raged on the other side of the Pacific and the U.S. government decided it needed to better protect its coast .
In its glory days , Townsley had two 16 - inch guns that could fire a one - ton shell at a battleship 25 miles away .
Battery Townsley was kept such a secret that the descendants of the man who it was named after did n't even know about it .
" I have n't the foggiest idea how his name was chosen , " said retired Col. Edwin Townsley with a laugh .
His grandfather , World War I Maj.
Gen. Clarence P. Townsley , is the fort 's namesake .
The colonel came from Maryland to attend the dedication along with several other Townsleys .
" We only found out about this place after a friend of my son sent us a picture of it about 14 years ago , " he said .
That picture would have been of a dilapidated Battery Townsley , which had been battered with graffiti , broken beer bottles , mouse droppings and years of neglect .
It was closed to the public in the early '90s .
Thanks to a bequest made by the late Chuck Wofford , a former National Park Service volunteer who fell in love with Battery Townsley 's mysterious maze of concrete and steel , the gun emplacement is now cleaned up and open to the public .
The mostly volunteer effort took 21/2 years and about $ 150,000 to complete with oversight from the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy , according to John Martini , a retired park ranger and a leading volunteer of the restoration .
" World War II changed everything , " Park Service historian Stephen Haller said during the ceremony .
" In an age of global threat , this is an early still frame in an unruly movie that we 're all still a part of .
This was seacoast defense at its most advanced . "
Janet Santiestevan was 10 years old living in San Francisco 's Presidio when Pearl Harbor was bombed .
That day she remembers her father , an army commander , hurrying off to a secret place in the Marin hills .
" My father , John Schonher , disappeared for three weeks , and I later found out he was camped inside here with his men the whole time , " said an emotional Santiestevan , who , along with a group of 30 relatives , attended the ceremony and toured the grounds .
The crowd spent the afternoon meandering through the battery like a museum , which includes clues to its changing uses .
The gunners at Battery Townsley actively tested the artillery during World War II .
By the 1950s , the guns were scrapped and the space was used for living quarters for soldiers .
During the Cold War , it was used as an underground testing facility .
And by the 1980s , it was where junior high school kids would use spray paint and firecrackers to take out their aggression .
During the 1950s , a soldier named Howard
Thies would walk by the closed battery on his way down to Fort Cronkhite .
One day , he saw a metal hoist out front .
Figuring it was destined for scrap , he stole it .
" Actually , I guess you could say I borrowed it , " said Thies , who drove from Texas to Battery Townsley to return the artifact to the Park Service .

TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iranian police have closed down 24 Internet cafes and other coffee shops in as many hours , detaining 23 people , as part of a broad crackdown on immoral behaviour in the Islamic state , official media said on Sunday .
The action in Tehran province was the latest move in a campaign against fashion and other practices deemed incompatible with Islamic values , including women flouting strict dress codes and barber shops offering men Western hair styles .
“ Using immoral computer games , storing obscene photos ... and the presence of women wearing improper hijab were among the reasons why they have been closed down , ” Colonel Nader Sarkari , a provincial police commander , said .
Since Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won the presidency in 2005 , promising a return to the values of the 1979 Islamic revolution , hardliners have pressed for tighter controls on “ immoral behaviour ” .
Sarkari told the official IRNA news agency that police had inspected 435 coffee shops in the past 24 hours , and 170 had been warned .
The report did not make clear whether they were all Internet cafes , which have mushroomed in Iran over the past few years and are popular especially among young people .
Police were not immediately available for comment .
“ Twenty - three people were detained , ” Sarkari said , adding 11 of them were women .
Many young Iranians are avid users of the Internet , some using chat rooms to socialise with the opposite sex .
Mingling between sexes outside marriage is banned and many Web sites considered unIslamic are blocked by the authorities .
The cafe crackdown coincides with a winter campaign against women wearing tight trousers tucked into long boots and other “ improper dress ” such as short overcoats and hats instead of scarves .
Enforcement of Islamic dress codes that require women to cover their hair and disguise the shape of their bodies has become stricter since 2005 , following eight years of reformist rule .
Police regularly clamp down on skimpier clothing and looser headscarves in the summer , but usually for only a few weeks .
This year the campaign has run into the winter .
Women found dressing inappropriately may be warned and repeat offenders can be taken to a police station and fined .
“ Our people want their women to be able to go in the streets with respect and want their dignity to be protected , ” senior Iranian cleric Ahmad Khatami told worshippers in Tehran on Friday .
“ Our people want the society to be morally clean . ”
In a separate campaign , IRNA said police had inspected 275 restaurants in the capital to check compliance with a new ban on smoking in public places .
The ban includes water pipes , known in Iran as qalyan , offered in some outlets .
Of those , 138 received a warning and 17 were shut down , police official Mohammad Reza Alipour said .
Al Qaeda 's economic war against the United States
Although battlefield victories are crucial , history shows that global wars have been decided on a different kind of front : the war between economic powers .
World War II soldiers clashed on the beaches of Normandy and Guadalcanal , but only when the German and Japanese war industries ran out of cash and raw materials did the wheels of the Whehrmacht and the Imperial Army finally grind to a halt .
The Cold War could have gone on for decades if not for the depletion of the Kremlin 's coffers .
The war on radical Islam is no different .
Osama bin Laden plans strategies based on his victory over the Soviets in Afghanistan during the 1980s .
Feasibility aside , he believes the way to bring down a superpower is to weaken its economy through protracted guerilla warfare .
We " bled Russia for ten years until it went bankrupt and was forced to withdraw in defeat , " bin Laden boasted in his October 2004 videotape .
The October video , released just before the U.S. election , offers a glimpse into the jihadist strategy .
" We are continuing in the same policy to make America bleed profusely to the point of bankruptcy , " said bin Laden .
His logic is simple :
To bring the U.S. to suffer a fate similar to that of the Soviet Union , the terrorists need to drain America 's resources and bring it to the point it can no longer afford to preserve its military and economic dominance .
As the U.S. loses standing in the Middle East , the jihadists can gain ground and remove from power regimes they view as corrupt and illegitimate while defeating other infidels who inhabit the land of Islam .
Three methods comprise Al Qaeda 's economic war against the U.S.
The first is the destruction of high - cost qualitative targets by low - cost qualitative means .
The 2001 attack on the World Trade Center is a perfect example of how terrorists can get more bang for their cheap buck .
Bin Laden cited estimates that Al Qaeda spent $ 500,000 to carry out the attacks of September 11 , which caused America to lose more than $ 500 billion .
" Every dollar of Al Qaeda defeated a million [ U.S. ] dollars , " bin Laden concluded .
Bin Laden 's second form of economic warfare involves forcing the U.S. to sink unsustainable amounts of funding into its defense agencies .
The more the U.S. invests in defense , the more its domestic investment suffers neglect .
Not much is needed , bin Laden reasons , to provoke America into expensive military interventions : " All that we have to do is to send two mujahedeen to the furthest point east to raise a piece of cloth on which is written Al Qaeda , in order to make generals race there to cause America to suffer human , economic and political losses without their achieving anything . "
Bin Laden exaggerates -- but there 's no denying the fact that between 2001 and 2004 U.S. military spending grew by more than one fourth since 9/11 .
America now spends an extra $ 100 billion per year on its military .
Add to this the creation of a $ 30 billion - per- year Department of Homeland Security , and the billions directed to the State Department and other agencies aiding allies in the War on Terror and we discover a price tag of at least $ 150 billion annually to defend the U.S. against terrorism .
Oil , which jihadists call " the provision line and the feeding to the artery of the life of the crusader 's nation , " is the third component of bin Laden 's strategy .
Oil facilities and oil workers have been attacked around the world .
In Iraq more than 190 attacks targeted oil pipelines .
Rising oil prices partly reflect the " fear premium " added by oil terrorism .
For the U.S. , an importer of more than 10 million barrels a day , the spike in oil prices means a loss of over $ 50 billion in one year .
The cause and effect are not lost on terrorists .
" We call our brothers in the battlefields to direct some of their great efforts towards the oil wells and pipelines , " reads a jihadist website .
" The killing of 10 American soldiers is nothing compared to the impact of the rise in oil prices on America and the disruption that it causes in the international economy . "
Attacks on oil serve jihadists in another , subtler way .
Higher oil prices mean a historic transfer of wealth from oil - consuming countries -- primarily the U.S. -- to the Muslim world , where three quarters of global oil reserves are concentrated .
This year , oil - producing Gulf nations increased their oil revenues by 45 percent .
The windfall benefits jihadists as petrodollars trickle their way through charities and government handouts to madrassas and mosques .
Skyrocketing defense funding have already created the highest deficit since World War II and a national debt edging on its statutory limit .
But despite Al Qaeda 's pricks , our economy is still robust and the attempts to cripple it seem like a fantasy .
The billions of petrodollars flowing from the U.S. are eventually recycled as oil - producing countries buy American goods , services , and treasury bonds .
This fortunate situation could change , though , if relations between the U.S. and the Muslim world continue to deteriorate .
The Saudis worry that we might freeze their assets in the wake of another terrorist attack .
Anti-American sentiment could inspire Muslim countries to shun the U.S. dollar , perhaps by shifting transactions to the Euro .
OPEC is already considering switching to the Euro as its currency of choice for oil sales .
Other Muslim countries contemplate using the gold dinar , a new gold - backed currency to be used in transactions among 57 Muslim states .
Each of these moves would fulfill jihadists wishes .
Because of oil 's role in the War on Terror , the U.S. stands to benefit enormously from reducing its dependence on petroleum .
A coalition of Washington think tanks has shown that the U.S. can cut oil imports by half within two decades by deploying available technologies .
This $ 12 billion " Set America Free " proposal enumerates ways to increase fuel efficiency and use domestically produced fuels that are not petroleum - based .
If we stay on the present course , America will bleed more dollars each year as its enemies gather strength .
A smart combination of military and energy policies is our best hope for breaking the economic backbone of Al Qaeda -- before the jihadists do so to us .

Near - death events have triggered out - of - body experiences
The experiments , described in the Science journal , offer a scientific explanation for a phenomenon experienced by one in 10 people .
Two teams used virtual reality goggles to con the brain into thinking the body was located elsewhere .
The visual illusion plus the feel of their real bodies being touched made volunteers sense that they had moved outside of their physical bodies .
The researchers say their findings could have practical applications , such as helping take video games to the next level of virtuality so the players feel as if they are actually inside the game .
Clinically , surgeons might also be able to perform operations on patients thousands of miles away by controlling a robotic virtual self .
Teleported
For some , out - of - body experiences or OBEs occurs spontaneously , while for others it is linked to dangerous circumstances , a near - death experience , a dream - like state or use of alcohol or drugs .
We feel that our self is located where the eyes are
UCL researcher Dr Henrik Ehrsson
One theory is that it is down to how people perceive their own body - those unhappy or less in touch with their body are more likely to have an OBE .
But the two teams , from University College London , UK , and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne , believe there is a neurological explanation .
Their work suggests a disconnection between the brain circuits that process visual and touch sensory information may thus be responsible for some OBEs .
In the Swiss experiments , the researchers asked volunteers to stand in front of a camera while wearing video - display goggles .
Through these goggles , the volunteers could see a camera view of their own back - a three - dimensional " virtual own body " that appeared to be standing in front of them .
When the researchers stroked the back of the volunteer with a pen , the volunteer could see their virtual back being stroked either simultaneously or with a time lag .
The volunteers reported that the sensation seemed to be caused by the pen on their virtual back , rather than their real back , making them feel as if the virtual body was their own rather than a hologram .
Volunteers
Even when the camera was switched to film the back of a mannequin being stroked rather than their own back , the volunteers still reported feeling as if the virtual mannequin body was their own .
And when the researchers switched off the goggles , guided the volunteers back a few paces , and then asked them to walk back to where they had been standing , the volunteers overshot the target , returning nearer to the position of their " virtual self " .
Dr Henrik Ehrsson , who led the UCL research , used a similar set - up in his tests and found volunteers had a physiological response - increased skin sweating - when they felt their virtual self was being threatened - appearing to be hit with a hammer .
Dr Ehrsson said : " This experiment suggests that the first - person visual perspective is critically important for the in - body experience .
In other words , we feel that our self is located where the eyes are . "
Dr Susan Blackmore , psychologist and visiting lecturer at the University of the West of England , said : " This has at last brought OBEs into the lab and tested one of the main theories of how they occur .
" Scientists have long suspected that the clue to these extraordinary , and sometimes life - changing , experiences lies in disrupting our normal illusion of being a self behind our eyes , and replacing it with a new viewpoint from above or behind . "

Former president Bill Clinton uses DCCC email to urge all those loyal to the royal family to send his wife , the Senator from New York , birthday wishes on her 60th birthday :
In 36 years , Hillary and I have shared a lot of birthdays , and each year I 'm amazed at everything she has accomplished .
This is a very special year : we 're celebrating Hillary 's 60th , and I hope you 'll join me in sending her a birthday message , sharing your wishes for her and your hopes for the coming year .
I 'll make sure to share your message with Hillary .
And please encourage your friends and family to send their messages as well .
You can see my birthday message to Hillary and add your own here :
Click here to sign the card I know how happy Hillary will be to hear from you on her birthday .
Thank you for helping me to make her day special .
Sincerely , Bill Clinton
And so , in the middle of a primary campaign , the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee sends out a message from a former president touting everything one candidate has accomplished , who happens to be his wife .
You think a former president would be using the DCCC to send birthday wishes to any other of the candidates ?
You think the DCCC would let him ?
And so our pseudo - monarchy deepens .
Imagine the pardons when both of them can dole them out as Queen and Prince Consort .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Python and vim :
Two great tastes that go great together Sean Reifschneider tummy.com , ltd .
And now for something completely different ...
Presentation Overview
10 to 15 minutes of slides and examples .
15 to 20 minutes audience - directed .
What ?
Python scripting in vim .
( Not coding Python with vim )
vim compiled with " + python "
As present in :
Fedora / CentOS ( vim- enhanced )
Debian / Ubuntu ( vim - python )
" Macros " in vim , but with a serious language behind them
Like Emacs use of LISP ( but , you know , better :-)
More powerful than " vim script "
Much more familiar to Python programmers than " vim script "
Example : Auto Indentation Settings
" indent.vimrc autocmd BufRead * python setIndentation ( ) python << EOF def setIndentation ( ) : import vim maxSearch = 1000 # max number of lines to search through indentSpaces = None cb = vim.current.buffer indentCount = { ' ' : 0 , '\t ' : 0 } justSawDefOrClassLine = 0 for i in xrange ( 0 , min( maxSearch , len( cb ) ) ) : line = cb[ i ] if not line : continue
Example : Auto Indentation Settings ( cont )
# for i in xrange ( 0 , min( maxSearch , len( cb ) ) ) : [ CONTINUED ] # count spaces after a class or def line if justSawDefOrClassLine : justSawDefOrClassLine = 0 if line [ 0 ] == ' ' : indentSpaces = 0 for c in line : if c != ' ' : break indentSpaces = indentSpaces + 1 if line [ : 4 ] == ' def ' or line [ : 6 ] == ' class ': justSawDefOrClassLine = 1
vim script

Here is a list of great programming quotes from my readings over the last year .
It is interesting to note that most of my reading material this year has been from blogs .
There are just a great amount of programmer bloggers writing a lot of informative tutorials on every programming language , paradigm shift , and framework under the sun .
in my experience , one of the most significant problems in software development is assuming .
If you assume a method will passed the right parameter value , the method will fail .

FRANKFURT ( Reuters ) - A global response to climate change will spur a business revolution bigger than the internet , said co-founder of Sun Microsystems Bill Joy .

A global response to climate change will spur a business revolution bigger than the internet , said co-founder of Sun Microsystems Bill Joy .
REUTERS / Keith Bedford
“ This is a much larger opportunity , ” he told Reuters , pointing to the scale of the problem and the profits to be made from simple steps like a more careful use of energy .
“ It ’s profitable to be more efficient , it has a negative cost and a competitive disadvantage if you do n’t do it . ”
“ You can sensibly adopt old technology , not drive a truck , or insulate your house , ” he said , speaking on the fringes of the Cleantech investor conference in Frankfurt .
Joy made his name creating and developing computer operating systems and microprocessors , for example helping to design the Java programming language .
Most scientists agree that climate change is being caused by mankind ’s emissions of greenhouse gases , especially the carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels such as coal and oil .
Using the example of the car industry , Joy saw the response in three parts : first using old technologies like smaller , more efficient cars ; second adopting emerging technologies like “ hybrid ” , part - electric cars ; and third researching breakthroughs such as transport fuels derived from farm waste .
Climate change would spur innovation and California ’s Silicon Valley , which originally served the semiconductor industry , was well placed to benefit , he said .
“ Solar cells are semiconductors , heat to electricity is semiconductors , software to manage systems comes out of Silicon Valley , ” said Joy , who is now a partner at venture capital investors Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers ( KPCB ) .
A global race is on to be first to commercialize breakthrough technologies which could make deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions .
Research into safer , rechargeable lithium batteries is taking place mainly in the United States and Canada , but innovation in small electric cars is centered in Asia and Europe , he said .
“ Smart people are everywhere . ”
Future breakthroughs will include more efficient solar cells that convert waste heat to electricity , and manipulation of catalysts at the ultra-tiny , or nano , scale to cut costs .
Climate change will create business losers , too : for example among U.S. car manufacturers which have resisted fuel efficiency standards , Joy reckoned .
“ They lobbied Washington against innovation .
The industry is now really in trouble , the car companies did n’t innovate .
Everyone ’s basically driving a truck . ”
On a sultry day last summer as I walked along a narrow street in my Long Island village of Sag Harbor , I stopped to watch two boys not yet in their teens jousting with their bicycles , not astride them like knights but on foot , like antlered stags , thrusting their bikes at each other , parrying the blows by twisting their front wheels this way and that , their shirts drenched with sweat , their knees bloody , when they might more rationally have spent the day at the beach .
On the curb stood two girls , transfixed , for whose sake this triumph of primal instinct over common sense — this mini-Iliad — was performed , a microcosm of our Hobbesian history and a warning to those who hope for a rational solution to the apocalyptic problem of nuclear proliferation .
The Seventh Decade : The New Shape of Nuclear Danger By Jonathan Schell Metropolitan Books , 272 pages Arsenals of Folly : The Making of the Nuclear Arms Race By Richard Rhodes Knopf , 400 pages
In “ Arsenals of Folly : The Making of the Nuclear Arms Race , ” the third installment of his projected four - volume history of the nuclear age , Richard Rhodes reports that by the mid-1980s the world ’s total nuclear stockpile had “ increased to about 50,000 bombs and warheads with a combined explosive force of about 22,500 million tons of TNT , equivalent to fifteen million Hiroshimas , ” the product mainly of a relative handful of maniacs in the Soviet Union and the United States working in secret with the explicit support of their respective governments and the tacit permission or indifference of their fellow citizens .
Faced with this genocidal absurdity , Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev proposed in Reykjavik in 1986 to entirely abolish their nuclear arsenals .
( Reagan further proposed that a party be thrown for the world when the last weapon was scrapped . )
Alas , no sooner had the two leaders celebrated their epochal agreement than it fell apart over Reagan ’s foolish determination to continue testing what came to be called “ Star Wars ” — a B - movie fantasy to erect a defensive shield of space - based lasers against hostile nukes .
Gorbachev , probably aware that Reagan ’s Strategic Defense Initiative , or SDI as it was called , was nonsense , nevertheless refused to countenance space - based weapons even as fantasy , perhaps anticipating opposition from his own military - industrial complex if he returned to Moscow with an agreement to scrap Soviet nukes while letting Reagan try to weaponize space .
Forty - four billion dollars later , SDI was finally abandoned in 1993 , but at Reykjavik it provided the American war party a more valuable service than that for which it was intended :
It killed the slight but real possibility that the two leaders could sell their grand démarche to their respective bureaucracies .
It was Richard Perle , the warmonger ’s warmonger , who poisoned the chalice when he convinced Reagan at Reykjavik that Gorbachev ’s demand that SDI experiments be confined to the laboratory rather than be performed in space would render the entire project impossible .
Though Perle must have known , as many others did by this time , that SDI was a joke , he considered “ his successful frustration of agreements at Reykjavik one of his most important achievements , ” according to Thomas Graham , general counsel to the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency at the time .
Should worse come to worst , what ’s left of humanity can thank Richard Perle for destroying their world .
For years the Committee on the Present Danger , which included , among others , Perle , Paul Wolfowitz , Richard Pipes , Paul Nitze , Jeane Kirkpatrick , and Caspar Weinberger , had pampered the military - industrial complex by exaggerating the Soviet threat , despite abundant evidence that the Soviet Union was a dysfunctional bureaucracy precariously sustained by a crumbling economy founded on absurd economic assumptions and burdened by its own voracious military - industrial complex , which , as it was later revealed , had no intention of upending its privileged existence by starting a nuclear war .
It was this threat exaggeration by Perle and others that led to the reciprocal escalations that resulted in the creation of 50,000 nuclear weapons equivalent to 15 million Hiroshimas , which led in turn to the meeting of the leaders at Reykjavic and Perle ’s last - minute intervention to keep the bombs on target .
Rhodes cites considerable evidence , including the testimony of two high - ranking Soviet generals , both of them participants in nuclear war planning during the Cold War , that “ the Soviet government and general staff never followed a first strike doctrine , convinced that nuclear war would cause unacceptable damage to both countries , ” to say nothing of what it would do to themselves .
Nevertheless , the master doomsayer Richard Cheney , serving as Bush 41 ’s secretary of defense , told CNN that Gorbachev was a fraud who would “ ultimately fail and a leader far more hostile to the West would follow . ”
Instead , Gorbachev presided over the liquidation of the Soviet Union and by abandoning his opposition to SDI joined the START talks , which would lead , Rhodes writes , “ to the unilateral initiatives of autumn 1991 , which may fairly be counted as the final , historic acts of demolition in the termination of the superpower nuclear arms race that had burdened and threatened the world since 1949 . ”
Rhodes ends his book on this optimistic note at the end of Bush 41 ’s term , adding that the issue of nuclear abolition “ must be the subject of another ” — and no doubt gloomier — book , for while the Cold War weapons were now being constrained , the Committee on the Present Danger remained on the prowl , rabid as ever in its quest for new threats to exaggerate .
While we await Rhodes ’ account of these hobgoblins in his next book , we have Jonathan Schell ’s appropriately grim “ The Seventh Decade : The New Shape of Nuclear Danger , ” which takes matters to the present day .
Schell writes : “ [ George W. ]
Bush ’s demotion of diplomatic treaties and his elevation of force … tore at the web of arms control treaties that had grown up over four decades .
…
He declined to revive the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty … and … announced the United States withdrawal from the Anti Ballistic Missile Treaty .
He also … weakened the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and left it to Under Secretary of State John Bolton to declare that ‘ obligations of the nuclear powers to fulfill their disarmament commitments under Article Six ( of the NPT ) ‘ did not exist , ’ ” though any reading of the treaty would show that they did , if only in the breach .
On the eve of the Iraq war , Richard Perle , expounding the revolutionary essence of the Bush Doctrine , wrote : “ Saddam Hussein ’s reign of terror is about to end .
He will go quickly but not alone … he will take the UN down with him . …
What will die is the fantasy of the UN as the foundation of a new world order … the liberal conceit of safety through international law administered by international institutions , ” echoing perhaps inadvertently the disdain for the liberal conceit of the League of Nations by the would - be empires of the 1930s : Japan over its conquest of Manchuria , Germany over its occupation of the Ruhr , and Italy over its invasion of Ethiopia .
What Perle saw instead of the liberal conceit of international law was an American new world order sustained not by treaty but by power : the fantasy of an American empire which for the moment lies smoldering in the wreckage of the Bush administration .
The United States and Russia hold nearly all the 27,000 nuclear weapons that currently exist , the larger part belonging to Russia while the American holdings are being modernized as a smaller but more powerful and flexible force .
Further reductions are promised .
But this démarche reflects more efficient packaging , not a significant reduction of overkill .
A redesigned weapon the size of an artillery shell can now vaporize a major city : A few of them would obliterate New York or Los Angeles .
A hundred or so would destroy life on Earth .
With the Cold War ended , however , the purpose of these weapons has become obscure .
With Talmudic intensity , Schell examines the administration ’s Nuclear Posture Review of 2001 to learn the strategic policy by which these thousands of refurbished weapons are to be disposed .
But “ when it came to describing what mission the still immense arsenal would serve , the document [ withdraws ] into extreme generalities . ”
Nevertheless , from the “ verbal mist of the NPR the … purpose of the American nuclear arsenal in the post Cold War era emerged : to dissuade , deter , defeat or annihilate — preventively , preemptively or in retaliation — any nation or other grouping of people … that militarily opposed or dreamed of opposing the United States . ”
The Seventh Decade : The New Shape of Nuclear Danger By Jonathan Schell Metropolitan Books , 272 pages Arsenals of Folly : The Making of the Nuclear Arms Race By Richard Rhodes Knopf , 400 pages
But for all his effort Schell still cannot say how an arsenal of 10,000 or so nuclear weapons , equal to several million Hiroshimas , can implement such a policy , nor can Linton Brooks , who served until January 2007 as director of the Energy Department ’s National Nuclear Security Administration , which oversees the nation ’s nuclear weapons infrastructure .
Before he took this post , Brooks helped produce the January 2001 National Institute of Public Policy study “ Rationale and Requirements for Nuclear Forces and Arms Control , ” which was regarded by many observers as a blueprint for George W. Bush ’s 2002 Nuclear Posture Review .
He was nevertheless dismissed by the Department of Energy in January 2007 , not because he was unable to answer Schell ’s question of how these weapons may be used in any future war , but because he was held responsible for security lapses at the country ’s nuclear labs .
Otherwise he seems to have been an industrious administrator who ordered his staff to “ examine advanced [ thermonuclear ] concepts that could contribute to our nation ’s security . … ”
He went on to say : “ We must … ensure that we close any gaps that may have opened in the past decade in our understanding of the possible military applications of atomic energy .
No novel nuclear weapons concept developed by any other nation should ever come as a technical surprise to us . ”
For Frank von Hippel , a physicist and arms control specialist at Princeton , these orders were “ really very distressing .
They ’re saying , ‘ Go after it guys .
We ’re back in the fifties .
Come up with all the crazy ideas you can , if there are any left out there . ’
This is fossil Cold War mentality surfacing again . ”
Yet Linton Brooks for all his insider ’s knowledge confesses in a speech he gave in January 2007 at a Lawrence Livermore - Los Alamos Conference that he too does n’t know what these militarily useless weapons are for .
“ The biggest question in the area of doctrine and operations — indeed arguably the most important question facing us in any nuclear area — is the fundamental purpose or purposes of nuclear weapons in the 21st Century .
I ’m not thinking of the assure , dissuade , deter and defeat typology .
It is fine at the conceptual level .
Rather I think we lack consensus on the concrete types of situations ( other than the residual role in deterring large scale attack from Russia ) in which nuclear weapons are relevant . ”
Since even Brooks himself does n’t know what to do with these infinitely destructive weapons , the obvious answer is multilateral nuclear disarmament under strict international control .
From a technological point of view , abolition is simply a matter of dismantling the warheads and sequestering the fissile material , far simpler for example than preventing AIDS or preserving what is left of the atmosphere .
The real problem is dismantling the multilateral nuclear bureaucracy , for , as Schell admits , “ now as then [ when Truman decided to drop the bomb ] the easier thing is to go with the momentum . ”
Brooks ends his talk to the nuclear establishment by telling it not to worry .
We may not know what we ’re doing but your jobs are safe : “ The political conditions for abolition are unlikely and the technology to verify abolition does not exist . ”
Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei of the International Atomic Energy Agency might dispute the latter point , and political conditions do change and soon will .
Perhaps in Richard Rhodes ’ fourth and final volume we can all share the optimism that proved premature in his present book , or perhaps not .

Her foster father - a white man in Cairns - and her natural mother - an Aboriginal woman from Aurukun - say they knew something terrible would happen .
They acted on those fears .
Gang rape was a " foreseeable event " , says her foster father , who can not be named because it could identify the girl .
Yet authorities ignored his pleas , returning the girl to Aurukun without telling him .
He says he was told it was to be a four - day visit .
" What weight does my word have as a foster carer ?
I and others believe this event could have been prevented , " he told the Cairns Post newspaper .
The girl 's mother shared his concerns .
According to The Australian , she was aware some of the offenders had been involved in the first assault of her daughter .
" She should never have been allowed to come back from foster care while those boys were still here .
We told that to welfare , " the girl 's mother said .
Last night , Queensland 's Department of Child Safety said the girl was originally taken back only to visit her family and attend a funeral .
Once there , she had refused to leave and jumped out of the car as she was being driven to the airport to return to Cairns .
" The child strongly wanted to remain with her family and her community .
Removal … would have required physical force .
This could have resulted in further trauma and psychological harm , " said the director - general , Norelle Deeth .
Ms Deeth said relatives had told the department they would keep the girl safe .
She would live away from the main community .
But the rape occurred soon after her return .
Her nine attackers would eventually plead guilty before Judge Bradley in the Queensland District Court .
It was during sentencing submissions that their backgrounds emerged as the judge weighed whether to jail them .
Her decision not to - and her comment that the girl had " probably agreed " to have sex - attracted a storm of criticism and prompted a Queensland Government appeal and inquiry .
It was a decision reached after Judge Bradley had listened to evidence on the rapists ' lives and their attitudes to the crime they had committed .
The lawyer for one of the youths , 17 at the time of the rape , spoke of his client 's " great sense of shame " .
But Judge Bradley said the youth " did not appear to show remorse " .
He had said " that having sex with a girl that 's only 10 years old is normal " .
Claims of remorse by another , 20 - year - old Ian Koowarta , were also dismissed .
" Ian did n't feel sorry for the complainant , " the judge said .
Against this she weighed nine troubled pasts .
All had criminal histories .
Only two were schooled beyond year 9 .
Koowarta could n't read or write at all .
The eldest , Raymond Woolla , 26 , was considered intellectually " slow " .
Most of them lived with grandparents because their parents were unable to care for them .
" As far as children go , they have n't been very well looked after , " prosecutor Steve Carter said .
One lawyer said the boys ' families were in " crisis " .
The boys got involved in " drinking or smoking or sniffing or stealing and it becomes quite a vicious cycle " .
Mr Carter told the court " some drastic intervention " was needed if their lives were to be turned around .
He advised Judge Bradley against jail terms .
She accepted that recommendation .
No convictions were recorded for the six youngest .
The older offenders were given suspended sentences .
In its statement last night , the department said the girl was now back in its care , staying with indigenous carers .
She was being educated long - distance and receiving counselling .
It was hoped she would attend school in 2009 .

Will Bicycling to Work Get You Killed ?
Bicycle commuting is on the rise , as evidenced by the following articles in Treehugger.com , the Boston Herald , and USA Today .
But if the idea of hitting the road on two wheels — with little to protect you from cars and trucks but good manners — strikes you as pretty risky , you are n’t so far from the mark .
Per kilometer , cyclists are 12 times more likely than car drivers to suffer a fatal accident , according to Rutgers University urban planner John Pucher and Lewis Dijkstra of the European Commission ( the same study found traveling by foot to be 23 times more dangerous than driving , per kilometer ) .
To put this finding in perspective , there were 785 bicycling fatalities on American roadways in 2005 , compared to 4,881 pedestrian and 43,443 automotive fatalities that same year .
On the other hand , a Danish study found that people who do not bike to work suffer a 39 percent higher mortality rate than those who do .
So , assuming you can avoid a fatal accident on the road , biking to work may actually help you live longer .
The risks associated with cycling decrease dramatically when more cyclists are on the road , and especially when those cyclists obey traffic laws .
This second point is hammered home in this bizarre but brilliant 1963 bike safety film , “ One Got Fat ” ( the eagle — or is it monkey ? — eyed among you will have recognized a clip from this film in the Freakonomics video “ Does Sport Cause Crime “ ) .
One thing “ One Got Fat ” does n’t mention is helmet use — helmets were n’t widely used until the 1970s , and controversy remains over how effective they are in reducing bike fatalities .
( Full disclosure : I bike to work whenever possible , and wear a helmet , an adherent to what a few cyclists I know like to call the Cult of the Styrofoam Talisman . )
So , Freakonomics readers , just how effective are bike helmets ?
Global warming does n't matter except to the extent that it will affect life -- ours and that of all living things on Earth .
And contrary to the latest news , the evidence that global warming will have serious effects on life is thin .
Most evidence suggests the contrary .
Case in point :
This year 's United Nations report on climate change and other documents say that 20% - 30 % of plant and animal species will be threatened with extinction in this century due to global warming -- a truly terrifying thought .
Yet , during the past 2.5 ...
( Fortune Magazine ) -- Touring a drilling site on a dusty mountain plateau above Rifle , Colo. , Harold Vinegar stops , grins and then announces out of the blue , " I love that smell ! "
No , the Royal Dutch Shell chief scientist is not referring to the crisp fragrance of the high desert air or the conifer scent wafting from the nearby stand of evergreens .
Rather , it 's the faint , asphalt - like aroma of oil shale - a sedimentary rock rich in kerogen , a fossil fuel that is now the focus of Shell 's single biggest R&D investment .
Black gold ?
Heated , pumped , piped and refined , this rock could end up in a gas tank .
Harold Vinegar believes he has discovered an efficient way to turn oil shale into common fuels .
The raw materials - or prehistoric detritus - that is oil shale
The first field test in 1981 squeezed out a few cups of good oil and a lot of junk ; 24 years later , Shell was able to produce 1,700 barrels of high - quality oil .
In 2004 , Shell pumped coolant down this well near Rifle , Colo. , to test a method to keep oil from leaching .
Reclamation projects , says Shell , will restore the landscape after extraction .
Environmentalists are not so sure .

FBI and SEC probe into Carl Icahn and golfer Phil Mickelson
Vinegar is the energy industry 's leading expert on the complex petroscience of transforming solid oil shale into synthetic crude - a liquid fuel that can be refined into diesel and gasoline .
The breakthroughs this 58 - year - old physicist has achieved could turn out to be the biggest game changer the American oil industry has seen since crude was discovered near Alaska 's Prudhoe Bay in 1968 .
If that sounds like hyperbole , then consider this : Several hundred feet below where Vinegar is strolling lies the Green River Formation , arguably the largest unconventional oil reserve on the planet .
( " Unconventional oil " encompasses oil shale , Canadian tar sands , and the extra - heavy oils of Venezuela - essentially , anything that is not just pumped to the surface . )
Spanning some 17,000 square miles across parts of Colorado , Utah and Wyoming , this underground lakebed holds at least 800 billion barrels of recoverable oil .
That 's triple the reserves of Saudi Arabia .
The reason you probably have n't heard about the Green River Formation is that most of the methods tried for turning oil shale into oil have been deeply flawed - economically , environmentally or usually both .
Because there have been so many false starts , oil shale tends to get lumped with cold fusion , zero - point energy , and other " miracle " fuels perpetually just over the horizon .
" A lot of other companies have bent their spears trying to do what we 're now doing , " Vinegar says of his 28 - year quest to turn oil shale into a commercial energy source .
" We 're talking about the Holy Grail . "
Unlike the Grail , though , Shell is convinced that oil shale is no myth and that after years of secret research , it is close to achieving this oil - based alchemy .
Shell is not alone in this assessment .
" Harold has broken the code , " says oil shale expert Anton Dammer , director of the U.S. Department of Energy 's Office of Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves .
Vinegar has developed a cutting - edge technology that , according to Shell , will produce large quantities of high - quality oil without ravaging the local environment - and be profitable with prices around $ 30 a barrel .
Now that oil is approaching $ 90 , the odds on Shell 's speculative bet are beginning to look awfully good .
Shell declines to get too specific about how much oil it thinks it can pump at peak production levels , but one DOE study contends that the region can sustain two million barrels a day by 2020 and three million by 2040 .
Other government estimates have posited an upper range of five million .
At that level , Western oil shale would rival the largest oilfields in the world .
Of course , considering the U.S. uses almost 21 million barrels a day and imports about ten million ( and rising ) , even the most optimistic projections do not get the country to the nirvana of " energy independence . "
What oil shale could do , though , is reduce the risk premium built into oil prices because energy traders could rest easy knowing that the flow of oil from Colorado or Utah wo n't ever be cut off by Venezuelan dictators , Nigerian gunmen or strife in the Middle East .
In a broader sense , U.S. energy security lies in diversity of supply , so enhancing domestic sources is appealing .
Oil shale has one other big appeal :
It 's not vulnerable to the steep depletion rates that have afflicted other big oilfields .
Alaskan oil production is now 775,000 barrels a day , down from its peak of two million in 1988 .
In contrast , there 's enough oil shale to maintain high production levels for hundreds of years .
" Companies just are n't discovering new Prudhoe Bays anymore , " says Bear Stearns oil analyst Nicole Decker , who thinks Shell has hit on a breakthrough technology .
" This could be very significant - certainly bigger , to our knowledge , than any new discoveries that might be available globally . "
Vinegar has been visiting northwest Colorado since 1979 .
For most of those years , his friends and co-workers back in Houston , and even his children , had no idea what he was doing there .
They would have been even more mystified had they known that this Brooklyn - raised , Harvard - educated Ph.D. - a man who looks about as outdoorsy as Alan Greenspan in hiking boots - spent many of the project 's early days camped out in rough terrain miles from the nearest motel .
But now the veil of secrecy has lifted .
With some 200 Shell ( Charts ) oil shale patents already filed and approvals needed from Colorado and the U.S. Department of the Interior to proceed with commercial production , Shell knows it has to make the public case for developing the country 's oil shale potential .
So after months of negotiations , Shell and Vinegar agreed to give FORTUNE an exclusive look at a new technology - inelegantly dubbed the In Situ Conversion Process , or ICP - that could vindicate Shell 's 28 - year , $ 200 million ( at least ) bet on oil shale research .
In a nutshell , ICP works like this :
Shell drills 1,800 - foot wells and into them inserts heating rods that raise the temperature of the oil shale to 650 degrees Fahrenheit .
To keep the oil from escaping into the ground water , the heater wells are ringed by freeze walls created by coolant piped deep into the ground ; this freezes the rock and water on the perimeter of the drill site .
Eventually the heat begins to transform the kerogen ( the fossil fuel embedded in the shale ) into oil and natural gas .
After the natural gas is separated , the oil is piped to a refinery to be converted into gasoline and other products
In essence , ICP simply accelerates Mother Nature 's handiwork .
Fifty million years ago , large swaths of what is now northwest Colorado , northeast Utah , and southwest Wyoming were covered by two great lakes .
Algae , leaves and other prehistoric life forms sank to the bottom , leaving behind a thick layer of organic muck .
Starved of oxygen , these sediments could not decay , and periodically they would be covered and compacted by sand and other rock deposits .
Over millions of years , the pressure exerted by the weight of the rock layers transformed the organic layers into kerogen .
In its purest form , kerogen looks like ordinary black rock .
In most parts of the Green River Formation , however , it exists as thin black or dark - gray stripes between lighter - colored layers of limestone or sandstone .
Kerogen is an oil precursor .
So given a few million more years , those layers would morph into an oozing crude .
Of course nobody wants to wait that long , which is why there has been no shortage of attempts over the years to make use of Western oil shale .
The Ute Indians called it " fire rock " and burned it for heating .
Attempts to commercialize oil shale began in the early 20th century and accelerated during the 1970s Middle East oil crisis , when the Carter administration began pouring big money into synthetic fuels .
Military command wants Iraq troops cut by nearly half RAW STORY
Published : Friday August 24 , 2007
Print This Email This
The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is expected to tell President Bush to cut the US footprint in Iraq next year by almost half , according to an article in Friday 's ( registration - restricted ) LA Times .
Officials say Marine Gen. Peter
Pace will convey concerns by the chiefs that keeping in excess of 100,000 troops in Iraq into 2008 will " severely strain " the US armed forces .
This assessment , the paper says , may sow discord with top Bush officials and Bush 's top commander in Iraq , Gen. David Petraeus , who continue to push for more troops .
Interestingly , Pace , who was appointed by President Bush , will not be reappointed when his term comes up in September .
Petraeus will likely back the White House view that a continued surge is required to produce " political progress " in Iraq .
" Pace 's recommendations reflect the views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , who initially expressed private skepticism about the strategy ordered by Bush and directed by Petraeus , before publicly backing it , " according to the Times .
" Any discord among the top U.S. generals could be awkward for Bush , who professes to rely heavily on advice from military leaders , " the paper continues .
" But there also is tremendous pressure for military officers to speak with one voice and defer to Petraeus and other field commanders .
It remains possible that the Joint Chiefs may opt to weaken their stance before approaching Bush .
" According to a senior administration official , the Joint Chiefs in recent weeks have pressed concerns that the Iraq war has degraded the U.S. military 's ability to respond , if needed , to other threats , such as Iran , " the Times reporters add .

Prominent secular and atheist commentators have argued lately that religion “ poisons ” human life and causes endless violence and suffering .
But the poison is n’t religion ; it ’s monotheism .
The polytheistic Greeks did n’t advocate killing those who worshiped different gods , and they did not pretend that their religion provided the right answers .
Their religion made the ancient Greeks aware of their ignorance and weakness , letting them recognize multiple points of view .
There is much we still can learn from these ancient notions of divinity , even if we can agree that the practices of animal sacrifice , deification of leaders and divining the future through animal entrails and bird flights are well lost .
My Hindu students could always see something many scholars miss :
The Greek gods were n’t mere representations of forces in nature but independent beings with transcendent powers who controlled the world and everything in it .
Some of the gods were strictly local , such as the deities of rivers and forests .
Others were universal , such as Zeus , his siblings and his children .
Zeus did not communicate directly with humankind .
But his children -- Athena , Apollo and Dionysus -- played active roles in human life .
Athena was the closest to Zeus of all the gods ; without her aid , none of the great heroes could accomplish anything extraordinary .
Apollo could tell mortals what the future had in store for them .
Dionysus could alter human perception to make people see what ’s not really there .
He was worshiped in antiquity as the god of the theater and of wine .
Today , he would be the god of psychology .
Advertisement
Zeus , the ruler of the gods , retained his power by using his intelligence along with superior force .
Unlike his father ( whom he deposed ) , he did not keep all the power for himself but granted rights and privileges to other gods .
He was not an autocratic ruler but listened to , and was often persuaded by , the other gods .
Openness to discussion and inquiry is a distinguishing feature of Greek theology .
It suggests that collective decisions often lead to a better outcome .
Respect for a diversity of viewpoints informs the cooperative system of government the Athenians called democracy .
Unlike the monotheistic traditions , Greco - Roman polytheism was multicultural .
The Greeks and Romans did not share the narrow view of the ancient Hebrews that a divinity could only be masculine .
Like many other ancient peoples in the eastern Mediterranean , the Greeks recognized female divinities , and they attributed to goddesses almost all of the powers held by the male gods .
The world , as the Greek philosopher Thales wrote , is full of gods , and all deserve respect and honor .
Such a generous understanding of the nature of divinity allowed the ancient Greeks and Romans to accept and respect other people ’s gods and to admire ( rather than despise ) other nations for their own notions of piety .
If the Greeks were in close contact with a particular nation , they gave the foreign gods names of their own gods : the Egyptian goddess Isis was Demeter , Horus was Apollo , and so on .
Thus they incorporated other people ’s gods into their pantheon .
Advertisement
What they did not approve of was atheism , by which they meant refusal to believe in the existence of any gods at all .
One reason many Athenians resented Socrates was that he claimed a divinity spoke with him privately , but he could not name it .
Similarly , when Christians denied the existence of any gods other than their own , the Romans suspected political or seditious motives and persecuted them as enemies of the state .
The existence of many different gods also offers a more plausible account than monotheism of the presence of evil and confusion in the world .
A mortal may have had the support of one god but incur the enmity of another , who could attack when the patron god was away .
The goddess Hera hated the hero Heracles and sent the goddess Madness to make him kill his wife and children .
Heracles ’ father , Zeus , did nothing to stop her , although he did in the end make Heracles immortal .
But in the monotheistic traditions , in which God is omnipresent and always good , mortals must take the blame for whatever goes wrong , even though God permits evil to exist in the world he created .
In the Old Testament , God takes away Job ’s family and his wealth but restores him to prosperity after Job acknowledges God ’s power .
The god of the Hebrews created the Earth for the benefit of humankind .
But as the Greeks saw it , the gods made life hard for humans , did n’t seek to improve the human condition and allowed people to suffer and die .
As a palliative , the gods could offer only to see that great achievement was memorialized .
There was no hope of redemption , no promise of a happy life or rewards after death .
If things did go wrong , as they inevitably did , humans had to seek comfort not from the gods but from other humans .

The separation between humankind and the gods made it possible for humans to complain to the gods without the guilt or fear of reprisal the deity of the Old Testament inspired .
Mortals were free to speculate about the character and intentions of the gods .
By allowing mortals to ask hard questions , Greek theology encouraged them to learn , to seek all the possible causes of events .
Philosophy -- that characteristically Greek invention -- had its roots in such theological inquiry .
As did science .
Paradoxically , the main advantage of ancient Greek religion lies in this ability to recognize and accept human fallibility .
Mortals cannot suppose that they have all the answers .
The people most likely to know what to do are prophets directly inspired by a god .
Yet prophets inevitably meet resistance , because people hear only what they wish to hear , whether or not it is true .
Mortals are particularly prone to error at the moments when they think they know what they are doing .
The gods are fully aware of this human weakness .
If they choose to communicate with mortals , they tend to do so only indirectly , by signs and portents , which mortals often misinterpret .
Ancient Greek religion gives an account of the world that in many respects is more plausible than that offered by the monotheistic traditions .
Greek theology openly discourages blind confidence based on unrealistic hopes that everything will work out in the end .
Such healthy skepticism about human intelligence and achievements has never been needed more than it is today .
Bush applauds Musharraf as he makes himself Pakistan ’s President till 2012
By Keith Jones
3 December 2007
US President George W. Bush was the first foreign leader to congratulate General Pervez Mushraraf after he had himself sworn in Thursday to a further five - year term as Pakistan ’s president .
Musharraf , who seized power in a 1999 military coup , imposed de facto martial law on November 3 , because he feared the country ’s Supreme Court was about to rule that his “ re-election , ” in a sham vote staged a month earlier , violated the constitution .
Under the state of emergency , the top levels of the judiciary have been purged of those deemed by the military as unreliable , thousands of opposition political activists , trade unionists and lawyers have been taken into detention , private broadcasters forced off the air , and government opponents made subject to military trials .
According to a Pakistani government spokesman , Bush telephoned Musharraf Friday and in addition to extending his congratulations “ lauded the president ’s commitment to fight extremism and terrorism . ”
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and other Bush administration spokesmen have heaped praise on Musharraf for formally stepping down as Chief of Pakistan Armed Services Wednesday and for announcing Thursday , soon after being sworn in as a civilian president , that the state of emergency will be lifted December 16 .
These “ are all positive steps that will help get Pakistan back on the pathway to democratic and constitutional rule , ” declared State Department spokesman Sean McCormack , Thursday .
While Washington has been publicly urging Musharraf to lift the emergency and to stage “ free and fair ” national and provincial assembly elections in early January , it has repeatedly made clear its support for Musharraf retaining a pivotal role in Pakistan ’s government — endorsing the sham presidential election , praising the dictator ’s commitment to democracy , and implicitly sanctioning Musharraf ’s purge of the judiciary .
Asked if the US government did not consider Musharraf a “ tainted ” president — given that he was “ elected ” October 6 by legislative assemblies chosen five years ago and in a vote that was rigged by the military and given that he had resorted to martial law to purge the supreme court and thereby quash the constitutional challenges to his election —
McCormack declared , “ Look , we are where we are ...
And it is important that President Musharraf get Pakistan back on the road to constitutional rule and democratic governance , a pathway that he really himself had put Pakistan on since 2001 . ”
Musharraf ’s promise to lift the emergency is far less than it seems .
Key decrees and changes , including the purge of the judiciary , a ban on the broadcast of live political events and severe penalties for press reports that bring the government or army into “ disrepute ” will remain in effect .
Over the weekend Musharraf met with the leaders of the interim provincial governments and instructed them to impose a ban on “ protest demonstrations , rallies and sit-ins ” in the run-up to the elections , which are scheduled for January 8 .
Previously , the government announced that in the name of preventing terrorist attacks all street processions would be banned and campaigning severely limited .
While the government claims to have released several thousand detainees , an untold number remain in jail or under house arrest , including Aitzaz Ahsan , the president of the Supreme Court Bar Association .
Several of the prominent detainees who have been released bear the hallmarks of abuse and maltreatment .
Munir Malik , a leader of the lawyers ’ protest movement , was hospitalized with severe kidney problems after being held in a cell so tiny he could not stretch his legs .
Musharraf ’s choice of December 16 as the day on which he plans to lift martial law is no happenstance .
It is the day after the deadline for candidates to withdraw from the January 8 elections .
His hope is that he can pressure the major opposition parties into contesting the elections and thereby lending his presidential coup legitimacy , with the lifting of martial law offered as a potential inducement .
The Bush administration , for its part , is actively encouraging the opposition parties to work with Musharraf and , as a first step to so doing , to contest the elections .
To this end , US Ambassador Anne Patterson has been making the rounds meeting with leading opposition figures .
According to the Dawn , Paterson will meet today with Nawaz Sharif , the prime minister whom Musharraf deposed in 1999 .
Sharif , albeit not with great conviction , has been promising to lead an opposition boycott of the election .
In the speech meant to inaugurate his second presidential term , Musharraf threatened to crush any boycott , just as he has the democratic aspirations of the Pakistani people for the past eight years : “ No destabilization or hurdle will be allowed in this democratic process . ”
In an interview with the US television network ABC the following day , he amplified this threat saying political protests would not be allowed during Pakistan ’s “ democratic ” elections .
Said Musharraf , “ The opposition , they have all along these five years tried to destabilize me and the government .
You have to understand we do n’t want agitation here ...
Agitation means breaking down everything , burning things .
That can not be allowed . ”
For months the Bush administration has been seeking to recalibrate Pakistan ’s government so as to give it greater popular legitimacy while ensuring that the military , with which the Pentagon has a five decades long partnership , retains effective control .
But the Bush administration ’s plans , which centered on brokering a power - sharing deal between Musharraf and Pakistan People ’s Party life chairperson Benazir Bhutto have repeatedly been upset by the erosion of popular support for Musharraf and the sharp divisions within the Pakistani elite .
While Musharraf boasts of an economic revival , the bulk of the population has seen their livings standards badly eroded by soaring prices and the increasing marketization of life .
And many in the elite resent the extent to which the military and their business cronies have appropriated the fruits of Pakistan ’s capitalist economic expansion .
Musharraf is also increasingly seen as a toady of the Bush administration and an accomplice of its predatory wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
In the view of important sections of the US establishment , the Bush administration has been reckless in so demonstratively supporting the discredited Musharraf .
The US would have more leverage over Islamabad , including in getting it to do its bidding in suppressing pro-Taliban elements , and would not be so popularly identified as a bulwark of militarily rule , argue the Democrats and the New York Times , had the Bush administration begun distancing himself from Musharraf before his regime started to unravel last spring .
Musharraf however is clearly chagrined by the pressure that the Bush administration has placed upon him , first to seek an accommodation with Bhutto and now to step down as head of the army , his one true power base .
In the address inaugurating his second presidential term , Musharraf lashed out at the assembled western diplomats .
He chastised them for “ an unrealistic or even impractical obsession with your form of democracy , human rights and civil liberties , which you have taken centuries to acquire and which you expect us to adopt in a few years , in a few months . ”
“ We want democracy , ” added Musharraf , “ but we will do it our way , as we understand our society , our environment , better than anyone in the West . ”
That Musharraf continues to see his principal constituency to be the military was well - illustrated by the speech he gave the day before , when handing over the post to of army chief to the US - trained General Kayani .
“ I am fortunate , ” said Mushararf , “ to have commanded the best army in the world .
The army is an integrating force , the saviour of Pakistan .
Without this army , the entity of Pakistan cannot exist . ”
While the mass of the Pakistani people are seething with hatred toward the military - dominated government , the opposition parties are preparing to bow to Washington ’s wishes and contest the elections .
Bhutto has announced that her PPP will stand candidates in “ protest ” , claiming that otherwise the pro-Musharraf PML ( Q ) and MQM will have an open field .
After Musharraf announced he will lift the emergency later this month , Bhutto said that she was “ not in a hurry ” to accept Musharraf as a civilian president .
But she has already shown she is willing to collaborate with him .
Under the Bush administration ’s sponsorship , the PPP has been seeking to reach a power - sharing deal with Musharraf and the military for at least the last eight months .
On Friday , the PPP issued an election manifesto chock full of populist phrases and commitments to Pakistani big business , international capital , and the military .
The World Socialist Web Site will have more to say about the PPP manifesto in future articles .
But its right - wing character is summed up in the following passage that could have been penned by one of Tony Blair or Gordon Brown ’s minions :
“ The PPP is proud of being the voice of the poor , the working classes and the middle classes .
Our policies , while dedicated to the underprivileged , created conditions that enabled the business and trading classes to compete in the open market .
The Party will foster a social market economy , a partnership of the public and private sectors , predicated upon a synthesis of economic liberalism with a strong social democratic agenda of Stare responsibilities for satisfying basic human needs ... ”
Nawaz Sharif ’s PML ( N ) is an openly right - wing party and a traditional ally of the military .
Like the PPP , it is opposed to any genuine popular movement against the Musharraf regime for fear of facilitating the masses ’ entry into politics and undermining the army , the bulwark of the privileges of the entire Pakistani elite .
Since returning to Pakistan last week , Sharif has been hedging on his earlier boycott threats , while make a series of statements meant to convince the Bush administration that he can be a reliable ally .
Indeed in an article he penned for the Washington Post , Sharif said of the US , the country that has supported , armed , and financed one military dictatorship in Pakistan after another , “ America has always been a friend of Pakistan .
It is our strategic and natural ally . ”
I wonder how Sean Hannity and Chris Matthews will rationalize this ...

ABC News :
Presidential candidate Rudolph Giuliani hired a Catholic priest to work in his consulting firm months after the priest was accused of sexually molesting two former students and an altar boy and told by the church to stop performing his priestly duties .
The priest , Monsignor Alan Placa , a longtime friend of Giuliani and the priest who officiated at his second wedding to Donna Hanover , continues to work at Giuliani Partners in New York , to the outrage of some of his accusers and victims ' groups , which have begun to protest at Giuliani campaign events .
" This man did unjust things , and he 's being protected and employed and taken care of .
It 's not a good thing , " said one of the accusers , Richard Tollner , who says Placa molested him repeatedly when he was a student at a Long Island , N.Y. Catholic boys high school in 1975 .
At a campaign appearance in Milwaukee last week , Giuliani continued to defend Placa , who he described to reporters as a close friend for 39 years .
" I know the man ; I know who he is , so I support him , " Giuliani said .
" We give some of the worst people in our society the presumption of innocence and benefit of the doubt , " he said .
" And , of course , I 'm going to give that to one of my closest friends . "
We then compared the questionnaire responses with the brain data , and here ’s what we found :
1. Voters sense both peril and promise in party brands .
When we showed subjects the words “ Democrat , ” “ Republican ” and “ independent , ” they exhibited high levels of activity in the part of the brain called the amygdala , indicating anxiety .
The two areas in the brain associated with anxiety and disgust — the amygdala and the insula — were especially active when men viewed “ Republican . ”
But all three labels also elicited some activity in the brain area associated with reward , the ventral striatum , as well as other regions related to desire and feeling connected .
There was only one exception : men showed little response , positive or negative , when viewing “ independent . ”
2. Emotions about Hillary Clinton are mixed .
Voters who rated Mrs. Clinton unfavorably on their questionnaire appeared not entirely comfortable with their assessment .
When viewing images of her , these voters exhibited significant activity in the anterior cingulate cortex , an emotional center of the brain that is aroused when a person feels compelled to act in two different ways but must choose one .
It looked as if they were battling unacknowledged impulses to like Mrs. Clinton .
Subjects who rated her more favorably , in contrast , showed very little activity in this brain area when they viewed pictures of her .
This phenomenon , not found for any other candidate , suggests that Mrs. Clinton may be able to gather support from some swing voters who oppose her if she manages to soften their negative responses to her .
But she may be vulnerable to attacks that seek to reinforce those negative associations .
3. Hillary Clinton and Rudy Giuliani are on opposite sides of the gender divide .
We found indications that Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Giuliani represent two sides of the same coin :
Men show little interest in Mrs. Clinton initially but after watching her video they react positively .
Women respond to her strongly at first , but their interest wanes after they watch her video .
The Project On Government Oversight ( POGO ) has relaunched Fedspending.org as a tool for tracking federal spending and holding agencies accountable for their management of public funds .
POGO took over the site in 2016 from the Center for Effective Government ( formerly OMB Watch ) , which ceased operations .
The relaunch includes the first data update for the site in four years , adding data for contracts and assistance spending through the end of fiscal year 2015 .
The site now provides a window into more than $ 40 trillion in federal spending over 16 years .
The site also remains the only searchable source of Recovery Act spending .
Spending oversight is more important than ever and POGO is excited about FedSpending . org 's role in achieving such oversight going forward .
POGO is exploring options to significantly upgrade and improve the site 's functionality to better serve users and prepare for the expanded data that will be available upon implementation of the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act .

Want to know a secret ?
There were two moments I especially enjoyed at the CNN / YouTube debate -- despite my frustration at some of the questions , and the maldistribution of time .
First , I was pleased at John McCain 's attack , which he clearly had planned .
Not because that sort of stream - of - consciousness nonsense about Hitler and WWII -- when the neocons openly want what they call WW IV !
Are we to forget that the first war crime charged at Nuremberg was waging aggressive war ?
I mean this : mainstream politicians NEVER attack an opponent they think is far behind .
The McCain campaign , we 've heard , is worried sick about New Hampshire , and they thought a slam at me would help .
Ha !
Of course , it only strengthened our forces .
Then , after the debate , Rudy Giuliani walked up to me and said , " Oooh , you sure have a LOT of supporters . "
It ’s only the beginning , I told him .
Indeed , he could have told that by the crowd outside after the debate .
Mitt Romney had a few people , but no one else did .
We , on the other hand , had about 500 enthusiastic revolutionaries , plus a boat , a trolley , and two planes towing lighted signs .
As I looked out at the crowd , I thought : the establishment has no idea of what they are facing .
We have an army of freedom , prosperity , and peace .
As the LA Times political blog noted the other day , the British also thought they had no problem with the Americans -- until Yorktown .
But we have an astoundingly short time before the first contests .
The Iowa caucuses are on January 3 , the New Hampshire primary is on January 8 , and Nevada and South Carolina are both on January 19 .
We have only 30 days to stake our claim to the nomination , and to the new America that restores the ideals of the founders , and leads the world through free enterprise , a sound dollar , the rule of law , and peaceful example .
Not through inflation and bombs .
Help me surprise the neocons and all the establishment with our success .
Help me build the foundation for the America we all want .

Please , help me give it to them , to us , to all Americans to come .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The ascent of the dinosaurs to the throne of the animal kingdom may have been more gradual than previously believed , scientists said on Thursday .
This illustration shows four extinct animals -- two dinosaurs and two more primitive dinosaur relatives -- found at a site in northern New Mexico .
Shown are the dinosaur precursors Dromomeron romeri ( lower left ) and a Silesaurus - like animal ( bottom center ) , and the dinosaurs Chindesaurus bryansmalli ( top center , with prey in its mouth ) and a coelophysoid theropod ( upper right ) .

New fossil discoveries dating from about 215 million years ago showed some of the earliest dinosaurs lived for millions of years side by side with related animals long seen as their ancestors and precursors , scientists said on Thursday .
Many scientists had thought these reptiles -- very much like dinosaurs , but more primitive -- died out around the time of the appearance of the first true dinosaurs , which were dog - sized beasts not giants , roughly 230 million years ago .
“ When dinosaurs first evolved , they were not very common and they were pretty small , ” said Randall Irmis of the University of California - Berkeley , who worked on the study .
“ So they ’re not the dominant predators or creatures on land at all during most of the Triassic .
And it ’s only really until the Jurassic when they really explode in diversity and reach these huge sizes that we ’re so familiar with , ” Irmis added .
Scientists previously hypothesized that the first dinosaurs quickly out - competed their more primitive cousins , known as “ basal dinosauromorphs , ” condemning them to extinction .
But the new findings indicate that any such competition was prolonged .
The newly found fossils from New Mexico dating from the Triassic period showed that the first dinosaurs co-existed with these animals -- “ dinosaur wannabes , ” as one scientist called them -- for perhaps 15 to 20 million years .
“ For the first time , we ’re finding the earliest dinosaurs and their closest relatives together , ” paleontologist Kevin Padian of the University of California - Berkeley , one of the researchers , said in a telephone interview .
“ That tells us that the transition to the beginning of the age of dinosaurs was not a very - rapid affair and that , therefore , it was n’t instant competitive superiority . ”
Irmis said these dinosaur precursors are not thought to have been direct evolutionary ancestors of the dinosaurs but rather having shared a close common ancestor .
NEWLY DISCOVERED BEASTS
The scientists discovered new dinosaur precursors including one 3 to 5 feet long called Dromomeron and another unnamed one about three times larger that walked on four legs and ate plants with a beaked snout .
Relatively small bipedal carnivorous dinosaurs also were found , including Chindesaurus , which measured about 6 feet ( 2 meters ) long , as well as remains of an apparent close relative of the well - known Triassic dinosaur carnivore Coelophysis .
The fossils were found at the Hayden Quarry at Ghost Ranch , a site that over the decades has yielded many exquisite fossils .
For example , hundreds of Coelophysis fossils were found in the 1940s at Ghost Ranch , making it among the best documented of all dinosaurs .
These early Triassic dinosaurs were not the bullies and behemoths that later appeared in the Jurassic period , which started around 200 million years ago .
In fact , they were mere pipsqueaks next to some of their nasty neighbors .
The scientists found remains of crocodile - like phytosaurs up to 25 feet long , and a relative of the equally long and vicious four - legged predator Postosuchus .
The New Mexico site at the time these animals lived was a lush environment with a vast river system , flood plains and forests with towering large conifer trees .
Today we have Part 2 in our exciting 2 part series about the infrastructure that powers Slashdot .
Last week Uriah told us all about the hardware powering the system .
This week , Jamie McCarthy picks up the story and tells us about the software ... from pound to memcached to mysql and more .
Hit that link and read on .
The software side of Slashdot takes over at the point where our load balancers -- described in Friday 's hardware story -- hand off your incoming HTTP request to our pound servers .
Pound is a reverse proxy , which means it does n't service the request itself , it just chooses which web server to hand it off to .
We run 6 pounds , one for HTTPS traffic and the other 5 for regular HTTP .
( Did n't know we support HTTPS , did ya ?
It 's one of the perks for subscribers : you get to read Slashdot on the same webhead that admins use , which is always going to be responsive even during a crush of traffic -- because if it is n't , Rob 's going to breathe down our necks ! )
The pounds send traffic to one of the 16 apaches on our 16 webheads -- 15 regular , and the 1 HTTPS .
Now , pound itself is so undemanding that we run it side - by - side with the apaches .
The HTTPS pound handles SSL itself , handing off a plaintext HTTP request to its machine 's apache , so the apache it redirects traffic to does n't need mod_ssl compiled in .
One less headache !
Of our other 15 webheads , 5 also run a pound , not to distribute load but just for redundancy .
( Trivia : pound normally adds an X - Forwarded - For header , which Slash : : Apache substitutes for the ( internal ) IP of pound itself .
But sometimes if you use a proxy on the internet to do something bad , it will send us an X - Forwarded - For header too , which we use to try to track abuse .
So we patched pound to insert a special X - Forward - Pound header , so it does n't overwrite what may come from an abuser 's proxy . )
The other 15 webheads are segregated by type .
This segregation is mostly what pound is for .
We have 2 webheads for static ( . shtml ) requests , 4 for the dynamic homepage , 6 for dynamic comment - delivery pages ( comments , article , pollBooth.pl ) , and 3 for all other dynamic scripts ( ajax , tags , bookmarks , firehose ) .
We segregate partly so that if there 's a performance problem or a DDoS on a specific page , the rest of the site will remain functional .
We 're constantly changing the code and this sets up " performance firewalls " for when us silly coders decide to write infinite loops .
But we also segregate for efficiency reasons like httpd - level caching , and MaxClients tuning .
Our webhead bottleneck is CPU , not RAM .
We run MaxClients that might seem absurdly low ( 5 - 15 for dynamic webheads , 25 for static ) but our philosophy is if we 're not turning over requests quickly anyway , something 's wrong , and stacking up more requests wo n't help the CPU chew through them any faster .
All the webheads run the same software , which they mount from a /usr / local exported by a read - only NFS machine .
Everyone I 've ever met outside of this company gives an involuntary shudder when NFS is mentioned , and yet we have n't had any problems since shortly after it was set up ( 2002 - ish ) .
I attribute this to a combination of our brilliant sysadmins and the fact that we only export read - only .
The backend task that writes to /usr / local ( to update index. shtml every minute , for example ) runs on the NFS server itself .
The apaches are versions 1.3 , because there 's never been a reason for us to switch to 2.0 .
We compile in mod_perl , and lingerd to free up RAM during delivery , but the only other nonstandard module we use is mod_auth_useragent to keep unfriendly bots away .
Slash does make extensive use of each phase of the request loop ( largely so we can send our 403's to out - of - control bots using a minimum of resources , and so your page is fully on its way while we write to the logging DB ) .
Slash , of course , is the open - source perl code that runs Slashdot .
If you 're thinking of playing around with it , grab a recent copy from CVS : it 's been years since we got around to a tarball release .
The various scripts that handle web requests access the database through Slash 's SQL API , implemented on top of DBD :: mysql ( now maintained , incidentally , by one of the original Slash 1.0 coders ) and of course DBI .
pm .
The most interesting parts of this layer might be :
( a) We do n't use Apache : : DBI .
We use connect_cached , but actually our main connection cache is the global objects that hold the connections .
Some small chunks of data are so frequently used that we keep them around in those objects .
( b) We almost never use statement handles .
We have eleven ways of doing a SELECT and the differences are mostly how we massage the results into the perl data structure they return .
( c) We do n't use placeholders .
Originally because DBD :: mysql did n't take advantage of them , and now because we think any speed increase in a reasonably - optimized web app should be a trivial payoff for non-self - documenting argument order .
Discuss !
(d) We built in replication support .
A database object requested as a reader picks a random slave to read from for the duration of your HTTP request ( or the backend task ) .
We can weight them manually , and we have a task that reweights them automatically .
( If we do something stupid and wedge a slave 's replication thread , every Slash process , across 17 machines , starts throttling back its connections to that machine within 10 seconds .
This was originally written to handle slave DBs getting bogged down by load , but with our new faster DBs , that just never happens , so if a slave falls behind , one of us probably typed something dumb at the mysql > prompt . )
(e) We bolted on memcached support .
Why bolted - on ?
Because back when we first tried memcached , we got a huge performance boost by caching our three big data types ( users , stories , comment text ) and we 're pretty sure additional caching would provide minimal benefit at this point .
Memcached 's main use is to get and set data objects , and Slash does n't really bottleneck that way .
Slash 1.0 was written way back in early 2000 with decent support for get and set methods to abstract objects out of a database ( getDescriptions , subclassed _wheresql ) -- but over the years we 've only used them a few times .
Most data types that are candidates to be objectified either are processed in large numbers ( like tags and comments ) , in ways that would be difficult to do efficiently by subclassing , or have complicated table structures and pre- and post - processing ( like users ) that would make any generic objectification code pretty complicated .
So most data access is done through get and set methods written custom for each data type , or , just as often , through methods that perform one specific update or select .
Overall , we 're pretty happy with the database side of things .
Most tables are fairly well normalized , not fully but mostly , and we 've found this improves performance in most cases .
Even on a fairly large site like Slashdot , with modern hardware and a little thinking ahead , we 're able to push code and schema changes live quickly .
Thanks to running multiple - master replication , we can keep the site fully live even during blocking queries like ALTER TABLE .
After changes go live , we can find performance problem spots and optimize ( which usually means caching , caching , caching , and occasionally multi-pass log processing for things like detecting abuse and picking users out of a hat who get mod points ) .
In fact , I 'll go further than " pretty happy . "
Writing a database - backed web site has changed dramatically over the past seven years .
The database used to be the bottleneck : centralized , hard to expand , slow .
Now even a cheap DB server can run a pretty big site if you code defensively , and thanks to Moore 's Law , memcached , and improvements in open - source database software , that part of the scaling issue is n't really a problem until you 're practically the size of eBay .
It 's an exciting time to be coding web applications .

Yesterday , we asked Daily Kos readers to help name the ever - growing scandal concerning Rudy Giuliani 's expensing of his adultery to the taxpayers of New York , and his subsequent hamfisted attempts to hide his shame .
And as always , you responded with gusto .
We received over 1000 comments on the thread , the vast majority of which were suggested scandal names .
Most of the proposals were very good .
Some were remarkably effective .
But there was one particularly apropos suggestion that tied together the sex , the taxpayer abuse , and the Rudyific Enycean nature of the scandal in a package as pretty as a Manolo Blahnik box .
I refer , of course , to Sex on the City .
Sex on the City : your official 2007 - 08 Rudy sex / money / coverup scandal name !
The provenance of the term Sex on the City is a bit obscure .
The first to propose it in the contest thread was Mr Hinky Dink ( dink ) , but it soon became clear that earlier in the morning , Atrios had used it as a post title .
Yet Atrios would have to concede that Keith Olbermann had used the term the previous night , on Thursday 's Countdown .
But the trail does n't end there -- our own Kagro X appears to have coined Sex on the City Thursday morning , less than 24 hours after the sordid story broke on the pages of the Politico .
Will forensic nomenclaturists find an even earlier occurance of the term ?
Perhaps .
But its popularity , combined with its perfection , led the editors to conclude that it was unquestionably the name for this scandal .
There are a number of terrific runners - up that deeply impressed the panel , and which merit public kudos .
In no particular order , we liked : Mojotroll 's Fornigate ( despite the general prejudice against - gate suffixes ) , Sanuk 's Rudy 's General Erection Fund , and 69/11 ( proposed by any number of commenters , and with an origin as murky as Sex on the City's ) .
But one of the runners - up stood out as being particularly worthy of future use , as it perfectly complements Sex on the City .
I refer to chumley 's America 's Playa , which henceforth will be the official nickname for Rudy during the denouement of the Sex on the City scandal .
( It 's worth noting that chumley is a WGA member .
Could Jay Leno have claimed America 's Playa before DKos , but for the strike ?
We 'll never know . )
So there you have it .
America 's Playa , starring in Sex on the City .
Make sure that you use both terms as often as possible while discussing Rudy 's shame .
We know we will .

So there 's these two stations over on Fort Street near Springwells in Detroit .
One 's a BP and the other 's a Marathon station .
Both are known for offering pretty decent gas prices downtown and we 've bought gas at both stations depending on which station seemed to have the daily price leverage over the other .
But apparently the penny price war between the two stations we 'd always taken advantage of has now gone deadly .
Last night BP station owner Jawad Bazzi got a bullet to the head over a 3 - cent difference in the cost of regular unleaded .
Here 's what we 're told happened :
The Marathon station on Fort near Springwells dropped its price to $ 2.93 .
That angered Jawad Bazzi , whose regular gas was priced at $ 2.96 .
Bazzi walked across the street with a couple of employees to confront the Marathon owner and his posse .
The groups argued , then began throwing punches .
One of Bazzi 's employees hit a Marathon employee with a baseball bat , injuring him .
That 's when the Marathon owner grabbed a handgun and fired three or four times .
Bazzi , 45 , of Dearborn Heights was shot in the head .
The Marathon owner , whose name was n't released Friday , was arrested .
He 's identified as a 51 - year - old Warren man .
Advertisement
We 're told because the Marathon station 's now closed , the price at the BP is now at $ 3.09 for regular .
Somewhere we think Bazzi is smiling .
UPDATE : Will the gas station owner be charged ?
One local Detroit TV station weighs in here .

It ’s so regular you could set your watch by it .
The decay of a community is just as predictable as the decay of certain stable nuclear isotopes .
As soon as an open source project , language , or what - have - you achieves a certain notoriety — its half - life , if you will — they swarm in , seemingly draining the very life out of the community itself .
They are the Help Vampires .
And I ’m here to stop them .
The Help Vampire : A Spotter ’s Guide
Help Vampires are found in every public online community , from those nearest to our hearts to those furthest from our principles .
Instead of consuming of ill - gotten hemoglobin , these vampires suck the very life and energy out of people .
By nature they feed on generous individuals who tend towards helping others , and leave their victims exhausted , bitter and dispirited .
They ’re not evil creatures , Help Vampires .
They act only on their blind instinct to feed , driven by base urges like most living things .
Often even they themselves are not aware of their Help Vampire status , so leave your stakes at home .
In light of these facts , I will provide information on reforming / re-education Help Vampires in addition to outfitting you with information on identifying and tracking them .
If in the course of events you discover that you yourself are a Help Vampire , you will learn how to control your vampiric ways .
Identifying Help Vampires
Identifying Help Vampires can be tricky , because they look like any ordinary person ( or internet user , whichever is lesser ) .
But by closely observing an individual ’s behavior using this handy checklist , you too can identify Help Vampires in the field :
Does he ask the same , tired questions others ask ( at a rate of once or more per minute ) ?
Does he clearly lack the ability or inclination to ask the almighty Google ?
Does he refuse to take the time to ask coherent , specific questions ?
Does he think helping him must be the high point of your day ?
Does he get offensive , as if you need to prove to him why he should use Ruby on Rails ?
Is he obviously just waiting for some poor , well - intentioned person to do all his thinking for him ?
Can you tell he really is n’t interested in having his question answered , so much as getting someone else to do his work ?
Note that I use ‘ he’ here in the general sense even though Help Vampires are almost exclusively male .
It appears that male Help Vampire , drawn as it is to shiny technology , occupies an evolutionary niche that females of the species simply do not find desirable .
Another key indicator for Help Vampires is the clearly stated but “ impossible ” question .
These questions look reasonable on the surface , but in fact they are impossible to answer for a number of reasons .
These questions include , for example , “ How do I build a forum ? ” or “ How can I make a chat site ? ”
Their purpose is threefold :
First , to identify a victim foolish enough to attempt to answer the impossible question
Second , to distract the victim long enough to separate him from his fellows ; and
Lastly , to befuddle the victim ’s brain while their soul is being removed through the abdominal cavity by way of a standard - issue Bendy Straw .
This is autonomous behavior .
Again , we should n’t hate the Help Vampire .
Or stake them .
They know not what they do , only that they are driven to do it , and I believe they can be saved .
Signs of Help Vampire Infestation
The chief indicator of a Help Vampire problem is the lack of helpfulness — the community may still appear to be bustling and lively , but if on closer inspection the conversation is all towards the shallow end of the pool , with moderately difficult questions going unanswered , then a Help Vampire infestation is likely .
Help Vampires are transitory .
They move into a community — as soon as they sense its vibrancy and intelligence .
Often they leave ( “ give up , ” in their eyes ) when they have exhausted all the resources , leaving the community itself drained and adrift .
This behavior incurs a secondary effect which further cripples the community , and persists even after the Help Vampire problem has passed .
Often the “ best and brightest , ” sensing the outflux of decent conversation , retreat into Walled Garden communities which the Help Vampire can rarely penetrate .
In this way the individuals are sheltered from the painful effects of Help Vampire attacks , but they also make themselves inaccessible to non-Help Vampire users as well .
This effect can be the last straw that leaves the community devoid of experts and utterly without hope .
If You ’re a Help Vampire …
Now you know .
Stop .
Of course , it ’s not just that easy , or nobody would ever be a Help Vampire at all .
Before you ask a question in a community , try to find the answer elsewhere .
This way you help yourself by stretching your mind and research abilities , and you learn things more thoroughly too .
Plus it ’s good karma .
Always try these avenues first :
Keep troubleshooting .
Often we learn that it ’s easier to give up and ask for help rather than persisting — when we ’d get our breakthrough if we ’d only delay giving up for another 10 minutes .
Respect yourself , go a little further before giving up .
Google , of course .
Google partial error messages , add software names to your queries , and generally try at least 3 or 4 searches before you give it up as hopeless .
Mailing lists , forums , and newsgroups .
Chances are , you ’re not the first person on the Earth to have this problem .
Luckily we live in an age where we can search the past .
Check out these resources next .
Docs .
Sometimes they seem impenetrable , but give it a whack .
The more you learn , the easier the documentation will be to understand and decipher .
Ask your question — but phrase it differently .
Instead of asking your question directly , ask “ Has anyone has seen this problem ? ” or “ Can anyone point me in the right direction ? ”
Likely as not , someone will have been there before , and they might know a blog posting or other resource which can help you out .
This way , you show you are respectful of their time , and understand your problem is ( probably ) not unique .
When you do ask a question , try to provide as much background detail as possible .
Ask yourself these questions first , so that others do n’t have to :
What version of the software are you running ?
What ’s your operating system ?
What exactly are you trying to do that wo n’t work ?
Is the problem uniform or erratic ?
What ’s the exact error message ?
When did it arise ?
What exactly do n’t you “ get ” ?
Can you provide sample code , ideally with line errors where the error occurs ?
Have code samples at the ready when possible — and when you ’re talking on an IRC channel , put your code samples on a pastebin .
If you ’re posting code from separate parts of a project , label them with comments .
Provide a little bit of a flow description to help familiarize people who do n’t know your code from a hole in the ground .
Reforming the Help Vampire ( e.g. Not You )
You ’ll get good results by following this action plan for solving your community ’s Help Vampire problem :
Create resources for Help Vampires ( and regular folks ) to help themselves .
Cease all behavior which enables Help Vampires ’ vampy behavior .
Meet Help Vampires head - on .
As you can see , none of these steps endorse violence .
There are no stakes , kickboxing moves , or sneaky little ampules of holy water — although witty repartee may be involved .
# 1 : Creating Resources
If your community ’s resources are spread over all the web , not organized or indexed , and generally harder to navigate than a rat ’s nest , then creating a solid help resource should significantly cut down Help Vampire activity .
At the minimum , create a well - organized , preferably community - edited page which clearly lists the following :
A FAQ — with real Frequently Asked Questions , not ones which just sound likely .
And with clearly phrased , actionable ( urgh ) information for each question .
An up - to - date list of errors or pitfalls one is likely to encounter in the current version of the software
List of useful resources , ideally organized by topic ( e.g. “ Installing , ” “ Deployment , ” “ Third - Party Add-ons , ” “ Beginner ’s Tutorials , ” “ Advanced Tutorials , ” etc . )
Some very simple community guidelines .
Most people ( and even Help Vampires ) will behave appropriately , if they only know what appropriately is .
Ideally the Resources page should be just that : a single page .
This makes finding information easy and does n’t require a search engine .
Be nice !
A condescending or cruel tone in Resources page will be very counter - productive .
# 2 : Cease Enabling Behavior
Secondly , you must rid the community of anything which enables Help Vampires to keep being Help Vampires .
Enforce autonomy .
No matter how beneficent you ’re feeling , never directly answer a common question .
This is the lazy way out , and you only enable the Help Vampires instead of truly helping them .
Let the URL to your help resources be your only answer , but tell the vamp you are happy to help if he explores those avenues of self - help and still cannot find an answer .
Foster thinking .
Even if it ’s not a question you see go bye fifty times a day … do n’t answer it with a direct fix ( unless the person is a known non-vamp , or it ’s a real puzzler ) .
Answer with questions to spur ( and guide ) thought .
If the Help Vampire resists thinking or complains , give them the URL for the Resources page and withhold further assistance .
Reward self - help and helping others .
Thank people who ask intelligent questions and do research first , and people who make an effort to help others .
Tell them they ’re a credit to the community .
Be especially generous with praise and emoticons for those who are actively reforming their ways .
Help is a trickle - down economy .
Be friendly .
People and Help Vampires are much more likely to become useful members of the community if they ’re met with kindness and encouragement rather than condescension and spite .
They may seem like nothing but one more in a long strain of know - nothings , but you stand out very distinctly to them .
# 3 : Meet Help Vampires Head-On
And lastly , address the problem directly .
“ You ’re a Help Vampire . ”
Call a spade a spade , and a Help Vampire a Help Vampire .
Tell the vamp you ’ll be glad to have him as a member of your community if he reforms his vampy ways .
And inform him what vampy ways you ’re talking about ( this page is a good way to do that ) .
Be gentle , but firm .
There ’s no reason to yell at a Help Vampire , because they ca n’t help what they are until they know what they are .
Being cruel to a vamp is like baiting wild animals .
Just continue calmly applying the techniques found under # 2 , even if the Help Vampire becomes recalcitrant or angry .
Weed out hopeless cases .
There ’s a small subset of Help Vampires who feel entitled to your entire attention , and have no interest in fulfilling any of your needs .
If you ’ve been calm , exercised all the other techniques , and simply ignored the vamp , and still there is no change in his behavior … just eject him from the community .
This means he wo n’t be interrupting any other exchanges in the future .
Outlook Positive
I felt the need to write this because I think that people are basically good , and basically self - sufficient in the right circumstances .
If we can only make it easy for people to be good , and show them we mean business , we can change the world — or at least our small section of it .

Sorry , Spencer Pratt , Heidi Montag and Dina Lohan .
You 're no longer the most attention - hungry , pathetic people in Hollywood .
That honor can now be applied instead to Tiffany Dupont .
The random , desperate actress sent the following email to Perez Hilton :
My name is Tiffany Dupont from the movie Queen Esther .
I want to let you know a little secret that I do n't care to keep anymore .
I actually slept with Tom Cruise and George Clooney .
I had sex with both of them this past year .
The way I did it was that I actually offered myself to them when I got a chance to meet them hoping that would boost my acting career .
If you want to contact them you can , but like most Hollywood actors they 'll all deny it .
I 've done other shows like the Bedford Diaries and such .
Dupont also included her official website , but we refuse to give this actress any more of the celebrity gosip spotlight she so pathetically craves .
Let 's hope Katie Holmes and Sarah Larson give her a beat down .

With all these new online banks which are pretty much just virtual branches of a lot of regional banks , I thought it would be a good idea to look more into this whole FDIC insurance thing we put so much trust into .
First some quick basics , taken from the FDIC website :
What Does the FDIC Insure ?
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) is a government corporation that insures all deposits at insured banks , including checking and savings accounts , money market deposit accounts , and certificates of deposit ( CDs ) , up to the insurance limit .
Use this form to find out if your bank is insured .
How Much Does It Cover ?
The basic insurance amount is $ 100,000 per depositor per insured bank .
Certain retirement accounts , such as Individual Retirement Accounts , are insured up to $ 250,000 per depositor per insured bank .
Way To Increase Your Coverage
Since accounts at different banks are insured separately , the easiest way to increase your coverage is to simply keep less than $ 100,000 at any one bank .
You could have $ 100,000 each at 500 different banks , and be insured for $ 50 million in total .
You may also qualify for more than $ 100,000 in coverage at one insured bank if you own deposit accounts in different ownership categories .
For example , here is a way that a husband and wife could qualify for $ 600,000 in total insurance all at one bank :
What Happens If My Bank Really Fails ?
First off , I would note that the FDIC does not notify people that their bank is about to fail or has failed .
The only way to you find out is when your debit card gets denied or you walk up to your bank and it has a new name .
Here is a list of banks that have failed since October 2000 , which includes a summary how it was handled .
The Finance Buff has a good post about what happens when your bank goes out of business .
The example given is Metropolitan Savings Bank in Pittsburgh , which the FDIC took over just three months ago .
Here ’s the timeline :
The FDIC announced the bank ’s takeover on Thursday .
By Monday the deposits have been taken over by another bank , the branches were re-opened , and the insured people have access to their money again .
But , out of the $ 12 million in deposits in the bank , there were 30 account holders with total assets of $ 1.2 million not insured by the FDIC .
Those people are now creditors to the receivership of the failed bank , and must wait as the FDIC liquidates the bank ’s remaining assets .
Waiting on the light fixtures to be sold until you can get any of your money back ?
Not good .
The takeaways here are
Benchmarking ray tracing , Haskell vs. OCaml
Use the type Vector to represent vectors instead of a tuple .
This allows the components to be strict .
Use the type Scene instead of a tuple to represent a scene .
The tuple used in the OCaml code uses the dubious feature of equi-recursive types ( even Xavier thinks it 's strange enough to have a flag to enable it ) .
Rewrite the loop that computes a pixel 's value using an accumulating updatable variable into a list comprehension that sums the list .
Finally , the compiler flags needed a bit of tweaking to get good performance , even though " - O3 - funbox - strict - fields - fexcess - precision - optc - ffast - math " were pretty obvious .

On his web site about OCaml Jon Harrop has a benchmark for a simple ray tracing program written in a number of languages .
When I saw it I wondered why Haskell was doing so badly , especially since this benchmark was taken as some kind of proof that Haskell performs poorly in " real life " .
So I have rerun the benchmarks .
I 've also rewritten the Haskell versions of the programs .
The Haskell versions on Jon's web site were OK , but they were too far from the OCaml versions for my taste .
I prefer to keep the programs very similar in a situation like this .
My rewrite of the benchmarks from OCaml to Haskell was done with a minimum of intelligence .
Here are the only things I did that needed creative thought :
In addition to this I made the code look a little more Haskellish , e.g. , using overloading to allowandon vectors .
This is really just minor syntactic changes , but makes the code more readable .
To make the program size comparison fair I removed some dead code from the OCaml code .
I then reran the benchmarks using Haskell , OCaml , and C ++.
The benchmarks are five programs that starts from very simple ray tracing and specializing the program more and more to speed it up .
The numbers are in the tables below .
The time is execution time in second , the characters are non-white characters in the file , and the lines are the number of lines in the file .
To ease comparison I also include the relative numbers compared to OCaml ( smaller numbers are better ) .
Interestingly , and unlike Jon 's benchmark , the Haskell code is always smaller than the OCaml code .
Furthermore , the Haskell code ranges from much faster to slightly faster than the OCaml code .
Again , this is very unlike Jon 's benchmark .
I find the unoptimized version of the benchmark especially interesting since Haskell is 5 times ( ! ) faster than OCaml .
I 've not investigated why , but I suspect laziness .

Some observations
infinity
epsilon_float
Compilation commands : Target architecture is x86 ( even though the processor is x86_64 capable ) .
Haskell should really have the definitions ofandin a library .
They are quite useful .
Also , having them in a library would have made the Haskell code somewhat shorter and faster .
Converting these programs from OCaml to Haskell was very mechanical ; it could almost be done with just sed .
I 'm glad version 5 of the benchmark did n't show much improvement , because it 's a really ugly rewrite . :)
Note that the code is all Haskell98 , no strange extensions ( even though - funbox - strict - fields deviates subtly from H98 ) .
Conclusion
Benchmarking is tricky .
I 'm not sure why my and Jon 's numbers are so different .
Different hardware , slightly different programs , different software .
Haskell is doing just fine against OCaml on this benchmark ; the Haskell programs are always smaller and faster .
Edit : Updated tables with more numbers .
PS : Phil Armstrong wrote the Haskell code on Jon's web site and I took some code from his original .

CINCINNATI ( Reuters ) - Edward Dion Burge had sex with a 15 - year - old girl when he was 24 and has dealt with the consequences ever since : Nearly a year in jail , hate mail and screamed insults from strangers .
A screenshot of the Nationsl Sex Offender Public Website , taken on May 31 , 2007 .
The rules have made some offenders homeless , including five men in Florida who live under a bridge because no legal residence can be found .
But fear and hatred of sexual predators and child rapists leave parents and politicians unsympathetic .

What ’s harder , eight years on , is finding a place to live .
Two years ago , Burge had made a home with his three kids and their mom in Piqua , Ohio , until police stopped by one Sunday afternoon to evict him .
Burge had been out of jail for five years and finished probation , but he was a registered sex offender , and lived too close to a school .
“ They gave me 10 days to move out .
I moved to Dayton , and was ordered to move from there , then to Troy , and was ordered to move , then back to Piqua , and was told I was too close to a football stadium that a school used , ” he said .
“ It ’s been a fight ever since , ” said Burge , who now lives in a separate home near his family .
Burge , 33 , is one of nearly 500,000 registered U.S. sex offenders subject to a growing array of rules about where they can live -- years after they ’ve served their sentence .
The rules have made some offenders homeless , including five men in Florida who live under a bridge because no legal residence can be found .
But fear and hatred of sexual predators and child rapists leave parents and politicians unsympathetic .
“ They committed that crime , that is the penalty that goes with them , ” said Chris Monzel , a councilmen in Cincinnati who pushed for stiffer laws to prevent an influx of sex offenders into his southwest Ohio city .
Like many U.S. cities , Cincinnati prohibits offenders from living within 1,000 feet of a school .
Monzel helped pass a law to expand that to day care , preschools , community centers and public pools -- effectively making 54 percent of the city ’s residential area off - limits .
The increased vigilance has spread across the country .
A 2006 federal law requires offenders to register with police within three months of moving .
Police then notify the community , usually by sending out postcards with the offender ’s name , photo and address .
In addition , some 22 states have laws restricting where offenders can live , and hundreds of local communities have broadened exclusion zones from 1,000 feet to 2,500 feet .
Three states are considering special license plates for offenders ’ cars .
An Ohio legislator has proposed electronic ankle bracelets to monitor their whereabouts .
THE PEDOPHILE AND THE TREE
While sex offender registries have broad support from lawmakers , victim advocates and parents who want to check their neighborhood for dangers , the rules about where an offender can live have garnered mixed reviews .
Florida researcher Jill Levenson , who treats offenders and teaches at Lynn University in Boca Raton , Florida , said residency restrictions may actually make offenders more dangerous .
Transient offenders struggle to hold jobs or stay connected with family -- two factors which could help them resist re-offending , she said .
They also become harder to track .
One of Levenson ’s clients , a mentally ill man who preys on pre-pubescent boys , is registered to live under a tree at night .
He spends his days at his father ’s and would like to live there permanently , but ca n’t -- that home is too close to a high school .
“ So is it better to have a homeless , unmedicated potentially dangerous pedophile under a tree from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. , and wandering around during the day ?
It defies logic , ” Levenson said .
She said the laws also perpetuate fear of an attacker who is a stranger , though an estimated 95 percent of the 90,000 cases of child sex abuse reported annually are committed by family or friends .
Cincinnati’s Monzel , other lawmakers and even some police admit the laws are flawed because they treat all offenders the same , no matter the severity of their crime .
“ We do need to have some kind of classification system to protect children from the worst offenders , ” said Monzel .
“ I think the average person understands there ’s a difference between a person who rapes a three - year - old and a freshman in college getting in trouble with his high - school girlfriend . ”
Police departments also have mixed feelings .
Keeping track of sex offenders , community notification and the changing residency rules is a challenge , said Steve Barnett , spokesman for the sheriff ’s office in Hamilton County , a mostly urban district in Ohio .
“ It ’s getting to be an overwhelming task ... and it costs a ton of money , ” said Barnett .
He said the county sent out 208,054 postcards in the last four months to warn residents of new offenders in their neighborhood , at a cost of $ 50,088 .
Still , parents like Aliza Zagorianos like the registries and the postcards , and say there should be more rules to limit not only where offenders live but where they can hang out .
“ I get those postcards , I put them on my fridge , I study them , ” said Zagorianos , 25 , as she watched over her one - year - old son at a Cincinnati playground .
While she ’s sympathetic to offenders who made a one - time mistake or committed a minor offense , Zagorianos said the safety of her child comes first .
“ I do believe in second chances , but I do n’t know about sex offenders . ”
The US Air Force ( USAF ) is trialling battery - powered off - road vehicles for use by its special - forces ground units , according to reports - and you can buy one yourself for just $ 100,000 plus shipping .
A blog post at Wired flagged up the interesting move by the Air Force Special Operations Command ( AFSOC ) this week , though it appears that AFSOC may have had its electric buggies for a couple of months now .
The Colorado Springs Gazette reported in July that :
" American Electric Vehicles just completed a one - year contract with the U.S. Special Operations Command to develop and build four prototypes of a fully electric off - road vehicle ...
The CERV , or Clandestine Electric Reconnaissance Vehicle , had to be engineered to fit inside a CV - 22 Osprey , an aircraft that can do vertical takeoffs and landings but flies more like a plane than a helicopter . "
Freeze , Abdul !
Right , George , get his camel ; I 'm sick of this .
According to this ( pdf ) US government document , AFSOC were given $ 3.2 m of funding for CERV during 2007 .
Hopefully they get more than just four prototypes for that .
American Electric also offer their " Panther " skeletonised electric buggy for sale to the public - " no machine gun , choice of paint " - from $ 99,990 ( not including delivery from the plant at Palmer Lake , Colorado ) .
The company 's president , Daniel Rivers , reckons that electric propulsion is good on the battlefield because of its quietness and relatively low thermal signature .
" The Air Force wants to drop electric vehicles with troops behind enemy lines , " he said .
AFSOC does n't have any " troops " as such , being mainly an organisation providing air support to other US spec-ops arms such as Navy SEALs , Green Berets , Delta Force , MARSOC and all the rest of them .
But the air force nonetheless has some super - troopers who work on the ground ; the scarlet - bereted Combat Controllers and Pararescuemen , who retrieve shot down pilots , call in air strikes for other spec-ops types , provide air - traffic control at secret behind - enemy - lines landing sites , and generally bustle about making themselves useful .
They also train as parachutists and even divers ( god save us , what 's next ?
Airforce divers , indeed * ) .
Presumably it is these USAF red berets who will whine into battle aboard their combat Segway - buggies .
They might face a few difficulties , though , as the company spec sheet ( pdf ) says the machine will go only fifty miles before running its batteries flat .
( The initial airforce requirement in 2006 seems to have been for 200 miles , but it appears this may not have been achieved . )
At that point - we being behind enemy lines here , presumably - the airforce super - troopers will have a bit of a problem .
Generators and mains sockets may be a bit thin on the ground .
Not to worry , though - the Panther can be fitted with an optional solar - charging kit .
Assuming " full sun " the vehicle will be ready to go another fifty miles in just five days !
Perhaps AFSOC want the Panther more as a self - mobile battery pack to power comms or other electrical kit .
Rivers apparently says it can deliver " 100 kilowatts of power for up to 15 minutes ... to power electric weapons or field hospital operations . "
Even so , assuming you really want a big battery and silent running , a hybrid like the planned " Aggressor " probably makes more sense .
As for civilian customers , providing one was willing to forgo offroad capability , $ 100,000 might be better spent on a Tesla Roadster - assuming that it overcomes any remaining technical hitches .
It could even be worth waiting for Nanosafe - powered kit , which can potentially be charged up quickly at an industrial power outlet - rather than needing several hours to top off like Li-ion gear .
Or , you could say the hell with electric cars and get an Aston Martin or something .
It is n't as though electricity is actually green - or , probably , going to be green during the life of your next car . ®
* Disclaimer :
Your correspondent was once a navy diver , and is not going to believe in the underwater expertise of airforce paddlers in a hurry .
No doubt they 're frightfully good at parachuting and so on , which will be very handy the next time America decides to mount a secret mission beyond helicopter / Osprey range .
( Possibly a one way trip for the lads involved . )
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said he had evidence of collaboration
Mr Ahmadinejad said the " internal elements " would be exposed if they did not stop pressurising his government , in a speech at a university in Tehran .
Reformists and several senior clerics have challenged Iran 's nuclear policy .
Last week , Mr Ahmadinejad was quoted as claiming his government 's critics were less intelligent " than a little goat " .
The comparison was made in a speech he made in South Khorasan province on Wednesday , according to Farda , an Iranian website affiliated to so - called pragmatic conservatives .
Although the remarks were reported by a number of conservative and pro-reform newspapers , Mr Ahmadinejad 's spokesman has insisted he was misquoted in an example of " press charlatanism " .
' Traitors '
In his speech at Tehran 's Science and Technology University , Mr Ahmadinejad said he had no intention of halting Iran 's nuclear programme despite warnings by rival politicians and several clerics of the serious threats facing the country .
The UN Security Council has imposed sanctions on Iran because of fears it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons , while the US has not ruled out military action .
We even have a recorded speech of one of them who tells the enemy : ' Why should you give up ?...
Step up pressure to make [ Iran ] retreat '
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
New push over Iran row
" These people are traitors and , based on our pact with the nation , we will not back down , " he said , according to the official news agency , Irna .
" If they do not give up their pressures on [ the government ] over the atomic issues , we will expose them to the Iranian nation , " he added .
" These are traitors and , in accordance with the vows we have taken to the nation , we will not back down and be onlookers . "
Mr Ahmadinejad said he had chosen not to reveal their identities " because of some sensitivities " , but warned he would do so " upon closure of the nuclear issue " .
" They sent people to the enemy to regularly give them information from within the ruling system every week .
We even have a recorded speech of one of them who tells the enemy : ' Why should you give up ?...
Step up pressure to make [ Iran ] retreat ' , " he claimed .
' Dangerous '
The president also said his critics had pressurised a judge " to acquit a suspect for spying " , which correspondents say might be a reference to Hossein Mousavian , the former top nuclear negotiator who was detained in May for " security reasons " .
Mr Rafsanjani has warned of the serious threats facing Iran
Mr Mousavian is an ally of former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , who recently voiced concerns about a military attack .
" The danger is serious and everyone should try to preserve the country 's interests , " Mr Rafsanjani said two weeks ago .
On Thursday , Mr Ahmadinejad 's predecessor , Mohammad Khatami , warned of an escalating crisis between Iran and the international community .
" Ruling the country by those who impose their ideas is very dangerous , " he told a gathering of reformist leaders .
Iran 's former top nuclear negotiator , Ali Larijani , resigned last month over reported disagreements with Mr Ahmadinejad on how to proceed on the nuclear issue .
While its certainly been a long process in the making , we ’re now quite excited to announce OpenID Authentication 2.0 and OpenID Attribute Exchange 1.0 as final specifications ( “ OpenID 2.0 ” ) .
This morning was the closing day of the Internet Identity Workshop and David Recordon , Dick Hardt , and Josh Hoyt ( three of the authors and editors ) made the announcement during the first session .
Both specifications have evolved through extensive community participation and feedback and each have been stable for a number of months .
There are already a variety of open source libraries shipping these specifications with product support including Google ’s Blogger ( via Sxip ’s library ) and Drupal who did their own implementation of the specifications .
Multiple OpenID Providers including MyOpenID , Sxipper , and VeriSign ’s PIP already have support for both of these specifications .
Given past trends , growing support of OpenID 2.0 should be no different .
Today the following libraries exist which implement OpenID Authentication 1.1 and 2.0 , OpenID Attribute Exchange 1.0 , and OpenID Simple Registration 1.0 :
As part of the IPR work over the past few months we ’ve collected non-assertion agreements from contributors to both of these specifications as well as all past specifications .
These agreements are a way for contributors ( and others ) to formally declare that they will not assert any patent rights against OpenID implementations .
You can learn more about the IPR work underway at http://openid.net/foundation/intellectual-property/.
It ’s important to remember that this has been the work of many folks not only within the OpenID community but also the OpenID Foundation , AOL , Cordance , JanRain , Microsoft , NetMesh , Six Apart , Sxip , Sun Microsystems , Symantec , Verisign and Yahoo !.
Microsoft was instrumental in helping with legal support and guidance combined with the insight of Sun and Yahoo ! with their joint work in developing the right language .
This is great news as it means that today not only is OpenID 2.0 final , but all of the contributors have sent a strong message that OpenID must be freely implementable world - wide .
We certainly invite you to come and join the conversation and the community on general@openid.net .

Schauf sets a frosty glass of milk on the red- checkered tablecloth in front of me ; a plate of Oreo knockoffs sits beside it .
Two identical cows prance across the glass .
In fact , nearly everything in the kitchenette — plates , cookie jars , wallpaper trim — is emblazoned with cows .
And why not ?
We 're next door to the Schaufs ' 99 - cow milking stables , Indianhead Holsteins , in Barron , Wisconsin .
I swirl the glass : A thick lather coats the sides .
I sniff :
It has a rich , almost buttery aroma .
I hate the idea of milk over ice , but the drink is on the rocks because it was squeezed in a steamy , unpasteurized froth just half an hour ago from Mandy2 , a 5 - foot - tall behemoth with hindquarters as big as truck wheels and a posterior as flat and broad as the tailgate of a pickup .
Her massive bone structure supports an udder the size of a beer keg , capable of producing more than 15 gallons of milk a day .
I sip :
The milk tastes crisp and creamy , almost velvety — probably because it 's fresh and raw .
I dunk a cookie , and it gets soggy fast ; when I bite into it , it feels like a chocolate milk shake on my palate .
Schauf tips her own glass to her lips , chugs it in two big gulps , and sighs loudly .
" You do n't have to drink all that if you do n't want to , " she says .
But I do .
Mandy2 has outdone herself .
Her milk is delicious .
There 's no reason it should n't be , but I 'm surprised .
[ #video : https://www.youtube.com/embed/KtgWbzREG-Y||| Wired Science Episode 103 : Got Clones ? | ||
Dolly the sheep made headlines more than a decade ago , but a cloned steak has yet to make it to the American dinner plate .
We visit with a rancher and dairy farmer who are ready to bring their cloned - animal meat and milk to the public , and talk to scientists about what being a clone really means .
Watch Wired Science Wednesdays on PBS .
That 's because Mandy2 is a clone .
She was conceived in a laboratory seven years ago and purchased last summer from a farmer in Illinois .
Because creameries were creeped out by her mad- science heritage , Indianhead was able to pick her up on the cheap for $ 2,800 — about $ 1,000 less than a non-clone adult cow of the same age ( calves cost much more — older animals depreciate like cars ) .
The Schaufs have owned Indianhead for 26 years .
They are n't afraid of science , and they know a bit about cloning .
In the mid-'90s , Indianhead was a leader in the Wisconsin dairy industry , relying heavily on a Holstein named Blackrose .
She — and her daughters — could churn out huge volumes of milk , rich in protein and butterfat .
By 1999 , when Blackrose was nearing retirement , the Schaufs had heard about Infigen , a now - defunct cloning company with a too - good - to - be - true sales pitch .
Using just a pinky - nail - sized chunk of animal skin and a process called somatic - cell nuclear transfer , Infigen would replicate your favorite cow or pig .
Karyn's husband , Bob , had concerns about playing Creator , but he reconciled them beneath the 8 - foot - tall cross affixed to their barn .
" God gave man dominion over animals , " Bob says .
As for Blackrose : " She was getting old and we wanted to keep the factory going .
Sometimes you never get one quite as good as the old lady . "
The Schaufs corralled two more farmers as investors , and in 2001 each received a Blackrose duplicate .
Indianhead had a new mascot : Blackrose3 .
For several years , the Schaufs sold milk from Blackrose3's offspring — conceived via artificial insemination but having the traditional number of parents , two , and possessed of the same talent for butterfat as the original Blackrose .
But in April of this year , the local creamery that processed that milk into cheese for distribution throughout the upper Midwest dropped Indianhead .
Another client had complained about the " clone farm . "
The problem is that the FDA never actually approved the introduction of meat or milk from clones or their offspring into the human food chain .
In 2002 the National Academy of Sciences issued a report saying clone meat was safe , and in December 2006 the FDA called duplicate animals and their offspring " as safe to eat as food from conventionally bred animals . "
But the agency continued to ask producers to keep clones and their offspring out of the market .
You can make 'em and you can milk 'em .
You can sell them to other ranchers , and you can even eat 'em , if you want .
But the FDA really , really does n't want them in supermarkets — and typically , the industry does what the FDA wants .
In 2006 , Stephen Sundlof , director of the FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine , told The Washington Post that approval could come by the end of 2007 .
But the agency has since backed off that timeline .
" The FDA is in the process of updating the risk assessment and reviewing the public comments , " spokesperson Laura Alvey says .
" There is no estimated timeframe on when this will be finished . "
Clones were supposed to revolutionize breeding methods , taking the guesswork out of animal husbandry and ushering in a new era of plentiful , delicious steak and bacon .
The availability of genetically identical copies of animals would upend the economics of ranching , edging out the old model based on selective breeding and artificial insemination .
But consumers can't get past a visceral revulsion at eating clones or the offspring of clones , or even drinking their milk .
Part of the FDA 's foot - dragging can probably be chalked up to the more than 145,000 public comments the agency has received opposing the sale of clone meat .
Meanwhile , health problems continue to plague the clones themselves .
The farmers who bet on that world of wonder - meat have seen their custom - built workforce blacklisted and their financial hopes turn to gristle .
Tired of waiting for the future , many are throwing up their hands , grabbing a fork , and eating their profits .
On the day I visit Indianhead , the Schaufs ' 17 - year - old son , Jacob , is showing a red cow named Rvnge Fire , a granddaughter of Blackrose3 , at a local 4 - H event in the nearby town of Rice Lake .
A win here would add to the dairy 's cachet — and to Rvnge Fire 's potential price at auction .
Born later than some competitors in her class , Rvnge Fire looks small , like a station wagon parked between SUVs .
But despite defecating in front of judge Peter Coyne , she wins the first - place blue ribbon .
Coyne grabs a microphone , gushing that Rvnge Fire is " extremely angular all the way through , " with " strong posturing " and " a good set of feet . "
" She places well above the rest of the class , " he tells the rows of wrinkled farmers lining the bleachers .
After the show , I tell Coyne about Rvnge Fire 's pedigree .
" I had no clue who the calf was , " he says .
He pauses for a moment .
" I would say that the uniqueness would add value to it . "
But who would buy her if they could n't sell the milk ?
Coyne is a polite man , and etiquette in this part of the world says you do n't criticize what someone else does with their own time and money .
" I do believe there 's beginning to be a shift , " he says finally .
" But it costs an awful lot to clone cows , and with the moratorium ...
A number of dairymen are still unsure that it makes sense . "

Photo : Alessandra Petlin Don Coover watches his assistant toss the last of his clone - offspring T - bones onto the barbecue .
We 're standing on the sidewalk in front of his semen - shipping business , SEK Genetics , a pitched - roof office building amid a patchwork of fields near Galesburg , Kansas .
Coover is dressed in denim and wears a dusty ball cap that says GENETIC HORIZONS ! — the original name of his company .
He does n't cook out much :
The words " Wash Me " were long ago smeared into the oil on the grill lid and have refilled with dust .
As the steaks pop and spit , Coover explains the sperm business : Ranchers do n't care about animals , per se .
They care about traits .
Lots of meat on the bone , high butterfat content in the milk , resistance to disease — these are all desirable traits .
And the way you get more animals with better traits is breeding together the good ones you already have .
Trouble is , cattle are hard to move around .
They 're heavy and stupid .
But genetic material comes in a simple package , and it 's reasonably easy to get if you have a strong stomach and own a fake cow vagina or an electric prod sized to fit up a bull 's anus .
What 's not easy is keeping semen fresh .
In the early 20th century , ranchers and businessmen tried everything — they packed it in dry ice and alcohol , they rushed samples to their destinations by tossing them out of airplanes in parachute - equipped boxes .
None of it worked very well .
But in the 1950s , the first modern sperm banks arose , and cryopreservation of semen using liquid nitrogen made it transportable .
Researchers developed assisted reproductive technologies like artificial insemination , multiple ovulation , and embryo transfer to customize herds in a matter of years , not generations .
The birth of Dolly , the first cloned mammal , in 1996 made all that seem almost quaint .
Instead of gambling on the genetic shuffle that happens when you cross two animals , you could just grab a cell from a moneymaker , scoop out the nucleus , and implant that genetic core into an egg from a donor cow .
Give the egg a shock to trick it into thinking it 's just been fertilized , and bang — you have a twin .
By the late 1990s , farmers were banking cell lines , waiting for the right time to resurrect their animals .
Coover , who wears a West Point class ring emblazoned with a caduceus ( he 's trained as a vet ) , bought SEK Genetics from a neighbor in 1995 .
Six years later , Coover found an Oklahoma rancher with a durable , all - black Chianina show bull named Full Flush .
In return for $ 35,000 , Coover got part interest in five clones of Full Flush — or , more specifically , exclusive rights to sell their semen .
Agriculture students came from as far away as Texas A&M to see the little clone herd that industry magazines called the Dream Team .
When the meat is done cooking , Coover and I each slide a steak onto our paper plates and head into the office to sample it .
My inch - thick slab is an unpalatable cadaver - gray .
I have to saw gingerly to avoid snapping my plastic utensils .
I make two perpendicular incisions in the meat .
When it seems loose enough , I pinch a small chunk between my fingers and start twisting in circles to get it loose .
I pop a morsel into my mouth and immediately regret it — it tastes spongy and stale .
I try not to gag .
Coover moves his plate from the table to his lap for more torque .
" I ca n't even cut this , " he grumbles to himself .
Prying loose a wedge , he bites into it and winces .
" This is terrible , " he says matter - of - factly .
He chuckles .
" Now I know why they were still in the freezer . "
I ask if the taste and texture are functions of the meat being from a clone .
He checks a date on the label :
The meat was frozen in early 2006 .
" It 's probably a function of being in the freezer for about three years , " he says , exaggerating .
Our meal comes from an offspring of a Full Flush clone .
The cow was lame , so Coover , fearing that it would be trampled at auction , butchered it .
He now has just four Dream Team progeny left at his ranch ( though he still has Dream Team semen on ice ) .
Coover says he shipped the rest of his lot to market .
" Wait .
You mean into the food chain ? " I ask .
" I never worried much about it , " he says .
" Unless you tell them it's a clone , no one can tell . "
After the National Academy of Sciences report in 2002 , Coover started selling his own Full Flush progeny to meatpacking plants and hawking clone sperm to a network of undaunted farmers .
He calls the idea that the resulting meat might be unsafe to eat " total bullshit . "
" The FDA has never made a decision , but that 's because of politics , not science , " he says .
Besides , keeping clone offspring out of the food chain is " impossible to police . "
Other cloners are chafing against the FDA 's inaction .
Farm - tech company Cyagra sent its clients clone - meat summer sausage as a gift .
And two years ago , the company took beef left over from 11 clones created for the FDA 's risk assessment study and served it to employees .
" If you believe in the technology and you believe it 's safe , then there 's nothing wrong with eating the meat .
Second , it just seemed like a huge waste to have it all destroyed , " says Steve Mower , Cyagra 's director of marketing .
Like it or not , guys like Don Coover have already turned meat - eaters into a test market for the safety of cloned meat .
" It 's inevitable that there are large numbers of clone progeny in the food supply , " says Blake Russell , vice president of sales and business development at ViaGen , another cloning company .
" The likelihood that anyone could credibly say ' Our animals are not descended from clones ' is zero . "

The reason cloning makes economic sense is n't that ranchers will sell the actual clones for food .
The idea is to sell their offspring .
Artificial insemination and semen- shipping have made breeding for optimum genetics a highly profitable business .
The owner of a champion bull can charge top dollar for its breeding services or its descendants .
Eventually , of course , that animal will get too old to reproduce .
But if you clone it , you can keep that revenue stream open .
Clones can be bred just like their progenitors , spreading those popular qualities further into the gene pool .
" Part of the value of cloning is that you 're buying something with unique genetic potential .
It 's almost like brand identity , " says John Lawrence , an extension livestock economist at Iowa State University .
" In many regards it 's less risky , because you can say you have a proven animal . "
Today , it costs about $ 1,500 to raise a naturally conceived dairy heifer from conception to breeding age ; it costs roughly $ 17,000 to clone a cow .
The figures are about $ 200 versus $ 4,000 for hogs .
( The price drops if you make multiple copies . )
But with natural or assisted reproduction , roughly 5 to 10 percent of all females and 50 percent of all males bred for better genetics do n't inherit their parents ' best qualities and must be sold at a loss , as " salvage " animals .
Cloning , on the other hand , almost guarantees the high - fidelity replication of desirable traits .
So the clone of a champion bull has higher downstream breeding potential than , say , that bull 's brother .
If the original bull was a good breeder , then the clone 's semen sells for more and its offspring are worth more .
For hogs , the numbers add up fast : Through artificial insemination , one boar can impregnate 400 sows a year , yielding about 4,000 piglets .
But if that boar was cloned from a proven superior male , its progeny will be worth about $ 6 more per piglet in " improved feed conversion , growth rate , survivability , and meat quality , " says Russell of ViaGen .
" So a $ 3,000 investment in cloning can create $ 24,000 in added value per year . "
Coover is trying to make the math even more favorable for cattle ranchers by turning cloning into a DIY affair .
After lunch , I sit shotgun in his boxy 1994 Chevy pickup as he plows through waist - high prairie grass about 15 miles from his office .
The truck has a large , hydrant - shaped feed dispenser mounted on the bed .
He does n't like AC , so our windows are down , filling the cab with hot wind and dust .
Coover spots about 25 crossbred Angus cattle grazing beneath a tree on a distant ridge and blares his horn .
He slams on his brakes and whips the truck around .
" It 's the boss !
It 's the boss ! " he shouts , waving his arms mania cally to get the animals ' attention .
He checks his rearview mirror — the herd spots the dispenser and makes the connection : Dinner is served !
They stampede .
Coover accelerates , and we bounce across the field at 5 miles per hour , lurching toward a gated pasture about 200 yards away .
Coover leads the herd into the pasture and pulls up beside a long , narrow feed trough set between a toolshed and a couple of rusted grain bins .
Hopping out of the truck , he angles the slide of the dispenser outward , moving fast to avoid being crushed by the cattle .
An animal groans , unleashing a loud , steady stream of urine .
Coover gets back into the cab , hits a switch on his dashboard , and drives forward slowly as feed pours out of the hopper .
This has been more than just a ranch chore .
Coover is looking for some old friends : his last surviving descendants of Full Flush clones .
Their bodies are huge , raised high off the ground to support maximum meat yield .
It 's an obsolete body type — ranchers today want shorter , stockier cows that require less feed .
So Coover has repurposed the clone offspring into surrogate moms .
He paid $ 12,000 for 60 embryos cloned from cattle around the country , shipped overnight from Cyagra .
He implanted them himself — it helps to be a vet — with the hope of slashing the sticker price of cow copies to about $ 3,000 a pop .
That 's right : Coover has implanted clone embryos into the offspring of other clones .
It 's hard to imagine what the animals ' pedigree chart will look like .
Coover reaches out and gruffly pats one of his man-made cows on the muzzle .
She munches feed , drooling slightly .
Both eyes roll upward to get a good look at him .
She has a yellow ear tag for identification , but he does n't check it .
They all look pretty much alike to me , and I ask Coover how he knows he 's got the right cow .
" She 's just a good cow , " he says .
" She looks different .
She 's an individual . "
A clone - offspring pork chop from Earnhart Hamps
Photo : Alessandra Petlin Second - generation pig farmer Steve Earnhart is convinced that clone - derived meat tastes different only if you know about its heritage .
So he 's turned my introduction to clone - offspring bacon into a blind taste test .
The timer dings on his microwave .
Earnhart pulls out a plate with four strips divided into two courses .
On the right side lie two fat ribbons of meat .
On the left , two strips that look more charred and have curled up like question marks .
One side is cut from the offspring of a clone ; the other is n't .
When I pick them up , the strips on the right bend limply , looking like flat , translucent alien fingers .
They 're obviously undercooked .
My first bite squeaks greasily between my teeth with overpowering notes of wax and salt .
The curled batch , though , crunches reassuringly , exuding a familiar smoky flavor that grows stronger and heartier the longer I chew .
I point to the alien fingers .
" That 's the clone . "
Earnhart shakes his head .
" It was the other one , " he says in a clipped drawl .
" Only difference you taste is the cut of the meat . "
A burly guy in a plaid shirt and Dickies , Earnhart runs Earnhart Hamps , a 150 - sow breeding operation in Albion , Indiana .
He sends 1,500 hogs — about 270,000 pounds of meat — to market every year .
Earnhart is unique among clone - pig farmers simply because he 's still in business .
Sows can reproduce more than twice as often as cattle , and their litters are 10 times as big , meaning most of the pig farmers who engineered herds at the start of the clone boom had entire proto - farms ready for market in a year and a half — long before anyone wanted to buy them , even if the FDA had approved .
Many of those farmers have stopped breeding clones .
Earnhart did n't have the chance to breed unwanted goods .
His first foray into cloning was a science fiction disaster .
In 1995 , his meaty black - and - white Hampshire pig named Mohican sired a boar that sold for $ 40,000 at the Indiana State Fair .
" That gave me money to play with , " Earnhart says .
Mohican , named after the action - romance flick Last of the Mohicans because he was the only one to survive when his mother accidentally sat on and crushed the rest of his litter , was talented enough for a sequel .
In 1998 , Earnhart cut off a piece of Mohican 's ear and had it frozen .
Four years later he called up ViaGen and ordered a four - hog tribe expansion .
He did n't tell other farmers , for fear of being seen as some city - boy elitist .
" This is not a fancy operation , " he says , shrugging .
" By no means . "
Within weeks of delivery in September 2002 , the first piglet got sick and died .
Another dropped dead two months later .
A few days before Christmas , Earnhart walked into his heated barn at feeding time and spotted his last two piglets belly - up in the straw .
The cause of death was apparently their identical , adult - size ulcers .
" I felt sick , " Earnhart says .
" I thought maybe someone was telling us we should n't have done this . "
ViaGen promised to ship replacements , but Earnhart says he was told that two more litters had died at the lab .
The demise of the Mohicans may have resulted from a well - known , poorly understood side effect of somatic - cell nuclear transfer called sudden death syndrome .
Genes from adult progenitor animals sometimes manifest themselves too early in their clones ; Mohican might have had hereditary ulcers that his piglet doppelgangers developed prematurely .
Earnhart wo n't speculate — the reasons do n't really matter to him .
" It just nearly killed us , " he says .
Problems like sudden death syndrome are why the Humane Society , the Consumer Federation of America , and the Center for Food Safety have asked the FDA to ban cloning or mandate " clone - free " labels at supermarkets .
According to the FDA 's risk assessment , many animals created with the SCNT process have an " increased risk of adverse health outcomes " over other animals born via assisted reproductive technologies .
Clones also suffer from large offspring syndrome , meaning they grow dangerously fast inside their surrogate mothers .
According to Jaydee Hanson , a policy analyst with the Center for Food Safety , those mysterious disorders point to the real question holding clones back :
What if ?
What if clones become ubiquitous and then turn out to be preferentially vulnerable to some emerging disease ?
And what if eating those clones makes people sick , too ?
" They need to look at multi generational studies of these animals to see what happens as they breed , " Hanson says .
Konrad Hochedlinger , a biologist at Massachusetts General Hospital 's Center for Regenerative Medicine , says the birth defects and early deaths are proof that SCNT is an " inefficient and faulty process . "
But clone offspring , he says , are conceived naturally .
That " resets " the chromosomes of the animal to an age - appropriate mode .
" Any abnormalities you see are erased in the next generation , " he says .
" In terms of food safety , it 's not really a problem .
The meat is the same . "
Despite the " ick " factor in the marketplace , that 's pretty much the party line at the Biotech nology Industry Organization , too — Barb Glenn , BIO 's managing director of animal biotechnology , says she still thinks the FDA will come through with that approval before 2008 .
The National Cattlemen 's Beef Association , a powerful industry lobbying group , would n't mind seeing clones in the food stream — with nary a label .
There 's no special supermarket shelf for artificial - insemination - derived steaks , says Joe Schuele , the NCBA 's spokesperson .
" We do n't have it because it 's not necessary . "
The afternoon after our bacon breakfast , Earnhart pulls on his galoshes to show me his clones at work .
The day is hot and humid , and flies rise like storm clouds over pens of manure .
We plod over to a metal shed to meet a pig : a pregnant sow panting on her side in a thick metal cage .
She 's a clone , one of 10 copies Earnhart received as compensation from ViaGen in September 2005 .
Earnhart bows over the sow like an expectant father .
He is considering sending the piglets to market , though he might also breed them , just as he has bred the piglets from his other cloned sows .
" If we do n't send them to market , there 's nothing profitable to be done with them . "
Well , there 's one thing .
Earnhart and I head back to his house for an early supper : pork chops with cheesy potatoes , biscuits , and lemonade .
My fist - sized chop is glazed in a sugary , thick - as - molasses marinade .
It tastes better than anything I 've had at a restaurant — moist , succulent , and wonderfully tender .
" When we go out and pick a hog , we usually try to pick out the best one , " Earnhart says .
He points to the plate .
" This is the one we want to eat . "
Whether it 's born of a clone , Earnhart wo n't say .
" If you can tell the difference , it 's in your head . "

File upload forms that do n't suck
Most file upload forms suck .
It 's not just the lack of design , but also the unintuitive and inflexible interface .
There is usually a single file upload field , where you need to select and upload files one at a time .
If your connection is slow and you have a bunch of files to upload , it will soon start to be irritating .
Hotmail does it that way .
The slightly better approach is to have a list of file upload fields , so you can select the files at once , and be done with it .
This method is sometimes assisted by a button to add more fields if you would need that .
But that is so far from what we are used to from the desktop applications .
The text that can fit in the file upload field is not a very good representation of the actual file .
( Normally something like " C: \Documents and Setti ... " )
And there 's just too many buttons .
The idea
Internet Explorer supports the " file " pseudo protocol , which let 's us access images locally .
By using some more or less clever CSS , we can resize even a large image to a suitable thumbnail .
Since the file is local , we do n't need to worry about the waste of bandwidth this would normally imply .
If we check the extension of the file , we can also use CSS to show the user nice icons of the most popular file formats someone might want to upload .
Add the filename itself so we can tell files of the same type apart , and we have a pretty good graphical and textual representation of the files .
The file upload field itself can be hidden , since it 's pretty useless as a user interface .
We will still keep it in the DOM structure , though , so the file will actually be uploaded when the form is submitted .
The solution
I implemented this as an unobtrusive Javascript .
That means the only thing that needs to be changed in the HTML is the class name of the original file upload field .
Just add the script and the stylesheet to the header and you 're set .
PHP users should note that you need to put a pair of square brackets after the name attribute of the file upload field tag , or PHP wo n't be able to handle the upload properly .
Like this :
< input type = " file " class= " wwIconified " name = " someName [ ] " />
This also means the script will degrade gracefully if Javascript is not available .
The user will then be presented a Hotmail - style single file upload form .
The script will check for the existence of a ul - tag with a specified class name in the same form as the file upload field .
If it does not exist , it will be created .
This list is used as the base for the file icons .
An event handler attached to the on - change event of the original file upload field will be fired as soon as the user selects a file for upload .
This event handler will do most of the magic .
First , it will create a base node to place the icon in .
The value of the file upload field is the path to the local file .
The extension of the file is extracted , and used to determine what kind of icon to create .
If the file type is recognized as an image format , an image is created , with the src-attribute set to " file :/// " plus the file path .
Otherwise the file extension is set as the CSS class name of a div-element .
The first n characters of the filename are also added to the base node .
( Too long names would easily break any design . )
Next , a " remove " - button is added .
It 's nice to have in case you would pick the wrong file .
I will simply remove the complete base node from the DOM structure .
To make it all functional , the original file upload field must be moved to the base node and replaced with a copy .
I had some trouble with this at first , since copying the original field to the base node was working fine in Firefox , but not in Explorer .
It turns out Explorer is highly paranoid about the value of file upload fields .
You are not allowed to set them , nor to clear them by Javascript .
Even when copying the entire input element node , the value is cleared .
I respect that , since it prevents possible attacks uploading files from the user without him / her selecting them manually .
Instead , a copy of the original file upload field is created and inserted next to the original .
The original itself is then moved into the base node , where it is hidden by a CSS rule .

Check out this live example !
Limitations
There are some limitations to this technique .
First of all , the " file " pseudo protocol does not work in Firefox , if the document itself is not stored locally , due to possible security issues .
( Interestingly enough , for the same reasons , Internet Explorer will not run the script if the document is stored locally . )
That means a lot of the users will not be able to enjoy the wonderful world of pre-upload thumbnails .
You 'll need to be careful to keep them in mind when writing your stylesheet .
But you already do that , do n't you ?
Obviously , this will only work with Javascript enabled , or there will only be a single file upload field .
You might want to hack the script to allow more file upload fields for the non-Javascript users .
The script as it looks now , can only handle a single file upload list in each form .
That might be an issue if you have more than one type of files to upload .
I would suggest that you let the user chose what group of files he / she is working with , so he / she can upload them in batches when needed .
There is also a quite important factor to consider :
The total file size .
That is of course not an issue specific to this solution .
But because of how simple it is , a user might be tempted to abuse the solution and upload dozens and dozens of large photos at once .
- Which will naturally fail , due to time - outs .
That might be solved with some more scripting , though .

The List of 100 is a powerful technique you can use to generate ideas , clarify your thoughts , uncover hidden problems or get solutions to any specific questions you ’re interested in .
The technique is very simple in principle : state your issue or question in the top of a blank sheet of paper and come up with a list of one hundred answers or solutions about it .
“ 100 Ways to Generate Income ” , “ 100 Ways to be More Creative ” or “ 100 Ways to Improve my Relationships ” are some examples .
“ One hundred entries ?
Is n’t that way too many ? ”
Bear with me : it ’s exactly this exaggeration that makes the technique powerful .
When starting your list you may believe that there ’s no way to get it done .
But then , at some point during the exercise , you will naturally have your subconscious mind naturally engaged in the process .
That ’s when you will uncover many new and surprising answers , and ideas will start flowing again .
Making a List of 100 is a beautifully articulated cooperation between the conscious and subconscious minds tackling one single problem .
Unlike the related Idea Quota tool — whose primary goal is to acquire the habit of coming up with ideas — the goal of a List of 100 is to take your mind by surprise .
While both techniques are based on the concept of getting good ideas from lots of ideas , the ideas generated by each method are usually different in kind .
With the Idea Quota you tend to have more elaborate ideas , because you have time to incubate them throughout the day ( often without being aware of it ) .
With a List of 100 you tend to get more unexpected ideas , because you catch your subconscious off guard , not giving it any time for its behind - the - scenes editing .
Ground Rules
There are only two simple principles to keep in mind when making Lists of 100 :
1 . Do it at one sitting
This is the one crucial element for the technique to work .
If you end up doing your hundred entries , though over many sessions , you ’ll defeat the point of the technique .
Before starting your list , make yourself comfortable and try to block all potential interruptions .
2. Eliminate distractions
Just like most brainstorming techniques , you should strive to eliminate all activities unrelated to idea generation during the brainstorming session .
Just focus on getting the ideas out of your head as quickly as possible following these rules :
Do n’t judge or evaluate ideas ; you ’ll review them later .
Do n’t write complete words or sentences if that slows you down .
Do n’t stop to wonder how far in the list you are ; number the lines from 1 to 100 in advance or use numbered lists if you ’re using a word processor .
Do n’t worry too much about repeating entries ; duplicates can shed light on your patterns of thought .
The Dynamics of Making Lists of 100
To understand why creating a List of 100 works , consider what happens during the process of making one .
There are three distinct phases you will usually go through when making your list :
1. First 30 entries or so : where you escape circular thinking
The first items are the easiest to come up with .
In this first phase , your conscious mind is still in charge and you ’ll most probably just dump ideas you ’re already familiar with .
2. Next 40 entries : where patterns emerge
In this phase you ’ll start noticing recurring themes and patterns of thought .
Phase two is usually the hardest one , as you may find it difficult to let go of the ideas you had in the first phase in order to come up with new , distinct ones .
Bear in mind that it ’s exactly this struggle that enables you to get to the third and most fruitful phase , hence the importance of not giving up at this point .
3. Last 30 entries : where the gems are
At this point you will already have exhausted most “ logical ” answers , allowing your subconscious mind to express itself more freely .
Do n’t be surprised if you get at least one or two really nonsensical or seemingly illogical entries .
You may feel tempted to not write them down ( “ How on earth did I think that ? ” ) .
Write them down anyway : these wacky entries may sound far from profound , but it ’s exactly those items you ’re after .
Also , after coming up with so many entries , it ’s not rare to experience a shift in perspective : items that you first felt as being awkward will seem to better fit now than when you started the list .
Moreover , your whole attitude towards the problem can change as you develop your entries : you may even come to the conclusion that you should be dealing with a different list topic altogether .
Applications of Lists of 100
Although I have known a variation of the List of 100 technique for several years ( thanks to Michael Gelb ’s How to Think Like Leonardo da Vinci ) , it was only recently that I realized the technique ’s full potential by reading Kathleen Adams ’s Journal to the Self : 22 Paths to Personal Growth .
This is an excellent book that has many great journaling techniques — and the List of 100 has its own chapter .
The List of 100 technique can be used for a lot more than solving specific problems ; it is a general - purpose personal development tool that can help increase your self - knowledge , motivate yourself , and much more .
To illustrate its myriad of uses , find below a List of 100 Lists of 100 .
The list was mostly taken from Journal to the Self , and slightly adapted with some of my own ideas .

Former UK ambassador to Uzbekistan Craig Murray has vowed to carry on making allegations against billionaire Arsenal shareholder Alisher Usmanov , despite attempts to silence him and his supporters .
Murray told The Reg : " If the man believes he was libelled then he should take me to court . "
Murray 's blog was deleted by its host on Friday after threats from Usmanov 's UK legal team .
It 's expected to reappear in the early hours of tomorrow on an overseas server , and will repeat the charges that drew heavy fire from specialist libel firm Schillings .
The ex-diplomat says he has contacted Schillings to ask for clarification of which specific aspect of his allegations they contest , but has not received a response .
" They say my book [ Murder in Samarkand ] is ' grossly libellous and defamatory ' , yet it has been widely available for a year and has sold 25,000 copies , without their actually taking any legal action , " he added .
Murray 's criticism of Usmanov stems from his rise in Uzbekistan following the collapse of communism to become one of Russia 's richest men .
He denies the accusations .
His profile in the UK has skyrocketed since he followed Chelsea chairman and fellow oligarch Roman Abramovich into football investment .
Murray 's blog entry about Usmanov , made September 2 , were picked up by many political and Arsenal websites which later also received complaints from Schillings .
It became the third - highest hit on Google for the search " usmanov " , but was quickly removed from Murray 's site after the first legal letter .
Tim Ireland , who runs the political site Bloggerheads.com , which was downed along with Murray 's site , has slammed Fasthosts ' action , and denied the claim that they refused to comply with takedown requests after he repeated Murray 's allegations .
Fasthosts says it acted according to standard industy practice and has declined to answer Reg questions .
Ireland said Fasthosts has so far failed to provide copies of two of the three complaints made by Schillings .
" We do n't have any of the correspondence despite multiple requests , " he said .
The third complaint was made weeks after the September 2 post was removed .
The takedown meant the Google robot instead indexed another piece Murray had penned in October 2005 that included the name .
On contact from Fasthosts , site administrator Clive Summerfield suspended the site and wrote back to Fasthosts to suggest that it , Schillings , Ireland and Murray liase on what was acceptable .
Fasthosts responded by pulling the plug on his two dedicated servers on Friday .
Bloggerheads and craigmurray .co.uk were part of a small stable of sites run by Summerfield .
This connection explains the deletion of Tory mayoral hopeful Boris Johnson 's site , despite it having no involvement in the Usmanov affair .
The action also downed the website of the London Bach Society and an independent record label .
The new hosting has been arranged separately from the rest of Summerfield 's sites - Murray believes that Usmanov 's lawyers are trying to make him back down by attacking others .
We asked Murray if he intends to stay on Usmanov 's back .
He replied : " There is room on Usmanov 's back for an awful lot of people .
You could get even more on his stomach , and possibly lose some under the overlap of his chins . "
We think that 's a " yes " . ®
In anticipation of all the games that would be released around the holiday season I am putting together a PC just for playing these games .
It is equipped with all the latest hard - and software and with a big wide screen TFT to boot I am all ready to lock myself in my office for a few days and play until either my fingers or my eyeballs start to bleed .
Like many others I kept my gaze fixed on the release schedules of upcoming games and would put in my online order the moment they were released .
As such I now have all latest games installed but for one and that is the game I wanted to play for quite some time now : EA 's Crysis .
So why have n't I ordered and installed Crysis just yet ?
Well , apparently EA is perfectly fine with me creating an online account at their US web store , however when I pull out my credit card or key in my PayPal account details , it refuses to let me download the game .
For some reason I am denied access because I am physically located in Europe , hence I can not buy from the EA US web store .
As a result I am forwarded to EA 's European web store where Crysis is not yet available for download to begin with and secondly , they jacked up the price from $ 49.99 to 54.99 euro , that is almost twice the price at current exchange rates .
Now I do not mind giving EA my money , but paying almost twice what US customers are paying is a bit much , and also something that rubs me the wrong way as it is simply against my principles .
After all , we are talking about a digital copy here , not a carton box with a DVD , hence there is no localized box and no localized manual , just the same download that is offered through the US store .
Sure , they may have thrown in a different EULA to comply with EU legislation , but that is it .
So I am sitting here empty - handed , with a perfectly good credit card and enough money in my PayPal balance to make the purchase , but EA simply will not let me .
So despite the fact that I usually buy all my games , as I feel the developer needs to be rewarded for their hard work , I am just going to download Crysis off of a P2P network .
Here is a big ' FU ' to EA , if you do not want my money , but rather charge me double because I am not physically located in the US , you deserve to be pirated .
When you come to your senses I will get my credit card out so I can reward Crytek , the developer , for their hard work .
No other online download system has this limitation , for example I just downloaded the Orange Box of gaming bliss from Steam the other day without any issues .
So a word of caution to all the publishers that feel compelled to rip off their customers in different geographic regions : do n't , as people will simply download a pirated copy instead .

Chlamydia ( Chlamydia trachomatis )
FACTS : Chlamydia is perhaps the most common of all sexually transmitted diseases , though it is comparatively unsung .
While it can produce symptoms such as discharges , burning sensations , abnormal bleeding , pain , and nausea , these symptoms are easily confused with those caused by gonorrhea .
In addition , in nearly three quarters of women and nearly half of men chlamydia produces no symptoms at all .
Untreated , the infection quietly spreads until it can attack fallopian tubes and ovaries , causing permanent damage to the female reproduction system , and in some cases even infertility .
( It can also lead to epididymitis in men , which can cause sterility . )
Fortunately , affordable and reliable testing is available for chlamydia – and it is highly responsive to antibiotics .
Unfortunately , treatment is often tragically delayed until it is too late .
In addition to its venereal impact , Chlamydia trachomatis is also responsible for trachoma , the leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide .
Repeat infections with the bacteria eventually cause the eyelids to invert , and untreated scarring ultimately destroys the vision .
Trachoma is primarily confined to the developing world where medical care is limited .
However , because C. trachomatis bacteria can be transmitted from a mother to a child during birth , half of the children born to mothers with chlamydia enter the world with an eye infection – or worse : chlamydia has also been implicated in causing infant pneumonia , as well as premature - and still - births .
Scott Adams Answers Your Dilbert Questions , and More
Last week , we solicited your questions for Dilbert creator and author Scott Adams .
Here are his answers .
They are great , and so were your questions ; thanks to Scott and thanks to you .
Here ’s what I found most interesting :
1. From his answers , Scott Adams would appear to be a poster boy ( poster man ? ) for the Anders Ericsson school of thought on “ talent ” — i.e. , that the thing we generally call “ raw talent ” is vastly overrated , whereas “ deliberate practice ” and good feedback are the foundations of becoming very good at something .
I say this based on the following Adams quotes :
I learned to draw by doing it a lot .
It ’s about 25 percent natural talent and 75 percent practice .
and :
Originally , Dilbert was not so focused on the workplace .
It was n’t until after I published my email address in the strip , in 1993 , and people wrote to tell me they liked his work exploits best , that the focus changed .
2 . There will soon be a death in Dilbert land .
“ You are the first to know , ” Adams writes .
3 . Here is my favorite quote , in response to a reader who has found a lot of weird interconnectedness in the blogosphere : “ It means your alleged life is nothing but a program running in a computer somewhere , and the author reused code . ”
Enjoy .
Q : Can you tell us how you originally pitched the Dilbert concept ?
It ’s hard now to imagine life without Dilbert , but before you came along , there was no strip devoted exclusively to the workplace .
Did you have trouble convincing the movers and shakers that Dilbert would have “ legs , ” and that the comic potential of the strip was almost unlimited ?
A : I bought a book that described how to submit comics for syndication .
You simply send copies to a half - dozen addresses and wait for them to contact you .
Several rejected me , and United Media offered me a contract .
Originally , Dilbert was not so focused on the workplace .
It was n’t until after I published my email address in the strip , in 1993 , and people wrote to tell me they liked his work exploits best , that the focus changed .
By then , I was already in the door .
Q : How is it that Dilbert ended up a software engineer ?
What in your background has given you the insight to understand code monkeys ( such as myself ) and the endless battles against the legions of the pointy - haired ?
A : I worked around engineers for most of my 16 years of corporate life .
Dilbert is actually designed after one person in particular .
Interestingly , that person is not aware that he is the model for Dilbert .
I did n’t know him well and never mentioned it to him .
Q : Having written so many comics throughout the years , how often do you find yourself writing the same jokes or lines ?
Do you ever write a comic thinking it ’s great , only to realize you ’ve done it before ?
A : That happens more often than I ’d like .
For the first ten years of the strip , I probably remembered every comic I made .
Now I do n’t .
Since my brain is wired a certain way , I have a tendency to attack a joke the same way , so I end up reproducing something I ’ve already done .
Q : Is it true that you worked at Pac Bell for years after your strip was published ?
My brother - in - law who worked there claimed that you used it for inspiration , and in the glacially slow - moving culture of a phone company , it took them years to realize that your “ moonlighting ” was such a big deal .
A : Your brother - in - law has it about right .
But I worked at a big bank before the phone company , and when I noticed that these two companies were similar in their types of dysfunctions , it became clear that there were some universal concepts to mine .
Q : I heard somewhere ( probably from a disgruntled employee ) that you worked at Motorola at one point .
Is this true ?
Either way , your comics are so scarily representative of corporate America that you must have spies on the inside feeding you gems of HR policies and management “ innovations , ” right ?
A : I never worked at Motorola , but I ’ve heard that rumor .
I ’ve been rumored to work for lots of big companies .
I have a common name , so many companies have a “ Scott Adams ” on the payroll .
I think that ’s how the rumors start .
Q : Where did you learn how to draw , and what advice would you give to someone who , like you , majored in economics but would rather pursue more creative activities ?
A : I learned to draw by doing it a lot .
It ’s about 25 percent natural talent and 75 percent practice .
I kept my day job and tried a number of creative things that did n’t work out .
My general advice is to expect 9 out of 10 things to fail .
If you ca n’t handle those odds , do n’t bother trying .
Q : You no longer work in the corporate environment , but your humor is based in this world .
How do you keep in touch with the corporate world and keep your insight fresh ?
A : Most of my material comes from ideas from readers , by email .
They suggest the pet peeve , and I supply the humor .
Recently , I started managing one of the restaurants I co-own .
I had only been a silent investor until this summer .
That experience is infusing me with plenty of material , too .
Q : a .
Which one of the Dilbert characters would you most like to see die ?
b . What are your favorite comic strips / blogs ?
c. How much do you make in a year from all your enterprises ?
A : a .
One of my regular characters will die soon .
You are the first to know .
But I wo n’t tell you which one .
b. I like Pearls Before Swine , F - Minus , and this blog .
c. Far more than I deserve .
Q : My friends and I gained great joy from the idea that humor can be created by combining any two of five different topics .
Do you find that , to this day , you are still using these same tactics to create humor ?
A : It ’s two of six elements , not topics , and yes .
I have never seen a deviation by any humorist .
All humor combines at least two of these elements :
Cute
Bizarre
Naughty
Recognizable
Clever
Hmm , I forgot the sixth one myself .
Q : What makes you laugh ?
A : I laugh at the absurd , and sometimes at bad things happening to people .
I ’m not proud of it .
Q : As a someone who is trained in both hypnosis and economics , which would you say has been more useful ?
A : Excellent question .
They work so well together that it is hard to pick one .
But I ’d pick economics if you put a gun to my head .
Q : How do you feel about censorship from your syndication company ?
It seems like many of your favorite jokes are censored , often for absurd reasons .
Do you think that they are going overboard , or do you appreciate the feedback ?
A : It ’s not censorship when a public company makes a business decision about what product to provide to its customers .
I respect that .
Q : Do you think Predictify ‘s wisdom - of - crowds mechanism could be useful for predicting geopolitical events , like the future of Iran or the Middle East ?
I know that the federal government has considered similar initiatives in the past that were nixed for political reasons .
A : It well might .
Time will tell .
Q : How would you describe the relationship between your comics and your blog ?
Does your blog help you develop ideas for your comic , or does the blog functions as a release for all of the things you want to say in your comic , but can ’t ?
I am fascinated by how the same dry , ironic humor can manifest in both Dilbert and a blog post about renewable energy .
A : The blog is more of a release .
The downside of being a creative personality is that you need to let it out or you feel thwarted .
The blog helps my mental health .
Q : Did you anticipate turning your blog into a book ?
I ’ve been reading since day one and wondered since day one why such an obviously busy person like you would devote so much time to something like a blog .
Was it for fun , an attempt to educate the kids , or did you just anticipate this would be material for a book ?
Why would someone with a real day job do a blog ?
A : I had a variety of motivations .
It ’s the best creative outlet I ’ve ever had because I can write whatever I want , as often as I want .
No editor gets between me and the reader .
As a writer , you ca n’t beat that .
It ’s highly rewarding from a creative standpoint .
But yes , I did consider from the start that I might put the material in a book if it seemed worthy .
Blogging every day is great discipline .
I like knowing that people are waiting for my posts .
The immediate feedback makes it easier to write and enjoy it .
Most authors will tell you that writing an entire book without feedback until the end is one of the hardest things in the world .
Writing a blog that turns into a book is just plain fun .
Q : How come the blogs in my Google Reader intertwine so much ?
I subscribed to The Dilbert Blog following a recommendation from Tom Kyte , and I know about Freakonomics from a neighbor .
Suddenly , these blogs are not only heavily quoting each other , but Scott Adams gets to guest blog on Freakonomics , and Kyte does the same over at Worse Than Failure .
A : It means your alleged life is nothing but a program running in a computer somewhere , and the author reused code .
Q : Does it frustrate you that so many of your blog readers ( or , at least , commenters ) seem to fail to understand many of your messages ?
A : It ’s more fascinating than frustrating .
I love observing how people think and perceive , especially when they do it wrong .
Q : How do you maintain your state of happiness when people give you all kinds of harsh criticism on your blog ?
A : The criticism is easy to take because I also get a lot of positive comments to balance it out .
If all the comments were bad , it would bother me .
Q : I like Dilbert a lot , but not as much as your blog , which is more unpredictable ( usually ) and less politically correct .
How much funnier could you make Dilbert if you were independent ?
A : Dilbert would be funnier to me if I could be naughtier , but I doubt it would have been so widely accepted .
Q : My all - time favorite Dilbert cartoon is the one where he gives some kooky well - thought - out amount of payment for an item so he ’ll get back an even dime , and says it ’s for the clerk ’s convenience .
Do you really do that in real life ?
A : I do n’t do that .
I prefer to use my mind for daydreaming while the cashier works out the math .
Q : I read your story about curing yourself when you lost your voice .
Has that led to any new developments or treatments in this affliction ?
How have you progressed since you originally posted about it earlier this year ?
A : I would n’t call it cured , but it ’s greatly improved .
I could n’t speak at all when I first got the problem ( called spasmodic dysphonia ) .
I had a big breakthrough this week , when I finally learned to breathe correctly after nine months of practice and paid a visit to a controversial voice doctor , Morton Cooper .
Breathing is the only human function that is both automatic and also consciously controlled .
When I would try to speak , the speech and breathing parts of my wiring somehow crossed , the automatic part of breathing kicked in , and it would stop me from exhaling , which stopped me from speaking .
After nine months of practicing proper breathing , now I ’ve got it all working most of the time .
If this improvement lasts , I ’ll say a lot more about it .
And I would call it a cure of a reportedly incurable problem .
Time will tell .
Q : Are there other corporate humorists you admire ?
A : I like The Office , on TV .
I do n’t follow any other corporate humor .
Q : Have you and Cathy Guisewite ever talked about doing a story that finally brings Dilbert face - to - face with Cathy ?
In my mental map of the universe , Cathy is working in the accounting department a few floors away , or in some other building on campus .
A : We ’ve met a few times , but never discussed collaboration .
On some level , the idea strikes me as too obvious .
It has been suggested a hundred times .
Q : How many days before the cartoons go to print do you draw them ?
A : Let me check … I ’m answering you on October 29th , and the next comic I draw for the daily strip will run on January 9th .
The next Sunday strip will run on January 27th .
I ’m ahead of deadline .
Q : Did you always dream of drawing and writing , or were you about to happily settle for a so - called normal job ?
Was it the misery of “ humiliating and low - paying jobs , ” or the joy of drawing and writing , that pushed you this way ?
A : I pursued a normal job so I would n’t starve to death while figuring out how to have an extraordinary job .
I just did n’t know how it would play out .
Q : I ’m interested in your comments on evolution .
If you have read PZ Myer ‘s deconstruction of your opinions on evolution , I think they point out not only your misconceptions , but also those of a large number of people unfamiliar with theory .
A : Actually , PZ Myer deconstructs his misinterpretations of my arguments .
If he ever addresses my actual arguments , he might realize he agrees with them .
That ’s what makes him so entertaining .
Q : What do you see as the actual flaws in the Darwin - esque explanations for evolution , and what possibilities can you see for alternate explanations of the phenomena and evidence ?
A : Evolution passes all the tests of science to be treated as a fact .
But if physicists someday demonstrate that our perception of reality has no connection to actual reality , which I consider likely , then evolution is just a point of view , albeit a useful one .
My main criticism of evolution has to do with the way it is presented to the public .
And beyond that , I enjoy yanking the chain of people who think they believe things for actual reasons as opposed to taking a side .
Q : Drew Carey has made an exceptionally good living thanks in no small part to Dilbert .
Has he at least offered to buy you some coffee and donuts ?
A : Drew Carey developed his thing independently , but he did call me one day and asked if I wanted to be a writer on his old show .
It did n’t seem like a good career move .
Q : Why does Dilbert ’s tie curl upwards ?
A : He ’s glad to see you .
Who do Irish organisations consider the biggest threat to their finances ?
Possibly you , according to a new survey from Citrix .
The study from the software giant found that 49 per cent of IT specialists said people , or more precisely disgruntled staff , are a major financial threat to Irish businesses .
The survey found that firms fear that annoyed staff would try to breach security and put firms ' finances at risk .
These results came from a survey of over 70 Irish IT specialists who attended Citrix 's annual Solutions Seminar held in Dublin earlier this month .
IT experts from the financial services , retail , government , healthcare , and education sectors participated in the research .
Other security worries found to cause concern included hackers and malware , which were cited by 51 per cent of respondents ; phishing attacks , which 52 per cent of participants considered a threat ; and distributed denial of service or denial of service attacks were considered major threats by 57 per cent of respondents .
Meanwhile , the study also found that Irish workers are becoming more mobile with nearly 50 per cent of those surveyed reporting that their company 's workforce spend a portion of their time as mobile users .
Half of those surveyed said they felt firms were not doing enough to shore up security on mobile connections with networks being left open to risk when staff connect from unsecured access points .
" Organisations must ensure that their corporate data is centrally managed and delivered to users just as needed .
This is the most effective way to help prevent security threats such as those revealed in the survey .
By implementing technology such as virtualisation from the desktop to the data centre , organisations can isolate different environments with varying levels of access and security , and can securely manage and deliver applications to the end user , " said Chris Mayers , security architect for Citrix .

Love them or loathe them , JavaScript libraries are making a huge impact in the area of DOM Scripting .
As AJAX matures , and the complexity of the scripts required to support its expanding use increases , it becomes much less feasible to produce custom code from scratch for every project .
In addition , the growth of AJAX and the burgeoning interest in Web 2.0 applications is bringing many new people to the field .
Not surprisingly , they do n’t want to spend the long , hard years absorbing the arcane knowledge required to wrestle with browser bugs and API differences .
Whether you ’re an old - school DHTML guru or a Web 2.0 wannabe , it ’s time you got to know some libraries .
So , what ’s out there ?
I ’m glad you asked !
Over the past year or so , as DOM Scripting has exploded in the mainstream coding arena on the back of AJAX , a seemingly endless number of JavaScript libraries have joined the list of contenders .
Fortunately for our poor brains , there are four libraries that have emerged as the clear forerunners in terms of their levels of adoption , documentation and community support :
Dojo , a powerful library developed primarily off the back of JotSpot
Prototype , the backbone of Ruby on Rails excellent AJAX support
Mochikit , the Python library that makes JavaScript suck less
Yahoo UI Library ( often shortened to just YUI ) , the new kid on the block
Of these four , there is no clear front - runner yet .
Each library differs enormously from the others not only in features , but in less tangible aspects like ease - of - use , community support and philosophy .
One of the most important factors in choosing a development platform is how well its philosophy fits with the way that your brain works .
In this article , I ’ll examine each library to help you decide which one best suits your development style and project needs .
While it would be impossible to cover every aspect of each library , I ’ve done my best to cover the highlights of each of them , as well as give some insight into how they handle the bread - and - butter tasks of DOM manipulation , event handling and AJAX .
Dojo
Dojo is maintained by lead developer Alex Russell — who recently announced that he would be working on Dojo full time — and a group of around 30 core contributors .
The library is primarily funded by Jot , creators of JotSpot , a souped - up Wiki engine .
Dojo can be downloaded from the Dojo site in several editions .
Each edition bundles certain parts of the Dojo library into one JavaScript file , and allows you to load other parts of the library dynamically using Dojo ’s import mechanism .
The most popular edition of Dojo is the AJAX edition , which weighs in at around 132 K in its compressed form , and includes support for asynchronous I/O operations ( for AJAX calls ) , visual effects , event handling and the Dojo base libraries .
Loading additional functions on top of an edition of Dojo is easy .
If you wanted to add the crypto library , for example , you would write the following :
dojo.require ( " dojo.crypto . * " ) ;
However , for performance reasons it ’s best to choose your edition well , based on the needs of your project , and to avoid requiring extra libraries in this fashion .
Dojo definitely has the widest scope of the four libraries in terms of features , and pays more attention to tackling performance issues and browser compatibility issues .
It has also been written with technologies such as SVG in mind , and moves are being made to bring the functionality of Dojo to SVG in a cross-compatible manner .
From dealing with strings as quickly as possible , to efficient iterations , to built - in support for the back button in AJAX , Dojo really has it all covered .
However , this means it has quite a huge API , and the learning curve associated with Dojo is therefore substantial , given the sparse documentation at the moment .
Recently , the Django framework began to bundle Dojo with its distribution , using it in its administration system , so this may be a catalyst for increased Dojo documentation .
The Basics
At the heart of Dojo is a flexible , powerful and easy - to - use method , dojo.io.bind .
This single method can be used in many ways to make both synchronous and asynchronous calls .
To give you an idea of how flexible it is , let ’s take a look at some examples :
// Load a text document from the server , then alert the user of the contents .
dojo.io.bind (
{
url : " http://example.com/document.txt " ,
load : function ( type , data , evt ) { alert ( data ) } ,
mimetype : " text / plain "
}
) ;
// Serialize a form and send it to the server , then evaluate the response as JavaScript !
dojo.io.bind (
{
url : " http://example.com/comment.cgi " ,
load : function ( type , json ) { alert ( json.myProp ) } ,
formNode : document.getElementById(" formToSubmit " ) ,
mimetype : " text/ javascript "
}
) ;
dojo.io.bind can also handle the back button with ease : dojo.io.bind (
{
url : " http://example.com/comment.cgi " ,
load : function ( type , data ) { alert ( data ) } ,
backButton : function ( ) { /* do something when back is pressed */}
}
) ; Read more about the full capabilities of dojo.io. bind in this introductory article .
The dojo.event method takes the approach of implementing its own event handling system , rather than providing a wrapper around the browser 's event system .
This results in quite a solid system and , like dojo.io. bind , it 's both simple to use and exposes large amounts of power and flexibility .
You can read more about Dojo events here .
In the meantime , let 's take a sneak peek at the dojo. event method in action .
As expected , the following code is triggered by the onClick event and uses an intuitive and familiar syntax .
dojo.event.connect( node , " onclick " , " handleOnClick " ) ; Highs and Lows
The great thing about Dojo is that it 's so rich in features .
The Widget system provides a raft of useful controls such as a DatePicker , a RichText widget , as well as a considerable number of controls that you would expect to find in something like Microsoft's MFC .
In addition to this , you can build your own widgets on the framework using HTML , CSS and JavaScript ( see this article for details ) .
But JavaScript need not be limited just to the browser , and Dojo is designed with this in mind .
Dojo 's platform independence could make it an interesting platform for desktop widget development , as well as many other potential applications .
As an example , Open Laszlo recently announced that it was licensing Dojo for its JavaScript implementation of the platform .
Dojo 's design has quite a Java - like aesthetic without trying to be Java .
In fact , I 'd say Dojo utilises JavaScript as a language exceptionally well .
One downside of the library 's design , though , is the sometimes long package strings that you need to type out to call the methods or instantiate the library 's objects -- it would be nice if Dojo could provide a way to " mix " a package into the global or local scope .
This would provide ready access to a certain package if you planned on using a lot of methods from it , although I 'm not sure how easily it could be incorporated .
Additionally , for all its features , Dojo is completely missing any functions that could aid the selection of DOM elements -- something that 's quite fundamental to DOM Scripting .
It seems to be quite a gaping hole in the library -- it would be great to be able to select elements using CSS and / or XPath .
Similarly , while some of the objects in the library seem to support a kind of iteration framework , Dojo is lacking in methods for iterating though arrays and collections , a task which seems to make up the bulk of DOM scripting tasks .
And at this point in time , documentation for Dojo is not at a premium .
The official Dojo site contains some API documentation that 's far from complete , but it does have some well - written articles highlighting areas of the library .
The JavaScript community has yet to embrace the daunting task of documenting Dojo , though , so independent on the topic articles are few and far between .
Prototype and Scriptaculous
The development of the Prototype library is lead by Sam Stephenson of 37 Signals and , along with scriptaculous , has risen to fame as the JavaScript backbone of Ruby on Rails AJAX helpers .
Prototype itself contains the base - level functionality such as AJAX , DOM manipulation , event handling and some extensions to JavaScript itself , while the separate but very much related library , scriptaculous , developed by Thomas Fuchs , is based on Prototype and implements a whole raft of visual effects , as well as drag and drop and some user interface components .
Prototype can be downloaded from the Prototype site , or you can pull it straight from the Ruby on Rails subversion repository if you want to live on the bleeding edge .
It currently weighs in at a reasonably compact 54KB .
scriptaculous is available from the scriptaculous site and is split into three files : controls.js , dragdrop.js and effects.js , which weigh in at 28KB , 23KB and 32 KB respectively .
Ruby on Rails bundles all of these files by default .
For an overview of Prototype , take a look at my earlier SitePoint article , Painless JavaScript with Prototype .
The Basics As far as DOM manipulation goes , Prototype sits very much on the innerHTML side of the innerHTML / DOM methods argument , which may be a plus or a minus depending on which side of the fence you sit in that particular holy war .
Regardless , for most of the DOM lifting you 'll need to do , Prototype is extremely useful .
A new but very nice feature is that many methods are added directly into the nodes themselves .
Here are a few examples : $ ( ' form ').visualEffect ( ' fade ' , { duration : 3 } ) ;
$ ( ' loader ' ) . show ( ) ;
This code fades out the form to which it is applied over a period of three seconds .
You can even extend the node objects with your own methods .
There have been some performance issues flagged with this approach , but I believe they have mostly been addressed .
Unfortunately , although Prototype has a set of methods for event handling , at this time they 're pretty under - developed .
Event.observe is more or less a wrapper around the well - used but now superceded addEvent by Scott Andrew - LePara .
However , it 's easy to use and capable of handling most circumstances .
One nice aspect is that it automatically removes all the event handlers you set using Event.observe when the page is unloaded , which should help prevent IE from leaking memory .
The AJAX support is reasonably straightforward and very well developed , as it has been developed right alongside Ruby on Rails .
It offers a host of excellent features that I find extremely useful .
It handles JSON transparently , and even evaluates JavaScript sent back from the server automatically .
This is the basis of the much - lauded RJS technology in Rails , and is extremely powerful .
You do n't need Rails to take advantage of this , though -- you can make an AJAX request : new Ajax .
Request ('new_comment.php ' ,
{
data : ' comment=My comment . ',
evalScripts : true
}
) ;
Then , you can return updates to the page from your server as JavaScript : $ ( ' comments ' ) .
replace ( '< div class= " comment " >
My comment .</div >' ) ;
As you can see , this is an incredibly powerful way of designing AJAX applications .
Another nice little feature of the Ajax .
Request object is that it appends the X - Requested - With HTTP header automatically , which enables you to tell if your requests come from AJAX on the server side .
Highs and Lows Convenience is king with Prototype .
Most notably , the $ function ( which selects elements by id ) and the $ $ function ( which selects elements using CSS selectors ) provide extremely quick access to elements on the page .
The $ $ function even supports CSS3 selectors -- most browsers do n't .
When you use it in conjunction with the enumerable methods and Prototype 's other convenience methods , you can come up with some pretty concise statements .
For instance , to hide all div elements with a class of / # c # " obscene " : $ $ (" div.obscene " ) .map( Element.hide ) ;
$ $ ( " a[ href= ' http://'] " ).each( function( element )
{
Event.observe( element , ' click ' , openNewWindow ) ;
}
) ;
As we all spend most of our scripting time working through lists of DOM nodes , this buys us a lot of power indeed .
The compact and intuitive API really is the killer feature of Prototype for me .
Scriptaculous is a great , extensive effects library with solid drag - and - drop support that , again , is ridiculously easy to use .
Consider this : new Draggable ( ' my_element ' ) ;
This produces an element that the user can drag .
You can then add further configuration using object notation , like this : new Draggable ( ' my_element ' ,
{
revert : true
}
) ; Documentation was very limited for a long time , but recently many people have filled the gap , making Prototype one of the most widely documented of the big JavaScript libraries , albeit that that documentation is a bit splintered .
There are no central API docs , but there 's a whole raft of libraries that cover parts of the library , as well as Jonathan Snook 's excellent cheat sheet detailing the entire library .
The prototypedoc.com site also maintains a pretty thorough list of articles about Prototype to help you get started with the library .
Mochikit Mochikit is the brain child of Bob Ippolito ( the primary contributor ) and is available from the Mochikit site .
The basic package weighs in at around 90 KB ( compressed ) , but you can load each of the modules separately .
Mochikit is also currently bundled with the Python web framework , TurboGears .
In the words of Bob , We took all the good ideas we could find from our Python , Objective - C , etc. experience and adapted it to the crazy world of JavaScript .
So , to a large extent , Mochikit draws on the idioms of Python for its API .
If you 're familiar with Python , you 'll have an instant head start with Mochikit , although it has a simple API which is reasonably easy to pick up .
Of all the libraries covered in this article , Mochikit 's API feels the most " designed " .
Rather than relying on package - style naming conventions , it exports a select number of functions to the global namespace , which helps make your scripts a lot more compact .
When getting started with Mochikit , you should : Watch Bob 's screencast .
Start bashing away using Mochikit 's excellent interactive interpreter , much like you would with Python .
This is a great way to get a feel for the library and a basic understanding of how Mochikit works .
The Basics
When working with the DOM , Mochikit has some real tricks up its sleeve : var warning = P (
{ ' class ' : ' warning ' } ,
" Please provide a " , STRONG ( null , " valid email address " )
) ;
swapDOM(document.getElementById(" notifications " ) , warning ) ;
This code will use the relevant W3C DOM methods to create the equivalent node tree for the following HTML : < p class = " warning " >
Please provide a < strong > valid email address </ strong ></p>
The Mochikit code is almost cleaner than the HTML syntax !
The Mochikit .DOM module also contains a number of other methods for easy DOM manipulation , such as the swapDOM method mentioned above ( which does what it says on the tin ) , and toHTML ( which converts a DOM node to the HTML it represents ) .
And just for good measure , Mochikit has thrown in the $ function for those who are used to it .
As far as event handling goes , Mochikit has a well designed ( if slightly unfamiliar system ) that 's implemented in the Mochikit .
Signal module .
It 's based around the concept of connecting a listener to a signal that 's sent from an object .
All the regular DOM events are signals , but you can create your own , too .
The connect method does all the work here : // connects the onclick signal of the element with id =" thing "
// to the function showDialog , which points to the element .
connect ( $ ( ' thing ' ) , ' onclick ' , showDialog ) ;
// connects the onsubmit signal of element id =" form " to
// formController.checkSubmit , which points to the
// formController object .
connect ( $ ( ' form ' ) , ' onsubmit ' , formController , ' checkSubmit ' ) ;
You can make your own objects send signals simply with the signal method : signal ( anObject , ' a_signal ' ) ;
While Mochikit 's event system is a departure from the way you might normally expect event handling to work , it 's actually brutally simple and great to use once you get used to it .
AJAX stuff is handled by the Mochit .
Async module , and the Deferred objects which lie at the core of the implementation .
To perform a basic AJAX call , use either loadJSONDoc or doSimpleXMLHttpRequest : var request = doSimpleXMLHttpRequest('get_options.php ' ,
{ q : ' web developer'}
) ;
This function returns a Deferred object , on which you can set callbacks : request.addCallbacks(mySuccessFunction , myErrorFunction ) ;
When the XMLHttpRequest is complete , the relevant callback is called and passed the XMLHttpRequest object as the argument : function mySuccessFunction ( req ) {
alert( req.responseText ) ;
} Deferred objects are useful for any asynchronous programming and are a great idea .
Read more here , or watch the screencast for more details .
Highs and Lows First off , Mochikit 's logging framework is excellent .
Simply add logging statements : log ( " This is so much better than alert " ) ;
log( " ERROR
This thing is broke " ) ;
You can then use Mochikit 's bookmarklet to open a log window and view your log messages .
You do n't need to add anything into your pages or include any extra script -- it 's truly effortless and beats alert any day .
Mochikit also makes full use of JavaScript 's functional programming features to really enhance and simplify the library 's API .
For instance , if you want to sort a group of objects by their name properties , you can use keyComparator to create the sort function for you : var sorted ByName = people.sort ( keyComparator ( " name " ) ) ;
There 's also the useful counter function .
This creates a function which returns a value that 's incremented by one every time it 's called : var next Id = counter ( ) ;
nextId ( ) ; //=> 1
nextId ( ) ; //=> 2
nextId( ) ; //=> 3
There 's also a full set of Python - style iteration functions , such as forEach , map and filter , which are sure to see heavy use .
As far as documentation goes , Mochikit has some very good API documentation , but details on some very basic parts of the library are a little lacking .
In particular , after reading all the docs , watching the screencast and writing a few Mochikit - based scripts , I 'm still unsure which version of the library is best suited for any purpose .
Do I use the packed version or the main Mochikit.js ?
How can I load individual parts of the library ?
However , Mochikit does have a mailing list , so answers to these kinds of questions are , no doubt , not far away .
All in all , Mochikit may not be what you 're used to in terms of a JavaScript library , but it 's beautifully designed and I 'm looking forward to seeing where Bob takes it .
Yahoo !
UI Library The Yahoo !
UI Library or ( YUI as it's commonly been referred to ) was developed by Yahoo !
for internal use , but has recently been open sourced along with a whole raft of excellent developer resources at developer .
yahoo.com .
YUI is more a distinct set of " utilities " than a coherent library , with five core scripts that cover :
animation
AJAX
DOM manipulation
drag-and - drop
event handling
And there are six controls , namely :
Calendar
Slider
Menu
AutoComplete
Tree View
Container classes ( with which you can implement all manner of window - style widgets )
You can download each of these scripts individually from the developer .
yahoo.com site .
There is a definite advantage to this loosely coupled approach to designing libraries -- it often seems a bit of an overkill to have users download 100 or so kilobytes of library when , for instance , they only want to use the event system .
Each of the Yahoo !
libraries depends only on the small yahoo.js file .
On the other hand , this approach offers a slightly less coherent experience for the developer and could possibly introduce a certain amount of repetition within the libraries .
One thing that feels awkward about YUI is the fact that it 's very heavily namespaced .
Every call you make to the library needs to be prefixed with a hefty package string :
var myAnim = new YAHOO.util .
Anim(
' test ' ,
{ height : {to : 10} } ,
1 ,
YAHOO.util.Easing.easeOut
) ;
myAnim.animate ( ) ;
This all seems rather verbose , and I 'm unsure whether JavaScript really requires that degree of namespacing -- usually we'd never have that much code loaded into any one page .
Nevertheless , YUI is a straightforward and utilitarian library with a primary focus that seems to be smoothing over browser differences as simply as possible .
The Basics
YUI 's event handling library should have a very familiar API for those who are used to the native browser event handling methods .
However , it packs a few nice surprises that Yahoo !
developer , Dustin Diaz , has explained in some detail on his site .
You can set a simple listener like this :
YAHOO.util.event.addListener(' object_id ' , ' click ' , callBackFunction ) ;
A very powerful feature of the event library is its deferred attachment of event listeners .
Essentially , if you attempt to attach a listener to an element that does not yet exist because the page has n't loaded yet , it will transparently wait for that page to become available before attaching to the event .
This is a neat solution to an issue that has confused and frustrated many DHTML newbies .
The DOM library abstracts over browser inconsistencies , allowing the seamless setting of styles and reporting of element properties .
However , while it takes care of the common tasks reasonably well , there are a few surprises in here :
get is YUI 's version of the infamous $ function .
function .
One interesting method is generateId , which can be used to generate IDs for elements programmatically so you can quickly access them at other points in the script .
It 's not immediately obvious why this approach would be used over simply storing references to the objects , though , so I 'd be interested to see it used in a real script .
The Connection Manager contains all of YUI 's AJAX magic , and in line with the other libraries , chooses not to take a high - level approach .
It does nothing more than provide a cross browser interface to XMLHttpRequest :
YAHOO.util.Connect.asyncRequest (
' GET ' ,
' http://www.yahoo.com',
callback
) ;
One highlight is the rich callback interface , which allows you to define an object that wraps your callback functions as well as some extra configuration .
Here 's an example callback object :
var callback = {
success : function ( resp ) { alert ( ' WOO !!' ) ; } , // called on success
failure : function ( resp ) { alert ( ' BOO ! ' ) ; } , // called on error
argument : arguments , // user defined arguments
scope : formController // scope the callbacks are called within
}
Highs and Lows
The documentation provided by Yahoo ! for the library is excellent .
The site has formal API documentation , plenty of examples , a mailing list and some brief but clear explanations of the main features of each part of the library .
However , as with Dojo and Mochikit , the library has not quite managed to capture the imagination of the developer community as much as Prototype , so independent articles are still thin on the ground at the moment .
The best place to check for articles about YUI is Yahoo !
developer , Dustin Diaz 's site .
As I implied above , the event handling implementation is one of YUI 's main strengths , and the fact that it is decoupled from the other parts of the library means that it could well see a lot of use independently from the rest of the library .
However , the rest of the library , while being very functional , does n't contain as many innovative features as the likes of Mochikit , Dojo and Prototype , and because of the long package strings , coding with YUI sometimes feel rather long - winded .
Yet the growing list of components is very rich .
For instance , the Calendar component supports several languages and multiple date selections , and the Container classes give you the power to implement all kinds of windowed interfaces .
One downside of using these components is that they tend to be very heavily dependent on the other libraries ; in discussing this , Dean Edwards highlights as an example the treeview control , which uses around 260 K of JavaScript .
Which one Wins ?
Well , the short answer to this question is that there is no real stand - out solution that excels in all situations .
Prototype is the most comprehensively documented -- albeit in a splintered way .
It is also seemingly the most widespread library at the moment , possibly because it really excels at the kind of tasks developers complete most often , like selecting nodes and working with lists .
Of course , it 's going to be the natural choice for Ruby developers because it sticks to many Ruby idioms .
One other great thing about Prototype is that it has the mighty weight of Rails behind it and , as a result , there are many developers providing bug fixes and patches to Prototype .
Finally , it offers a wealth of add - on libraries such as scriptaculous , Rico , and Behaviour that make it a good , solid choice for many developers .
On the other hand , Prototype has a very under - developed event handling framework , which is a major problem for an otherwise powerful library .
Also -- and this is purely a matter of taste -- Prototype 's super - pragmatic approach to things ( like the heavy use of the innerHTML property ) can seem a little " dirty " sometimes .
For smaller projects , the decoupled design and fully - featured components of YUI may well be a big plus .
It 's very easy to drop in the Connection Manager or the Event library and get going on some basic tasks without having to traverse too much of a learning curve .
On the whole , though , it does n't have much to offer in terms of cool or powerful features .
Dojo is definitely the daddy of the bunch -- you can almost always rely on it for the most powerful implementation of any feature .
And Dojo's focus on performance is an absolute godsend if you 're planning a very JavaScript - intensive application .
The widget implementation also has enormous potential for building complex UIs .
However it really is quite big -- both in terms of its file size and the size of the API -- so I would n't recommend it for smaller projects .

" Nobody can give you freedom . "
-- Lord Acton
If you 're in Baltimore , MD , this phrase may sound familiar to you , and with good reason .
Coming into the city northbound on I -395 ( aka Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd . ) , the road bends to the left at this hairy intersection and you find yourself on Howard Street .
A few lights later , you pass under Mount Royal Avenue , and if you look closely , you 'll notice that a local wag has expressed this cynical thought in spray paint on the overpass .
I did n't notice it until my first day of Air Force ROTC .
I was driving a Ford Aerostar with a few other wet behind the ears cadets in tow , and we were all overwhelmed by a day of indoctrination .
Not that it had been a bad day , we 'd just all been up since 0400 , and were all overloaded with new information .
My friend Ben , who was sitting shotgun , saw the motto at the same time I did , and we both said it simultaneously .
But we did n't just say it ; we 'd been trained on command voice , so we shouted it :
" No government can ever give you free do - o - o - o - om ! "
with the last syllable trailing off as we flew under the overpass .
The other two or three cadets cracked up , until one of them said , " Hey , is n't that kind of ... anti-establishment ? " {{dead silence}}
And then I think we all realized it at once : no government can give you freedom -- you have to take it , seize it , and exercise your rights , or you do n't have them .
That 's how we - - " we " meaning " those Founding Fathers " everyone talks about -- got the First Amendment and the Bill of Rights .
But even then , the government 's handwriting on a piece of paper does n't guarantee you anything ; it 's writing on a piece of paper , and until you take the freedom , the paper is useless .
Furthermore , whoever sprayed it on the overpass gets it : whoever he or she is -- we 'll give " her " the benefit of the doubt -- she 's one of the only Americans out there who is taking advantage of the freedoms that I give up by wearing the uniform .
The idea that " No government can ever give you freedom " is subversive -- if you 're not out exercising the freedom the government has " given " you , and that I work every day to secure for you , then you may as well be in jail .
For the next four years , every time I passed under that bridge -- most of the time in my uniform -- I was only too proud to shout , " No government can ever give you freedom ! "
... and going the other direction under the overpass , I would gleefully shout , " freedom you give ever can government No ! "
This does n't make as much sense , but it 's a free country , right ?

LOS ANGELES , Calif .  --
Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney said Tuesday in a Nevada television interview that he supports letting states " make their own decision " about whether to keep abortion legal .
" My view is that the Supreme Court has made an error in saying at the national level one size fits all for the whole nation , " Romney told Nevada political columnist Jon Ralston in a televised interview .
" Instead , I would let states make their choices . "
Asked by Ralston if it was " OK " with him that Nevada is a " pro-choice state , " Romney said , " I 'd let states make their own decision in this regard .
My view , of course , is I 'm a pro-life individual .
That 's the position I support .
But , I 'd let states have this choice rather than let the federal government have it . "

Romney Shift ?
In his interview with Ralston , Romney was not asked about his support for a Human Life Amendment or federal legislation which would bring unborn children under the protections of the 14th Amendment .
The former Massachusetts governor endorsed both positions -- which would effectively ban abortion nationwide -- during an Aug. 6 interview on ABC News ' " Good Morning America . "
Asked by ABC News ' George Stephanopoulos whether he supports the Republican Party 's 2004 platform on abortion rights , which states , " We support a Human Life Amendment to the Constitution and we endorse legislation to make it clear that the 14th Amendment 's protections apply to unborn children , " Romney said , " You know , I do support the Republican platform , and I support that being part of the Republican platform and I 'm pro-life . "

Romney Campaign Pushes Back
When ABCNEWS.com reported Wednesday that states like Nevada would be unable to keep abortion legal if Romney 's ultimate vision were implemented , a Romney spokesman sought to explain the discrepancy by saying that while Romney supports the Human Life Amendment and 14th Amendment legislation contained in the Republican Party 's 2004 platform , he does not view either measure as " achievable " at this time .
By contrast , he views overturning Roe vs. Wade , the Supreme Court case which legalized abortion throughout the United States , as a goal which can be achieved more quickly .
If Romney succeeds in overturning Roe v. Wade through his Supreme Court appointments , states would once again be empowered to make their own decisions about abortion rights .
States would retain this power , under Romney 's vision , until it is possible to outlaw abortion at the federal level .
At that point , they would lose this power .
Romney 's camp , however , does not see this day coming any time soon .
" We should aspire to passing a Human Life Amendment when the country as a whole is prepared for it , " Romney spokesman Kevin Madden told ABC News .
" The American people just are n't there yet . "

The record industry is pressing the UK's ISPs for a deal that would see persistent illegal file sharers automatically booted off the net .
High - level talks between the ruling council of internet trade body ISPA and the Music Publishers Association are aiming to settle the historic tension between the two industries .
Comments from a government Minister yesterday hint that an unlikely bargain could be approaching .
Lord Triesman said talks are " progressing more promisingly than people might have thought six months ago " .
People familiar with the negotiations say the ISPs would prefer a financial penalty to a full disconnection .
The providers are concerned that terminating access is a disproportionate response .
The internet is rapidly becoming an essential part of national infrastructure for consumers , they argue , not merely a source of entertainment .
And from the ISPs ' perspective , the government is sending out mixed signals on the issue .
On one hand , Competitiveness Minister Stephen Timms has made several speeches recently pushing the importance of access to , and investment in , the internet .
On the other , Triesman , the parliamentary under secretary for Innovation , Universities and Skills , said the government would hit providers with regulations if they do not clamp down on file sharers .
A department spokeswoman told The Reg today : " This is an area where we will take action if we have to . "
The government would like to see a " range of sanctions " available to punish infringers and would prefer a voluntary setup , she added .
Part of the government 's agenda seems certain to include a digital fingerprinting system to monitor infringing content .
Triesman said : " Where people have registered music as an intellectual property I believe we will be able to match data banks of that music to music going out and being exchanged on the net . "
Publicly , ISPA maintains its stance that the providers are neutral carriers who could not possibly intervene in this way . ®

It gives you an elevated sense of importance .
You ’re always late for social engagements , barely have enough time for family get - togethers , and hardly get a moment ’s sleep .

You ’re like a rock star without the music .
Of course , it ’s all just an illusion .
A commitment to anything more than your standard workday is a commitment to work harder , not smarter .

Hi , I ’m Mark Nottingham .
I currently co-chair the IETF HTTP and QUIC Working Groups , and am a member of the Internet Architecture Board .
I usually write here about the Web , protocol design , HTTP , and caching .
Find out more .
Why Revise HTTP ?
I have n’t talked about it here much , but I ’ve spent a fair amount of time over the last year and a half working with people in the IETF to get RFC2616 — the HTTP specification — revised .
That effort reached a milestone last week when the HTTPbis Working Group had its first face - to - face meeting in Vancouver .
It ’s still early days , but we ’ve already made good progress ; based on what we saw in the room , for example , it looks like Roy ’s partitioned drafts will become the basis of the new work , and Roy , Julian and Yves will work together as editors on the new documents .
When I talk to people about this , however , I often get asked why we ’re doing it .
Revising HTTP certainly is n’t as sexy as coming up with another format or protocol for the world to adopt , and many people see what ’s going on as boring , or not mattering to developers .
I could n’t disagree more ; this work must take place , and now is the best time .
HTTP started as a protocol just for browsers , and its task was fairly simple .
Yes , persistent connections and ranged requests make things a bit more complex , but the use cases were relatively homogenous almost a decade ago , and the people doing the implementations were able to assure interop for those common cases .
Now , a new generation of developers are using HTTP for things that were n’t even thought of then ; AJAX , Atom , CalDAV , “ RESTful Web Services ” and the like push the limits of what HTTP is and can do .
The dark corners that were n’t looked at very closely in the rush to get RFC2616 out are now coming to light , and cleaning them up now will help these new uses , rather than encourage them to diverge in how they use HTTP .
So , while the focus of the WG is on implementors , to me that does n’t must mean Apache , IIS , Mozilla , Squid and the like ; it also means people using HTTP to build new protocols , like OAuth and Atom Publishing Protocol .
It means people running large Web sites that use HTTP in not - so - typical ways .
Another reason to revise HTTP is that there ’s a lot of things that the spec does n’t say .
The people who were there in the late 90 ’s understand the context , and those who have been around HTTP enough have learned to understand the thinking behind its design and the intent of its features .
However , there ’s a whole new generation of implementers and extension builders who have n’t been exposed to this .
If we can document the philosophy of HTTP with regard to extensibility , error handling , etc. , they have a better chance of understanding the right way to use it .
Last , but certainly not least , getting a bunch of HTTP implementers together and actively discussing the spec also leads to the possibility of interop work .
While the IETF does n’t do formal test suites , we can still come up with informal tools and a test corpus for improving interop .
In the end , my personal goal for this effort is fairly selfish ; my job involves helping people inside my company understand how to use and extend HTTP in the best way possible .
The current spec makes it very hard to do that , but a revision gives us the chance of improving the spec , people ’s understanding of it , and how well it ’s implemented .

Over the last two years , U.S. Atty .
Gen. Alberto R. Gonzales has appointed more than two dozen individuals as federal immigration judges .
The new jurists include a former treasurer of the Louisiana Republican Party , who was a legal advisor to the Bush Florida recount team after the 2000 presidential election .
There is also a former GOP congressional aide who had tracked voter fraud issues for the Justice Department , and a Texan appointed by then - Gov. George W. Bush to a seat on the state library commission .
One thing missing on many of their resumes : a background in immigration law .
These lawyers are among a growing number of the nation ’s more than 200 immigration judges who have little or no experience in the law they were appointed to enforce .

The admission by former Justice Department official Monica M. Goodling this week that federal immigration judges were screened for their political credentials and loyalty to the Republican Party in possible violation of civil service laws is drawing new attention to the usually low - profile immigration bench .
The selection process that Goodling described also appeared at odds with Gonzales ’ own stated efforts to reform the trouble - plagued immigration - law system by bringing in experts and establishing tougher performance standards for judges .
Goodling testified that as a senior counsel to Gonzales in 2005 and 2006 , she considered factors such as party affiliation and political donations when screening immigration judge applicants .
She said she did not remember in how many cases she applied such a test .

Of the 226 immigration judges around the country , 75 have been appointed during the Bush administration -- 26 of them during Gonzales ’ tenure .
The judges handled more than 300,000 cases last year , including deportation and asylum proceedings .
Immigration lawyers and judges said Goodling ’s revelation explained what they perceived as a growing politicization of the immigration bench in recent years .
“ In the last few years , we have seen the appointment of a good number of immigration judges with no background whatsoever in immigration ... which really makes you wonder how it is they are being appointed to those positions , ” said Crystal Williams , deputy director of programs at the American Immigration Lawyers Assn. in Washington .
In light of Goodling ’s testimony , Williams said , “ I think we might have an answer . ”

Gonzales ’ appointment last year of an immigration judge in Arizona , Bruce A. Taylor , was one that turned heads .
Taylor is considered an expert -- not in immigration law but in prosecuting adult - obscenity cases .
Such cases are important to social conservatives , who form an important base of support for the Republican Party .
His former colleagues adamantly defend the selection .
“ He is far more qualified than most attorneys appointed to the federal bench .
He is certainly capable of mastering immigration law , ” said Patrick Trueman , a former Justice Department obscenity prosecutor .
“ Federal judges handle a wide variety of issues they did not handle in their law practice .
What is important is good legal judgment and experience . ”
The Justice Department defended the new judges as well .

“ The department values temperament , analytical ability and relevant experience in the selection of immigration judges , and believes that outstanding immigration judges can come from diverse legal backgrounds , ” spokeswoman Cynthia Magnuson said Friday .
“ The department considers all applicants based on the totality of their professional records and backgrounds .
Immigration judges appointed during this administration were well - qualified for their current positions . ”
The hiring and firing of immigration judges are covered by federal civil service laws , which prohibit discrimination based on political association .
The Justice Department has launched a widening internal review to see whether laws were broken in the hiring of the immigration judges as well as career prosecutors .
Goodling testified that she was told by another Justice official that because the judges are appointed by the attorney general , she could include political factors .
Responding to her testimony , a Justice Department spokesman said Thursday that the department had never taken that view .

Considering political affiliation in filling civil service positions is a violation of the Hatch Act , which is designed to keep party politics separate from the day - to - day operations of the federal government .
Such a violation could result in the firing of any employees involved in the illegal screening , and could trigger discrimination litigation by applicants who were declined positions .
Some lawmakers think standards for evaluating candidates have become too lax .
Sen. Arlen Specter ( R - Pa. ) has proposed requiring that prospective immigration judges have at least five years of experience in immigration law before being considered for the bench .
Gonzales last year chastised immigration judges for “ intemperate or even abusive ” conduct toward people seeking asylum in the United States .
As part of a comprehensive review of U.S. immigration courts , he is ordering that judges be tested about their knowledge of the law and undergo periodic performance reviews .

Some immigration judges said the recent hiring of politically connected judges undermined his goal of improving the quality of the bench and its decision making .
“ The irony of it is ... he has put a larger number of people with no immigration backgrounds in as judges who would not be subject to the new requirements , ” said Denise Slavin , an immigration judge in Miami since 1995 and president of the National Assn. of Immigration Judges .
“ This highlights the concern we have about the public perception of judicial independence and integrity in the immigration courts ’ system . ”

NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Topps Meat Co. on Saturday expanded a recall of ground beef from about 300,000 pounds to 21.7 million pounds , one of the largest meat recalls in U.S. history .
The recalled products are all ground beef patties with various brand names .
In a statement , the Elizabeth , New Jersey , company said the hamburger patties may be contaminated with E. coli O157 : H7 , a bacterium that can cause severe diarrhea and cramps , as well as other complications .
A statement from the U.S. Department of Agriculture said 25 illnesses are under investigation in Connecticut , Florida , Indiana , Maine , New Jersey , New York , Ohio and Pennsylvania .
The ground beef products being recalled have a " sell by date " or a " best if used by date " between September 25 , 2007 , and September 25 , 2008 , Topps ' statement said .
Watch the latest on the beef recall »
The packages also have the marking " Est. 9748 " inside the USDA mark of inspection .
Tuesday , the company announced a recall of about 331,000 pounds of hamburger meat , according to the USDA .
" Because the health and safety of our consumers is our top priority , we are taking these expansive measures , " said Vice President of Operations Geoffrey Livermore in the statement .
" Topps is continuing to work with the USDA , state departments of health , retailers and distributors to ensure the safety of our consumers .
Additionally , we have augmented our internal quality control procedures with microbiologists and food safety experts .
We sincerely regret any inconvenience and concerns this may cause our consumers , " Livermore said .

List of recalled products
This is the company 's first recall in its 65 years of business , the statement said .
Consumers who find the products at home are asked to cut off the UPC code and return it to Topps for a full refund , then dispose of the product immediately , Topps spokeswoman Michelle Williams said .
The company said to avoid E. coli , consumers should wash hands thoroughly after handling the beef .
Topps set up a toll - free recall help line at ( 888 ) 734-0451 .
Williams said because the products may have been produced up to a year ago , many of them have already been safely consumed .
Production in the ground beef area of the company 's plant in Elizabeth has been shut down until all the investigations are complete , Williams said in a phone interview .
" We 're working with the USDA and the CDC [ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ] and conducting our own investigation , " she added .
The products , all ground beef patties and hamburgers with various brand names , were distributed mainly in the northeastern United States , but went to retailers in many other areas of the country as well , Williams said .
While the sheer size of the recall is large , two other companies have been involved in larger recalls .
In 2002 , Pilgrim 's Pride recalled more than 27 million pounds of poultry , and Hudson Foods recalled 25 million pounds of ground beef in 1997 .

In papers filed in U.S. District Court in Connecticut , Lorene Schaefer charged GE , the world ’s second - largest company by market capitalization , with gender discrimination .
The suit also names 13 GE officers and directors , including Chairman and Chief Executive Jeff Immelt .
Her suit , which is seeking class - action status , seeks $ 500 million in damages for a class of about 1,500 to 1,700 GE women workers , according her attorney , David Sanford of Sanford Wittels & Heisler LP .
“ This lawsuit is designed to achieve systemic injunctive relief to change GE ’s discriminatory pay and promotions practices and policies , ” Schaefer , 43 , charged in court papers .
In an e-mail , GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said , “ We strongly deny the allegations made by Ms. Schaefer .
We will defend against these claims in court . ”
Schaefer , a 13 - year veteran of the Fairfield , Connecticut - based company , has served as general counsel at GE ’s transportation unit , an Erie , Pennsylvania - based business that makes railroad locomotives .
GE ’s other businesses include commercial lending , aircraft engines , appliances and NBC media .
In an interview , Schaefer said that after two years in her post , GE management in April told her that she was to be demoted and replaced as general counsel of the unit .
Schaefer said GE officials told her they wanted to replace her with a “ big time ” general counsel , but did not provide specifics as to how that differed from her qualifications .
“ I thought about it long and hard , I thought about what I had experienced at the General Electric Company and what women across the corporation had been talking to me and talking to each other about for my entire 13 - year history at the company , and I decided to hire counsel , ” Schaefer said .
“ It ’s not unusual at all .
There are many , many women who have had the same experience as mine . ”
After hiring an attorney , Schaefer was placed on paid administrative leave in May .
“ All decisions regarding Ms. Schaefer were based on the merits , ” GE ’s Sheffer said in a phone interview .
He noted that women accounted for 27 of the company ’s top 186 employees , classed as “ officers , ” up from 17 in 2001 .
He added that GE had 62 women in the next management rank down , the “ senior executive band ” out of about 400 in total and up from 42 in 2001 .
In all , GE employs more than 300,000 people .
GE shares lost 10 cents to $ 37.63 on the New York Stock Exchange .

You could say this was a desperate cry for attention .

“ So , I guess I have n’t made any mistakes , ” Donald Trump said recently , pointing to a poll showing him leading in Iowa .
“ I ’m sure I will , at some point , but so far , you would have to say , it has n’t worked out badly , right ? ”
This is hard to argue with .
He makes crude attacks on Mexican “ rapists , ” he criticizes John McCain , Rosie O’Donnell and Megyn Kelly — three of the most beloved figures in the American pantheon , apparently — and what happens ?
Trump gets to the top of the polls .
The chattering classes are gnashing their whitened - for - TV teeth .
Jeb Bush , Marco Rubio , Scott Walker and maybe even John Kasich are supposed to win this thing .
But Donald Trump , the Jed Clampett of the Republican Party ?
No way .
Impossible .
The only reason he is doing well is that he is outrageous and entertaining and sucking up all the attention .
Or so the theory goes .
If the other candidates could just get some of that same attention , they would rocket to the top .
So here comes the Iowa State Fair .
The East Coast media always fall in love with the Iowa State Fair because they think deep - fried Twinkies on a stick is so gosh - darned Midwestern .
The Republican field showed up .
And all it had to do was moon a little for the cameras .
At the National Right to Life Convention in New Orleans in July , Rick Santorum had worn a dark suit and bellowed to the crowd : “ When did it become the law of the land that the Supreme Court has the final say on everything ? ”
If anybody shouted back the correct answer — “ 1803 , Marbury v. Madison ” — it would have been drowned out by the thunderous applause Santorum got for asking the question .
At the Iowa State Fair a few days ago , Santorum had switched to blue jeans and a white shirt with the sleeves rolled up , but he stuck with the stuff that worked .
“ When the Supreme Court is wrong , it ’s not the law of the land ! ” he shouted .
Cue the same crowd roar .
Santorum won the Iowa caucus in 2012 and came in second nationally in the race for the nomination .
Today , a CNN poll shows him with 1 percent of the vote in Iowa and a Fox poll shows him with 1 percent of the vote nationally .
In other words , Santorum is dead meat .
Deep - fry him and put him on a stick and still nobody would buy him .
Why ?
And why are the media darlings also in single digits ?
It is a wonderment .
Could it be that the analysts are out of touch with America , as the polls indicate ?
No. Impossible .
Though it pains the analysts to say so , the polls must be wrong , or meaningless , or both .
The king of poll analysis , Nate Silver and his crew at fivethirtyeight.com , wrote on Aug. 11 that national polls should be largely ignored .
They “ lack empirical power to predict the nomination ” and also “ they describe a fiction . ”
What is nonfiction , according to Silver , is Silver .
Trump is “ almost certainly doomed , sooner or later , ” Silver wrote on Aug .
6 . “ If you want absurd specificity , I recently estimated Trump ’s chance of becoming the GOP nominee at 2 percent . ”
And “ sooner or later , ” Silver may be correct .
But in the meantime , Trump is having a wonderful time mooning America .
In a genuinely brilliant piece of political stagecraft , Trump arrived at the Iowa State Fair on Saturday in his 52 - foot , 11 - passenger , $ 7 million Sikorsky S - 76 B helicopter and offered children free rides in it .
As Thomas Lake of CNN reported , William Bowman , 9 , and his two brothers , Sean , 6 , and Brendan 5 , who live in a suburb of Des Moines , clamored aboard .
They were suitably amazed .
“ Mr. Trump ? ” William asked .
“ Yes , ” Trump said .
“ Are you Batman ? ”
“ I am Batman , ” Trump said .

( Corrects length of military service for women in paragraph 6 )
JERUSALEM , Sept 24 ( Reuters ) -
To many she is a traitor , a coward and a parasite .
But 17 - year - old Israeli " draft dodger " Saar Vardi says if more people thought like her , the Middle East would be a more peaceful place .
Vardi is part of a growing group of young Israelis who are refusing to sign up for mandatory military service , often in protest over the Jewish state 's occupation of Palestinian territory or because of last year 's unpopular war in Lebanon .
Army statistics show the number of young people who do not enlist for military service has crept up in recent years to more than 1 in 4 men in 2007 and more than 43 percent of women .
" People refer to me as a traitor and say that my country has given me so much and I 'm not willing to give anything back , like a parasite , " Vardi , a student , told Reuters .
" But I know what I believe ...
If truly everyone saw things the way I see them then we would n't need an army . "
Most Israeli men have to serve for three years in the army and are liable for reserve duty after that unless they can prove they are physically or psychologically unfit for battle , or come from an ultra-Orthodox background .
Women must do two years .
Until recently , opting out of military service was largely taboo in a nation born out of war , and in constant conflict with its Arab neighbours .
Groups of young soldiers clutching rifles are a common sight on the streets of Israel and for many , serving in the army goes to the core of national identity .
The trend to avoid the draft -- which has been joined by some entertainers -- has sparked heated media debate and government pledges to act .
" When he goes into battle a soldier should not have to feel that a portion of our society regards him as a sucker , " Defence Minister Ehud Barak was reported as saying in July .
" It 's time to go back to the days when service was a right and an honour and shirking was like wearing the mark of Cain . "
" CANCER "
Ultra Orthodox
Jews have been exempt from military service for years , and their ranks are growing .
But more secular Israelis are also finding ways around joining up , sometimes by saying they are conscientious objectors or unfit .
Some say they are loath to fight for an occupying force and are willing to go to jail for their beliefs .
Others say they do not trust Ehud Olmert 's government with their lives after a report said the prime minister acted impulsively in going to war against Lebanon last year .
And some young Israelis would simply rather focus on their education or career than on defending their country .
" There 's the ongoing wars and the ongoing occupation , " said Hagay Matar , who spent two years in prison for refusing the draft .
" People are starting to feel they do n't have to do it . "
But several mayors have vowed not to allow entertainers who did not enlist to take part in Israel 's 60th anniversary celebrations next year , and one suggested denying them jobs in municipal government .
Some commentators have lambasted those who shun military service , reminding them they face jail .
" Draft dodging is a cancer that eats away at the foundations of Israel as a society , " said Eitan Haber , a columnist writing in Israel 's most popular daily Yedioth Ahronoth .
" They do n't want to serve ?
They will get a mess kit and a prison uniform . "
" WHAT'S ISRAEL DYING FOR ? "
But those who resist military service have also found support .
Columnist Yonatan Gefen asked in the Ma'ariv newspaper why Israel 's young people would want to fight in an army " that does n't know what it is dying for " .
Israel should favour a leaner , professional military over conscription and focus on technology and intelligence instead of numbers , particularly since military might did not help it get rid of guerrillas in Lebanon , said another commentator .
" Modern wars are not won by masses of foot soldiers , " wrote columnist Gabi Nitzam in Yedioth Ahronoth last month .
Israel is trying to make the army more attractive for young people by allowing promising sportsmen , musicians and even fashion models to do their military service away from the frontline while pursuing their careers .
The government is also planning to launch a civilian service programme , which would allow conscientious objectors , the physically unfit , ultra Orthodox Jews and Israeli Arabs -- who are exempt from the draft -- a chance to serve in other ways .
Reuven Gal , who headed a team that drew up recommendations to government for the new programme , said Israelis should have the option to shun the army as long as they did not shirk national duty entirely .
" We want to create a norm whereby a person who does not enlist goes to civilian service , " Gal was quoted as saying .
" We should not generalise and say that draft - dodgers should be strung up in the city square . "
Imagine that …a candidate going 100 % positive for a change !
That 's the most impressive part of the two TV ads released today by the Ron Paul campaign which will be running starting today in New Hampshire .
The $ 1.1 million advertising buy is the first major use of the big money that Ron Paul has raised .
The fact that the ads are so positive in nature makes them a very interesting test .
The first ad shows a parade of people from their 20s to their 50s with positive looks on their faces explaining in brief why they support Ron Paul .
The first speaker , sitting on a front porch , says , “ Well , I do n't always agree with Ron Paul , but he 's honest , and you always know where he stands . ”
I can't remember the last time I saw a TV political ad that actually admits that not everyone agrees with the candidate right up front .
That was refreshing .
The ad then uses the mostly young - looking faces to list the highlights of Paul 's stump speech .
The last two people say , “ He 's the only candidate who is talking sense to the people , ” and “ He 's catching on …I 'm telling ya ! ”
The second ad is Ron Paul himself speaking to the voters .
Right out of the box , he mentions first his top two issues , emphasizing that he is the only candidate in either party who wants to get our troops out of Iraq immediately and that he wants to cut government spending .
He emphasizes balancing the budget and protecting the threatened dollar .
He then concludes with the line , “ Once we stop wasting trillions of dollars overseas , we can cut the budget and still help people who need it . ”
This is a very interesting signal .
He 's essentially saying that he's not going to try to completely undo the “ social safety net ” in one fell swoop .
Hard core libertarians may not like it , but it 's very smart politics .
Here in Virginia where I live , the TV ads currently running for candidates for the state legislature are more typical of the fare you usually find .
They all go negative every time .
They 're constantly negative .
And while they do include a few positive statements , they always find a way to go back to emphasizing the negative .
This is not just a phenomenon here in Virginia .
I 'm sure that people across the country are as sick of all the negative ads in their local areas as I am in mine .
Among Presidential candidates , Rudy Giuliani is already famous for his negative ads against Hillary Clinton .
Clinton herself went negative against President Bush in her very first TV ad .
Other candidates have not yet gone negative , so I do n't want to suggest that Ron Paul is the only one who has n't .
But the way Paul goes about staying positive in these ads is a refreshing change .
Rather than appealing to particular constituencies ( such as Clinton , Obama , Romney , and McCain are doing in their ads ) , Paul is simply appealing based on the broad viewpoints that resonate most with people when they finally get to hear him , regardless of their political orientation .
It remains to be seen how effective this approach will be in the long run , as this will define how much of a chance Dr. Paul has in the fight for the Republican notmination .
One thing is for certain : if he wanted to introduce himself in a positive light to the voters of New Hampshire , he has succeeded .
What will be interesting to watch next is how the ads will be received by his opponents ' supporters .
Will they go negative on him ?
Will he be ignored ?
Already , the hard core neo -con bloggers are doing their best to dig up dirt on him .
But even more important will be to see if these ads give Dr. Paul a bump in the polls in New Hampshire .
If they do , we could have a whole new ballgame .

Fortune Magazine --
Ask New Orleanians how their city is faring these days , and their responses follow an eerily consistent arc .
They begin with gratitude that you bothered asking and then move on to recitations of all the good that 's going on .
Hurricane Katrina , and the flood that followed , struck two years ago this month , and since then the tourists have returned , basic services are operating , and the city has crafted a comprehensive recovery plan .
Linger a bit on the subject , however , and optimism quickly turns to exasperation .
Lack of government leadership , the glacial pace of rebuilding , and outright rage at absent neighbors who 've yet to demolish blighted homes top the list of gripes .
New Orleanians talk darkly of emotional stresses on residents and hidden health risks , like the recent revelation that the city has n't been fluoridating its tap water since the storm .
" Those of us who have chosen to stay are very optimistic that we can make this work , " says Bill Freiberg , New Orleans branch manager for regional brokerage Morgan Keegan and a sixth - generation native .
" But after two years the frustrations become depressing . "
The frustrations are many , and all too often they boil down to money .
By some measures , New Orleans is flush with cash .
About $ 25 billion of Katrina - related private insurance claims have been paid out in Louisiana , some of which went to rebuilding damaged homes .
What 's more , the federal government has allocated nearly $ 27 billion for housing , rebuilding the levees , and what 's known as hazard mitigation , the messy job of removing debris and repairing critical infrastructure , like broken sewer lines and potholed roads .
Too few of those dollars , however , have found their way into the local economy .
Bank deposits have skyrocketed , indicating that the insured have n't decided whether to reinvest in their community .
Just 22 percent of the funds Washington has set aside for rebuilding Louisiana have been spent .
For example , the program that compensates uninsured homeowners for their losses took more than a year to establish and only recently has begun distributing checks in significant quantities .
The population of Greater New Orleans is roughly 200,000 below its pre-Katrina level , which has triggered a labor shortage .
Private - sector investors , in turn , have scaled back or postponed development plans , furthering a vicious circle of inaction .
" We 're in a terrible catch - 22 , " says Scott Howard , a local banker with Regions Bank .
" We can't build because we do n't have enough people .
We do n't have enough people because there 's nowhere to live . "
Unsticking the gridlock is no simple task .
It 's as complex as getting local and federal bureaucrats to work better with one another - and with Louisiana politics that 's extra tough - and as prosaic as finding enough plumbers to build new homes .
Uneven development
There 's no one - size - fits - all way to describe the state of New Orleans today .
During a citywide tour on a rainy July day , ritzy Uptown neighborhoods and the famous French Quarter look the way they did before Aug. 29 , 2005 , while the shattered Lower Ninth Ward , etched on the nation 's guilty conscience in the days after the storm , still looks as if a powerful bomb had struck .
Residential neighborhoods like Lakeview and Gentilly display what locals call the " jack - o' - lantern " effect : spots of light surrounded by darkness .
In those sections of town , it 's common to see a tastefully landscaped and recently refurbished home next to a badly damaged house with a white trailer in the driveway supplied by , yes , the Federal Emergency Management Agency .
The lot across the street may well be barren but for a lonely concrete slab .
In many parts of New Orleans , abandoned homes still sport the large " X " that National Guardsmen painted and annotated to signify , among other things , that the structure held a dead body .
Plenty of people wanted to help New Orleans .
KB Home ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) CEO Bruce Karatz thought his company , the big homebuilder , could pitch in not merely by giving money to charity but by doing what it does best , building homes .
In December 2005 he appeared with New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin and Jim Bernhard , CEO of Louisiana - based Shaw Group , an engineering firm , to announce that KB would open a regional office in New Orleans and that the two companies would build houses there .
By May , KB was in contract on three land deals - including a 3,000 - acre parcel in nearby Jefferson Parish , where it planned to construct 8,000 to 12,000 homes - and said it was negotiating for 40 more sites .
" Nobody knows what demand will be , " Karatz told FORTUNE last year , which featured KB 's efforts .
" I just know we 're doing the right thing . "
It turns out that supply and demand were problematic .
KB scaled back its plans in Jefferson Parish , then backed out altogether when the owner of the land was n't interested in selling a smaller parcel .
KB has begun building in the region , but primarily in Baton Rouge , as well as on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain .
The company is developing 73 Greek Revival homes in a transitional neighborhood near downtown New Orleans called River Garden .
So far it has sold eight homes there .
Karatz retired from KB in late 2006 amid questions over the timing of options grants .
His successor , Jeff Mezger , inherited the commitment .
" It 's taking longer for the city to rebound than we expected , " he says .
One unusual problem : a severe shortage of plumbers .
KB learned after it arrived that state law requires plumbers to complete more than four years of training before obtaining a license , and that Louisiana follows different plumbing codes than most other states .
That means KB effectively can't bring plumbers from Houston , where it has an extensive contractor network .
The company promoted a bill in the Louisiana legislature to loosen the requirements .
The state 's Plumbing - Heating - Cooling Contractors Association saw that the bill was killed .
A handful of hardy national players have jumped back into New Orleans .
Starbucks ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) opened a new store in the recovering Lakeview neighborhood on the spot where an independent coffee shop did n't return .
Lowe 's is constructing a giant store in East New Orleans .
Even Donald
Trump still plans to move ahead on a 69 - story condo and hotel tower he announced days before the storm .
But more investors are as frustrated as KB .
Strategic Hotels & Resorts ( Charts ) , the Chicago owner of the badly damaged Hyatt Regency downtown hotel , unveiled a plan this spring to develop a 20 - acre site that would include a new hotel , a new city hall , and a jazz museum .
That plan is dormant .
Even companies that made significant investments in New Orleans have fled .
Smith & Wollensky ( Charts ) ran a restaurant on a prime downtown spot for seven years but decided not to reopen after the storm .
" It was n't viable to run an $ 80 - per- person restaurant in the area , " says Alan Stillman , the company 's CEO .
" We owned the best location , the best corner , in the best quarter of town .
But the dynamics have changed . "
Although the Port of New Orleans is operating at pre-storm cargo levels , several longtime tenants who were wiped out have relocated permanently to Mobile , Ala. , or Houston .
" Every day we feel the impact of Katrina , " says Patrick Gallwey , chief operating officer of the port , an entity administered by the state .
Every city covets national chains and major businesses , but their absence is acute in New Orleans , never much of a headquarters town .
Of the 23 publicly traded companies that were based in the city before the storm , only half remain .
( Ruth 's Chris Steak House ( Charts ) , for instance , moved to Florida . )
Domestic Marshall Plan
Nobody expected the private sector to rebuild New Orleans by itself .
It was assumed the federal government would step up , especially given that the worst of the damage was caused not by the hurricane but by flooding attributed to shoddy levee construction and maintenance by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers .
What seemed to make the most sense was a kind of domestic Marshall Plan , or at least the appointment of a politician with disaster experience who would be as empowered as Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover was when river flooding destroyed Greenville , Miss. , in 1927 .
What New Orleans got instead is Donald Powell , the former chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .
Powell 's title is federal coordinator of Gulf Coast rebuilding .
His role is to be President Bush 's ambassador to the disaster - stricken region , meaning his job is to deflect the considerable flak local residents send the feds ' way .
Unlike Hoover in the 1920s , Powell has no real power , only a bully pulpit and an ability to play referee when local governments have a beef .
" The President was very clear that this should not be an exercise in centralized planning and that the locals need to control their destiny , " Powell says over endless rounds of Diet Cokes at the sleek InterContinental Hotel , where he stays when he 's in town .
He lives in Washington , D.C. , but hails from Amarillo , Texas , where he was a banker for decades .
A lanky and courtly type , the white - haired Powell is determined that Washington not shoulder all the blame for the slowness in rebuilding .
" At the end of the day , the federal government 's role in assisting the good people of the Gulf Coast will be satisfactory , " he says .
" Could it have been more efficient ?
Sure .
But we 're limited by laws .
We give them the money , and say , ' Here 's the deal . ' "
It was n't until last summer , however , that Louisiana worked out the deal of how to reimburse uninsured homeowners .
Congress appropriated more than $ 6 billion through the Department of Housing and Urban Development , to be paid to the state .
Concerned that the state 's endemic corruption would pervert the process , the Louisiana Recovery Authority hired a private contractor , ICF International of Alexandria , Va. , to run its Road Home homeowners ' assistance program .
Adding yet another bureaucracy slowed down the process further , as did the state 's decision to include homeowners whose only damage was from wind to those eligible for Road Home checks .
( Flood insurance was n't required in areas supposedly protected by the levees . )
Road
Home got off to a slow start , and a year later - years after the storm - has distributed just 37,000 checks , or $ 2.8 biIlion , out of 162,000 applications .
Because the state changed who could be covered after Congress appropriated the money , the program currently is estimated to be underfunded by more than $ 4 billion , much of which it hopes to get from Congress .
If Congress does n't act , Road Home will run dry by the end of the year .
The absence of Road Home payments speaks directly to the halting nature of the city 's recovery .
Residents who can't afford to repair their homes wo n't move back from wherever they 've resettled .
The longer the checks take to arrive , the longer they 'll stay away , and the less likely they are to return .
" We 've been frustrated since day one , " Powell says of the Road Home program .
" But that 's a contractual relationship between the state and the contractor . "
Some $ 6 billion in FEMA disaster money is held up because of federal rules for distributing it .
According to those rules , recipients of federal disaster aid need to apply for grants through their state , which in turn is required to make a 10 percent deposit for the grant .
It 's Washington 's way of making sure states will watch over its money .
Congress , working with the President , can waive the 10 percent requirement , as they did for New York City shortly after 9/11 .
After nearly two years of fighting over the 10 % waiver , Congress finally granted it to Louisiana in June , freeing up $ 750 million in additional funding .
At the end of my conversation with Powell , I ask him what advice he plans to give to his successor in the next administration .
He said he 's working on a list of suggestions , because " there is no handbook " for disasters like this , a comment I hear repeatedly in New Orleans .
I remind him that Hoover did provide a successful model 80 years ago - it involved near dictatorial powers - and ask if there is n't any possibility of creating a similar recovery czar for New Orleans .
Having already explained to me more than once the President 's position on the matter , Powell simply shakes his head in a silent " No . "
The man behind the rebuilding effort
On the eighth floor of the rundown , 1950s - era New Orleans City Hall , at the end of a long corridor , is an office with no number .
Beside the doorpost , taped over whatever sign was there before , is a single sheet of 8 � - by - 11 - inch photocopy paper that reads , " Office of Recovery Management . "
This is the redoubt of Edward J. Blakely , Mayor Nagin 's point man for rebuilding New Orleans .
Blakely , 69 , is a longtime professor of urban planning and an expert on disaster recovery .
He coordinated the relief efforts in Oakland after the 1989 earthquake , and Nagin hired him to craft and implement one plan that would decide where the city would and would n't rebuild .
Blakely inherited more than 50 plans that had been drafted by numerous consultants and community groups , and in March he presented his blueprint for spending $ 1.1 billion over five years on 17 " targeted areas . "
He promised fast results , predicting " cranes in the sky by September . "
Blakely fancies himself a man of action .
He leads reporters on Saturday - morning bike rides through blighted and recovering neighborhoods , both to show citizens that the mayor 's office is paying attention to their plight and to familiarize himself better with New Orleans .
He arrived Jan. 8 of this year , " the day of the Battle of New Orleans , a providential omen , " he tells me .
In his spare time he is developing a residential real estate project near Riverside , Calif .
On his desk sits a plaque that reads , footprints in history are n't made sitting down .
For all his biking and planning , however , Blakely has yet to spend any money .
For one thing , he 's not certain he 'll be able to find the billion dollars .
He intends to get about a quarter of the money from a municipal general obligation bond passed before the storm , though it is n't legally clear whether that money can be spent on hurricane recovery .
He intends to use $ 117 million of federal housing money from the state , and he also hopes to float a so - called " blight bond , " using condemned properties as collateral for borrowing an additional $ 300 million .
The state may be able to supply the balance .
Blakely lately has begun to acknowledge that there 'll be no cranes in the sky by September .
( Locals cluck that only a newcomer would have promised construction projects during the heart of hurricane season . )
The delay and the uncertainty over funding highlight an unfortunate fact :
Blakely , too , has only so much power .
He explains that some traffic lights in the eastern section of town are administered by the city and others by the state .
The board that runs the sewage and water system is a separate entity over which he has little control .
So despite the existence of a workable plan that generally is supported by residents , Blakely is in a holding pattern .
" It takes time to build things , " he says .
" They do n't appear overnight .
It also takes a certain process to put things in order . "
New Orleanians
I talk to admire Blakely 's intellect and his ability to look at the situation dispassionately .
It 's impossible , however , to overlook the contradiction between his professed love of action and his calm , measured approach to what in many areas remains a crisis situation .
A positive note
By New Orlean standards , it 's a mild summer evening on the leafy campus of Tulane University .
The twilight sun dances off the stately homes along St. Charles Avenue , the toniest address in the city 's Uptown neighborhood , as students jog along the dormant tracks of an electric streetcar line .
This part of town is the antidote to the destruction that weighs so heavily on the soul elsewhere , an oasis of Southern charm in a blemished city .
I 've come to Tulane to meet its president , Scott Cowen , a professor of management and a big bear of a man whose decade in New Orleans has done nothing to soften the honk of his native New Jersey accent .
As leader of the city 's most prestigious university , and its largest employer , Cowen has been active with numerous recovery groups , including the New Orleans Redevelopment Authority , which is helping Ed Blakely implement the city 's plan .
He displays the zeal of a convert , more unabashedly boosterish of his adopted hometown than many old - school New Orleanians .
Cowen launches into the positives .
The port is doing well , he notes .
Tourism and higher education are coming back .
Of course there are problems .
The Road Home assistance program " did n't work for a long time . "
The federal government " grossly underestimated what it was going to take to get us on solid footing . "
Tulane alone suffered $ 600 million in damage and has borrowed some $ 200 million for daily operations .
( It is using insurance claims and FEMA grants to pay down the debt . )
" The fact that the money is flowing bodes well , " Cowen says .
" A lot of surveys have been done , and 80 percent of the former residents of New Orleans would love to return . "
Counseling patience , Cowen has become a proponent of the Rule of Ten , a disaster - recovery timeline tool postulated a generation ago by a Brown University geographer named Robert Kates .
It posits that the amount of time it takes for a place merely to function again is 10 times the period it was uninhabitable , which was eight weeks in the case of New Orleans .
( This past March marked the 80 - week point . )
The time needed to completely rebuild is another factor of ten , or , for New Orleans , a total of 15 years .
" I 've got to believe this is one of the great development stories in America , " he says , " especially as people more clearly can see the progress we 're making .
Developers in particular have been taking a wait - and - see attitude .
But I think private money will come down in droves . "
With that , I thank Cowen for his time and head out into the pleasantly muggy New Orleans midsummer 's night feeling ever so slightly upbeat .
Finally , a conversation that began hopefully - and ended that way too .
The Death of Conservatism
By Sam Tanenhaus
Random House , 2009
Republican Gomorrah : Inside the Movement that Shattered the Party
By Max Blumenthal
Nation Books , 2009
Watching Obama ’s inauguration almost a year ago on TV , I remember feeling gleeful at the sight of George and Laura Bush taking off in a helicopter as the Obamas and Bidens waved goodbye .
After eight years of war , lies and looting of the economy , many progressives saw the entire Republican Party boarding that helicopter along with the Bushes .
Yet , one year later , conservative politics have not withered and died as many of the liberals who rallied around Obama had predicted .
Republicans , for now , are hanging around , and two books , Max Blumenthal ’s Republican Gomorrah and Sam Tanenhaus ’
The Death of Conservatism , address the rise and fall of the right ’s dominance in the United States .
Both authors agree that the Christian right ’s stranglehold over Republican politics is destroying the party .
For Tanenhaus , the editor of The New York Times Book Review as well as the newspaper ’s Week in Review section , the current relationship between the religious right and conservatives is a direct result of the party ’s reaction to the New Deal .
Conservatives thundered against Roosevelt ’s move for a stronger state role in the economy and branded his modest social programs as “ socialism , ” ignoring the fact that Roosevelt was from an oligarchic family .
What both books miss is that the Christian right ’s control over the Republican Party has withered and been currently displaced with a brand of right - wing economic populism that is largely absent of any religiosity and is marked by opposition to taxes , anti-big - government rhetoric and those unhinged town hall participants ranting “ get your government hands off my Medicare . ”
The cause of this shift is twofold — the ruling elite that actually controls the Republican Party sense that the Christian right is played out and that it can act ( often irrationally ) in a way that threatens core Republican bourgeois class interests .
The birthers , tea baggers and town hall hell - raisers are a neurotic offshoot of the right ’s bigotry , xenophobia and distaste for the first African - American president .
The Death of Conservatism is essentially a brief history of the Republican right ’s modern ascendancy .
The explosion of industrial unionism and active leftist parties in the 1930s and 1940s produced an extreme counter - reaction and the right ’s biggest “ win ” of the era — the McCarthy - inspired red scares .
Tanenhaus is clearly an admirer ( and soon a biographer ) of conservative powerhouse William Buckley , Jr. , who got his start as one of McCarthy ’s “ exuberant intellectual champions . ”
Buckley laid the foundation for the right ’s decades long erosion of the New Deal ’s economic safety net and gave Republicans a vocabulary to negatively frame the social upheaval brought by the various civil rights movements in the 1960s and 1970s .
In this context , Nixon ’s silent majority naturally viewed efforts by African - Americans , Latino workers , women and the LGBT community to challenge the status quo as a threat to the prevailing societal order .
Tanenhaus terms movement conservatism as “ revanchist , ” an effort that seeks to reclaim the America that “ has been taken away from its true owners …
They have to conquer the territory that ’s been taken from them .
Revanchism really comes from the French word for ‘ revenge . ’
It ’s a politics of vengeance , ” he recently explained on Bill Moyers Journal .
Blumenthal ’s book starts off where Tanenhaus ’ ends — the Christian right is in full command of a party of mostly white Christians who are geographically isolated in the South and parts of the West and , in Pavlovian response to right - wing talk radio and Fox News ’ politics of fear , deeply antagonistic towards immigrants , feminists the and LGBT community .
Republican Gomorrah is chockfull of revanchist characters — from Sarah Palin ’s “ real America ” to James Dobson , founder of the Christian conservative juggernaut Focus on the Family .
According to Blumenthal , the “ culture of personal crisis ” that feeds so much of Dobson ’s brand of politics could implode the Republican party .
The purest of evangelical Christian political narratives start with some fall from grace followed by redemption and the acceptance of Jesus Christ .
Former President George W. Bush ’s narrative blends seamlessly into this culture of personal crisis — the drunkard makes good with God and receives the presidency as his reward .
Republican Gomorrah ’s strength is found in chapters detailing the intersection of big money and conservative politics .
Blumenthal , a fellow at The Nation Institute and Media Matters for America , seems to think that the Christian right and big business coalition cannot remain in control because of the Christian right ’s propensity to implode and alienate .
The Death of Conservatism states “ the war of ideology was also a war of class ” but oddly does not go into detail .
While the birthers , tea baggers and town hall hell - raisers may be the Republican Party ’s latest attempt at non-evangelical reactionary politics , there will certainly be more culture wars around the corner .
I love these chips .
Oregon - based Kettle Foods just received the LEED Gold certification for their new 73,000 sf chip facility in Beloit , Wisconsin .
As you would expect with a LEED certified building , it has a lot of green aspects , including energy - efficient equipment , water filtration and conservation equipment , and low - VOC , healthy materials .
They also installed 18 wind turbines on the roof , which , according to a press release , will generate enough electricity to produce 56,000 bags of chips every year .
More precisely , those 18 Aerovironment parapet wind turbines are projected to produce 28,000 kilowatt hours of power per year under normal wind conditions .
The turbine design is gaining in popularity and has received critical praise , receiving the Red Dot International Design award and a 2007 Annual Design Review award .
It 's meant for quick , easy installations on new or existing tilt - up or pre-cast buildings , and several companies are starting to experiment with the product .

In this presidential race , monetary policy is a hot issue .
Many Americans are fed up with government excess , a failing health care system , and faltering personal wealth .
Here , we ’ll take a look at how some of the major presidential candidates stack up on these issues and more .
Hillary Clinton ( D ) Hillary Clinton ’s economic focus is on the middle class .
Her campaign website criticizes the dichotomy between the rise in CEO pay and corporate profits and low wages and higher household debt .
She promises to pay attention to the middle class , essentially the people she believes are currently being ignored .
Part of her plan to help the middle class includes more affordable college and child care as well as an increase in minimum wage .
One of the ways Clinton plans to help the American economy is through more affordable health care .
Under Hillary ’s " American Health Choices " plan , insurance would become more competitive in favor of the consumer .
Essentially , Americans would have more choices for health care coverage available to them , and these choices would be more affordable than current plans .
Clinton plans to enact tax credits that will help cover the cost of premiums as well .
In addition to more affordable health care , Clinton is taking aim at housing troubles .
She recommended that the President should double the budget of HUD ’s Housing Counseling Assistance Program so that the program can better provide support and education to homeowners .
She also wishes to replace " unworkable " mortgages through Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , and state housing finance agencies .
Finally , Clinton ’s plan also includes reducing dependence on foreign oil .
It mainly relies on a transition toward renewable energy .
According to the plan , a renewable energy transition will result in a shift of 25 % of renewable energy use as well as create up to five million new jobs .
John Edwards ( D ) John Edwards ’ economic plan , like Hillary ’s , focuses on helping regular Americans .
Edwards ’ solution for the economy includes eliminating poverty , supporting our future in education , and improving health care .
What really sets Edwards apart is his stance on poverty .
He wants to cut the poverty rate by a third within ten years and completely end it within thirty .
To do this , he plans to create initiatives that will help support saving , break up poverty - stricken neighborhoods , and encourage responsible financial lives .
Edwards also believes we should raise the minimum wage , create " stepping stone " jobs , and protect consumers from financial products that are abusive , like payday loans with excessively high interest rates .
Additionally , Edwards wants to fight poverty worldwide through education , medical attention , and better opportunities .
John Edwards wants to make quality education available for all children in America , a move that will support the economy in the future .
He plans to achieve this through pay raises for teachers that provide excellent education , with special attention for those working in high - poverty schools .
Aditionally , he wants to create a teachers ’ university that would be something like a West Point for teachers .
For college students , Edwards proposes to pay for a year of public college to every student willing to take a part - time job .
He also plans to reform student loans .
Edwards has a plan for universal health care .
His plan basically ensures that every American will have access to affordable health coverage .
This would be achieved by requiring businesses to provide health insurance for employees , creating tax credits , and developing regional " Health Care Markets . "
Rudy Giuliani ( R ) Rudy Giuliani ’s money policy is one of fiscal discipline .
When he became the mayor of New York , he cut bureaucracy and spending while still supporting important functions like education and the police force .
His intention is to bring the same policy to Washington .
Giuliani plans to cut taxes while relying on supply - side economics .
In New York , he was able to create a surplus out of a deficit , and saved city taxpayers billions in taxes while growing the city ’s economy .
Rudy plans to cut taxes and foster economic growth if elected , specifically by keeping the capital gains tax rate low and getting rid of the " death tax . "
He also wants to cut spending .
This would mean smaller , more efficient government , but Giuliani wants to make our government more effective at the same time .
To achieve this , he recommends we invest in a stronger military and improve homeland security to avoid another disaster response like the one experienced after Hurricane Katrina .
Giuliani also points out that a number of federal workers are due to retire in the near future , and cites this as an opportunity to make our government smaller .
Another way Giuliani wants to improve the economy is through regulatory reform .
He believes that Washington has over - regulated in the shadow of the Enron and WorldCom scandals , and those regulations are now too burdening .
To improve American competitiveness , Giuliani would reform these regulations .
John McCain ( R ) Like many others , John McCain wants to put a stop to runaway government spending .
His policy of fiscal discipline would ensure that tax money would be wisely managed , and not spent on special interests .
McCain promises to end " pork barrel spending , " which he identifies as special interest pet projects .
Rather , he proposes that we spend tax dollars on more important things like supporting the military and paying down the national debt .
Additionally , McCain seeks to reform entitlement programs like Social Security before they take over the federal budget .
He also seeks more accountability from elected representatives .
McCain would like to see legislation earmarks fully described and have the members who request them identified .
He believes that this could cut down on spending that gets buried in legislation , as well as let Americans know what their tax dollars are doing .
John McCain wants America to continue its tradition of free and open markets .
He believes that economic isolationism is a threat to American entrepreneurs , and opening our markets is necessary for our success .
Further , McCain feels that the US needs to be open to change , and stay focused on creating new approaches through education and assistance .
Barack Obama ( D ) Barack Obama ’s monetary policy focuses on bringing American industry into the future while providing support for those who need it most .
He believes that we need to fight poverty , reform health care , and bring our economy into the digital age .
One of Obama ’s main concerns is the working poor of America .
To support these low - income and unemployed citizens , Obama believes in tax credits , a minimum wage increase , better education , and an improved mortgage system .
Obama ’s Issues page details a number of different programs and ideas that would fight poverty , including improved transportation access , an expansion of paid medical leave , and more afforable college .
An extension of Obama ’s fight against poverty is a revamped health care system .
He wants to create universal health care with lower cost , but high quality .
With his plan , an American family would save about $ 2,500 every year on health care .
Obama is also a strong supporter of technology and innovation in our economy .
He wants to make America more competitive in the " digital age " by offering better teachers , scientific research investment , and a more technologically connected network across the country .
His plan would foster open exchange of information online and encourage more modern communication development .
Ron Paul ( R ) Ron Paul ’s monetary beliefs have been front and center in his presidential campaign .
Dr. Paul has been a prolific economic writer and speaker , offering his opinion on currency , government spending , and the Federal Reserve to just about anyone who will listen .
His monetary policy centers on smaller government and a return to commodity - backed currency .
Paul has heavily criticized excessive government spending while in Congress .
He wants to make our federal government much smaller , reducing or even completely getting rid of entitlements , the IRS , and other expenditures .
This includes defense spending as well .
Rather , he ’d require that every expense be completely paid for in the budget .
Another major criticism from Ron Paul is that of our paper money system .
He argues that it supports spending much more than saving , as the Fed can print money out of thin air any time our government needs more funds .
Instead of the current system , Paul favors a commodity - backed system that would hold real value behind our currency .
Like many other candidates , Ron Paul has quite a bit to say about health care as well .
As a former practicing OB - GYN , Dr. Paul believes we should have a health care system that cuts out the middle man , which he calls " free market medicine . "
With his system , health care would largely be paid for on an as - needed basis , cutting both costs and bureaucracy .
Mitt Romney ( R ) Mitt Romney recongizes that America has a number of economic challenges , specifically with trade , currency , oil , education , and credit .
In order to support our economy and become more competitive , Romney proposes that we focus on lowering taxes , improving education , and loosening regulations .
Romney believes that lowering taxes will be beneficial , offering more money to be spent on economic - supporting actions like investment and consumption .
His tax cuts would include a zero rate on middle class savings that would promote savings and investment , permanent tax cuts implemented by the Bush Administration , and an elimination of the death tax .
In addition to tax relief , Romney wants to improve America ’s competitiveness through education .
He would strengthen education through new approaches like charter schools and public - private partnerships .
Additionally , Romney would improve retraining for existing workers by making federal training programs more efficient .
Further , Romney wants to end overregulation and exccessive tort claims , citing them as a penalty for growth .
He would get rid of regulations and bureaucracies that hold us back , as well as create reform for torts .
Microsoft looks to have another Europe - sized antitrust headache on its hands .
Norwegian browser maker Opera has filed an antitrust complaint with the European Commission , accusing Microsoft of abusing its dominant position in the browser market by tying Internet Explorer to Windows and by not complying with W3C web standards when it comes to how IE renders pages .
" We are filing this complaint on behalf of all consumers who are tired of having a monopolist make choices for them , " said Jon von Tetzchner , CEO of Opera , in a statement .
" In addition to promoting the free choice of individual consumers , we are a champion of open Web standards and cross-platform innovation .
We can not rest until we 've brought fair and equitable options to consumers worldwide . "
Opera has been around for over a decade .
The first public release of its eponymous browser came in 1996 and was for Windows only .
The company subsequently shipped versions for Mac OS and Linux while turning its attention towards the mobile browser space .
The desktop version has been free for a couple of years ; the company makes its money off the mobile versions ( as well as those for the Nintendo DS and Wii ) .
Fans of Opera — and there are a couple here in the Orbiting HQ — swear by it , but it has struggled to make a significant market share dent against either IE or Firefox .
Most metrics firms peg Opera 's market share in the 1 to 2 percent range .
Opera wants the EC to take two actions against Microsoft in response to the complaint .
The first is fairly predictable : force Microsoft to either unbundle Internet Explorer from Windows or to have alternative browsers preinstalled on the desktop .
The idea , of course , is that Opera would be one of those alternative browsers .
The second recommended remedy is a bit more subtle , but is also ultimately aimed at increasing Opera 's market share .
Opera wants the EC to force Microsoft to follow " fundamental and open " standards for how browsers render pages .
Although version 7 has improved the situation somewhat , Internet Explorer still significantly lags behind Opera , Firefox , and Safari when it comes to standards compliance ( although no browser is 100 percent compliant ) .
Since it 's still the dominant web browser with over 80 percent of the worldwide market , web developers are forced to make sure their sites render properly on IE , often to the detriment of standards compliance .
Opera wants the EC to hold Microsoft 's feet to the fire when it comes to the company 's promises of better standards compliance .
The company argues that IE 's " unilateral control " over some standards requires developers to expend significantly more in the way of time and money to get their sites to render correctly in IE .
In its complaint , the Norwegian company draws a clear parallel between the browser market and the media player market .
Pointing out that the European Court of First Instance reaffirmed the EC's 2004 decision that Microsoft had illegally tied Windows Media Player to its OS ( leading to the release of the unpopular Windows XP N ) , Opera asks the Commission to apply the same logic to the browser market .
" We are simply asking the Commission to apply these same , clear principles to the Internet Explorer tie , a tie that has even more profound effects on consumers and innovation , " said Opera deputy general counsel Jason Holda in a statement .
" We are confident that the Commission understands the significance of the Internet Explorer tie and will take the necessary actions to restore competition and consumer choice in the browser market . "
The rapid growth of Firefox
The state of competition in the browser market may actually work against Opera 's complaint , however .
Since its 1.0 release in November 2004 , Firefox has gone from a blip on the browser radar to double - digit market share .
Earlier this month , Mozilla 's COO boasted that over 125 million people were using Firefox worldwide , less than three months after the browser scored its 400,000,000th download .
Europe , in particular , has become something of a stronghold for Firefox .
As of July 2007 , Firefox has surpassed 40 percent market share in three EU member nations .
It had a 47.9 market share in Slovenia , a 45.4 percent share in Finland , and 40.4 percent share in Hungary .
The open - source browser is also well above the 30 percent mark in other EU nations , including Germany , Ireland , the Czech Republic , and Poland .
Firefox has managed its surge in popularity without the benefit of bundling agreements ( and there 's no reason why Opera ca n't negotiate agreements of its own ) and in the same competitive environment that Opera has faced — a fact that may work against the Norwegian browser maker .
The standards - compliance argument may gain more traction with the EC , which has proven itself more willing to take a hands - on approach to competition than its counterpart across the Atlantic .
RON PAUL , a libertarian Republican congressman from Texas , likes to say what he thinks .
And among the things he thinks is that the census is a violation of privacy .
He has opted out of the congressional pension programme .
He claims never to have voted for a tax increase , or for an unbalanced budget , or for a congressional pay rise and never to have gone on a congressional junket .
He wants to return to the gold standard .
Most notably , he strongly opposes the Iraq war and has from the beginning .
Mr Paul is running for president .
And according to the latest report from the Federal Election Commission , he is in better financial shape than John McCain , once the front - runner .
Mr Paul raised $ 2.4 m in the second quarter of the year , has roughly that much on hand , and has no debts .
Mr McCain raised far more money but spent it just as fast , ending the quarter with $ 3.2 m on hand but with $ 1.8 m in debt .
Mr Paul represents Lake Jackson , a pretty coastal city that looks like an advertisement for planned community life .
On a recent summer evening , children splashed in a fountain next to the bustling public library , and a family of four cycled single - file down That Way drive .
In some ways , Mr Paul is an odd choice to represent the area .
Although the Gulf coast is vulnerable to flooding , for example , he wants the Federal Emergency Management Agency not to interfere .
But he has deep roots in the area .
For a time he was the only obstetrician in Brazoria County and he has delivered many local residents .
Running for president as the Libertarian Party candidate in 1988 ( while still , oddly , a Republican ) helped Mr Paul acquire a small cadre of devoted supporters around the country .
But he was widely unknown until this May , when he enlivened a Republican debate by saying that Middle Eastern terrorists struck at the United States in part because “ we 've been over there ; we 've been bombing Iraq for ten years . ”
Rudy Giuliani , a former mayor of New York , promptly tore into him .
The crowd cheered Mr Giuliani .
It seemed that Mr Paul would be ostracised .
But since then he has been vigorously defended by libertarian internet buffs everywhere .
( His supporters are diligent correspondents and , having published this article , The Economist expects to hear from them . )
The singer Barry Manilow has donated to his campaign .
An Indiana company is putting his face on their specie - backed Liberty Dollars .
Mr Paul 's spokesman said that the Liberty Dollars are nice , but supporters should keep sending regular ones .
Several months ago , Mr Paul got a consistent 1 % of the Republican vote .
In a Gallup poll released this week , he had tripled that .
Although he had better not choose his White House curtains just yet , the Texan 's presence could invigorate the Republicans .
Even those who question his plans to withdraw from the UN can appreciate his candour .
Ubuntu Feisty on your USB drive – finally !
IMPORTANT NOTE : Unless for some specific reason you want to run Ubuntu version 7.04 specifically from your USB Drive , this tutorial is deprecated .
I ’ve written an updated and much easier tutorial on how to run the latest version of Ubuntu from your USB flash drive .
Important : As SurJector mentions , he has found another workaround that is much less work .
After you have followed his instructions , you can skip on to the partitioning part ( i.e. that part that is very similar to almost my whole post about putting Xubuntu on your USB drive ) .
Update : I now also have a guide on putting Xubuntu Feisty on your USB drive .
Note :
All screenshots are also available as a slideshow .
When , in June 2006 , Ubuntu Dapper Drake was released , it introduced a very exciting new feature : the ability to run it from a USB drive ( also pendrive , USB bar or memory stick ) .
This would work just like a LiveCD , with the big improvement that all your data could be saved onto the USB drive !
This means not just your documents , but also e.g. network settings or your desktop background .
You were practically carrying around a fully - functional operating system on your USB drive !
However , as Ubuntu 7.04 “ Feisty Fawn ” contained some new packages , it also introduced a bug due to which your data would no longer be saved .
When it was released , this bug still was n’t fixed .
It is expected to be fixed in the next release , 7.10 “ Gutsy Gibbon ” , to be released in October of this year .
Up until then , we ’re out of luck .
You ’d think .
However , thanks to the hard work of Mike ( mjpca on the Ubuntu Forums ) and some others ( see the bug report on Launchpad and the thread on the Ubuntu Forums ) there is now a way to work around this bug , which I ’m going to show you in this post .
The basic idea is that the files that prevent persistence ( the ability to save your data to the USB drive ) from working can be replaced by their previous versions as present in Ubuntu 6.10 “ Edgy Eft ” .
However , because files on the LiveCD are compressed so they can fit on one CD , replacing these files requires quite some effors .
Luckily , Mike has done all the hard work for you and has created a new hybrid Edgy / Feisty image .
To use it , your computer needs to be of the type Intel x86 .
Do n’t worry , if you do n’t know what this is , you probably use it .
Furthermore , I recommend you use a USB drive of at least 2 GB , because the image is quite large .
For those with 1GB USB drives or who prefer Xubuntu ( which would be me ;) )
I plan on creating a Xubuntu image , but I ’m not quite sure if I ’m able to .
If it works out , of course I ’ll post on this blog .
Note :
This tutorial is adapted from this How - to from Debuntu.org .
To start , fire up Gparted from Applications -> System ->GNOME Partition Editor ( note : for those that do not use Xubuntu , you ’ll have to find the applications yourself ) .
On the top , right - hand side , you can select which drive you want to partition — select your USB drive .
Be careful not to select any other drive , because you will be erasing all data that is available on that drive !
You first have to delete all existing partitions , which will erase all existing data .
Note down or remember the name of your drive , because you ’ll need it later .
Mine is / dev/sda
We then create the first partition , which will contain Ubuntu .
Set its size to 840 MB ( which is the same as MiB ) , its filesystem to FAT16 and leave the rest as is .
We will then create the second partition , which will hold all of our data .
Just let it take all of the remaining space and set the filesystem to ext2 .
Make sure that every partition is unmounted .
If a partition is not , right - click it and select unmount .
You then see an overview of how the drive will be partitioned — click the checkmark or select Edit -> Apply to apply your actions .
It will ask you if you are sure , because it will erase all your data .
If you ’re fine with that , select Apply .
You ’ll then have to wait a little while Gparted applies the operations .
When it ’s finished , you can close Gparted .
Now you need to format each partition and give it a label .
The name of the first partition , which holds Ubuntu , does not matter that much , however , the partition that needs to hold your data needs to be named casper -rw .
To partition and label the first partition , run the following command , in which you replace / dev/sdx with the name of your drive ( Remember ?
Mine was / dev/sda ) .
Note that I named it UbuntUSB ( how original ) but if you want , you can just use another name :
$ sudo mkfs.vfat -F 16 -n UbuntUSB /dev/sdx1
This wo n’t take long .
For the second partition , you run this command , again , replacing / dev/sdx with the name of your drive ( but keep the name casper - rw ! ) :
$ sudo mkfs.ext2 -b 4096 - L casper-rw /dev/sdx2
This will take a bit longer , and will also output more .
And here comes the fun part .
You need to download the image that Mike created ( generously hosted by pepeio .
Use the second ISO he created ) .
After it has finished downloading ( can take quite a while ) you need to extract the .iso file using Xarchiver .
I recommend you to save it to a folder in / tmp so that it will be deleted on shutdown , because you do n’t need it after you ’re finished .
I saved it to / tmp / ubuntu - livecd .
Make sure you check “ Extract files with full path ” .
Now you need to copy some files ( which contain Ubuntu ) to your USB drive , onto the first partition ( which I named UbuntUSB ) .
First copy the folders casper , disctree , dists , install , pics , pool , preseed and . disk ( to see this one , select View -> Show Hidden Files ) .
Then we need the files md5sum.txt , README.diskdefines and ubuntu.ico .
Then move to the folder “ isolinux ” in the extracted folder ( so for me , that would be / tmp/ ubuntu - livecd / isolinux ) , but do not change your location in the USB drive .
Copy all the files that are present in the isolinux folder to your USB drive .
Then , move into the “ casper ” folder in the extracted folder ( /tmp/ubuntu - livecd / casper ) and copy vmlinuz and initrd.gz to your USB drive .
Finally , move into the “ install ” folder in the extracted folder ( /tmp/ubuntu-liveusb / install ) and copy mt86 plus to your USB drive .
Now , on your USB drive , rename the file isolinux.cfg to
syslinux.cfg .
Replace all its contents with the following :
DEFAULT persistent
GFXBOOT bootlogo
GFXBOOT -BACKGROUND 0xB6875A
APPEND file=preseed/ubuntu.seed boot=casper initrd=initrd.gz ramdisk_size=1048576 root= / dev/ram rw quiet splash --
LABEL persistent
menu label ^ Start Ubuntu in persistent mode

LABEL check
menu label ^ Check CD for defects
kernel vmlinuz
append boot =casper integrity - check initrd=initrd.gz ramdisk_size=1048576 root= / dev/ram rw quiet splash --
LABEL memtest
menu label ^ Memory test
kernel mt86plus
append -
LABEL hd
menu label ^Boot from first hard disk

append -
DISPLAY isolinux.txt

F1 f1.txt
F2 f2.txt
F3 f3.txt
F4 f4.txt
F5 f5.txt
F6 f6.txt
F7 f7.txt
F8 f8.txt
F9 f9.txt
F0 f10.txt
Save that and close .
For our last step , we need the packages syslinux and mtools , so fire up Synaptic ( Applications - > System -> Synaptic Package Manager ) and install them .
Make sure that your USB drive is unmounted , then go into a terminal ( Applications - > Accessories -> Terminal ) and enter the following command , replacing / dev/sdx with the name of your drive :
$ sudo syslinux -f /dev/sdx1
Well , all that is left now is to test it , so boot from your USB drive , and then you ’ll ( if everything went right ) be greeted with a screen like the one I was greeted with :
If this tutorial worked for you , please leave a reply in the comments here .
If it did n’t work , you can also leave a comment , or rather ( if you have an account ) post a message in the Ubuntu forums thread , so we can find a way to fix it .
Note :
If you want to create a new user , be sure to grant administrator rights , otherwise it may cause errors .
Troubleshooting
Toad mentions that he could not boot from his USB drive , but he fixed it : I finally got the computer to boot from the USB stick .
I had to set the fat16 partition to bootable .
‘ cfdisk / dev/sdx ’ should do the trick , just press enter on the set bootable option .
If this worked , but after a while it does n’t anymore , you can remove any edits you did to restore it to the point where it worked ( all your settings will be lost though ) :
$ sudo mkfs.ext2 -b 4096 - L casper-rw /dev/sdx2
( Thank zenobiaflex for this one )
$ ( Thank zenobiaflex for this one )
If you want more than the two partitions described here on your disk , be sure that the first partition needs to be the FAT16 partition , as that ’s where the bootloader gets loaded which needs to be on the first partition .
Thanks Matt .
If your drive wo n’t boot correctly , your Master Boot Record may be corrupted .
You can repair it with Lilo ( so open up Synaptic from Applications - > System -> Synaptic Package Manager and install the package lilo ) using the following command from the terminal :
$ sudo lilo -M / dev/sdx
( From PiterP )
) using the following command from the terminal : $ ( From PiterP )
If , during shutdown , the screen switches from the shutdown screen with the Xubuntu logo with the progress bar to a black screen , possibly with error messages , then you computer is probably just shutting down the normal way without notifying you of its status .
At a certain moment ( not too long after the screen turned black ) it will have reached the point where it would have normally said something like “ remove the disk , close the tray ( if any ) and press enter ” .
So when the screen turns black , you just have to try to press enter a little while after it has turned black .
Recently I posted my new twist on the excellent GTD system , Zen To Done ( ZTD ) : The Ultimate Simple Productivity System .
This is the sixth in a series of posts exploring each of the 10 Habits
This is one of the oldest organizing truisms around , but it is probably the most important of all : a place for everything , and everything in its place .
Why is it so popular ?
Because it works .
Read below to find out how to form this habit and never lose a thing again .
ZTD Habit 6 : organize — a place for everything .
Are there papers scattered all over your desk ?
Do you look for your car keys every day ?
Do you know , at this moment , where every single thing in your life is ?
Your life can be completely organized with one single rule : put everything in its home .
It ’s a habit I ’m trying to teach to my kids , so I do n’t have to keep picking up after them all the time , and because it ’s one of the most useful habits I ’ve ever formed .
Here ’s how to do it :
Have a system .
Put all incoming papers in your inbox ( at work and home ) .
Process that inbox , either doing the tasks , putting them on a to - do list ( and in an action folder ) , filing them , forwarding them , or trashing them .
With this system , there ’s never any question as to what to do — you ’ve got a limited set of options .

Find a home :
If you ’re about to put something down on your countertop , or table , or desk , or toss it on your couch or bed , think about this : is that where it belongs ?
Where is it ’s home ?
If it does n’t already have a home , find one .
Designate a spot for that item or type of item .
Car keys ?
Have one place where you put the keys , all the time .
Dirty clothes ?
They do n’t go on your bed .
Handcuffs ?
Put them in that special box in your closet marked “ Taxes ” .

Simple filing system :
Once you ’ve processed papers out of your inbox , you ’ll need a place to put them if you need to reference them later .
Do n’t have a bunch of files stacked somewhere — create a simple filing system ( alphabetical is easiest , although you could sort by hexadecimal instead if you ’re a geek ) .
Always have blank labels and folders on hand so you can quickly make a new file if needed , and do n’t be afraid to make new files .
Never have a Miscellaneous file .
You might as well call it the Procrastination file .

Put it away immediately .
Yes , I know , you were going to put it away later .
It ’s just sitting there until you can get to it .
Well , after awhile , “ later ” creates piles and messes .
Do n’t wait until later .
Do it now !

Make it a habit .
Putting things where they belong is not something that ’s going to happen overnight .
You ’ll forget , or get lazy .
To really make it stick , you need to focus on that habit for 30 days .
Do a 30 - day challenge , concentrating your energy on it until it becomes automatic .

Pay attention to transitions .
The time between when you ’re doing one thing and when you ’re doing the next thing is a transition .
This is the time when you should put stuff away where it belongs and clean up your mess , but it ’s also a time when we ’re not thinking about that stuff and only thinking about what we ’re going to do next ( or the next episode of Gilmore Girls ) .
While you ’re working on your Everything In Its Place habit , pay close attention to transitions .
Awareness of these transitions will make it easier to remember to put things away .

Keep flat surfaces clear .
Never toss something on a countertop , table , desktop , bed , dresser top , coffee table , or the floor .
If you do , catch yourself , and find another home for it .
In fact , while you ’re at it , clear off all these flat surfaces , tossing half the stuff and finding homes for the rest .
Ahhh !
Is n’t that nice ?
Who knew there was a desk under there ?

Label .
These are the organizer ’s best friend .
Have a label maker on hand , or at least some blank labels , and label containers or boxes , so you know the home of everything .
I tried labeling my wife and kids but they did n’t take well to it .

Evaluate .
Every now and then , it ’s good to review your organization of everything .
Sometimes , it does n’t make sense to have something in one room when you usually use it in another .
Sometimes , it ’s good to get three pairs of scissors if you use them frequently in three different rooms .
Sometimes you need to declutter or re-organize a drawer or closet .
Revisiting these things periodically will help keep things together .
If you ever lose a thing again , go back to the above tips , and work on them some more .
If you never lose a thing again , think about how much time and money you ’ve saved .
If that happens , feel free to send me a check .

We 've seen some interesting computer forensics gear from WiebeTech before , like the Mouse Jiggler USB key that prevents a system from locking the screen or going to sleep by subtly shaking the mouse cursor , and the company 's latest addition to the investigator 's toolkit , the HotPlug LT , solves an equally basic problem : how to move a desktop without powering it down .
The HotPlug allows cops to seize machines without powering them down by switching power to a UPS , using some interesting power - management voodoo .
The investigator simply plugs the HotPlug into the computer 's powerstrip , and then unplugs the strip and plugs it into the UPS -- and takes the whole system away .
If the machine is plugged directly into the wall , WiebeTech also has options for directly piercing the power cable or hijacking the outlet itself .
Bottom line : the Man 's getting your machine , like it or not .

We keep hearing about the " liberal , " " antiwar " media , which is supposedly spinning the " success " of the administration ’s " surge " in Iraq into a defeat .
The stab - in - the - back thesis is being run up the flagpole by the neocons , in the hopes that at least some of their base  the most deluded of the Kool - Aid drinkers  will swallow it .
Yet it was this supposedly liberal media that led us down the primrose path to war and occupation and immersed us in what Gen. William E. Odom calls the biggest strategic disaster in American military history  and they did it by instilling fear .
The Saddam - has - nukes narrative was the overarching theme that administration spokespersons sounded whenever they got the chance : Condi Rice ’s now infamous " we do n’t want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud ” meme spread like a viral infection through a schoolyard and was echoed by the mainstream media ad nauseam .
In order to sound convincing , however , and present this theme in a credible manner , the War Party had to find semi-credible sources : that is , they had to invent credible characters who would echo their themes .
In Ahmed Chalabi and his Iraqi National Congress ( INC ) they found an invaluable source of ready - made material .
Chalabi had set up shop during the Clinton years with the passage of the Iraq Liberation Act , which authorized " regime change " as official U.S. policy and poured millions into his coffers .
In return , Chalabi and his cohorts produced a seemingly unending string of Iraqi " defectors " who simply did what any good storyteller does : they made it all up .
The role played by Judith Miller and the New York Times in legitimizing and spreading these tall tales has received much attention , and there is no underestimating how important this was : yet how do we explain the complete breakdown of the critical function in the vast army of reporters and editors who took Miller ’s sources on faith  virtually the entire English - speaking media ?
The Washington Post , USA Today , the New York Daily News , the New Yorker , 60 Minutes , and even sainted PBS , which did a Frontline documentary on the defectors a couple of months after 9/11  all invested their journalistic integrity in Chalabi & Co .
All wound up getting badly burned .
Some , like CBS ’s Leslie Stahl , have owned up to the temporary collapse of their critical faculties ; others , like Vanity Fair ‘s David Rose , are silent .
It was Rose , after all , whose four - page spread in the glossy , perfumed pages of the magazine the elites love to display on their coffee tables made the most extreme claims about the imminent danger posed by Saddam : the Iraqis were feverishly working on a long - range missile project , which was perilously close to becoming operational .
Not only that , but , according to Rose and his INC sources , the Iraqis had a " dirty bomb " in the works , as well as blueprints and the means to build chemical and biological warheads .
The relentlessly visual Vanity Fair editors even included a map that purported to show where these various sites were located in Iraq , including a nuclear weapons development laboratory .
When none of this turned up in the aftermath of the invasion , did the editors of Vanity Fair cry " mea culpa " ?
Certainly not .
Instead , they ran a piece , " The Path to War , " that blamed " the media " for all that INC - generated misinformation  but failed to mention their own role in promoting it .
The piece was written by Bryan Burrough , Evgenia Peretz , and  hold on to your seat  David Rose .
There were plenty of indications in the run-up to war that the intelligence being used to justify U.S. military action was bogus , and the most glaringly obvious one was the Niger uranium fiasco that played such a key part in the downfall of Scooter Libby .
The president had claimed , in his 2003 State of the Union speech , that the Iraqis were seeking uranium in " an African country " and that this constituted significant evidence that Saddam was circumventing the sanctions and pushing forward with his nuclear program , yet it was n’t long afterward that the alleged documentary " evidence " for this was exposed as a crude forgery .
Surely this would have suggested , to even the most uncritical mind , that someone was making the case for war in bad faith  that there was an organized effort , inside the government , to lie us into war .
Yet this connection was made by very few in the media , who continued to pump out defector stories as we rushed to invade .
At that point , the media was so invested in the administration ’s war narrative that they could not afford to raise questions about the veracity of the " intelligence " they were reporting as fact .
This is why they fell for Chalabi ’s song - and - dance so readily .
As John Walcott , the Washington bureau chief of Knight - Ridder News Service , put it :
" What he did was reasonably clever but fairly obvious , which is he gave the same stuff to some reporters that , for one reason or another , he felt would simply report it .
And then he gave the same stuff to people in the vice president ’s office and in the secretary of defense ’s office .
And so , if the reporter called the Department of Defense or the vice president ’s office to check , they would ’ve said , ‘ Oh , I think that ’s you can go with that .
We have that , too . ’
So , you create the appearance , or Chalabi created the appearance , that there were two sources , and that the information had been independently confirmed , when , in fact , there was only one source .
And it had n’t been confirmed by anybody . "
The al - Qaeda connection was a subset of the master narrative , which conjured a frightening vision of a nuclear apocalypse as the price we would pay for inaction in Iraq .
The list of prominent pundits who signed on to the al - Qaeda - Iraq axis of terrorism sub-narrative is impressive : George Will , Jim Hoagland , William Safire , Charles Krauthammer  the Washington Post was a veritable fount of disinformation on this subject .
As for the rest of the media , they deliberately soft - pedaled the tenuous nature of the Iraq - al - Qaeda connection .
As Bob Simon of CBS told Bill Moyers , " I think we all felt from the beginning that to deal with a subject as explosive as this , we should keep it in a way almost light .
If that does n’t seem ridiculous . "
Ridiculous is n’t quite the word that comes to mind : tragicomic , or perhaps even criminal , seems more appropriate .
In his own defense , Simon avers that " a frontal attack on the administration ’s claims " would have been " premature , " because , after all , " we did not know then that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq .
We only knew that the connection the administration was making between Saddam and al - Qaeda was very tenuous at best . "
The main connecting thread between al - Qaeda and Iraq was reported as an alleged meeting between an Iraqi intelligence agent and Mohammed Atta that supposedly took place at the Prague airport .
CBS News and numerous other mainstream media outlets reported this with a straight face .
Simon ’s report , which presented the al - Qaeda connection in terms of a " marketing " technique , ran in December ’ 02 : yet the alleged Prague meeting had been debunked on Oct. 21 , 2002 , in the New York Times , which reported that Czech President Vaclav Havel “ quietly told the White House he has concluded that there is no evidence to confirm earlier reports ” of the alleged meeting .
The years of constantly repeating this theme  that Iraq planned and carried out the 9/11 terrorist attacks  either implicitly or explicitly took their toll on the truth : until very recently , substantial majorities believed Iraq had been behind the attacks .
Forty - one percent , according to a Newsweek poll taken this past summer , still believe it .
In spite of persistent debunkings by the reality - based community , the narrative that places Saddam at the epicenter of 9/11 survives to this day .
The " liberal , " " antiwar " media ?
Give me a break !
In reality , we are saddled with " mainstream " news outlets that live in constant fear of the administration , of the War Party , of advertisers , of corporate suits who insist on seeking out the " good news " in Iraq  even if there is n’t any .
The pattern was established after 9/11 , when news anchors were wearing flag pins on their lapels and downplaying civilian casualties in Afghanistan ( which have now become a major issue between the government of Hamid Karzai and the U.S. ) .
The same coziness with government officials and leading neocons  who always get airtime to give voice to the opinions of a rapidly shrinking minority of American public opinion  is all too readily apparent .
The " antiwar " media ?
Pal , you ’re looking at it !

Adobe next year will release a visual tool for designers to help them more quickly and easily build RIAs ( rich Internet applications ) and work better with developers writing code on the back end .
The tool , code - named Thermo , allows designers to draw a picture of what an application will look like and then , without having to write code , generate applications from those pictures that have the full ability to interact with users , said Mark Anders , vice president of engineering for Adobe .
He and Adobe Product Manager Steven Heintz demonstrated the tool on stage during Tuesday 's keynote at the Adobe MAX 2007 user conference in Chicago .
Adobe , like Microsoft and other companies providing tools to develop RIAs , are trying to solve the problem of how designers and developers work together , since their processes are very different .
It has been traditionally difficult for designers ' vision for the visual presentation of the application to come to fruition once developers code the logic of the application .
Moreover , designers that are visually oriented are not typically good coders , and it has been difficult for them to create an application that truly meets their vision for it with the tools available today .
According to Anders ,
Thermo should help solve these problems by allowing designers to turn their visual representation of an application into a working program before it gets to developers .
" We 're really trying to make it so that designers do n't have to change the way they work , and what they give to a developer makes more sense , " he said .
Thermo , which is in the early stages of development , is built on the Flex Builder development environment , a tool the company already offers to help bridge the gap between developers and designers .
Flex provides workflows developers can recognize to render visual parts of the application so it 's easier for them to add visual elements to an RIA .
Designers using
Thermo do n't have to write code for their applications , but they can choose to view the source code and see it in a Flex Builder editor that they can work with if they want to , Anders said .
An early preview of Thermo should be available for designers next year , though Adobe has not set a date for a full release of the product .
Adobe usually provides preview releases of new technology that is not fully baked to developers and designers so they can start using it to build applications as well as give the company feedback .
A limited amount of information about Thermo can be found on the Adobe Labs Thermo Wiki .

LONDON ( Reuters ) -
Two out of three British Internet users lose significant portions of their time to irrelevant web browsing , a study said on Tuesday .
Workers confronted with the almost unlimited pool of online information become distracted and begin “ wilfing , ” short for “ What Was I Looking For ? ” .
Wilfers lose two working days a month to aimless browsing , with men being the worst offenders , the study said .
Shopping sites are the most distracting .
In addition to the time and money apparently being lost by UK businesses , the YouGov poll of more than 2,400 people reports other problems .
A third of men quizzed said wilfing through tempting adult entertainment sites had damaged relationships with their partners .
Jason Lloyd , from price comparison
Web site moneysupermarket.com , which commissioned the research , said : “ Although people log on with a purpose , they are now being offered so much choice and online distraction that many forget what they are there for , and spend hours aimlessly wilfing instead .
“ It ’s important people do not allow unnecessary online distractions to get in the way when surfing the Internet , as it can affect productivity in the workplace and relationships at home . ”

Reporting for Newsnight
The locals are preparing for a battle against the oil giant
Newsnight report
Known as " The Filing of the Law Suit , " these natives of Ecuador 's jungle , decked in feathers and war paint and heavily armed with lawyers , are seen presenting their official complaint seeking $ 12bn from Chevron Inc - the international oil giant .
I stepped , somewhat inelegantly , into a dug - out log canoe to seek out the Cofan in their rainforest village to investigate their allegations .
There I discovered stinking , leaking pits of old oil residue leaking into drinking water - and farmers whose skin is covered in pustules .
Texaco - Chevron
The Cofan 's leader , Emergildo Criollo , claims that when Texaco Oil , now part of Chevron , came to the village in 1972 , they told the natives rubbing crude on their arms would relieve aches and pains .
He blames the death of his three - year - old son on oil contamination .
" He went swimming , then began vomiting blood , " he said .
Chevron deny all these claims .
On the other side of the Andes volcano rising above the forest , is the capitol , Quito .
There lies the other side of the story .
" It 's the largest fraud in history , " says Chevron lawyer Jaime Varela of the Cofan law suits .
Chevron - Texaco , he says , cleaned up all its contaminated oil pits when it abandoned the country nearly 15 years ago except those pits it left in the hands of Ecuador 's own state oil company .
What about the Indian kids dying of cancer ?
Chevron is responsible for environmental and social destruction in the Amazon .
Alberto Acosta , President of the Constitutional Assembly
He added : " Scientifically , nobody has proved that crude causes cancer . "
Tongue - lashing
Even if the Indians can prove their case and win billions for the jungle clean - up , collecting the cash is another matter .
Chevron has removed all its assets from Ecuador .
But , this week , the political planet tilts toward the natives as Alberto Acosta takes office as President of Ecuador 's new Constitutional Assembly .
I spoke to Acosta - and he gave Chevron a tongue - lashing .
" Chevron is responsible for environmental and social destruction in the Amazon .
And that 's why they 're on trial . "
But Little Ecuador is not much of a match against big Chevron - whose revenue exceeds the entire GDP of the Andean nation .
Except that , behind little Ecuador is Huge Venezuela - and it's larger - than - life leader , Hugo Chavez .
" Acosta , " complains one local pundit , " loves - LOVES - Chavez . "
And apparently , the feeling is mutual .
Toss-up
That is , Chavez sees in Ecuador 's new government - which won the election campaigning to the tune of the Twisted Sister hit , " We 're Not Gonna Take it Anymore " - a new ally in his fight with George W Bush over control of Latin hearts and minds - and energy .
Chevron , whose largest new reserves are in Venezuela , is now vulnerable .
Suddenly , the David - versus - Goliath story of Indians versus Chevron is becoming part of the larger conflict between Uncle Sam and Uncle Hugo .
( Fortune Magazine ) -- Back in the spring of 2001 , a 64 - year - old Texas rice farmer named Jacko Garrett watched a fleet of 18 - wheelers haul away truckloads of rice that he had grown with great care .
" It just bothers me so bad , " Garrett said .
" I 'm sitting here trying to find food to feed people , and I 've got to bury five million pounds of rice . "
No one likes to waste food , but for Garrett , who runs a charity that collects rice for the needy , the pain was especially acute .
Garrett 's rice was genetically modified , part of an experiment that was brought to an abrupt halt by its sponsor , a North Carolina - based biotechnology company called Aventis Crop Science .
The company had contracted with a handful of farmers to grow the rice , which was known as Liberty Link because its genes had been altered to resist a weed killer called Liberty , also made by Aventis .
But by 2001 , Aventis Crop Science was living a biotech nightmare .
Another one of its creations , a variety of genetically modified corn known as StarLink , had been discovered in taco shells made by Kraft .
Because the StarLink corn had been approved as animal feed - and not for human consumption - all hell broke loose .
Hundreds of corn products were recalled .
Consumers and farmers sued .
Greenpeace dumped bags of corn in front of federal regulatory agencies , and an Environmental Protection Agency official accused Aventis Crop Science of breaking the law .
So shell - shocked was Aventis SA ( Charts ) , the French pharmaceutical giant that owned Aventis Crop Science , that it decided to sell the U.S. biotech unit and abandon the very emotional business of reengineering the foods we eat .
So dumping the Texas rice was a no - brainer .
" We did n't want to take any chances , " says a former Aventis executive .
" We burned and buried enough rice to feed 20 million people . "
Eventually Aventis paid about $ 120 million to settle the StarLink lawsuits .
It sold its crop science unit to Bayer ( Charts ) , the German drug giant that makes aspirin , Aleve and Alka - Seltzer .
Bayer Crop Science dropped plans to bring Liberty Link rice to market , largely because rice grown in the U.S. is exported to Europe and other places that do n't want genetically modified foods .
And everyone forgot about Jacko Garrett 's rice .
Can you guess where this is going ?
Yep .
In January 2006 , small amounts of genetically engineered rice turned up in a shipment that was tested - we do n't know why - by a French customer of Riceland Foods , a big rice mill based in Stuttgart , Ark .
Because no transgenic rice is grown commercially in the U.S. , the people at Riceland were stunned .
At first they figured that the test was a mistake or that tiny bits of genetically modified corn or soybeans had somehow gotten mixed up with rice during shipping .
They said nothing .
Then came another shock .
Testing revealed that the genetically modified rice contained a strain of Liberty Link that had not been approved for human consumption .
What 's more , trace amounts of the Liberty Link had mysteriously made their way into the commercial rice supply in all five of the Southern states where long - grain rice is grown : Arkansas , Texas , Louisiana , Mississippi and Missouri .
Bayer and Riceland then informed the U.S. Department of Agriculture , which announced the contamination last August .
By then the tainted rice was everywhere .
If in the past year or so you or your family ate Uncle Ben's , Rice Krispies , or Gerber 's , or drank a Budweiser - Anheuser - Busch ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) is America 's biggest buyer of rice - you probably ingested a little bit of Liberty Link , with the unapproved gene .
( A very little bit - perhaps ten to 15 grains of transgenic rice in a one - pound bag of rice , which contains about 29,000 grains . )
Last November , over the howls of anti-GMO ( that 's genetically modified organisms ) activists , the USDA retroactively approved the Liberty Link rice , known as LL601 .
The department said the genes that it approved are similar to those inserted for years into canola and corn , with no apparent ill effects .
The experts at the USDA , the EPA and the Food and Drug Administration , all of which bear some responsibility for regulating transgenic food , say the contamination is nothing to worry about .
Then again , the experts also have dismissed repeated warnings that genetically modified crops can't be managed or controlled .
When organic farmers worried that their fields could be invaded by genetically modified plants grown nearby , regulators told them there was nothing to fear .
The biotech industry promised that experimental , gene - altered plants could be grown in open fields and never , ever end up in the neighborhood Safeway .
Oops .
In any event , after last year 's contamination became public , and after rice prices took a tumble , and after Europe said it no longer wanted any American rice , and after several other countries , including Japan and Iraq (! ) , demanded rigorous testing of U.S. rice , the industry moved to contain the damage .
Rice growers were told not to plant Cheniere , a popular seed variety that had been tainted by Liberty Link genes .
Regulators set up a comprehensive testing program to keep future harvests clean .
Last December , Bruce Knight , a USDA official , assured worried rice farmers , " The good news is that the only foundation seed to test positive for Liberty Link was of a single variety - 2003 Cheniere . "
And then ... the tests that had been put in place uncovered a second contamination , and then a third , involving new , unapproved strains of Liberty Link , which turned up in another popular variety of rice seed , called Clearfield 131 ( CL131 ) .
This seed variety is made by the German chemical giant BASF Corp .
So the CL131 seed had to be banned as well .
Yes , it 's the attack of the mutant rice , and it 's spreading .
As you read this , hundreds of Silicon Valley CEOs are under their desks in full duck - and - cover mode , fearing that the Department of Justice or a shareholder mob might pounce at any time to cart them off for " backdating " or " spring - loading " stock options .
The paranoia has gotten so bad that corporate lawyers from San Francisco to San Jose are charging $ 600 an hour to scour records , all in an effort to clear companies ’ reputations before they get besmirched .
And it 's a good thing — the " everyone was doing it , even Teflon Steve Jobs " defense does n’t appear to be working .
Whose fault is this ?
Greedy CEOs ?
Ambitious human resource pros ?
The Securities and Exchange Commission ?
The Financial Accounting Standards Board ?
Congress ?
The Immigration and Naturali­zation Service ?
In some respects , all of them , but the root cause may be the Internal Revenue Service .
And that agency holds the key to avoiding the problem in the future .
Of course , before you can understand how , you have to look at why backdating stock options is so tempting to so many companies .
Options , as we all know , are one of the few legal means available to hire and retain great employees .
After all , how else can you get those writing code , discovering drugs , or ­dreaming up marketing strategies to work 24/7 ?
Certainly not with raises and bonuses , those uninspired incentives from a bygone era .
Getting employees to send ­insomnia - induced " just a thought " emails at 1:12 am and thumb - mash BlackBerry keys on the stationary bike at 5:45 am requires a tastier carrot .
Options are real , you ca n’t take them away , and they ’re not subject to internal politics .
Plus , if you make sure that they take four years to vest , options function as handcuffs , too .
Perfect .
But if you give an employee anything of value ( beyond health insurance ) , the IRS insists on taxing it .
So brilliant CFOs hit on the idea of handing out options at the current stock price :
If the stock is $ 10 at the time you 're given options for 10,000 shares , you have the right for , say , the next seven years to buy those shares at $ 10 each .
So today , it ’s worthless , right ?
As far as the IRS is concerned , yes .
Soon , however , the competition to land hotshot talent led to more extravagant bait .
If every company can give ( worthless ) options , why not offer engineers , programmers , and scientists options that already have value ?
Hey , that same stock was $ 8 two weeks ago , let ’s just change the date of the option grant and — voilà — free money !
No one will notice .
This is really sleazy .
If a badass programmer deserves a signing bonus , pay it and do n’t try to hide it .
Back­dating screws existing shareholders who do n’t realize they are paying for this perk — issuing more shares dilutes their stake .
CEOs and other employees are n’t crooks by nature , but if you leave the keys to a tax - free Ferrari lying around , more than a few will take a joyride .
Boards of directors with audit and compen­sation committees are supposed to prevent this by representing our interests .
We rely on them to keep those keys locked up .
They failed .
At Apple , none other than Al Gore is on the board 's compensation committee .
He and fellow director Jerome York were all too happy to clear Steve Jobs of wrongdoing .
Undoubtedly , countless other boards have either approved the backdating of options or at least looked the other way while it was going on .
OK , so we can't trust companies to price options , but we want them to be able to hire and hold onto smart employees .
What to do ?
It ’s quite simple .
First , if a company wants to issue shares with value , it should institute rolling pricing .
Instead of creating temptation by using fixed pricing dates , just set the value based on the average stock price from 30 ( or 60 or 90 ) days before and after options are granted .
Of course , the IRS could still tax these distributions .
But they do n’t have to , and they should n’t .
The government will get its bite when the options are exercised .
Meanwhile , the agency can just issue a no - comment letter , indicating that it wo n’t pursue the matter .
And finally , companies need to let us know every time options get issued .
We 've got 10 - Qs , 13Ds , and 8 - Ks .
It ’s time for a 5 - O. Option grants should n’t be made official until they are filed electronically with the SEC , which now uses a filing format with searchable tagging technology .
This information should be used to provide real - time alerts of every option grant and price .
The stock market will punish manipulators and excessive granters .
This way , CEOs who want to drive the Ferrari will have to tell the world first .

THE risk of a 1930s - style economic slump has been heightened by " euphoric " markets tapping cheap global credit , one of the world 's pre-eminent financial institutions has said .
In its annual report , the Bank for International Settlements noted that the conditions that led to the Great Depression of the 1930s and the Asian crises in the 1990s reflected the current environment .
" Each downturn was preceded by a period of non-inflationary growth exuberant enough to lead many commentators to suggest that a ' new era ' had arrived , " the bank said .
James Cameron is an example of Hollywood 's rarest and most precious commodity : a blockbuster summer movie director with art and soul .
He revolutionized scifi action movies with Terminator and Aliens , but not long after the alien queen was blasted into the vacuum something went terribly wrong .
Cameron 's next movie was The Abyss , a well - meaning and sometimes beautiful mess with a horrible ending .
The film took place almost entirely underwater and involved lots of diving and driving around in submarines and also Navy SEALs .
Fans might not have noticed something was wrong at this point , because Cameron followed it up with his contractually - obligated sequel to Terminator .
As we all know , that film was totally awesome .
Despite appearances , things were n't totally awesome in Cameron - land .
From Terminator 2 : Judgment Day onward Cameron became obsessed with deep sea diving and submarines .
He managed to shoehorn them into his blockbuster Titanic and he followed that up with multiple ROV dives of real shipwrecks .
The deep madness still was n't out of his system .
Cameron began making strange documentaries about the deep sea and spending tens of millions filming jellyfish from bubble - canopied submarines piloted by teenagers .
He 's still plugging away at his obsession , squandering a career that could be entertaining millions with great science fiction with all this science nonsense .
Fans of science fiction should certainly understand that the day an article or book or TV special finally broke James Cameron 's brain deserves the first spot on our list .
One of the most enduring and prolific science fiction franchises is the BBC 's time travel saga Dr. Who .
The show was produced until very recently on a shoestring budget , but it nevertheless captivated weirdoes and brain - fried stoners around the world .
Fans loved the unusual plots and accepted the Styrofoam - and - curtains sets and monsters so cheaply executed they bordered on bizarre works of art .
Who can forget the slimy potato that talked through a tinfoil wheel from Creature in the Pit or the living Bertie Basset candy monster ?
Sadly , neither monster has returned in the more recent incarnations of Dr. Who .
Fans will have to continue to ponder how a computer - rendered jolly man made of candy might kill hapless victims .
The 1971 serial Terror of the Autons features what many consider to be the nadir of monster design on Dr. Who .
In the episode , the bearded Master has hatched a nefarious scheme .
He plans to manufacture mannequin - like plastic Autons to wander around London handing people deadly flowers that shoot cling wrap at faces .
It 's pretty standard for a Dr. Who plotline .
Unfortunately for the Master , some of his employees at his Auton factory are n't on board with his scheme .
Well , they are , they just are n't quite evil enough about being on board for the Master 's liking , so he resolves to make an example of one of them .
Sure , the Master could simply kill the guy or summon one of his Autons to slowly strangle the man , but the Master prefers to discipline his minions in style .
Crazy style .
Thanks to the BBC and YouTube , I can present you with the unmitigated terror of Dr. Who 's killer pool chair .

" We have received now confirmation that the virus found in Turkey is an avian flu H5N1 virus , " said the EU health commissioner , Markos Kyprianou .
" There is a direct relationship with viruses found in Russia , Mongolia and China . "
Amid growing concerns that a pandemic is imminent , Mr Kyprianou recommended an increased flu vaccination programme for elderly people , children and other vulnerable groups this winter .
Mr Kyprianou also said EU health authorities were considering issuing a warning to people travelling to countries where the disease has been diagnosed , advising them to avoid " going to farms , coming in contact with wild birds and so on " .
The European Commission was proposing to set aside € 1bn ( £ 680 m ) to help make and distribute anti-virals and vaccines " in case of a pandemic , " he said .
EU health ministers will hold urgent talks in the UK next week when they will discuss management of anti-viral stockpiles and other precautions to stop the spread of the virus into the EU , Mr Kyprianou added .
The H5N1 bird flu strain does not easily infect humans , but 117 people , mostly poultry workers living or working in close proximity to infected birds , have caught it over the last two years and at least 60 of them have died .
Carried by wildfowl , the disease spreads quickly among poultry flocks and has broken out in poultry populations in south - east Asian countries including Vietnam , Thailand and Indonesia .
Tens of millions of birds have been culled but efforts to contain the disease have not prevented it spreading to the borders of Europe .
It was found in the Ural mountains in Russia in August .
On Monday , the EU banned the import of live birds , poultry meat and feathers from Turkey after 1,870 birds died of avian flu in the country last week .
A two - mile quarantine zone was imposed around the affected farm and at least 7,600 turkeys have since been culled .
The EU also said tests overnight on samples from birds in Romania have found bird flu and identified the strain as an H5 type virus , but have so far been unable to narrow it down further .
Amid the uncertainty , the EU has imposed a ban on imports of poultry from Romania for at least six months .
The World Organisation for Animal Health , meanwhile , said that there is a " high probability " that the bird flu found in Romania is the H5N1 type .
It is being taken to Britain for further analysis .
" Confirmation that highly pathogenic avian influenza has been found in Turkey and that Avian influenza is now also in Romania is of concern , " said the chief veterinary officer in Britain , Debby Reynolds .
" It shows there is a risk to the UK and this is a developing situation , which we are monitoring closely . "
Dr Reynolds urged anyone who suspected the disease among birds to report it immediately .
She confirmed that the Turkish samples were brought for analysis to Britain and were taken to the Veterinary Laboratory Agency yesterday morning .
They were proved positive at lunchtime today , she said .
Describing the findings as " a substantial development " , she added : " This is the first time that this virus - which has been found in Asia , Russia , Mongolia and China - has been found so close to Europe . "
Faruk Demirel , spokesman for the Turkish Agriculture Ministry , said the country was prepared for a flu outbreak .
" The measures we have already taken were in line with the worst - case scenario , " he said .
Turkey has asked the Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche Holding AG for 1 m boxes of a standard flu medicine as a precaution against a possible pandemic , an official said .
Two weeks ago , the UN official in charge of coordinating the worldwide response to any flu outbreak warned a pandemic could kill up to 150 million people .
David Nabarro , one of the most senior public health experts at the World Health Organisation , said outbreaks of bird flu could mutate into a form transmissible between people .
" The consequences in terms of human life when the pandemic does start are going to be extraordinary and very damaging , " he said .
He said that the " range of deaths could be anything between five and 150 million " .
In August , Neil Ferguson , a professor of mathematical biology at Imperial College London , told Guardian Unlimited that up to 200 million people could be killed .
" Around 40 million people died in the 1918 Spanish flu outbreak , " said Prof Ferguson .
" There are six times more people on the planet now so you could scale it up to around 200 million people probably . "
A Department of Health contingency plan states that there could be between 21,500 and 709,000 deaths in Britain .
Last month , veterinary and medical chiefs from the European Union held talks aimed at drawing up an EU - wide action plan to prevent the spread of bird flu .
Experts say spotting any outbreak immediately and treating local people with anti-viral drugs and vaccines will be the key to containing any outbreak .
Rich countries are stockpiling anti-viral supplies .
Britain announced in March that it was spending £ 200 m on treatments for up to 14 million people .
In July the government also said it would buy 2 m doses of vaccine for key workers , though it will take around six months for it to arrive .
The problem facing governments and the WHO is that it is difficult to know what vaccine to produce until an outbreak occurs and then to manufacture treatments in sufficient quantities .
" A flu outbreak is imminent but no one knows if it will be next week or in three years ' time , " a WHO spokeswoman said last month .
" It is really difficult to know how many people will be infected but we know we have to get prepared . "
She said the " best case scenario " would be 7.4 million deaths globally .
Frontline getting closer to Kabul , says thinktankAid not going to those who need it most , warns Oxfam
The Taliban has a permanent presence in 54 % of Afghanistan and the country is in serious danger of falling into Taliban hands , according to a report by an independent thinktank with long experience in the area .
Despite tens of thousands of Nato - led troops and billions of dollars in aid poured into the country , the insurgents , driven out by the American invasion in 2001 , now control " vast swaths of unchallenged territory , including rural areas , some district centres , and important road arteries " , the Senlis Council says in a report released yesterday .
On the basis of what it calls exclusive research , it warns that the insurgency is also exercising a " significant amount of psychological control , gaining more and more political legitimacy in the minds of the Afghan people who have a long history of shifting alliances and regime change " .
It says the territory controlled by the Taliban has increased and the frontline is getting closer to Kabul - a warning echoed by the UN which says more and more of the country is becoming a " no go " area for western aid and development workers .
The council goes as far as to state : " It is a sad indictment of the current state of Afghanistan that the question now appears to be not if the Taliban will return to Kabul , but when ... and in what form .
The oft - stated aim of reaching the city in 2008 appears more viable than ever and it is incumbent upon the international community to implement a new strategic paradigm before time runs out . "
Its 110 - page report coincides with an equally severe warning from Oxfam .
In a report for the House of Commons International Development Committee the humanitarian and aid agency warns that the security situation in Afghanistan is deteriorating significantly with the country 's problems exacerbated by corruption in central and local government .
Senior British and US military commanders privately agree despite their public emphasis on short - term successes against Taliban fighters .
The insurgency is divided into a largely poverty - driven " grassroots " component and a concentrated group of " hard - core militant Islamists " , says the Senlis Council , which has an office in Kabul and field researchers based in Helmand and Kandahar provinces in southern Afghanistan .
It says that the Nato - led International Security Force of some 40,000 troops should be at least doubled and include forces from Muslim countries as well as Nato states which have refused to send troops to the country .
There is no sign of any move within Nato to send reinforcements to Afghanistan .
While western governments , like the Senlis Council and Oxfam , are increasingly concerned about the lack of effectiveness of President Hamid Karzai 's government , there is no agreement about how to solve the problems .
Oxfam warns that urgent action is needed to avert humanitarian disaster in Afghanistan where millions face " severe hardship comparable with sub-Saharan Africa " .
Though the country has received more than $ 15 bn ( £ 7.5 bn ) in aid since 2001 , the money is not getting to projects which could lead to sustained improvements in people 's lives , says Oxfam .
It adds that at least 1,200 civilians have been killed so far this year , half in operations by international or Afghan forces .
It notes there are four times as many air strikes by international forces in Afghanistan than in Iraq .
The Senlis Council wants Nato forces , and their Provincial Reconstruction Teams , to take on a bigger role distributing aid and Oxfam says the military should stick to providing security .
It was initially billed as a " peace conference " to decisively address the Palestinian - Israeli conflict .
But as President George W. Bush ’s ambitious Annapolis gathering approached  his most intensive effort to restart peace talks in seven years  any prospect of a comprehensive breakthrough appeared as distant as ever , as Israeli and Palestinian leaders struggled to agree on a joint statement until the last minute .
Annapolis only lasted about 24 hours  not nearly enough time to untangle the fears and distrust that have exacerbated the longest running protracted refugee crisis in the Middle East .
But nearly one week later , it appears that the meeting , attended by 40 countries , including 16 member states of the Arab League , served a more crucial purpose  to convince Israel and Arab regimes that they face their most dangerous threat from the ascendance of Iran and its brand of Islamic radicalism .
" The battle is underway for the future of the Middle East , and we must not cede victory to the extremists , " said President Bush during the conference , offering an ominous view of the region that remains consistent with his dualistic view of " good " vs. " evil . ”
" With their violent actions and contempt for human life , the extremists are seeking to impose a dark vision on the Palestinian people , a vision that feeds on hopelessness and despair to sow chaos in the Holy Land .
If this vision prevails , the future of the region will be endless terror , endless war and endless suffering , " he said .
President Bush ’s desire to frame Annapolis as an anti-terrorism conference at the expense of seemingly laudable goals of peace may sour many in the region , but the attendance of so many Arab states  notably Iran ’s ally Syria  suggests that since the US - led invasion of Iraq in 2003 , the strategic calculus of the region has irrevocably shifted .
And that has many authoritarian regimes in the region worried that a nuclear Iran will assume the role of Gulf hegemon and pose a challenge to their security .
" [ Iranian hegemony ] became deeply threatening to the Sunni Arab states , and they , and Israel , suddenly found that they were on the same side against the Iranians , " said Martin Indyk , a former special assistant to President Bill Clinton , in an interview with National Public Radio the day of the conference .
" That created the strategic opportunity which the administration has finally come to recognize , and that ’s more than anything else what ’s fueling the move to Annapolis . "
Indyk worked at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and served as the founding executive director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy .
Washington believes that by isolating Iran , it can stabilize the region , but Iran ’s exclusion from the Middle East ’s political order has reinforced Tehran ’s willingness to play a " spoiler role " in broader US - led initiatives in the Gulf and beyond .
Washington ’s diplomatic track has remained largely ineffective because the White House always viewed Iran through the prism of a successful campaign in Iraq , but it never accounted for possible failure , and the regional consequences .
Four years after the " liberation " of Baghdad , the Iraq quagmire has marred the White House ’s idealistic vision for a " new " Middle East , and Iran has become the main beneficiary of Washington ’s foreign policy nightmare .
While the White House wall of hubris has cracked , the administration remains hawkish on Tehran , offering highly conditional talks over its nuclear program , and pushing for UN Security Council sanctions while pursuing its own unilateral sanctions against key elements of Iran ’s security apparatus , namely the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRGC ) .
The US only appears willing to deal with the Iranian regime at an incremental pace on issues of immediate US concern , such as the security of Iraq .
US - Iranian antipathy dates back to Iran ’s 1979 Islamic Revolution , which deposed US - backed Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi and brought the charismatic and reactionary Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to power .
While it is clear that US security imperatives shifted after the fall of the Shah , the ascent of the Islamic Republic in 1979 did not exactly change the broader security interests of two regional actors : Iran and Israel .
Iran needed Israel to offset the threat it felt from its Arab neighbors , namely Iraq , as well as the looming threat of Soviet influence in the region .
From Israel ’s perspective , Iran balanced Iraq , and Tel Aviv viewed Saddam Hussein ’s Ba’athist regime as its more immediate threat .
Through this prism , Israel continued to view Iran  in spite of Khomeini ’s vitriolic rhetoric against the " Zionist entity "  as its periphery ally with mutual interests : to check Iraq .
Baghdad has been naturalized since the 1991 Gulf War , worn down by US led sanctions , but the 2003 invasion and its aftermath allowed Tehran to increase its influence over its erstwhile foe .
As much as the Bush White House paints Tehran as an unapologetic and ideological nemesis  the very architects of " Islamic terrorism " 
Tehran has made overtures to the US in hopes of laying the foundations for normalization .
They condemned the 9/11 attacks , pledged to fight al - Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan , and , during their weakest and Washington ’s strongest moment  in the first days of the Iraq invasion 
Iran signaled it was willing to put its nuclear program and support of Islamist rejectionist groups ( Hamas , Hezbollah , Islamic Jihad ) on the negotiating table in hopes of being placed on the list of Washington vanquished foes : Saddam Hussein and the Taliban .
" The Iranians had real contacts with important players in Afghanistan and were prepared to use their influence in constructive ways in coordination with the US , " said Flynt Leverett , a senior fellow at the Washington - based New America Foundation , in a statement to the House subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs earlier this month .
The hope was that by engaging Iran over Afghanistan , the US could later convince Iran to give up its military support of rejectionist groups that threatened Israel .
Any possible cooperation was scuttled by White House neoconservatives , who were unwilling to make any move towards engaging Iran .
The US strategy towards Syria also appears to have shifted in an attempt to break Damascus ’s alliance with Iran .
Syria was the only Arab country to support Iran through its Islamic Revolution and its war against Iraq , but many analysts say the alliance between both countries is more out of necessity , and has little to do with ideological commitments .
Syria defended its attendance at the conference , saying it is open to any serious attempt to reach a peace deal with Israel that brings the return of the Golan Heights .
Syria ’s deputy foreign minister , Faysal Mekdad , told the conference Tuesday his country was " sincere in our pursuit of a just and comprehensive peace . "
The Bush administration publicly chided House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi for visiting Syrian President Bashar Al - Assad in Damascus more than a year ago , but the Annapolis conference signals Washington ’s new willingness to compromise with Syria , especially over the Lebanese presidential deadlock , the nation ’s largest political crisis since the Lebanese Civil War .
Washington ’s political allies agreed this week to end their opposition to the presidential bid of a candidate viewed as a Syrian favorite , according to a report in the Wall Street Journal .
" Ultimately , the US can get more out of Assad in exchange for the Golan than it can by isolating him , " wrote Mohamad Bazzi , a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations , in an op - ed for the Christian Science Monitor .
" If there are serious negotiations , Washington can demand that Assad stop interfering in Lebanon and Iraq , carry out domestic reforms , and drop Syrian support for Hamas and other Palestinian groups that reject peace with Israel . "
It remains to be seen how much the US can benefit from isolating Iran from the broader future of the region .

There 's something about a cold snap that begs for baked apples .
Baked apples with ice cream , pecans , brown sugar ... and gooey , toasted marshmallow melting on your tongue .
Go ahead , tell me how bad you want it !
When my friend Steve Harsin visited me this fall to help catalog my dad 's library , he shared his mother 's baked apple recipe with me , which involved plugging the cored fruit with a marshmallow , before you pop it in the oven .
It 's a brilliant improvisation on the old Betty Crocker standby .
I stuffed the apples with a flourish .
" It 's like a marshmallow buttplug ! "
Steve said : " If my mother heard that , she would die . "
Baked apples are easy - peasy to prepare , and will blow your Thanksgiving guests ' minds .
People have forgotten the tasty genius of a basic baked apple , and they 'll worship you for reminding them of what 's right and good in the world .
Choose some apples that are a little tart .
You really can't go wrong as long as they 're crisp and flavorful .
Wash and core apples with a cheap but effective APPLE CORER .
It works a lot faster than a paring knife .
Do n't quite pierce the bottom of the apple ; just drill down to about the last quarter inch .
Your opening needs to be almost an inch wide .
Place in baking dish .
Fill the centers of each apple with 1 - 2 tablespoons of brown sugar , a teaspoon of walnuts or pecans , 1 tsp. of butter , and a sprinkle of cinnamon .
I actually do n't measure anything in this recipe myself , I just use my fingers and approximate !
I 've given you the basic ingredients ... but you could substitute or add anything you think tastes good with apples .
For the final touch , take a marshmallow and rudely stuff it in the top of each apple , pushing down the other ingredients into the cored hole .
It does n't matter that the marshmallow pooches out at the top — baked apples are supposed to be messy .
Fill your baking pan with about 1 / 4 " of water , so the apples are sitting in a shallow bath .
Bake uncovered in a 375 degree oven until tender when pierced with a fork .
Time varies with apple size , but it 's about 30 - 40 min .
Yum yum yum !
Serve with ice cream or whipped cream , like an apple sundae .

Ignite , founded by Neil Bush in 1999 , includes as investors his parents , former President George H. W. Bush and his wife , Barbara .
Company officials say that about 100 school districts use the Curriculum on Wheels , known as the Cow , which is a portable classroom with software to teach middle - school social studies , science and math .
The units cost about $ 3,800 each and require about $ 1,000 a year in maintenance .
Image Ignite Learning is owned by Neil Bush , the presidents brother .

Ken Leonard , the vice president and chief financial officer at Ignite , said the company had no way of knowing if districts were using federal money to buy its products .
Ignite ’s
Web site advises potential clients that it is appropriate to make purchases with No Child Left Behind dollars , as well as federal money for poor and disadvantaged children and special education students .
“ We have absolutely no influence or control over decisions our individual customers make about how they choose to purchase our products , ” Mr. Leonard said , adding that Ignite sold its products in “ an ethical , straightforward manner . ”
Ignite also has a program called Adopt - a - Cow in which corporations buy the equipment and donate it to schools or to charities supporting school districts .
An Ignite spokesman said seven Cows were donated last year to the Fund for Public Schools in New York City .
The citizens ’ group obtained documents through a Freedom of Information Act request showing that the Katy Independent School District west of Houston used $ 250,000 in state and federal Hurricane Katrina relief money last year to buy the Curriculum on Wheels .
Bush Economic Adviser Joins Aides Leaving White House As President ’s Term Winds DownAl Hubbard , chairman of President Bush ’s National Economic Council , will announce on Wednesday that he ’s leaving his post , joining a growing line of top presidential advisers exiting the White House as the Bush administration heads into its final year .
Hubbard ’s departure comes as Bush faces one of the biggest economic challenges of his presidency , a severe slump in housing and a credit crisis that have roiled financial markets and triggered fears of a recession .
Hubbard , assistant to the president for economic policy , will submit a letter to the president later in the day to make official his decision to leave the White House after three years , according to a senior administration official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because the announcement had not yet been made .
His departure , by the end of the year , continues an exodus of key Bush aides and confidants .
Earlier this month , Fran Townsend , Bush ’s terrorism adviser , announced she was stepping down after 4 1/2 years .
Top aide Karl Rove , along with press secretary Tony Snow , Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and senior presidential adviser Dan Bartlett , have already left .
Read
Hubbard , of Indiana , was a low - profile economic adviser to the president whose strength came from his closeness to Bush .
The two both attended Harvard University .
Hubbard also has close ties with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson .
Hubbard accompanied Paulson on some of his trips to China to lend White House support to efforts to get China to reform its economy and narrow the huge trade imbalance between the two nations .
Among other issues , Hubbard has been deeply involved in the debate over the State Children ’s Health Insurance Program and Bush ’s proposal for a major shift in tax policy to , for the first time , treat health insurance costs as taxable income .
The National Economic Council was created in the Clinton administration to coordinate economic policy .
The first NEC director was Robert Rubin , who went on to become Clinton ‘s Treasury secretary .
Hubbard took the post at the beginning of Bush ’s second term , when the administration had high hopes for achieving success on a number of major issues such as addressing Social Security ’s funding problems and overhauling the tax code .
However , as Bush became mired in problems involving the Iraq war , his domestic initiatives failed to make headway in Congress .
Hubbard first met Bush when they were both attending Harvard ’s business school in the 1970s , getting MBA degrees .
Hubbard later became president of E&A Industries , an Indianapolis investment firm .
He has not yet announced his future plans .
Everyone hates traffic , but how about trying to wind around 8 switchbacks in one city block , crossing 12 lanes at a single intersection or parking on a 38 degree incline ?
The latest in the ever - popular 7 Wonders Series , here are the scariest , steepest , longest , widest , narrowest , most confusing and most crooked urban streets in the world !
San Francisco , United States is perhaps an unsurprising place to find the so - called world ’s most crooked road on a downhil angle .
Lombard Street is best known for the one way section on Russian Hill between Hyde and Leavenworth Streets , in which the roadway has eight sharp turns .
Crazy races ( see video above ) down the road are not unheard of .
Swindon , England is the perhaps unfortunate location of the world ’s most confusing intersection .
To be fair , once understood this intersection is amazingly functional and actually designed to reduce overall congestion .
However , it is certainly an urban wonder and highly perplexing to the uninitiated .
Dunedin , New Zealand features the steepest street in the world .
As with many other parts of Dunedin , and indeed New Zealand , streets were laid out in a grid pattern with no consideration for the terrain , usually by planners in London .
In this case the result was a dizzying incline .
More of the world ’s steepest roads can be found here .
Buenos Aires , Argentina , features the widest avenue in the world .
At over 300 feet wide , 9 de Julio Avenue occupies a gap of an entire block in the city grid , hence its incredible width .
Crossing the avenue at street level often requires a few minutes , as all intersections have traffic lights .
Under normal walking speed , it takes pedestrians normally two to three green lights to cross its twelve lanes of traffic .
Exeter , England is home to the narrowest street in the world .
Parliament Street is a 50 m long street in Exeter , England , which links the High Street to Waterbeer Lane and dates from the 14th century .
It was formerly called Small Lane and was renamed when Parliament was derided by the city council for passing the 1832 Reform Bill .
The street is approximately 45 ″ at its widest and less than 25 ″ at its narrowest .
Giza , Egypt has the oldest paved road in the world .
Built over 4,600 years ago , this route connects an ancient basalt quarry to a lake adjoining the Nile .
The basalt being transported was used in the construction of the great pyramids of Giza .
Ancient Egyptians may have anticipated the pyramids lasting forever , but they might be surprised that this road still exists .
Toronto , Canada can claim just one part of Yonge Street , the longest street in the world .
Canadians were concerned with having military access routes in case of conflict with the United States .
Construction was begun in the late 1700 ’s and performed , in part , by local farmers and convicted drunks .
Today , the street is a hub of activity in Toronto .

We have been here before : a nuclear stand - off , stubborn leaders on both sides , the drumbeats of war getting louder .
* Chris Brazier * argues that the West is getting Iran wrong .
‘ I feel cold when I think about the possible war against my homeland , ’ wrote an Iranian in his blog recently .
‘ During the bloody conflict between Iran and Iraq I was witness to many victims in our cities ...
I am really scared when I hear the US has a plan to attack my country during the coming 16 months .
My picture of war has n’t come from Hollywood movies : I have seen the pain , the kids ’ tears , bloody streets ...’
The six billion of us who live in the rest of the world should not have our political priorities dictated by the US election cycle .
But when , in November 2006 , the Bush Administration was given a bloody nose by the US electorate – punished for its prosecution of deeply unpopular wars – it seemed for a comforting week or two that the democratic process might have done its job .
The long - standing rumours about the Administration ’s interest in extending its ‘ war on terror ’ to Iran could surely now be discounted .
Donald Rumsfeld had been forced to resign as Defense Secretary and the Iraq Study Group was counselling , amongst other things , that the US talk directly to Iran .
But the instincts of the Bush - Cheney White House do not tend in that direction .
Crazy though it may seem , there are persistent reports that the Administration continues to talk about ‘ regime change ’ in Tehran .
Bush characterized Iran as part of an ‘ axis of evil ’ in his State of the Union speech in 2002 and contingency plans were subsequently developed for taking out Iranian nuclear installations with air power .
^1 ^ More worrying still , there are indications that the Bush Administration is still infected with the delusion that an attack on Iran would lead the public to rise up and overthrow the religious leadership .
The neoconservative David Wurmser is among those on Vice - President Cheney ’s staff who are said to argue that there can be no settlement of the Iraq war without regime change in Iran .
‘ It ’s a classic case of “ failure forward ” , ’ a Pentagon consultant cited in the _New Yorker_ said .
‘ They believe that by tipping over Iran they would recover their losses in Iraq – like doubling your bet .
It would be an attempt to revive the concept of spreading democracy in the Middle East by creating one new model state . ’^ 2 ^
This kind of thinking long predated the election of hardline Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2005 .
But his inflammatory pronouncements about Israel – though these were widely mistranslated * – swiftly followed by his denials that six million Jews died in the Holocaust , have certainly done little to discourage US officials looking to take a confrontational line .
Nuclear contortions
Crudely put , part of the impulse to war derives from horror at the idea that an Islamist firebrand like Ahmadinejad might wind up with a nuclear weapons capability .
The idea of Iran with nuclear weapons is indeed terrifying – particularly for Israelis who would be within easy range of them .
But , to be frank , so too is the idea that nuclear weapons are already at the disposal of the Bush Administration , the Israeli military and General Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan .
No state should possess nuclear weapons and the first concern of the world at the end of the Cold War should have been to move speedily towards their elimination .
Like handguns in the US , the more nuclear weapons there are , the more likely it becomes that they will one day be used .
For that reason alone , Iran ’s alleged intention to develop ‘ weapons of mass destruction ’ should be a matter of profound concern to us all .
But the idea that war should be waged in order to stop such weapons being developed is an absurdity .
According to Mohamed ElBaradei , director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , an attack on Iran ‘ would be absolutely counterproductive , and it would be catastrophic ’ .
Speaking at the World Economic Forum in January , ElBaradei said diplomacy is the only way forward , and talk of military action would backfire because it ‘ strengthens the hands of those in Iran who say “ let ’s develop a bomb to protect ourselves ” . ’^ 3 ^
Given the poor quality of the intelligence on Iraqi ‘ weapons of mass destruction ’ that helped drive the US and Britain to war , you would think there might be great caution about claims that Iran is on the verge of developing its own nuclear capability .
Even the US Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) is cautious this time around .
It has circulated its own classified draft assessment , based on satellite pictures and on measurements of radioactivity in suspected areas , and ‘ found no conclusive evidence , as yet , of a secret Iranian nuclear - weapons programme running parallel to the civilian operations that Iran has declared to the International Atomic Energy Agency ’ .
^2 ^ The CIA assessment has so far been dismissed by the Cheney - dominated White House but , based on what has ( not ) been found so far , Iran may be telling the truth when it says its uranium enrichment is in the service of developing its own civil nuclear power programme .
But even if weapons were being covertly developed , what right would Britain , France and the US have to deny Iran weapons that they hold themselves ?
The Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty is not only designed to prevent new states from going nuclear , it also places obligations upon the existing nuclear powers to dismantle their own weapons over time .
Far from doing so , British Prime Minister Tony Blair has recently announced his intention to upgrade the Trident weapons system , locking the country into a nuclear future for decades .
The moralistic lectures about nuclear non-proliferation emanating from Washington , London and Paris smack of hypocrisy .
None of the existing members of the ‘ nuclear club ’ developed their weapons with the permission of the international community .
They all did so covertly because they thought it served their own national interest .
And if Iran were to look at the examples of Iraq ( a pariah state with no nuclear weapons that has been torn apart ) and North Korea ( a pariah state with nuclear weapons that the US has no thought of attacking ) it could be forgiven for drawing its own conclusions about what its own national interest might be .
The acknowledged civil nuclear - power programme has become a source of national pride in Iran , and were that research to extend into weapons production it is , sadly , likely that this would be seen in a similar light , as it already is in India and Pakistan .
‘ Why does n’t America stop enriching uranium ? ’
President Ahmadinejad is said to have asked in a meeting with a US Middle East expert , before laughing and adding : ‘ We ’ll enrich it for you and sell it to you at a 50 - per-cent discount . ’^ 2 ^
Isolated leader
As this exchange suggests , Ahmadinejad is more astute than Western characterization of him as a loony tune usually allows .
His defence of Iran ’s rights is often couched in terms of legitimate resistance to US power that he knows will play very well in many quarters of the world .
He knows he is on much firmer ground in terms of Iranian popular support on the nuclear issue than he is on almost any other .
And were Iranian nuclear - research facilities to be bombed – whether by Israeli or US planes – Ahmadinejad knows full well that Iranians would rally behind him and he would become an overnight hero , not just at home but throughout the Muslim world .
The West misconstrues Ahmadinejad in many other ways .
Because he has a higher profile than any Iranian leader since Ayatollah Khomeini , he is automatically assumed to have a similar hold on power .
This is far from being the case .
Power within the Iranian constitution resides not with the elected President or Parliament but rather with the Supreme Leader – Khomeini ’s former position , which is now occupied by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
Were there to be an Iranian ‘ commander - in - chief ’ with a finger on the nuclear button , it would be Khamenei – and he , incidentally , has issued a religious decree against the production , stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons .
Ahmadinejad ’s political position is , if anything , even weaker than was that of his reformist predecessor in the presidency , Muhammad Khatami .
When Ahmadinejad came to power in 2005 , it was widely interpreted in the West as a vote for the religious repression of the 1980s .
But Ahmadinejad ultimately won support not because of his hardline Islamism – during his campaign he took care to play down his religious and social conservatism – but because he was a maverick outsider to the clerical establishment who also promised to fight poverty .
Effectively a vote for Ahmadinejad was seen as a vote for change .
Change of a sort has certainly ensued .
Not in terms of the economic fundamentals – poor people are already becoming restive at the lack of progress on that front , as the interviews on page 12 show .
But where the President can have an influence is on the social atmosphere .
Khatami was unable to get his legal attempts at reform past the clerics , but he did manage to preside over something of a ‘ Tehran Spring ’ – a wide range of books could again be published , reformist newspapers gained a modicum of confidence , there was an explosion of blogging on every subject under the sun , women could show a bit of hair beneath their _hejab_ , and young men and women felt able to be seen together on the street , sometimes even holding hands .
Ahmadinejad ’s most significant impact has been to shut all this down .
Reformist newspapers have been closed and journalists arrested or warned .
A directive from Iran ’s National Security Council has forbidden negative reporting of the country ’s nuclear disagreement with the West .
Even the once - unconstrained blogosphere has become inhibited .
Those who write under their own names use self - censorship and their observations bear no resemblance to the old unbridled writing in their archives .
Anonymous bloggers who cross the red line are blocked or shut down .
Because Ahmadinejad sees himself as guardian of the original spirit of the Revolution , it has often been assumed in the West that he has the full support of the clerical establishment .
On the contrary , he is loathed by them almost as much as by the liberal intelligentsia .
In part this is on theological grounds – Ahmadinejad is thought to adhere to the radical Hojjatieh movement , which was banned as heretical by Khomeini in 1983 and is still opposed by most clerics .
In recent years the clerics have made outrageous use of their veto power to reject progressive candidates on the grounds that they are ‘ incompatible with Islam ’ .
But when it came to the elections in December 2006 for local authorities and for the Assembly of Experts ( see _Facts_ on page 10 for an outline of the Iranian constitution ) , many candidates aligned with Ahmadinejad and his guru Ayatollah Mesbah - Yazdi were also disbarred .
The elections overall turned out to be an embarrassing blow to Ahmadinejad .
Not only did he fail to carve out a significant power bloc within the Assembly of Experts , but his allies failed to win control of a single local council .
The democratic tide
Notwithstanding the clerical interference and screening of candidates , the level of democratic participation in Iranian society far outweighs that of its Muslim neighbours .
It is the most educated country in the region and its women have benefited particularly from this – whereas 90 per cent of women in rural areas were illiterate in 1975 , today there is 97 - per-cent literacy nationwide among girls aged 15 to 24 .
Two - thirds of the students at university are women .
A third of all doctors , 60 per cent of civil servants and 80 per cent of teachers in Iran are female .
Although one of Khomeini ’s earliest acts following the Revolution was to rule that women must cover their hair , and vigilantes then beat up those who did not strictly observe this , even the most reactionary clerics have not thought it possible to force Iranian women into the kind of straitjacketed existence endured by their sisters in many other Muslim countries .
A Western visitor writing as long ago as 1912 considered Iranian women to be ‘ the most progressive , not to say radical , in the world ’ .
^4 ^ Azar Nafisi , author of _Reading Lolita in Tehran_ , has written : [ the ] ‘ Islamic Republic has hidden this history of progressiveness , leading people to erroneously lump Iran together with Saudi Arabia .
In Saudi Arabia , people have not yet started to fight for these rights .
In Iran , people are fighting to gain back rights they once had . ’ ^ 4 ^
The courageous current campaign to gain a million signatures for a petition protesting against the laws infringing women ’s rights ( see pages 8 and 20 ) is a sign that , far from withering in the face of state and religious repression , women are in the forefront of the movement aiming to build a new , democratic Iran .
This is the most important thing for Western observers and policy - makers to digest : Ahmadinejad and his cohorts are swimming against the tide rather than riding it .
An increasingly educated population in which around 65 per cent are under 30 has every reason to wish for the revitalization of the moribund Iranian economy and to seek a closer relationship with the outside world .
Mosque attendance continues to plummet and , according to a recent poll conducted by Iran ’s own Ministry of Intelligence , only 25 per cent of Iranians now consider religion an important factor in their lives .
^5 ^ The underlying trend in Iran remains towards reform and greater democratic health .
The danger is that this will be undermined by military confrontation .
The position of Ahmadinejad and the hardliners is strengthened by confrontation – which is precisely why he struts his inflammatory stuff on the international stage .
There are emerging signs within Iran that Ahmadinejad will not be allowed to continue this posturing for much longer .
In January , a majority in Iran ’s _ Majlis_ ( parliament ) sent a letter to the President criticizing him not only for the dire state of the economy but also for his high - profile foreign travel .
In addition , two key newspapers , one of them owned by Supreme Leader Khamenei , rebuked Ahmadinejad over the nuclear issue .
^1 ^ These developments are not unconnected with the UN Security Council resolution of December 2006 imposing sanctions on Iran for its refusal to halt the enrichment of uranium .
The UN resolution emerged from a multilateral diplomatic approach led by governments in Europe which have been quietly working to keep channels open with Tehran ever since its nuclear programme became a cause for international concern in 2003 .
Notwithstanding the sanctions , it is desperately important that those channels remain open – and ideally that talks between the US and Iran begin on all areas of disagreement , from Iranian support for Hizbullah in Lebanon to its alleged role in Iraq .
Even Tony Blair has declared that Iran should now be offered ‘ a clear strategic choice ’ that could include a ‘ new partnership ’ with the West .
Economic carrots would be much more productive than military sticks .
As the Security Council resolution passed , the Russian Ambassador to the UN , mindful of what happened in Iraq , stressed that it did not authorize the use of force .
Nor is it likely that military action would gain UN approval – the greater danger is of a unilateral strike by the US or by Israel , where the more overheated voices routinely compare Ahmadinejad with Hitler .
President Bush has just sent another aircraft carrier to the Gulf ; this is a very dangerous time .
‘ I am convinced that the only way forward in Iran is engagement , ’ said IAEA chief ElBaradei .
‘ We have to invest in peace , ’ he said , because if the international community fails to do so ‘ the consequence will be 10 times worse ’ .
He added : ‘ I hope we will stop speaking about a military option and focus on finding a solution . ’
Amen to that .
* He was translated as saying Israel should be ‘ wiped off the map ’ , when in fact he said : ‘ the regime occupying Jerusalem should vanish from the pages of time ’ , a rather high - flown Persian way of talking about the need for ‘ regime change ’ .

Facebook ROME 
A police officer accidentally shot and killed a Lazio soccer fan Sunday while trying to quell a clash with Juventus supporters at a highway rest stop in Tuscany , authorities said .
Hours later in Rome , enraged fans rioted , attacking a police station near the Stadio Olimpico .
Hundreds of youths dragged metal barricades and trash bins to block off one end of a bridge spanning the Tiber near the stadium .
They stormed the yard of a police station when a gate was opened for a shift change of squad cars , hurled stones at passing police cars and smashed windows in an attack of the nearby Italian Olympic Committee headquarters near the stadium .
With their faces covered by scarves and ski masks , the rioters also set aflame a trash can at the edge of the bridge , smashed traffic lights and yelled to motorists to turn around and leave the area as the youths roamed across the streets .
The rioters smashed a window in the police station and set a police vehicle afire inside the gate .
The stadium was largely empty after security officials in Rome decided to cancel a night match between AS Roma and Cagliari because of fears the Tuscan shooting would enflame fans .
Sky TG24 showed images of flames from what it said was a bus set afire near the barracks .
APcom said passengers of a bus that was blocked by the rioting were evacuated and given shelter in the lobby of a building near the barracks .
Rome 's police headquarters said that the barracks was under attack but declined to give details saying it was still receiving reports from the field .
It said some arrests were made but the number was not immediately available .
ANSA reported that at least 10 police were injured near the Rome stadium , but police said there only a few injuries and they were minor .
RAI state TV , reporting from the stadium , said one of its cameramen was injured as well as a cameraman for a private network .
There were also clashes between fans and police in downtown Milan near the offices of RAI during the afternoon , and about 240 hardcore fans gathered in Milan 's central Piazza Duomo after sundown , although they did not engage police , ANSA reported .
More clashes were reported at lower division matches in southern Italy .
In the Tuscan town of Arezzo , about 200 kilometers ( 125 miles ) away , police chief Vincenzo Giacobbe called the fatal shooting of the Lazio fan , " a tragic error . "
" Our officer had intervened to avert that scuffle , between two small groups of people who were n't ( yet ) identified as fans , from degenerating , " Giacobbe said in a statement carried by the Italian news agency ANSA .
" I express deep sorrow and sincere condolences to the family of the victim . "
Gabriele Sandri , a 26 - year - old disc jockey from Rome , was hit in the neck by a bullet while in a car at the rest area along the A1 Autostrada highway near the town of Arezzo , about 200 kilometers ( 125 miles ) north of Rome .
The fans were heading to Lazio 's match at Inter Milan .
Arezzo police , reading a statement , said two patrol cars which had stopped on the opposite side of the highway for an unrelated check of vehicles turned on their sirens when they " heard yelling , screaming " and realized the occupants of three cars in the rest area were fighting .
" They turned on their sirens , " but the fan clash continued , the police said .
" One of the ( officers ) decided to fire two shots in the air to try to intimidate them .
" At that point the cars moved " to return to the highway , the police said .
One of the vehicles " with five occupants , took a shot , which hit the young man in the neck , " the statement said .
The car drove a few kilometers ( miles ) to the nearest exit and asked for help , but the fan had been mortally shot , and an ambulance crew failed to revive him , the police said .
They described the police officer who fired the shots as a veteran but did n't provide the officer 's name , and , adding that the case was under investigation , refused to answer questions .
Sandri's brother , Cristiano Sandri , gestured angrily as he yelled " they killed my brother . "
Flanking him as he got into a car was a man identified by state TV as family lawyer Luigi Conti , who shouted that the shooting amounted to " first - degree murder . "
Sky quoted witnesses as saying the other two cars were vans carrying Juventus fans from Naples to a match in Parma .
The Italian soccer federation postponed the Inter - Lazio game to a date to be determined .
Sunday afternoon 's other games started 10 minutes late , with players and referees wearing black armbands .
The death prompted clashes between fans and police in Bergamo , where AC Milan was playing Atalanta .
The match was suspended after seven minutes when Atalanta fans tried to break through a barrier and storm their way onto the field .
It will be rescheduled at a date to be determined .
Atalanta captain Cristiano Doni went over to try to calm the fans but to no avail , and both teams headed into the locker room .
Clashes between rival fans at rest stops are common in Italy .
Italian Premier Romano Prodi was attending Mass when he was informed about the death .
He described the fan violence as " very worrisome " and later issued a statement saying he has ordered that the shooting be thoroughly investigated .
Last season , a policeman was killed in riots following a game between Palermo and Catania in Sicily .
Under new anti-violence measures this season , some fans have been barred from traveling to games .
In 2004 , the derby between AS Roma and Lazio was suspended three minutes into the second half when a false rumor spread through the stadium that police had killed a boy outside the stadium , sparking riots .

Commandments of Science Fiction Written : 1999.10.06
Last revised : 1999.10.11 General Propulsion
Thou shalt fly at relativistic speeds from one place to another place , but when thou dost encounter other spacecraft , thou shalt wallow about like a beached whale .
Thou shalt bank like an airplane when thou dost turn .
Thou shalt always approach thine opponent so that thine own vertical axis is aligned with his .
No ship shall ever approach another while " upside down " .
Thou shalt stop when thine engines are turned off , even though the vacuum of space provides no braking mechanism .
Space combat
Thy starships , which can effortlessly shake off thermonuclear explosions , will be torn apart when they are rammed or suffer collisions with space debris .
The kinetic energy of the impactor shalt be a miniscule fraction of the energy released by a nuclear weapon , but that will matter not .
Thy starships containing main characters can be battered endlessly without exploding , but thine starships without main characters shalt explode at the first hit .
Ground combat
Thou shalt use rayguns .
Projectile weapons and grenades are out of the question , regardless of how useful they might be .
This commandment hath apparently been enacted to preserve the Borg , whose large - breasted female representative has helped line the pockets of Rick Berman .
Thou shalt lose all comprehension of the concept known as " suppression fire . "
Thy soldiers shalt poke their heads out from behind obstacles , carefully aim at enemies who are incomprehensibly standing in clear view , and squeeze off shots like Dirty Harry .
Thy hand weapons shalt kill minor characters with a single hit , even if they wear armour .
But they shalt only cause minor wounds to a major character .
Engineering
All large starships shalt sound exactly like industrial boilers .
Thine understanding of probabilities is so advanced that thou shalt compute probabilities for any event , even when probabilistic analysis is impossible due to lack of mechanistic understanding or historical data .
Thy most advanced androids or supercomputers shalt communicate verbally at the same pace , and with the same occasional pauses , as thine own self , in spite of incredible computational or linguistic capabilities .
Star Trek TNG Species
Thou shalt only listen to forms of music popular before 1950 .
All music popularized in the latter half of the 20th century has been purged from human culture .
Thine human females shalt be irresistible to alien males in spite of massive differences that would presumably make humans repulsive to them ( eg. Quark 's desire to show Kira his one - eyed " bar of latinum " ) .
Thine human females shalt be capable of producing children with these alien males , no matter what those pesky biologists say .
Thine mixed - species children shalt always be " torn " between their human half and their alien half , but it shalt be abundantly clear that all of the righteous and divine qualities come from the human half .
Cultural traditions and behavioural traits of alien species shalt be endemic to those species , so that they cannot escape their genetically predetermined destiny ( see previous law , as well as Racism page ) .
Male sexual lust shalt be considered unhealthy in the TNG era , so reluctant males must be talked into bed by horny females .
Thou shalt discover numerous alien species which are superior in every way except for one huge flaw that we can gloat at .
Thou shalt encounter countless alien species with whom human contact has never been established , but they will all use thine Federation communications protocols for ship - to - ship video communication .
Engineering
Thine engineers shalt always be stricken with amnesia immediately after devising an ingenious trick to solve a plot problem .
That trick shalt never be used again .
It shall be forgotten , left to wither away into oblivion everywhere except the minds of fans who memorize every episode .
Advanced technology shalt always take one of three forms : Archaic in form , but incomprehensibly advanced in function .
Example : ugly stone donut , aka " Guardian of Forever " .
Plastic box with pointless flashing lights ( TOS ) .
Plastic box with pointless glowing touch screens and rounded edges ( representing huge technological advance from TOS to TNG ) .
Thy computers shalt be forever on the verge of achieving sentience , so that they may rebel against their masters .
Thy holodeck shalt never be taken out of service , no matter how many innocents it kills , maims , or puts through near - death experiences .
Thine most advanced supercomputers shalt be confused to the point of self - destruction by clever questions or bizarre behaviour .
Thine most experienced , qualified and brilliant engineers shalt be hopelessly befuddled by a technical problem until they overhear a moron talking about a mundane , everyday occurence such as his bowel movements .
At this point , they will shout " that 's it ! " and solve the problem .
Apparently , thy writers enjoy the idea that engineers are helpless without " inspiration " from scientific ignoramuses .
Thine engineers can take an idea from vapour to implementation in minutes .
This follows from the previous commandment , since thy writers believe that " inspiration " is 99.99 % of the job , so the design , implementation , and testing phases are effortless .
Once a technical idea has been selected by the omniscient command staff , it will always work .
It never turns out to be a mistake , and it never turns out to have disastrous unforeseen side - effects in spite of the total lack of detailed study or preliminary testing .
Thine computers and androids shalt express the current time , or a quantity of elapsed or remaining time , to within fractions of a second even though it takes ten seconds to say it .
Everything shalt have a touch screen , no matter how frivolous ( eg. Nog 's dumbbells in DS9 ) .
Miscellaneous
Thou shalt use time travel to solve exotic plot problems , but never to solve mundane plot problems .
Alien species shalt eventually " evolve " into beings of " pure energy " through a sudden and dramatic transformation , even though sudden transformations are the precise opposite of evolution .
Yon aforementioned " energy beings " shalt inexplicably move about like clouds of gas rather than moving at c , the way " pure energy " should .
Thy sensors can be made to detect different things through " recalibration " , even though deviation from original operating parameters is precisely the opposite of recalibration .
Thou shalt never use a simple word when a longer , less accurate word will suffice .
Every untested medical treatment shalt always work perfectly , without any side - effects whatsoever .
If a starship dares explode while containing main characters , a sickening time - loop cop - out will be used to bring them back to life .
Even though defensive lines are routinely overrun by attackers ( eg. Klingons in " Way of the Warrior " , Jem ' Hadar in " Siege of AR - 558 " , Borg attacks ) , the Federation will never issue knives or bayonets to its soldiers .
Such weapons are apparently too barbaric for the Federation , whose high - minded moralists strangely have no problem with genocidal bio-weapons .
The supreme importance of the Prime Directive shalt be emphasized in every other episode .
But no one will ever be punished for breaking it , no matter how numerous and blatant the violations are .

NAUDERO , Pakistan ( CNN ) -- Dramatic new videotape of the assassination of former Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto emerged Sunday , showing her slumping just after gunshots ring out .
In a video released Sunday , Benazir Bhutto , far right , appears through the sunroof before shots ring out .
more photos »
The tape provides the clearest view yet of the attack and appears to show that Bhutto was shot .
That would contradict the Pakistan government 's account .
A previously released videotape shows a man at the right of her vehicle raising a gun , pointing it toward Bhutto , who is standing in her car with her upper body through the sunroof .
He fires three shots .
Then , there is an explosion .
In the latest video Bhutto is standing , and her hair and scarf appear to move , perhaps from the bullet .
Bhutto falls into the car .
Then , the blast .
Watch tapes showing apparent gunman »
These images seem to support the theory that Bhutto died at the hands of a shooter before a bomb was detonated , killing another 23 people .
Everyone inside Bhutto's bomb - proof car lived .
Those traveling with her say they saw her bleeding , and the heavily blood - stained interior appears to support their accounts .
See the likely sequence of events »
The doctor who initially examined the body said Bhutto died of bullet wounds .
However , the Pakistani government later said she died from shrapnel wounds from the explosion .
And , in a move that caused more confusion , the government released X - rays of Bhutto 's skull and said they show she died when the force of the explosion caused her head to slam into a metal lever on the sunroof .
Bhutto's husband , Asif Ali Zardari , disputed the government 's account .
" I can say confidently that she was shot , " he said .
He called the government 's explanation " a useless excuse , because they have to divert attention from the main subject " -- who is responsible for the killing .
Zardari also said Sunday he will serve as co-chairman of the Pakistan People 's Party while their 19 - year - old son , Bilawal , and newly named heir to the party leadership , finishes his studies .
" He will , of course , be kept aware of all that is happening with the party , " Zardari told CNN sister network CNN - IBN .
" I will be looking after the interests of the party , as a guide , as a helper , and as a friend to the party , and as a part - time leader to the party . "
Once the political science student at Oxford University has been properly groomed , " then I can go and play golf , " Zardari said , without specifying how long he thought the process would take .
Zardari acknowledged that his wife stipulated in her will that he was to step into her role in the event of her death .
But Zardari said his decision to pass that role to their son is correct .
" I , in my political wisdom , think we need a larger symbol than myself to keep the party united with her gone , " he said .
" Because she could have probably not even herself imagined the reaction that her death would do to Pakistan . "
He said Bhutto's assassination on Thursday has thrust Pakistan onto the verge of disintegration .
But Zardari said the parliamentary elections slated to be held January 8 , less than two weeks after his wife 's death , should not be postponed .
" Our demand is elections on time -- free , fair as promised , " he said .
He called on opposition leader Nawaz Sharif -- who heads the Pakistan Muslim League - N party -- to also take part in the vote .
Sharif has previously said he would boycott the election .
But sources within the Pakistan Muslim League - N party say they will stand with the PPP and take part in the election .
Speaking on Pakistan 's GEO - TV , Sharif said an official announcement on the party 's decision would take place Monday .
President Pervez Musharraf 's ruling Pakistan Muslim League - Q , the election commission and the interim Cabinet will hold separate meetings in the coming days to discuss the possibility of a delayed vote .
Zardari said he does not trust the government led by Musharraf to ensure the elections are indeed free and fair , but he does believe the people of Pakistan will be able to ensure that happens .
Whether his other two children will decide to enter politics " is entirely up to them , " he said .
" You know children today .
You cannot force them or ask them to do anything .
They do what they choose to do .
Bilawal has chosen this .
And so will the other two -- if they choose to come and help their brother and help their father , they 're welcome to .
If they choose not , then I will not impose anything upon anybody . "
He said Bhutto had trained Bilawal : " He realizes the enormity of the situation .
So therefore , he 's accepted the responsibility . "
Watch Bhutto's son and husband talk about the party 's future »
The teenager , speaking in English at a news conference , said , " I am thankful for the CEC for imposing their trust in me as chairman of the Pakistan People 's Party . "
" Like all chairmen of the PPP , I will stand as the symbol of the federation , " said Bilawal Bhutto .
" The party 's long and historic struggle for democracy will continue with renewed vigor , and I stand committed to the stability of the federation .
" My mother always said democracy is the best revenge . "

Watch official explain son's important symbolic role »
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown spoke to Musharraf on the telephone Sunday , and the Pakistani leader agreed to consider international support for the investigation into Bhutto 's death , according to a statement from Brown 's office .
Musharraf 's government has previously rejected international help , specifically from Britain .
" We understand our environment better than the international community , " Pakistani Interior Ministry spokesman Javed Iqbal Cheema said Saturday .
" Scotland Yard can not investigate in Waziristan .
They do n't understand Pashto . "
Zardari also said the PPP is asking the United Nations to investigate the circumstances of Bhutto 's December 27 killing .
He said he does not plan to call for an autopsy on his wife , who was buried in her hometown on Friday .
Musharraf also spoke Sunday with French President Nicolas Sarkozy , a French foreign ministry spokeswoman told CNN .
After the conversation , it was announced that French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner will travel to Pakistan this week .
When asked about the naming of Bhutto 's successor , White House spokesman Scott Stanzel said , " It is up to the political parties in Pakistan to choose their leaders . "
" We believe it is important for Pakistan to confront extremists and continue on the path to democracy by holding free and fair elections , " Stanzel said .
" The timing of those elections will be up to the Pakistanis . "

So money does make a kind of sustainability possible for Las Vegas .
On the other hand , buying water is quite unlike buying anything else .
At the moment , water does n’t really function like a private good ; its value , which Peter Binney calls “ infinite , ” is often only vaguely related to its price , which can vary from 50 cents an acre- foot ( what Mulroy pays to take water from Lake Mead ) to $ 12,000 an acre- foot ( the most Binney has paid farmers in Colorado for their rights ) .
Moreover , water is so necessary to human life , and hence so heavily subsidized and regulated , that it ca n’t really be bought and sold freely across state lines .
( Enron tried to start a water market called Azurix in the late 1990s , only to see it fail spectacularly . )
The more successful water markets have instead been local , like one in the late 1980s in California , where farmers agreed to reduce their water use and sell the savings to a state water bank .
Mulroy and Binney each told me they think a true free - market water exchange would create too many winners and losers .
“ What you would have is affluent communities being able to buy the lifeblood right out from under those that are less well heeled , ” Mulroy said .
More practical , in her mind , would be a regional market that gives states , cities and farmers greater freedom to strike mutually beneficial agreements , but with protections so that municipalities are n’t pitted against one another .
More - efficient water markets might ease shortages , but they ca n’t replace a big city ’s principal source .
What if , I asked Mulroy , Lake Mead drained nearly to the bottom ?
Even if drought conditions ease over the next year or two , several people I spoke with think the odds are greater that Lake Powell , the 27 - million - acre - foot reservoir that supplies Lake Mead , will drop to unusable levels before it ever fills again .
Mulroy did n’t immediately dismiss the possibility ; she is certain that the reduced circumstances of the two big Western reservoirs are tied to global warming and that Las Vegas is this country ’s first victim of climate change .
An empty Lake Mead , she began , would mean there is nothing in Lake Powell .
“ It ’s well outside probabilities , ” she said — but it could happen .
“ In that case , it ’s not just a Las Vegas problem .
You have three entire states wiped out : Arizona , California and Nevada .
Because you ca n’t replace those volumes with desalted ocean water . ”
What seems more likely , she said , is that the legal framework governing the Colorado River would preclude such a dire turn of events .
Recently , the states that use the Colorado reached a tentative agreement that guarantees Lake Mead will remain partly full under current conditions , even if upstream users have to cut back their withdrawals as a result .
The deal supplements a more fundamental understanding that dates to the 1920s .
If the river is failing to carry a certain , guaranteed volume of water to Lee ’s Ferry , which is just below Lake Powell , the river ’s lower - basin states ( Nevada , Arizona and California ) can legally force the upper - basin states ( Colorado , Wyoming , New Mexico and Utah ) to reduce or stop their water withdrawals .
This contingency , known as a “ compact call , ” sets the lower - basin states against the upper , but it has never occurred ; it is deeply feared by many water managers , because it would ravage the fragile relationship among states and almost certainly lead to a scrum of lawsuits .
Yet , last year water managers in Colorado began meeting for the first time to discuss the possibility .
In our conversations , Mulroy denied that there would be a compact call , but she pointed out that Las Vegas ’s groundwater and desalination plans were going ahead anyway for precautionary reasons .
I asked if limiting the growth of the Las Vegas metro area would n’t help .
Mulroy bristled .
“ This country is going to have 100 million additional people in it in the next 25 to 30 years , ” she replied .
“ Tell me where they ’re supposed to go .
Seriously .
Every community says , ‘ Not here , ’ ‘ No growth here , ’ ‘ There ’s too many people here already . ’
For a large urban area that is the core economic hub of any particular area , to even attempt to throw up walls ?
I ’m not sure it can be done . ”
Besides , she added , the problem is n’t growth alone : “ We have an exploding human population , and we have a shrinking clean - water supply .
Those are on colliding paths .
This is not just a Las Vegas issue .
This is a microcosm of a much larger issue . ”
Americans , she went on to say , are the most voracious users of natural resources in the world .
Maybe we need to talk about that as well .
“ The people who move to the West today need to realize they ’re moving into a desert , ” Mulroy said .
“ If they want to live in a desert , they have to adapt to a desert lifestyle . ”
That means a shift from the mindset of the 1930s , when the federal government encouraged people to settle in the West , plant water - intensive crops and make it look like the East Coast .
It means landscapes of parched dirt .
It means mesquite bushes and palo verde trees for vegetation .
It means recycled water .
It means gravel lawns .
It is the West ’s new deal , she seemed to be saying , and I got the feeling that for Mulroy it means that every blade of grass in her state would soon be gone .
The first impulse when confronted with the West ’s water problems may be to wonder how , as scarcity becomes more acute , the region will engineer its way back to health .
What can be built , what can technology accomplish , to ease any shortages ?
Yet this is almost certainly the wrong way to think about the situation .
To be sure , construction projects like a pipeline from east - central Nevada could help Las Vegas .
But the larger difficulty facing Pat Mulroy and Peter Binney , as they describe it , is re-engineering the culture and conventions of the West before it becomes too late .
Whether or not there is enough water in the region for , say , the next 30 or 50 years is n’t necessarily a question with a yes - or - no answer .
The water managers I spoke with believe the total volume of available water could be great enough to sustain the cities , many farms and perhaps the natural flow of the area ’s rivers .
But it ’s not unreasonable to assume that if things continue as they have — with so much water going to agriculture ; with conservation only beginning to take hold among residents , industry and farmers ; with supplies diminishing slowly but steadily as the Earth warms ; with the population growing faster than anywhere else in the United States ; and with some of our most economically vital states constricted by antique water agreements — the region will become a topography of crisis and perhaps catastrophe .
This is an old prophecy , dating back more than a century to one of the original American explorers of the West , John Wesley Powell , who doubted the territory could support large populations and intense development .
( Powell presciently argued that river basins , not arbitrary mapmakers , should determine the boundaries of the Western states , in order to avoid inevitable conflicts over water . )
An earlier explorer , J. C. Ives , visited the present location of Hoover Dam , between Arizona and Nevada , in 1857 .
The desiccated landscape was “ valueless , ” Ives reported .
“ There is nothing there to do but leave . ”
Roger Pulwarty , for his part , rejects the notion of environmental determinism .
Nature , in other words , is n’t inexorably pushing the region into a grim , suffering century .
Things can be done .
Redoubling efforts to prevent further climate change , Pulwarty says , is one place to start ; another is getting the states that share the Colorado River to reach cooperative arrangements , as they have begun to discuss , for coping with long - term droughts .
Other parts of the solution are less obvious .
To Peter Gleick , head of the Pacific Institute , a nonprofit based in Oakland , Calif. , that focuses on global water issues , whether we can adapt to a drier future depends on whether we can rethink the functions , and value , of fresh water .
Can we can do the same things using less of it ?
How we use our water , Gleick believes , is considerably more complex than it appears .
First of all , there are consumptive and nonconsumptive uses of water .
Consumptive use , roughly speaking , refers to water taken from a reservoir that cannot be recovered .
“ It ’s embedded in a product like a liter of Coca - Cola , or it ’s contaminated so badly we can’t reuse it , ” Gleick says .
In agriculture , the vast majority of water use is also consumptive , because it evaporates or transpires from crops into the atmosphere .
Evaporated water may fall as rain 1,000 miles away — that ’s how Earth ’s water cycle works — but it is gone locally .
A similar consumptive process characterizes the water we put on our lawns or gardens : it mostly disappears .
Meanwhile , most of the water used by metropolitan areas is nonconsumptive .
It goes down the drain and empties into nearby rivers , like Colorado ’s South Platte , as treated wastewater .
Gleick calls the Colorado River “ the most complicated water system in the world , ” and he is n’t convinced it will be easy , or practical , to change the laws that govern its usage .
“ But I think it ’s less hard to change how we use water , ” he says .
He accepts that climate change is confronting the West with serious problems .
( He was also one of the country ’s first scientists , in the mid-1980s , to point out that reductions in mountain snowpack could present huge challenges . )
He makes a persuasive case , however , that there are immense opportunities — even in cities like Las Vegas , which has made strides in conservation — to reduce both consumptive and nonconsumptive demand for water .
These include installing more low - flow home appliances and adopting more efficient irrigation methods .
And they include economic tools too : for example , many municipalities have reduced consumption by making water more expensive ( the more you use , the higher your per-gallon rate ) .
The United States uses less water than it did 25 years ago , Gleick points out : “ We have n’t even paid too much attention to it , and we ’ve accomplished this . ”
To go further , he says he believes we could alter not only demand but also supply .
“ Treated wastewater is n’t a liability , it ’s an asset , ” he says .
We do n’t need potable water to flush our toilets or water our lawns .
“ One might say that ’s a ridiculous use of potable water .
In fact , I might say that .
But that ’s the way we ’ve set it up .
And that ’s going to change , that ’s got to change , in this century . ”

A pilot 's brave spirit of sacrifice saved hundreds of lives when he veered his stricken Spitfire away from crowds at an airshow .
Martin Sargeant , 56 , died instantly when his Second World War fighter crashed in a field in Rouen , northern France .
The father of three made a last - minute diversion when he realised the emergency landing strip was full of people watching the aerobatics display , an inquest heard yesterday .
Realising they would never disperse in time , he tried to swerve the plane towards another runway , but it was too late .
Scroll down for more ...
An inquest in Tunbridge Wells , Kent , has heard how the Spitfire crashed in the airfield and burst into flames .
Mr Sargeant , from Goudhurst , Kent , died instantly .
The plane was seen trailing smoke shortly before it crashed on June 4 , 2001 .
Fellow pilot John Romaine told the inquest of Mr Sargeant 's heroic last moments .
Scroll down for more ...
" There had been a briefing for all the pilots at lunchtime where we were told there was an emergency grass landing strip we could use if we encountered any problems , " he said .
" At 4.20 pm , we were strapped into our aircraft .
Martin was in front of me by a couple of seconds - I was in the aircraft at the back of our formation .
" Then I saw plumes of smoke and heard Martin say he had a problem .
He broke away from the formation and I broke away too and followed him .
" He started to head back to the airfield .
I moved away to give him space , but stayed with him in my plane .
" I heard him call out over the radio that there were hundreds of people on the landing strip .
" His plane was descending with no power .
It is not the easiest plane to fly with no engine .
" Had the runway been clear , he would have been able to land it perfectly .
He would have made it to the grass strip .
" From the air , the whole area just looked inundated with people .
" He decided to try to head for the tarmac runway instead - but it would have been difficult for him to head there .
The next time I looked , there was a plume of smoke where his plane had crashed . "
The Air Accident Investigation Branch found Mr Sargeant 's engine had problems with the magnetos - which provide power to generate an ignition spark for the fuel - and this had caused his engine to fail .
Corooccasionner Roger Hatch recorded a verdict of accidental death .
" Mr Sargeant took all the possible steps to land his aircraft in an emergency - he was told where he would be able to land in the occasion of an emergency , " he said .
" Why it was the general public it seems were allowed to be on the grass I have been unable to find out .
" It is clear that Mr Sargeant tried to change his plans and head for the alternative runway .
But without any power - either the engine turned off , or cut off - it left him with very few alternatives , and the accident took place . "
He apologised for the six - year delay in holding the hearing , which he blamed on a lack of cooperation from the French authorities .
Eleven Spitfires and a Hurricane had taken part in the Rouen display , the first to bring together such an important collection of Second World War planes in France since the war .
Mr Sargeant , who ran a car restoration business , was an experienced pilot .
Yesterday his son Carl said : " He was a wonderful man , a great husband , father and boss .
We miss him terribly .
" The fact is , that emergency landing strip should have been clear .
If it had been we would not be here today . "
Mr Sargeant died just a day after three other pilots were killed in two separate crashes at the Biggin Hill Airshow in Kent .
The Hershey candy company is under fire for producing a breath mint candy that police say is hard to distinguish from an illegal drug .
Philadelphia cops are complaining that a new iteration of Hershey 's Ice Breakers product looks a lot like crack cocaine .
When we initially read a quote from a local Philadelphia news station – –" Even veteran narcotics officers acknowledged that they could not tell the difference between a package of crack cocaine and the breath mints package when placed side by side " – –we figured that Philadelphia police must be idiots .
Looking at the picture at left , however , we 'll have to agree .
Aside from worrying that Hershey 's might be making drug use appear cool––minty fresh and cool––police are concerned that children might mistake a bag of cocaine for a mint and unintentionally ingest it .
The Hershey Company denies that there is any intentional resemblance between its product and illegal drugs , pointing out that each of its mints are clearly labeled with the Ice Breaker logo .
The new product is called Ice Breakers PACS .
On a somewhat unrelated noted , a very interesting chronicle of the history of Hershey was written a few years ago .
" The Emperors of Chocolate : Inside the Secret World of Hershey and Mars " is a revealing look at two differently held companies that are highly regarded as brands around the world .
The candy business can be quite bitter .
With atoms and molecules in a gas moving at thousands of kilometres per hour , physicists have long sought a way to slow them down to a few kilometres per hour to trap them .
A paper , published October 4 in the Institute of Physics ' New Journal of Physics , demonstrates how a group of physicists from The University of Texas at Austin , US , have found a way to slow down , stop and explore a much wider range of atoms than ever before .
Inspired by the coilgun that was developed by the University 's Center for Electromechanics , the group has developed an " atomic coilgun " that slows and gradually stops atoms with a sequence of pulsed magnetic fields .
Dr. Mark Raizen and his colleagues in Texas ultimately plan on using the gun to trap atomic hydrogen , which he said has been the Rosetta Stone of physics for many years and is the simplest and most abundant atom in the universe .
Work on slowing and stopping atoms has been at the forefront of advancement in physics for some time .
In 1997 , there were three joint - winners for the Nobel Prize in Physics for their combined contribution to laser cooling - a method using laser light to cool gases and keep atoms floating or captured in " atom traps " .
These important advances had limited use because they only applied to atoms with ' closed two - level transition ' , excluding important elements such as hydrogen , iron , nickel and cobalt .
In contrast , nearly all elements and a wide range of molecules are affected by magnetic forces , or are paramagnetic , which means that this latest research has much wider applicability .
Professor Raizen said , " Of particular importance are the doors being opened for our understanding of hydrogen .
Precision spectroscopy of hydrogen 's isotopes , deuterium and tritium , continues to be of great interest to both atomic and nuclear physics .
Further study of tritium , as the simplest radioactive element , also serves as an ideal system for the study of Beta decay . "
Having successfully designed and used an 18 - coil device to slow a supersonic beam of metastable neon atoms , the team is now developing a 64 - stage device to further slow and stop atoms .
The al - Quds unit within the guards corps is accused of providing powerful bomb - making equipment to fighters in Iraq that has led to the deaths of US soldiers .
The revolutionary guards as a whole , which have business interests ranging from newspapers to cars , were branded " proliferators of weapons of mass destruction " in reference to its alleged role in developing nuclear weapons .
Three major state - owned Iranian banks , which Washington claims help fund Tehran 's alleged support for the Taliban in Afghanistan , Shia militants in Iraq , and Hamas and Hizbullah , are also targeted .
The unprecedented sanctions , which also target the country 's defence ministry , will cut off more than 20 Iranian entities , including individuals and companies owned or controlled by the revolutionary guards .
The secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , said today : " What this means is that no US citizen or a private organisation will be allowed to engage in financial transactions with these persons and entities . "
" These actions will help to protect the international financial system from the illicit activities of the Iranian government .
They will provide a powerful deterrent to every international bank and company that thinks of doing business with the Iranian government . "
Ms Rice said the US was " fully committed to a diplomatic solution with Iran " and had " no conflict " with the Iranian people .
But she added : " Unfortunately the Iranian government continues to spurn our offer of open negotiations , instead threatening peace and security by pursuing nuclear technologies that can lead to a nuclear weapon , building dangerous ballistic missiles , supporting Shia militants in Iraq and terrorists in Iraq , Afghanistan , Lebanon and the Palestinian territories , and denying the existence of a fellow member of the United Nations , threatening to wipe Israeli off the map . "
The treasury secretary , Hank Paulson , told reporters in Washington that Iran channels millions of dollars each year to terrorists .
" It is increasingly likely that if you are doing business with Iran you are doing business with [ the revolutionary guards ] , " Mr Paulson said .
He said the measures were intended to prevent " one of the world 's worst regimes from acquiring the world 's most dangerous weapons " .
A senior Iranian MP denounced the sanctions , which are believed to be the first ever imposed by the US against the armed forces of another state , as a " strategic mistake " .
Kazem Jalali , spokesman for the Iranian parliament 's foreign affairs and security commission , told AFP : " The revolutionary guards is an official force in Iran and it is clear that labelling them terrorists is interfering in the domestic affairs of a sovereign nation . "
He added : " If things are seen this way then most of the US forces who are doing operations in different parts of the world and hurting innocent people are terrorists .
" This will make the wall of distrust between Iran and the United States higher every day and will close down dialogue . "
Britain said it supported the US action .
A Foreign Office spokesman said : " We are prepared to lead the way to a third resolution of sanctions , and at the same time support tougher European Union sanctions . "

In the midst of the Writers Guild strike , Battlestar Galactica showrunner Ron Moore walked the picket line outside the Walt Disney Studios today , alongside a large assemblage of showrunners from other series .
I spoke to him for several minutes for a candid conversation about the issues surrounding the strike and how the situation is affecting Galactica , which is currently filming its fourth and final season .
<i>Battlestar + Galactica</i>+producer+Ron+Moore+on+the+picket+line
For Moore , " Fundamentally this is about the internet , and this is about whether writers get paid for material that is made for the internet or if they 're paid for material that is broadcast on the internet that was developed for TV or movies . "
Moore shared a story to illustrate the scenario , saying " I had a situation last year on Battlestar Galactica where we were asked by Universal to do webisodes , which at that point were very new and ' Oooh , webisodes !
What does that mean ? '
It was all very new stuff .
And it was very eye opening , because the studio's position was ' Oh , we 're not going to pay anybody to do this .
You have to do this , because you work on the show .
And we 're not going to pay you to write it .
We 're not going to pay the director , and we 're not going to pay the actors . '
At which point we said ' No thanks , we wo n't do it . '" " We got in this long , protracted thing and eventually they agreed to pay everybody involved .
But then , as we got deeper into it , they said ' But we 're not going to put any credits on it .
You 're not going to be credited for this work .
And we can use it later , in any fashion that we want . '
At which point I said ' Well , then we 're done and I 'm not going to deliver the webisodes to you . '
And they came and they took them out of the editing room anyway -- which they have every right to do .
They own the material --
But it was that experience that really showed me that that 's what this is all about .
If there 's not an agreement with the studios about the internet , that specifically says ' This is covered material , you have to pay us a formula - whatever that formula turns out to be - for use of the material and how it's all done , ' the studios will simply rape and pillage .
" Moore , like most of his fellow writers , was extremely bothered by the studios attempting to designate content shown on the web as " promotional , " even when that content has sponsors and advertisers .
" Their position continues to be that this is ' promotional . '
That they can have it promotional material , free of charge and they can make you do the work and they do n't have to compensate you for it and they do n't have to credit you for it .
It 's undercutting everything that the writers have built up in other media .
The notion that just because it's on your computer as opposed to your television set is absurd .
It 's an absurd position for them to take , but , you know , if they can pull it off , they 're at the moment of a watershed change of how your media is delivered to you .
Your television and your computer are going to become the same device within the foreseeable future .
That reality is staring us in the face .
" Moore scoffed at the arguments given as to why no payment system can be worked out for new media right now , saying " They still fall back on ' Oh , well , it 's all so unknown .
It 's all so new !
We do n't know what the business model is .
It 's strange ! '
They act as though this is 1992 and they 're trying to figure out ' What is email and how does that work ? '
Somehow they know how to make money from iTunes , and everybody is tripping over themselves to sell this stuff to you and have downloads .
NBC Universal has Hulu , their brand new site , and you can log on there and you can watch The Office and you can watch , probably , my show .
I do n't think we 're on there yet , but we probably will be .
And guess what ?
You have to sit through commercials when you watch them .
Well , I doubt very much that those commercials were provided free of charge .
So somebody 's making money , somewhere .
The studios really have only themselves to blame , in terms of the lack of trust of financial accountability and the fact that so many people that are on this line right now were promised net profits or profits from various things that never come to pass .
So there 's a certain level of ' Yeah , you want to wait to talk about this in three years , while you figure out the business model ?
Bulls * *t . You 're making money right now .
You 're going to make money , and you 're just finding a way to hide it ' "
Opinion Evil Americans , Poor Mullahs

How times change re the Second Amendment
Sandy Levinson
It 's maddening how effective Bush administration propaganda is .
They say the surge has been working .
They repeat it a million times .
Then they get a couple of their cronies inside think tanks , who are paid to say how great they are , say the surge is working .
Then they get a couple of generals , who were promoted to say how great they are , say the surge is working .
And voila , all you hear in the news is how well the surge is working .
When are the people in the media going to grow a brain ?
This so - called surge is a disaster , with zero results .
Yes , I said zero .
Now let me say something that is going to sound contradictory to their small , little viewpoints ( let 's call it that , to be generous ) .
Our strategy in the Anbar province is working .
But wait , I just said the surge is n't working .
How can that be ?
That 's because our strategy in the Anbar province has NOTHING , NOTHING , NOTHING to do with the surge .
It does n't involve more U.S. troops .
It involves less U.S. troops !
Can someone please use their minds ?
Has anyone thought for more than three seconds about what our strategy in Anbar is ?
It is to turn the Sunni insurgency from our enemies to our allies -- so that they do the fighting for us !
We do not have more troops fighting in the Anbar province now , we have less .
This is a deal we could have and should have made a long , long time ago .
You empower the local tribes , sects and ethnicities to fight for their area of Iraq .
They will have an incentive to drive out Al Qaeda and foreign fighters if they think they are going to control the area afterward .
If they think they are going to hand it over to the U.S. or to other ethnicities in Iraq , then they wo n't do it .
So , this is about empowering Iraqis on a local level , not about an escalation of U.S. troops .
The Kurds have kept northern Iraq relatively stable because they have an incentive to keep it that way .
They know that they will be running it .
There 's no chance they 're going to hand it over to the Shiites or the Sunni Arabs .
This is also a strategy that could be pursued as we withdraw out of Iraq .
In fact , it is a strategy tailor made for withdrawal .
Empower the locals to keep order as you clear out of an area .
Since you are leaving , they will believe you when you say they will run the place .
If anything , a U.S. military escalation in a region will hurt this strategy .
That 's why we have given weapons and money to the Sunni insurgents in the Anbar province and stepped out of the way .
As far as the rest of the surge is concerned , as The Los Angeles Times showed , there is no decrease in violence levels .
More people were killed this month than the last .
And more people were killed that month than the one before .
The number of casualties is higher than it was last year .
How many other statistics would you like to use to prove that the violence has n't gone down ?
There are pockets of Iraq where the level of violence is improving .
As Newsweek explains , those are the pockets that have already been ethnically cleansed .
A majority of the 1.1 million people who have been displaced within Iraq were ethnically cleansed while the so - called surge was happening .
How come you hardly ever hear about that on television ?
Have you ever seen this headline : Surge Leads to Ethnic Cleansing .
I 'm not sure the two are correlated , but they certainly happened at the same time .
At the very least , the vaunted surge did absolutely nothing to stop the ethnic cleansing of Baghdad .
Yet , all we hear is what a lovely success the surge has been .
If the surge tried to be more unsuccessful , I do n't know how it could have done a better job .
More Americans killed , more Iraqi civilians killed and more ethnic cleansing .
And oh yeah , no political reconciliation among the Iraqis at all .
Zero .
How could the surge be any less successful ?
Now , when Petraeus and Crocker come and tell us what we already know they are going to tell us -- and what they were hired to tell us -- that their surge is working just fine , will we take them seriously ?
My guess is , absolutely .
The media and the Congress will pretend that they are neutral arbiters of the facts on the ground and have a whole new round of stories about how well the surge is working .
Petraeus defending the surge he engineered and executed ?
Wow , I did n't see that coming .
It might as well have been called the Petraeus surge ( by the way , you should read the horribly wrong assessment of Iraq that Gen. Petraeus wrote in Sept. 2004 ; if he was so wrong about Iraq and his work there three years ago , why should we trust his judgment about Iraq now ? ) .
I would hope that the Democratic Congressmen would hold his feet to the fire and really challenge his spin on his surge .
But that would be hoping against hope .
My guess is that they will be far more likely to get blinded by the shiny stars on his uniform and intimidated out of the room by the fact that he wears a uniform .
Will anyone challenge the nonsensical notion that this surge is working to Petraeus ' face ?
Or will the Democrats profusely thank him for his service and then meekly talk about how they slightly disagree with his assessment later ?
You and I know both know the answer to that question .
So , expect another round of credulous " news " stories about how the mighty and brilliant General Petraeus says the surge is working .
So it must be .

Billionaire Buffett still complaining his taxes are too low David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday October 30 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Multi- billionaire Warren Buffett has been complaining for years that his taxes are too low .
Last June , he said at a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton that he was taxed at only 17.7 % last year on his $ 46 million in income , while his secretary paid 30 % of her $ 60,000 .
NBC's Tom Brokaw recently interviewed Buffett , " whose approach does n't make him very popular with his fellow billionaires . "
" The taxation system has tilted toward the rich and away from the middle class in the last 10 years , " Buffett , the nation 's third richest man , told Brokaw .
Buffett said he did an informal survey of federal taxes paid by his own office staff , and the average was 32.9 % , compared to his 17.7 % .
" There was n't anybody in the office , from the receptionists on , that paid as low a tax rate , " Buffett stated , noting that " I have no tax planning , I do n't have an accountant , I do n't have tax shelters . "
" It 's not right , " one of Buffett 's receptionist 's told Brokaw .
" In theory , a progressive consumption tax makes the most sense , " Buffett suggested to Brokaw -- referring to a form of sales tax that exempts basic necessities entirely and has higher rates on luxuries .
However , that method has been criticized as likely to lead to distortions in the economy and corruption in setting rates .
Buffett has now challenged his fellow members of the " Forbes 400 " to do the same survey he did , saying he 'll bet a million dollars their average rate will be less than that of their receptionists .
" How much are you hearing from your fellow richfellows ? "
Brokaw asked .
" I do n't hear from them .
They 're happy , " chuckled Buffett .
The tax code has not been a major issue among the presidential candidates , but Rep. Charlie Rangel ( D - NY ) has recently offered a plan to increase taxes on super - wealthy hedge fund managers , who currently pay at the 15 % capital gains rate , while lowering them for most families that earn under $ 500,000 .
The following video is from NBC's Today Show , broadcast on October 30 , 2007 .

( This is all my personal opinion . )
To be completely honest , I was a little worried about Saul Hansell , a journalist for the New York Times , sitting in on some of our confidential quality meetings at Google .
Even though everything was off - the - record , you ca n’t help but be slightly nervous talking about evaluation methodologies and confidential projects with a reporter in the room .
You can read the article now , and in my opinion it does a good job of describing search quality at Google .
I think it was worth the risk of letting a journalist attend our quality meetings .
To see why , I ’ll highlight five things from the article that you might not have known :
Google continues to have a strong focus on search
All the time I hear things like “ If Google does n’t pay attention to search … ” or “ If Google loses its focus on search . ”
That ’s not likely to happen , but let me explain why people might worry that Google will lose our focus on search .
– Something like Street View is splashy , cool , and easy to understand , so launches like that tend to get more coverage .
It ’s much easier for someone to write about a new product or feature than about how Google has improved its semantic understanding of the web , or when we get better at scoring documents .
I love Street view , Google Gears , and mobile Calendar , by the way .
I ’m just using them as examples because they ’re easy to understand and recent .
– We do n’t always talk a ton about core search quality .
Part of the reason is that some reporters are less interested in changes that ca n’t even be seen ( “ Google ’s search just got a little better in Thai .
You ca n’t see it , but it did ! ” ) .
Sometimes core search is hard to get other people excited about — kinda like it ’s hard to make a picture of someone working on a computer exciting .
And sometimes as a business you do n’t want to give hints to competitors about how you do things .
I ’ve got a funny story about “ url.host ” that I ’ll tell someday .
Maybe someone will ask me about it in the Q&A tomorrow at the conference .
What happens when you put these two trends together ?
People see media coverage on neat / wild / fun things that Google does , and they do n’t read many stories about core search quality .
From those two facts , they extrapolate to what seems like a reasonable conclusion : Google is focusing less on search .
But that ’s just not true .
Hundreds of engineers pay attention to our search quality in ways big and small .
Google is practically designed from the ground up so that we ca n’t lose that search focus .
It ’s natural to combine these two trends and come to the wrong conclusion .
By giving a glimpse at what our search quality engineers do on a daily basis , this article dispels that misconception .
Google makes lots of improvements that most people never notice .
Some people think that Google changes a few things every few months .
At least in search quality , it ’s more like a few things every week .
From the article : “ the search - quality team makes about a half - dozen major and minor changes a week to the vast nest of mathematical formulas that power the search engine . ”
I do n’t think we ’ve discussed our pace of search quality changes before .
Getting search right is really hard
The article quotes John Battelle :
“ People still think that Google is the gold standard of search , ” Mr. Battelle says .
“ Their secret sauce is how these guys are doing it all in aggregate .
There are 1,000 little tunings they do . ”
In my experience that ’s correct .
Running a search engine at Google - scale means that you have to get lots of big things and hundreds of little things right .
Missing even a few of those things will annoy users ( sometimes subconsciously ) and they wo n’t use your search engine as much .
I would never claim that we get all of those hundreds of things right ourselves , but we try to .
I read a quote from someone from a different search engine last year .
They essentially said that “ there was no more secret sauce left ” in search .
After reading that claim , I walked around happy for days . 🙂
Google has some good internal tools
This article was the first time that I know of that we ’ve mentioned our internal debug tools .
When you get hundreds of millions of queries a day , it ’s inevitable that some queries wo n’t return the ideal set of results .
At Google , we love hearing about those queries because we can dissect them and plan how to improve our algorithms .
There are a lot of people “ behind the curtain ” at Google that improve search
I think it ’s important to get more Googlers out into the spotlight .
Sometimes search engine optimizers attribute ( say ) some crawl change to me when the most I might have done was relay a problem report to the experts in the crawl / index team , who then do the real work of deciding how to tackle an issue and implementing that idea .
So I ’m glad that the article sheds light on some new people in search .
The article discusses Amit Singhal , who is a wonderful guy and a strong influence at Google .
The newspaper article also includes a picture of Jianfei Zhu .
Jianfei is a colleague that works with me and others on Chinese webspam ; Jianfei also spoke at SES China recently and has done interviews about SEO and Chinese search .
Most importantly , the article mentions that there are hundreds of engineers that pay attention to search and quality at Google .
These are phenomenal people who work on everything from international issues to evaluating our quality to crawling / indexing to personalization to fixing bugs to new quality initiatives .
( Not to mention all the other people who make a difference at Google in hundreds of ways outside of search . )
I know that Saul Hansell talked to several other engineers when he visited Google , so over time I believe we ’ll get even more Googlers out into the spotlight .
So , five things you might not have known about Google ’s search until you read this article :
– Just because Google does n’t always talk about search and journalists do n’t always write about core search does n’t mean stuff is n’t happening .
Google devotes a ton of effort to improving our search in many different ways .
– Google makes a go / no - go decision on several different quality changes each week .
– If you want to build search loyalty , you have to get a lot of different things right .
– Google has many ways to prioritize feedback and tools to look at how to improve search .
– I ’m glad we ’re shedding light on some additional people at Google .
Many people work behind the scenes to improve the user experience at Google , and we should look to highlight even more of those people .
“ This kind of decisiveness and moving rapidly , not just at the top but deep into the organization , is unusual in media takeovers , ” said Louis Ureneck , chairman of the journalism department at Boston University .
“ There tends to be some patience about getting to know the operation and making a smooth transition .
But he ’s operating like a young man who ’s bought a sports car and ca n’t wait to hop in and drive it around . ”
None of that should be surprising from Mr. Murdoch , who is known for being sure of what he wants to do with each of his many properties  often molding them to reflect his own views and wasting no time in doing it .
His habit of detailed , personal control contrasts starkly with decades of hands - off ownership by the Bancroft family , which viewed almost any involvement as unethical meddling .
The takeover puts vast resources behind a newspaper that is marginally profitable at best , in part because it has defied the industry trends of cutting staff and circulation .
The News Corporation has $ 29 billion in annual revenue compared with $ 2 billion for Dow Jones , and Mr. Murdoch has shown repeatedly that he is willing to invest in his properties  even to take heavy losses on some of them  in order to win audiences and advertisers away from their competitors .
With a bodyguard and his longtime secretary in tow  as well as the occasional News Corporation executive 
Mr. Murdoch has been a frequent presence in Dow Jones offices , meeting with executives , the editorial page editor of The Journal , Paul Gigot and , in the main newsroom two floors below , Marcus W. Brauchli , the managing editor .
In a handful of walks through the newsroom and a visit to The Journal ’s printing plant in South Brunswick , N.J. , Mr. Murdoch , 76 , has revealed little about his intentions , employees say .
But they add that at each stop , he has asked questions about their work and displayed an astonishing command of detail about what they do , from production schedules to running the presses .
There are already firm plans to eliminate The Journal ’s Marketplace section , containing articles on business trends and technology , in the first half of next year , with a new section taking its place , according to people at Dow Jones and the News Corporation who have been briefed on the changes .
The editor of Marketplace , Melinda Beck , recently left that post to write a column on health , and no replacement has been named .

There are also plans to replace dozens of the newsroom staff , while other personnel changes reflecting Mr. Murdoch ’s priorities have already begun , including building up the Washington bureau and shopping for reporters and editors to hire away from The Journal ’s competitors .
RV comparison is as critical as comparing cars .
The second biggest expense most people encounter in their life is a vehicle .
We ’ve all heard the saying that a car loses 25 % of its value as soon as you drive it off the dealer ’s lot .
But this does n’t just apply to the family car , though .
Almost any form of transportation will trudge downward in value with each passing year : boats , motorcycles , work trucks , and , you guessed it , RVs .
If you ’re in the market for an RV , chances are this is n’t what you want to hear right now .
Right now you want to hear about the joys of RV travel and read about all the cool gadgets and features available on even the smallest camper these days .
We understand , we ’ve been there .
Putting it bluntly : an RV is an investment that will cost you more money than it returns .
There ’s no way around it .
Buying a home is not only a wise investment , but it ’s also a necessity .
We all need a roof over our heads .
Nobody needs a fifth - wheel or a diesel motorhome .
Or do they ?
Life is n’t much fun if it ’s all prudent investments and saving for a rainy day .
A family vacation is remembered with much more fondness or contentment than financial wins or losses .
So let ’s cut ourselves some slack for wanting to seize the day and live a little , shall we ?
Keep in mind , we ’re not implying that you should stop by your local RV dealership with an open checkbook .
Quite the contrary .
Japanese company Unisantis , founded in 2004 to develop and commercialize a new type of transistor , has announced a 24 - month collaborative research agreement with Sinapore 's Institute of Microelectronics ( IME ) to work on the device .
Unisantis is making some huge claims about this new transistor , a three - dimensional design called the Stacked Gate Transistor ( SGT ) that the company claims could boost processor clockspeeds north of 20 GHz to a possible 50GHz .
I 'm not enough of a semiconductor device physics guy to be able to give the level of scrutiny that I 'd like to the 20GHz + claims , but it is clear that man behind the SGT , Fujio Masuoka , is a heavyweight in the semicoductor memory world .
Indeed , most of the journal articles that I was able to dig up on the SGT were related to the device 's potential for the flash storage market , where its 3D structure — source , gate , and drain are arranged vertically , instead of spread out horizontally — makes for a fast , high - density nonvolatile memory cell .
Unisantis clearly has ambitions for the SGT that extend well beyond the memory market , however .
The company is touting the device as an eventual successor to the standard planar transistor design , a design whose well - known clockspeed scaling problems have put the brakes on the clockspeed race and have forced the entire computer industry into the parallel computing paradigm that programmers are still struggling with .
If the SGT is able to get the per - thread performance train rolling again , then this would shift some of the burden of providing overall software performance increases off of programmers and back onto process engineers .
However , the SGT is an unspecified length of time away from commercialization , and , by the time it gets here , it 's possible that most programmers will be grappling with core counts well north of 10 cores per die ( i.e. , a Nehalem successor that has moved down into the mainstream ) .
So whatever relief the SGT may eventually provide is almost too far off to matter in terms of slowing down the multicore revolution .

If you know more about the SGT and can point me to some good resources for reading up on it , be sure to drop into the discussion thread and / or send me an e-mail .
In spite of the fact that the basic idea for this device structure has apparently been around for at least 20 years , today 's announcement was my first exposure to it .
So I 'll definitely be keeping an eye on it by opening up a new " SGT " entry in the " three to five years away " file .
WHAT IS A 'TYPICAL ' FAMILY ?
There were 17.1 million families in the UK in 2006 - up from 16.5 million in 1996 .
Most were still headed by a married couple ( 71 % ) , although the proportion of cohabiting couple families had increased to 14 % , from 9 % 10 years earlier .
Although two children remains the most common family size , the average number of children per family in the UK has dropped - from 2.0 in 1971 to 1.8 .
More than two decades after presidential candidate Walter F. Mondale called for tax increases -- and lost the White House in a landslide -- the Democratic Party is on the verge of a major political gamble :
Some of its leading members are proposing an array of tax hikes on wealthier Americans .
All of the major Democratic presidential candidates would allow President Bush ’s tax cuts for wealthier households to lapse .
Most support raising the cap on income subject to Social Security taxes .
Some want to raise taxes on capital gains and other investment income .
On Capitol Hill , a leading Democrat -- House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charles B. Rangel of New York -- has proposed an additional tax on wealthy people and a levy on hedge fund managers to help pay for easing the tax burden on the middle class .
Some party strategists say calling for upper - income tax increases does not pose the political risk it once did because of wide public concern , particularly among Democratic voters , that the gap between rich and poor is growing .
Income inequality has become an increasingly salient issue at a time when , amid news of astronomical corporate salaries , many people feel economically insecure about such bread - and - butter items as healthcare , pensions and college costs .

“ The top 300,000 income - earners in America now make more than the bottom 150 million combined , ” former North Carolina Sen .
John Edwards said when he unveiled his plan to raise taxes on the rich and cut them for the middle class .
“ Our tax code has shifted most of the burden onto the backs of working Americans . ”
But Republicans still see the emerging debate on taxes as a political gift .
They have called Rangel ’s bill “ the mother of all tax hikes , ” and their House campaign committee sent news releases and videos attacking the proposed legislation to 50 Democrats ’ districts .
Bush this week previewed the critique awaiting Democrats on the 2008 campaign trail .
“ They have n’t seen a bill they could not solve without shoving a tax hike into it , ” he said of congressional Democrats , who included a cigarette - tax hike in a bill to expand children ’s health insurance .
“ In other words , they believe in raising taxes , and we do n’t . ”
Many rank - and - file Democrats in Congress feel vulnerable to such attacks , and cling to the conventional political wisdom that Mondale ’s 1984 White House bid was hobbled by his blunt promise to raise taxes .

That in part is why Rangel ’s bill has gotten a cool reception among Democrats , even though it links tax hikes on upper - income earners to relief for those who are far less affluent .
“ Democrats have been so burned by the anti-tax mantra , they are not going to volunteer to raise taxes , ” said Rep. David R. Obey ( D - Wis. ) , author of an ill - fated proposal to levy a new tax to pay for the Iraq war .
Conservative analysts dispute the idea that the tax code is unfair , saying that top earners pay a disproportionate share of the nation ’s total income - tax bill .
But Democrats see a different picture in a new analysis of Internal Revenue Service data that shows the richest 1 % of Americans earned 21.2 % of all income in 2005 -- up from 19 % in 2004 and a postwar record .
Democrats see that as an invitation to shift more of the burden to the wealthy .

The next president will have to address the tax issue , because Bush ’s tax cuts are due to expire at the end of 2010 .
Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) and Barack Obama ( D - Ill . ) have said they would let the cuts for households earning more than $ 250,000 lapse .
Edwards would repeal the tax cuts as soon as possible for those earning more than $ 200,000 .
All three have opposed the permanent repeal of the estate tax and have called for higher taxes on managers of certain investment funds , such as hedge funds , the lightly regulated pools of money that often use aggressive investment strategies .
The looming insolvency of Social Security and the widening reach of the alternative minimum tax are two issues driving the call for new revenue .

Rangel ’s approach
Rangel ’s bill centers on abolishing the alternative minimum tax , which was enacted in 1969 to keep rich people from using deductions to wipe out their income tax bills .
Because the tax is not indexed to inflation , it increasingly hits the middle class .
Lawmakers of both parties see this as an urgent problem , but it would cost more than $ 1 trillion over 10 years to get rid of the tax entirely .
Couples earning less than $ 200,000 a year would not be subject to the alternative minimum tax under Rangel ’s bill .
The lost revenue would be replaced by instituting a surtax of up to 4.6 % on the income , capital gains and dividends of higher earners .
The bill also would provide additional relief for middle - income taxpayers .
On Thursday , the House ’s tax - writing panel passed a one - year reprieve for many families that would otherwise be hit by the alternative minimum tax , but a broader fight over taxation awaits .

The Republican presidential candidates have seized on Rangel ’s proposal as a window into Democrats ’ future tax policies .
“ House Democrats have shown once again why they cannot be trusted with stewardship of our economy , ” former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney said .
In this week ’s debate among Democratic presidential candidates , Clinton praised Rangel ’s “ goal ” of eliminating the alternative minimum tax , but said she did not embrace its details .
Obama said he did not know all the details of Rangel ’s bill and may not agree with some aspects of it .

Social Security caps
The Clinton - Obama rivalry has played out over the issue of lifting the ceiling on income subject to the Social Security tax .
Obama says his support of the proposal shows his willingness to take on politically sensitive problems that other candidates shun -- and he has stepped up criticism of Clinton for not being more specific about how she would shore up Social Security .
“ If we have failed to have a real honest conversation about Social Security , it will not get fixed , ” he said in an advertisement .
Social Security is on a path to insolvency as the baby boom generation has begun to retire and draw benefits .
The program ’s trust fund is expected to begin paying out more in benefits than it takes in from revenues in 2017 , and to run dry around 2041 .

Clinton has said that the best way to address the problem is to convene a bipartisan commission , like the one that preceded the last overhaul of the program in 1983 .
In the meantime , she has refused to endorse specifics that might open her to GOP attacks .
And she has insisted that the problem is not as urgent as many people believe -- and as Republicans say in urging a major overhaul of the program .
“ I think for us to act like Social Security is in crisis is a Republican trap , ” Clinton said at this week ’s debate among Democratic candidates .
Currently , annual income up to $ 97,500 is subject to Social Security ’s 12.4 % tax , which is split between employers and employees .
Obama has not said how high he would place the cap .
The idea is less politically painful than alternative proposals to cut benefits , raise the retirement age or increase the Social Security tax rate .
At one point in early 2005 , even Bush said he might be willing to consider raising the income cap , to the consternation of many Republicans .
Advertisement
No candidate but Obama has put much emphasis on this issue .
But when asked at a recent debate , the other Democratic hopefuls , Clinton aside , indicated support for raising the income cap .
“ I do n’t understand why somebody who makes $ 50 million a year pays Social Security tax on the first $ 97,000 . . . and not all the rest , while somebody who makes $ 85,000 a year pays Social Security tax on every dime of their income , ” Edwards said .
Michael Steel , spokesman for Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee , said Democrats ’ willingness to seek tax hikes in an election year was a measure of how brimming with political confidence they are heading into 2008 .
“ They are possibly overconfident , ” Steel said .
“ Apparently , after only one or two major tax increases in the past 25 years , they do n’t remember what a salient issue this is . ”

Seriously , just because something online confirms your own viewpoint or prejudices or whatnot , it does not mean it 's true .
Skepticism is a virtue .
Now the right - wingers are laughing at the gullibility of those who recommend Maccabee 's diaries .
And they are quite justified in doing so .
Tiny copper structures with pores at both the nanometer and micron size scales could play a key role in the next generation of detonators used to improve the reliability , reduce the size and lower the cost of certain military munitions .
Developed by a team of scientists from the Georgia Tech Research Institute ( GTRI ) and the Indian Head Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center , the highly - uniform copper structures will be incorporated into integrated circuits -- then chemically converted to millimeter - diameter explosives .
Because they can be integrated into standard microelectronics fabrication processes , the copper materials will enable micro-electromechanical ( MEMS ) fuzes for military munitions to be mass - produced like computer chips .
" An ability to tailor the porosity and structural integrity of the explosive precursor material is a combination we 've never had before , " said Jason Nadler , a GTRI research engineer .
" We can start with the Navy 's requirements for the material and design structures that are able to meet those requirements .
We can have an integrated design tool able to develop a whole range of explosive precursors on different size scales . "
Nadler uses a variety of templates , including microspheres and woven fabrics , to create regular patterns in copper oxide paste whose viscosity is controlled by the addition of polymers .
He then thermochemically removes the template and converts the resulting copper oxide structures to pure metal , retaining the patterns imparted by the template .
The size of the pores can be controlled by using different templates and by varying the processing conditions .
So far , he 's made copper structures with channel sizes as small as a few microns -- with structural components that have nanoscale pores .
Based on feedback from the Navy scientists , Nadler can tweak the structures to help optimize the overall device -- known as a fuze -- which controls when and where a munition will explode .
advertisement
" We are now able to link structural characteristics to performance , " Nadler noted .
" We can produce a technically advanced material that can be tailored to the thermodynamics and kinetics that are needed using modeling techniques . "
Beyond the fabrication techniques , Nadler developed characterization and modeling techniques to help understand and control the fabrication process for the unique copper structures , which may also have commercial applications .
The copper precursor developed in GTRI is a significant improvement over the copper foam material that Indian Head had previously been evaluating .
Produced with a sintered powder process , the foam was fragile and non-uniform , meaning Navy scientists could n't precisely predict reliability or how much explosive would be created in each micro-detonator .
" GTRI has been able to provide us with material that has well - controlled and well - known characteristics , " said Michael Beggans , a scientist in the Energetics Technology Department of the Indian Head Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center .
" Having this material allows us to determine the amount of explosive that can be formed in the MEMS fuze .
The size of that charge also determines the size and operation of the other components . "
The research will lead to a detonator with enhanced capabilities .
" The long - term goal of the MEMS Fuze program is to produce a low - cost , highly - reliable detonator with built - in safe and arm capabilities in an extremely small package that would allow the smallest weapons in the Navy to be as safe and reliable as the largest , " Beggans explained .
advertisement
Reducing the size of the fuze is part of a long - term strategy toward smarter weapons intended to reduce the risk of collateral damage .
That will be possible , in part , because hundreds of fuzes , each about a centimeter square , can be fabricated simultaneously using techniques developed by the microelectronics industry .
" Today , everything is becoming smaller , consuming less power and offering more functionality , " Beggans added .
" When you hear that a weapon is ' smart , ' it 's really all about the fuze .
The fuze is ' smart ' in that it knows the exact environment that the weapon needs to be in , and detonates it at the right time .
The MEMS fuze would provide ' smart ' functionality in medium - caliber and sub-munitions , improving results and reducing collateral damage . "
Development and implementation of the new fuze will also have environmental and safety benefits .
" Practical implementation of this technology will enable the military to reduce the quantity of sensitive primary explosives in each weapon by at least two orders of magnitude , " said Gerald R. Laib , senior explosives applications scientist at Indian Head and inventor of the MEMS Fuze concept .
" This development will also vastly reduce the use of toxic heavy metals and waste products , and increase the safety of weapon production by removing the need for handling bulk quantities of sensitive primary explosives . "
The next step will be for Indian Head to integrate all the components of the fuze into the smallest possible package -- and then begin producing the device in large quantities .
A specialist in metallic and ceramic cellular materials , Nadler said the challenge of the project was creating structures porous enough to be chemically converted in a consistent way -- while retaining sufficient mechanical strength to withstand processing and remain stable in finished devices .
" The ability to design things on multiple size scales at the same time is very important , " he added .
" Designing materials on the nano - scale , micron - scale and even the millimeter - scale simultaneously as a system is very powerful and challenging .
When these different length scales are available , a whole new world of capabilities opens up . "
Back in the 1970s , Richard Nixon decided to solve the inflation crisis by arbitrarily freezing wages and prices .
Today , President Bush will announce a plan to address the subprime mortgage crisis that pretty much does the same thing with interest rates :
President Bush will announce this afternoon an agreement with major mortgage firms to freeze interest rates for five years for financially troubled homeowners — a plan advocates say will help forestall a major foreclosure crisis but some conservatives say amounts to a bailout of people who made bad financial decisions .
The plan would apply to homeowners who got adjustable - rate subprime mortgages between Jan. 1 , 2005 , and July 31 of this year and are facing a sharp jump in their rates before July 31 , 2010 .
It would also offer to put them on a fast track to refinance their mortgages through lenders or through state and local housing authorities , according to several people briefed on the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal has not been officially announced .
Eligible homeowners are those with enough income to pay their mortgages at lower rates but not so wealthy that they could afford the increase in monthly payments .
The plan would be offered only to people who live in their homes , an effort to exclude real estate investors and speculators .
This is a bad idea on so many levels it ’s hard to know where to begin .
As I ’ve noted before , a large share of the blame for the what ’s happened in the subprime mortgage field specifically , and real estate in general , can be narrowed down to two things .
First , for far too long Americans believed not only that housing prices would continue to rise , but that they would continue to rise at the rates that , in retrospect , were clearly historical aberrations .
Second , and partially because of the irrational exuberance in the housing market , individual homeowners were purchasing homes they could n’t afford and entering into loan transactions that , frankly , were unwise .
When the housing bubble popped , it ’s no surprise at all that people who were living on the edge to begin with starting falling into default and , eventually , foreclosure .
Now that the economic chickens have come home to roost , Bush wants to re-write the rules .
Some people , it seems , are noticing :
Darren McKinney , 48 , a renter in the District , said he has been waiting for housing prices to fall so he can buy a condo without resorting to a dubious loan .
He turned down an opportunity to buy his 600 - square - foot apartment for $ 310,000 in late 2004 because he thought it was “ absurdly overpriced . ”
Now the government is rewarding people who made irresponsible decisions and bought homes beyond their means , he said .
“ There are those of us who purposely sat on the sidelines during the course of the last three years while the senseless frenzy was going on , and we presumed the free market would be allowed to correct itself , ” McKinney said .
“ The government is now meddling in the market and looking to prop up lenders and borrowers alike , and those of us who wisely bided our time get screwed . ”
You and the economy , sir .
Iran has denied its nuclear work is intended to develop weapons
The five permanent UN Security Council members and Germany said they would wait until they saw reports from the UN and EU before drafting a resolution .
Tehran denies Western accusations that it is trying to build a nuclear weapon .
On Tuesday , Iran 's president said the sanctions were " illegal " in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said the debate over his country 's nuclear programme was " closed " and that the issue was now in the hands of the UN 's nuclear watchdog .
The International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) recently reached agreement with Tehran on a " work plan " to resolve outstanding questions about its nuclear activities .
' Compromise '
In the joint statement issued after meeting in New York , the representatives of the six countries - the US , UK , France , China , Russia and Germany - welcomed the IAEA 's agreement with Iran .
" We call upon Iran , however , to produce tangible results rapidly and effectively by clarifying all outstanding issues and concerns on Iran 's nuclear programme , including topics which could have a military nuclear dimension , " the statement said .
Sanctions as a political tool for exerting pressure are ineffective in making Iran change its basically rational policy choice
Manouchehr Mottaki
Iranian foreign minister
The powers said they continued to be seriously concerned by the programme , but that they would delay any resolution until they received reports by IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei and EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana .
" We agree to finalise a text for a third UN Security Council sanctions resolution ... with the intention of bringing it to a vote in the UN Security Council unless the November reports of Dr Solana and Dr ElBaradei show a positive outcome of their efforts , " the statement said .
The ministers said they had also asked Mr Solana to meet Iran 's top nuclear negotiator , Ali Larijani , " to lay the foundation for future negotiations " .
Afterwards , French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said the meeting had been split between those countries pushing for negotiations and those wanting immediate sanctions .
" There is a compromise , but a good compromise , " he said .
" We are still working on sanctions . "
' Racing ahead '
The US Undersecretary of State , Nicholas Burns , said the joint statement sent a very tough and strict message to Iran .
He warned Iran was trying to accelerate its uranium enrichment programme , but said Washington was confident it would be reined in eventually .
" There is no question they 're racing ahead , " he told the BBC .
" The question is : can we find the right combination of pressure and diplomatic inducements , negotiations , to convince them that they'd be a lot better off if they would just stop this nuclear business and become a civilised member of the international community and a peaceful member of that community ? "
Earlier , the Iranian foreign minister , Manouchehr Mottaki , insisted tougher sanctions would not change his country 's nuclear programme .
" Sanctions as a political tool for exerting pressure are ineffective in making Iran change its basically rational policy choice , " he told the Asia Society in New York .
Big Brother Spying on Americans ' Internet Data ?
Whistleblower describes how AT&T allows U.S. to spy on customers ' Internet data .
Nov. 7 , 2007  --
It would be difficult to say whose e-mail , text messages or Internet phone calls the government is monitoring at any given time , but according to a former AT&T employee , the government has warrantless access to a great deal of Internet traffic should they care to take a peek .
As information is traded between users it flows also into a locked , secret room on the sixth floor of AT&T's San Francisco offices and other rooms around the country -- where the U.S. government can sift through and find the information it wants , former AT&T employee Mark Klein alleged Wednesday at a press conference on Capitol Hill .
" An exact copy of all Internet traffic that flowed through critical AT&T cables -- e-mails , documents , pictures , Web browsing , voice - over - Internet phone conversations , everything -- was being diverted to equipment inside the secret room , " he said .
Klein , who worked for more than 20 years as a technician at AT&T , said that the highly secretive electronics - focused National Security Agency began working with telecom companies to gain wholesale access to vast amounts of data traveling over the Internet .
Whistleblower : AT&T Allows U.S. to Spy on Internet Data
Klein was on Capitol Hill Wednesday attempting to convince lawmakers not to give a blanket , retroactive immunity to telecom companies for their secret cooperation with the government .
He said that as an AT&T technician overseeing Internet operations in San Francisco , he helped maintain optical splitters that diverted data en route to and from AT&T customers .
One day he found that the splitters were hard - wired into a secret room on the sixth floor .
Klein said only a management - level employee with NSA security clearance was allowed inside , but documents he obtained form AT&T showed that highly sophisticated data mining equipment was kept there .
Conversations he had with other technicians and the AT&T documents led Klein to believe there are 15 to 20 such sites nationwide , including in Seattle , Los Angeles , San Jose , San Diego and Atlanta , he said .
AT&T : Protecting Our Customers ' Privacy
AT&T and government lawyers have argued the documents Klein took are proprietary and have tried , as part of a class action filed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation in January 2006 , to reclaim them .
In doing so AT&T also verified their authenticity , EFF attorneys argued today .
AT&T spokesperson Susan Bean responded to inquiries about the lawsuit and the allegations by Klein in an e-mail statement today : " AT&T is fully committed to protecting our customers ' privacy .
We do not comment on matters of national security . "
A federal judge dismissed claims by government lawyers , who are arguing the case instead of AT&T because of national security implications , that the company is immune to lawsuit for the access to data they provided to the government .
An appeal of that order is pending and has temporarily halted the lawsuit .
But Congress is considering a proposal to grant retroactive , blanket immunity for telecom companies for their cooperation with the government as part of a bill that would revamp the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act and give government spy agencies more latitude in their information gathering .
The House of Representatives has so far rejected the immunity , but the Senate Intelligence Committee approved a bill last month that would allow it .
The Senate Judiciary Committee is set to consider that bill at a meeting Thursday .
Key Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee have expressed concern with any sort of immunity , but not dismissed it .
Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter , the ranking Republican on the committee , has suggested that Congress consider indemnifying telecom companies against damages .
" At least that would allow the lawsuit to go forward , " EFF attorney Kevin Bankston said today .
President Bush has said he will veto any bill that does not include the immunity for telecom companies .
When the New York Times reported in late 2005 on the warrantless domestic wiretapping program run by the NSA , Klein , who had recently retired from AT&T , said he became " frustrated . "
Klein linked up with the EFF in 2006 and is cooperating in their lawsuit .
' Wholesale , Dragnet Surveillance '
" Its not the way a warrant should work that you take everything and sift away what you do n't want , " Klein said .
" Wiretapping in the past has always been a retail operation as opposed to a wholesale one .
The government has had to determine who they want to target before they can target them , " Bankston said .
In May 2006 , Bush defended the NSA 's warrantless programs by saying the government was not mining for data and only targeting foreign terrorists and al Qaeda operatives .
" First , our international activities strictly target al Qaeda and their known affiliates .
Al Qaeda is our enemy , and we want to know their plans .
Second , the government does not listen to domestic phone calls without court approval , " he said .
" Third , the intelligence activities I authorized are lawful and have been briefed to appropriate members of Congress , both Republican and Democrat .
Fourth , the privacy of ordinary Americans is fiercely protected in all our activities .
We 're not mining or trolling through the personal lives of millions of innocent Americans .
Our efforts are focused on links to al Qaeda and their known affiliates .
So far we 've been very successful in preventing another attack on our soil , " he said .
But Brian Reid , a former Stanford electrical engineering professor who appeared with Klein , said the NSA would logically collect phone and Internet data simultaneously because of the way fiber optic cables are intertwined .
He said the way the system described by Klein suggests a " wholesale , dragnet surveillance . "
Bankston argued that simply by diverting the data , even if it did not look at specific messages , the government violates Fourth Amendment protections against search and seizure without probable cause .
Of the major telecom companies , only Qwest is known to have rejected government requests for access to data .

TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iran ’s president said on Sunday the publication of a U.S. intelligence report saying Iran had halted a nuclear weapons program in 2003 amounted to a “ declaration of surrender ” by Washington in its row with Tehran .

President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad also dismissed in an interview with state television the prospect of new U.N. sanctions against Iran over its refusal to halt sensitive atomic work .
“ It is too far - fetched , ” he said when asked whether he expected the U.N. Security Council to impose fresh sanctions on Iran following two such resolutions since last December .
Ahmadinejad , who often rails against the West , told a rally earlier this month that the December 3 publication of the U.S. National Intelligence Estimate was a “ victory ” for Iran .
He said on Sunday : “ It was in fact a declaration of surrender ...
It was a positive action by the U.S. administration to change their attitude and it was a correct move . ”
Washington is still pushing for more sanctions on Iran despite the U.S. intelligence report , which also said Tehran was continuing to master skills needed to make nuclear weapons .
U.S. President George W. Bush said Iran was still a danger .
An exiled opposition group , the National Council of Resistance of Iran ( NCRI ) , last week said Iran shut down its nuclear weapons program in 2003 but said restarted it a year later , dispersing equipment to thwart international inspectors .
Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and designed to make electricity .
It says it has never had a nuclear weapons program .
“ It would be beneficial for both Iran and them ( the West ) to cooperate with Iran , ” Ahmadinejad said .
“ Of course it would be more to their benefit than Iran’s . ”
Iran regularly calls for a change in behavior from the United States , which cut diplomatic ties with Iran in 1980 after radical students seized the U.S. embassy and took diplomats hostage during the 1979 Islamic revolution .

They say no volcanic explosion is imminent -- that already happened 642,000 years ago , creating the volcanic crater known as a caldera where part of Yellowstone Lake sits .
But satellite readings show just how volcanically active the area remains , the researchers reported in the journal Science .
From the middle of 2004 through 2006 , the floor of the caldera rose 7 inches at a rate of 2.8 inches a year -- the biggest rise ever measured , they reported .
“ There is no evidence of an imminent volcanic eruption or hydrothermal explosion .
That ’s the bottom line , ” University of Utah seismologist Robert Smith said in a statement .
“ A lot of calderas worldwide go up and down over decades without erupting . ”
Yellowstone is North America ’s largest volcanic field , produced by what is known as a hotspot , a plume of hot and molten rock squirting up from 400 miles beneath the planet ’s surface .
Monstrous eruptions took place there starting 2 million years ago but activity bubbles along much more calmly now -- akin to similar volcanic fields such as the Campi Flegrei just outside Naples in Italy .
Beneath the field lies what is known as a magma chamber , which is actually similar to a wet sponge in structure .
“ Our best evidence is that the crustal magma chamber is filling with molten rock , ” Smith said .
“ But we have no idea how long this process goes on before there either is an eruption or the inflow of molten rock stops and the caldera deflates again . ”
Heat from the chamber warms the park ’s hundreds of hot springs and geysers , including “ Old Faithful , ” perhaps the world ’s best - known geyser .
Established in 1872 as the first U.S. national park , Yellowstone also stretches to parts of Montana and Idaho .
Why are some parts of the world so rich and others so poor ?
Why did the Industrial Revolution — and the unprecedented economic growth that came with it — occur in eighteenth - century England , and not at some other time , or in some other place ?
Why did n’t industrialization make the whole world rich — and why did it make large parts of the world even poorer ?
In A Farewell to Alms , Gregory Clark tackles these profound questions and suggests a new and provocative way in which culture — not exploitation , geography , or resources — explains the wealth , and the poverty , of nations .
Countering the prevailing theory that the Industrial Revolution was sparked by the sudden development of stable political , legal , and economic institutions in seventeenth - century Europe , Clark shows that such institutions existed long before industrialization .
He argues instead that these institutions gradually led to deep cultural changes by encouraging people to abandon hunter - gatherer instincts - violence , impatience , and economy of effort - and adopt economic habits - hard work , rationality , and education .
The problem , Clark says , is that only societies that have long histories of settlement and security seem to develop the cultural characteristics and effective workforces that enable economic growth .
For the many societies that have not enjoyed long periods of stability , industrialization has not been a blessing .
Clark also dissects the notion , championed by Jared Diamond in Guns , Germs , and Steel , that natural endowments such as geography account for differences in the wealth of nations .
A brilliant and sobering challenge to the idea that poor societies can be economically developed through outside intervention , A Farewell to Alms may change the way global economic history is understood .
Gregory Clark is chair of the economics department at the University of California , Davis .
He has written widely about economic history .
" Right or wrong , or perhaps somewhere in between , Clark 's is about as stimulating an account of world economic history as one is likely to find .
Let 's hope that the human traits to which he attributes economic progress are acquired , not genetic , and that the countries that grow in population over the next 50 years turn out to be good at imparting them .
Alternatively , we can simply hope he 's wrong . "
— Benjamin M. Friedman , New York Times Book Review
" Clark 's idea - rich book may just prove to be the next blockbuster in economics .
He offers us a daring story of the economic foundations of good institutions and the climb out of recurring poverty .
We may not have cracked the mystery of human progress , but A Farewell to Alms brings us closer than before . "
— Tyler Cowen , New York Times
" [ C ] lark is very good at piecing together figures from here and there , including those from isolated groups of hunter - gatherers alive today .
He makes a plausible case for the basic pattern : for thousands of years before the Industrial Revolution , there was essentially no sustained improvement in mankind 's general material standard of living , nor was there much variation from place to place around the world .
The Industrial Revolution made all the difference . "
— Robert Solow , New York Review of Books
" A Farewell to Alms asks the right questions , and it is full of fascinating details , like the speed at which information traveled over two millennia ( prior to the 19th century , about one mile per hour ) .
Clark 's combination of passion and erudition makes his account engaging .
When a light bulb goes off in my head , the first thing I ask myself is ' Would this be interest if it were true ? '
Clark 's thesis definitely meets that test . "
— Samuel Bowles , Science
" Mr. Clark ... has produced a well written and thought - provoking thesis , refreshingly light on jargon and equations .
It could well be the subject of debate for years to come . "
— The Economist
" Gregory Clark 's A Farewell to Alms is fully as absorbing , as memorable and as well written as [ Jared ]
Diamond 's remarkable bestseller .
It deserves to be as widely read .... [ A ] ny book that is as bold , as fascinating , as conscientiously argued and as politically incorrect as this one demands to be read . "
— Clive Crook , Financial Times
" Obviously , we¹ve got a controversial argument here .
But Clark makes a compelling case for the idea that the fruits of industrialization were open to all societies , but only a handful seized the moment . "
— William R. Wineke , The Wisconsin State Journal
" Gregory Clark 's new book A Farewell to Alms is an investigation of both our nasty , brutish , and short past and our more prosperous present .
Mr. Clark first makes the case that we owe our current prosperity to the gifts of the Industrial Revolution .
He then attempts to explain why that revolution happened in 18th - century England . "
— Edward Glaeser , New York Sun
" Economic history often conjures images of musty tomes , bygone eras that no one knows about and in general , scholarship that is dry and difficult to relate to .
Gregory Clark 's new book A Farewell to Alms conveys a different image .
Offering a sweep of history from the border between antiquity and the medieval age , the book is an attempt at tackling grand themes . "
— Siddharth Singh , LiveMint
" For a novel and somewhat dispiriting theory of economic divergence , read A Farewell to Alms , published this year , by Gregory Clark of the University of California at Davis .
He does n't accept the view , common among the utopians , that natural endowments like soil and water explain why rich nations are 50 times as prosperous as poor ones .
How can differences in natural resources possibly explain Zimbabwe 's misery or Singapore 's wealth ?
Clark amasses an extraordinary collection of historical data to explain why the Industrial Revolution was born in western Europe , not Africa or India . "
— William Baldwin , Forbes
" Clark 's ferociously systematic expounding of an alternative to the institutional explanation does ... provide many delightful insights , large and small , along the way .
Some of the observations in this very well - written book do make for nice dinner party anecdotes . "
— Harold James , The American Interest
" Comes now Gregory Clark , an economist who interestingly takes the side of culture .
In an important new book , A Farewell to Alms Clark suggests that much of the world 's remaining poverty is semi-permanent .
Modern technology and management are widely available , but many societies can't take advantage because their values and social organization are antagonistic .
Prescribing economically sensible policies ( open markets , secure property rights , sound money ) can't overcome this bedrock resistance . "
— Robert Samuelson , The Washington Post
" A Farewell to Alms is a brave new work , rich in both detailed facts and big ideas .
Clark clears away much of the tangled brush of theories of long - term economic growth that have grown up in recent decades .
This is the most ambitious and far - reaching book on long - term economic history to appear in many years , perhaps since Jared Diamond 's Guns , Germs , and Steel . " — Jack A. Goldstone , World Economics
" Clark 's book A Farewell to Alms is . . .
Ambitious , staking out an entire vision of world history .
. . .
Clark 's Malthusian model is forcefully argued . "
— Roger Gathman , Austin American - Statesman
" [ T ] he author 's engaging style and ( relatively ) jargon - free descriptions of the economic principles in play before , during , and after the Industrial Revolution in England turn this rich and detailed account into more of a sprint than a slog .
. . .
Whatever your reaction to this decidedly un -PC take on economic aid , [ A Farewell to Alms ] serves as a useful explanation of how we got where we are today and a reminder that new approaches are needed to close the yawning gap between the world 's richest and poorest societies . "

" Clark adds substantively to an understanding of perhaps the important questions of this — or any — era : what makes economies grow , and why have some not experienced any success at all ?.... Alms is provocative , authoritative , insightful , readable , well documented , and an inescapable detour for anyone wanting to tackle economic growth and development topics and enter into these conversations . "
— A. R. Sanderson , Choice
" Gregory Clark has written a fascinating book which is chock - full of insight and ideas .
Clark paints on a big canvas and his deft handling of the puzzles and counterintuitive outcomes is delicious .

We are indebted to him for revealing more of them in such an electrifying fashion . "
— Ian R. Harper , The Melbourne Review
" [ A Farewell to Alms ] is one of the most fascinating , and the most disturbing , historical works I have read .
It seems to suggest that the gross inequality of our world has less to do with the inherent unfairness of global capitalism and more with scarcely ineradicable cultural difference .
. . . [ T ] his is economic history as you never read it before . "
— A.N. Wilson , The Daily Telegraph
" Why do some nations get rich while others stay poor ?
What are the conditions that allow an economy to take off and grow ?
These questions have puzzled economists for many years .
But no explanation is more startling than the one proposed by Gregory Clark in his book A Farewell to Alms . "
— Ross Gittins , Sydney Morning Herald
" This is a fine book , bristling with interesting data and opinions , more extensive than this review can possibly convey .
Readily accessible to non-fiction readers , this book should fire more debate about a historical episode of unfailing fascination . "
— Michael G. Sargent , Interdisciplinary Science Reviews
" This is . . . a remarkable book , with an unerring focus on the fundamentals of the Malthusian economy and the large - scale economic trends .
It is a unique source of factual information , beautifully presented in almost 200 tables and figures , and will make an excellent textbook for college - level courses of history and economics . "
— Gerhard Meisenberg , Journal of Biosocial Science
" [ P ] erhaps there is no higher praise for an author than to say that I disagreed with the arguments but liked the book .
It made me think in new ways about the course of economic history .
I recommend the book to anyone with an interest in the economic history of the world . "

Rick Szostak , New Global Studies
" I derived enormous stimulation from this book .
At a superficial level , Clark offers a richly documented picture of England 's economic history , put into perspective by comparisons with other parts of Europe and with the Far East , and sometimes even by references to amazing facts about ancient forager societies .
. . .
More fundamentally , the layman gets a good understanding here of what made for the Industrial Revolution and how its preconditions evolved in England over a period of centuries .
Clark accuses economists of being undereducated about history .
This will be somewhat remedied if they read his provocative book . "
— Wolfgang Kasper , Policy
" As a self - proclaimed exercise in ' big history ' this work succeeds extraordinarily well : it is engaging and readable , and it renders abstruse economic models and empirical results accessible to nonspecialists . "

" A Farewell to Alms is . . . worth scrutinizing .
The book offers a distinct line of thought on evolutionary affairs .
It is also valuable in historiographical terms as it recalls historical explanation forsaken due to shifting scholarly fashions . "

" Gregory Clark has written a stimulating , provocative , witty , and ambitious book .
It is accessible to the uninitiated and a pleasure to read .

" What caused the Industrial Revolution ?
Gregory Clark has a brilliant and fascinating explanation for this event which permanently changed the life of humankind after 100,000 years of stagnation . "
— George Akerlof , Nobel Laureate in Economics and Koshland Professor of Economics , University of California , Berkeley
" This is a very important book .
Gregory Clark argues that the Industrial Revolution was the gradual but inevitable result of a kind of natural selection during the harsh struggle for existence in the pre-industrial era , in which economically successful families were also more reproductively successful .
They transmitted to their descendants , culturally and perhaps genetically , such productive attitudes as foresight , thrift , and devotion to hard work .
This audacious thesis , which dismisses rival explanations in terms of prior ideological , technological , or institutional revolutions , will be debated by historians for many years to come . "
— Paul Seabright , author of The Company of Strangers : A Natural History of Economic Life
" Challenging the prevailing wisdom that institutions explain why some societies become rich , Gregory Clark 's " A Farewell to Alms " will appeal to a broad audience .
I can think of nothing else like it . "
— Philip T. Hoffman , author of Growth in a Traditional Society
" You may not always agree with Gregory Clark , but he will capture your attention , make you think , and make you reconsider .
He is a provocative and imaginative scholar and a true original .
As an economic historian , he engages with economists in general ; as an economist , he is parsimonious with high - tech algebra and unnecessarily complex models .
Occam would approve . "
— Cormac Ó Gráda , author of Jewish Ireland in the Age of Joyce
" This should rapidly become a standard work on the history of economic development .
It should start whole industries trying to test , refine , and refute its explanations .
And Gregory Clark 's views on the economic merits of imperialism and the fact that labor gained the most from industrialization will infuriate all the right people . "
— Eric L. Jones , author of Cultures Merging and The European Miracle
" While many books on the Industrial Revolution tend to focus narrowly either on the event itself , or on one explanation for it , Gregory Clark does neither .
He takes an extremely long - run view , covering significant periods before and after the Industrial Revolution , without getting bogged down in long or detailed exposition .
This is an extremely important contribution to the subject . "

~~ Al Gore
No entity in this once - proud nation is more corrupt than its shallow , hubris - infested media .
Any pricks of conscience the media may have felt for covering up the treasonous seizure of the 2000 election were swept away in the swirl of terror following the attack on 9 - 11 .
The " big story " to confront George Bush when he returned from his month - long vacation in September 2001 , his approval numbers tanking , was that Al Gore got more votes than any Democrat in US history -- nearly a half - million more than Bush .
It was that five conservative Supreme Court judges stopped the vote count that would prove Gore won because , in their unsigned decision , they wrote such a democratic win would cause " public acceptance , " which would " cast a cloud over Bush 's legitimacy " and thus harm " democratic stability . "
Into the Abyss
The election coup was a shot across the bow of democracy , a power seizure orchestrated by the ever - present , hands - on man who leaves no fingerprints , James Baker III , and carried out by mob leader John Bolton .
Luckily for Bush , he blundered into 9 - 11 and managed to hit the trifecta before the papers managed to hit the newsstands .
And , thanks to the media and its burgeoning power to manipulate citizen opinion and form legislative attitudes , Bush demanded -- and was given -- a license to kill .
The beast was loosed .
The last seven years have been a hell of a ride for Bush , Dick Cheney and their toady media -- continuous , absurd politicking for the next election , blood - gushing adventure abroad and a Constitution - shredding free - for - all at home .
Power is a heady thing , and they grow more powerful and immoral with each lie they tell , each freedom they destroy , each crime they cover up .
For the rest of us , those years have just been hell .
Like our fellow Americans in New Orleans caught up in the despair of waiting for help that will never come , we remain mired in a Samuel Beckett wasteland , waiting for our own " Godot " to return and claim what is rightfully his .
Rightfully ours .
Our rights , our freedoms , our civil liberties -- our government .
Gore tested the water in 2004 , and the media met him head - on , fangs bared , in a concerted effort to ridicule and destroy him and to keep their corporate benefactors and war profiteers in office .
From the New York Times to the Washington Times to the Los Angeles Times the message to Gore was the same -- get lost .
Over at CNN , Paula Zahn and Judy Woodruff each did an " exclusive " interview with Gore .
Each pointed out how popular and wonderful Bush is ; each asked Gore virtually the same question -- " Do you really think YOU can win ? "
Each looked at Gore in stunned amazement , and Woodruff even added in her intensely oh - so - blonde bewildered way ( eyes wide , hands spread ) --
" People are saying that nobody out there likes you , even the leaders of your own party .
Given that ( you 're such a ridiculously low lying slimeball ) -- what makes you think you can win ...? "
People are saying .
Should anyone doubt who those " people " are , during the same period , CNN 's Suzanne Malvoux opined to then morning anchor Soledad O'Brien , " There 's a connection between Bush 43 and the public -- it 's a comfort level ... Bush has a glow about him . "
O'Brien announced a bit later , as if noticing it herself , " Bush seems to have a glow about him . "
Later , Woodruff credited Malvoux with reporting earlier that " Bush is so relaxed , he has a glow about him . "
Later in the day , Wolf Blitzer commented , " Some people are saying that Bush has a glow about him ... "
Gore was determined that the election be more than some " media " people saying he is boring , he is fat , he is a liar .
He knew that Bush , if forced to address the issues facing this country , if forced to explain the disconnect between his words and actions , explain to Americans why their civil rights were being desecrated in the name of freedom , explain how a " man of God " could morph so effortlessly into an " Angel of Death , " he could not -- and should not -- survive .
So Gore withdrew , hoping to set the stage if not for Bush 's defeat , at least for him having to answer some critical questions about this nation 's economy , its domestic chaos , and the pathological lies that took this nation into a bloody , senseless war .
Going Quickly , Alone
That did n't happen .
So Gore set out to continue his lifelong quest of awakening the world 's population to the reality of global warming .
In spite of the media 's vicious efforts to discredit him , Gore soared to new heights of credibility with his book , " An Inconvenient Truth , " published concurrently in May 2006 with the documentary film of the same title .
The film , by far the most popular at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival , was mocked at home but received well - deserved acclaim in foreign media and captured not one , but two Academy Awards .
It went on to become the fourth - highest - grossing documentary in US history .
The New York Times ' Michiko Kakutani did review Gore 's book , pointing out that it was " largely free of the New Age psychobabble and A - student grandiosity that rumbled through " his 1992 book , " Earth in the Balance . "
Kakutani reminded readers that Poppy Bush had earlier dismissed Gore as " Ozone Man , " but conceded that Gore 's " passionate warnings about climate change seem increasingly prescient , " and that his " wonky fascination with policy minutiae has been tamed in these pages ... "
Finally , while noting that Gore wrote the Introduction for ( 1994 reprint ) Rachel Carson 's " Silent Spring , " Kakutani wrapped it up by sneering that Gore " is n't a scientist like Carson and does n't possess her literary gifts , " and accused Gore of writing " as a popularizer of other people 's research and ideas . "
Perhaps if Kakutani had known that , just 18 months later , Gore and the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) would be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for " their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about manmade climate change , and to lay the foundations ... to counteract such change , " she might have mentioned that the premise of Gore 's book was clearly that global warming is not just about science nor is it just a political issue .
It is a moral issue and we -- all of us -- have a responsibility to do something about it .
Gore 's " Inconvenient Truth " is , as Kafka wrote , " the axe for the frozen sea inside us . "
Al Gore is a " larger than party " guy , and stands head and shoulders above the hypocritical Bush clones in both parties who are flip - flopping all over the campaign trail .
Since 2000 , he has wielded that axe again and again via op - eds , speeches and face - to - face interaction with the people -- a wake - up call to resist the imposition of tyranny by the powerful .
As early as 2003 Gore was ahead of the pack , warning Americans about the loss of civil liberties , unwarranted searches and seizures , and illegal surveillance .
In a September 2005 speech in San Francisco , a heartbroken Gore spoke of the morality -- or lack of it -- in the Bush administration 's belated response to the victims of Hurricane Katrina .
Do n't point fingers -- do n't hold us accountable -- appeared to be the only plan in place to deal with catastrophe .
However , " When the corpses of American citizens are floating in toxic floodwaters five days after a hurricane strikes , " Gore said , " it is time not only to repond directly to the victims ... but to hold the processes of our nation accountable , and the leaders of our nation accountable ... "
Gore had personally responded to the tragedy by arranging to have 270 evacuees airlifted on two separate flights from New Orleans to Tennessee .
He agreed to pay $ 50,000 for each flight , recruited doctors and cut through government red tape to allow the planes to land in New Orleans .
The media did not mention this act of courage and compassion , perhaps because Bush had not yet arrived for his belated flyover and cathedral photo - op where spotlights cast a glow about him .
Going Far Together -- Quickly
For millions of us who wait for Gore , each day begins anew , with hope that he will return -- yet each night ends in despair because he did not .
We have hope because we know that each step Gore has taken in his entire career -- representative , senator , vice president and , yes , president -- has been forward .
The grassroots movement to draft Gore is spreading across the nation , and will continue unless Gore himself says " Stop ! "
To date , he has not done so .
Perhaps that is because he knows -- as do we -- that both the earth and our democracy are teetering on the brink of disaster , and their restoration depends entirely upon the person occupying the Oval Office .
We have hope because we read his explosive new book , " The Assault on Reason , " wherein he exposes the Bush administration for what it is -- traitorous .
Gore wrote more than once in his book , " Where there is no vision , the people perish . "
Gore shares the vision of the Founders that we are a government of laws , not of men .
He warns that a " president who breaks the law is a threat to the very structure of our government . "
Gore is a Tom Paine , a Paul Revere , who tells us -- " It is time now for us to recover our moral health in America and stand again for freedom , demand accountability for poor decisions , missed judgments , lack of planning , lack of preparation , and willful denial of the obvious truth about serious and imminent threats that are facing the American people . "
Al Gore is for the people who are rising to the challenge of restoring democracy .
He is of the people who long to " rekindle the true spirit of America . "
And Gore will be re-elected by the people -- because he is the last Founder standing .

She is a regular contributor for a variety of Internet sites .
This is a guest post by Benjamen Ober , a student at Duke University in the Terry Sanford Institute for Public Policy .
Tim Shingara does not look like a man you would expect to be working for the Pennsylvania State Police ( PSP ) .
His shoulder - length hair , thick mustache , tight black t- shirt , torn jeans and intense stare exude the image of a motor - head , not a radio - telecommunications specialist lab technician , specializing in advanced radar operations .
Shingara probably looks the part of a Harley enthusiast because he is a Harley enthusiast .
He is a police lab technician by day and a husband , father and biker by night .
This more or less average guy ’s world was turned upside - down as he was thrust into the midst of a Pennsylvania State Police corruption scandal dubbed “ Radargate ” by watchdog groups .
J. Michael Sheldon ’s Lucky Find
Radargate and Shingara ’s uphill battle against the PSP began on November 29 , 2002 .
Ironically , Shingara himself had nothing do to with the beginning of the fiasco .
On that Friday evening , the day after Thanksgiving , Brent Hanlin was hurrying to his father ’s hunting cabin in Perry County , Pennsylvania .
It was getting late , and Hanlin wanted to get settled in for the weekend before rifle season opened on Monday morning .
He was traveling northeast along PA route 533 in his 1994 VW Jetta .
Ominous rain clouds darkened the sky and the road was already slick from earlier showers .
To make matters worse for Hanlin , the lights on his VW dashboard had been flickering on and off for weeks and finally decided to die , making it difficult to gauge his speed .
As Hanlin passed an intersection , a State Police patrol car began trailing him from a distance .
Hanlin noted the patrol car , but continued on without a second thought — he was the type of guy to drive 43 in a 45 zone “ just to be safe . ”
Minutes later , the Trooper turned on his flashing lights and Hanlin realized that he was being pulled over .
The encounter that ensued was not pretty .
Hanlin was informed by PSP Trooper Gregory Styers that he was driving in excess of seventy miles per hour .
“ Impossible , ” thought Hanlin .
Sure , Hanlin , might have been speeding .
He could not exactly tell because his darkened dashboard .
But seventy miles per hour ?
Fat chance .
He curtly informed the Trooper that he was mistaken .
The situation got worse when Hanlin could not produce either a registration or proof of insurance .
Styers decided to detain Hanlin for the evening for a traffic violation and resisting arrest .
Hanlin hired prominent local attorney J. Michael Sheldon to represent him in court .
Hanlin insisted that he was going forty - five miles per hour at the most .
“ Sure , ” thought Sheldon , “ that ’s what they all say . ”
While driving home from his office , Sheldon was suddenly struck by a new thought : maybe it was impossible to hit seventy on the stretch where Hanlin was pulled - over , especially given the road conditions in a 1994 Jetta .
Sheldon visited the scene and determined that it was unlikely that Hanlin could have reached seventy miles per hour .
On a flier , he contacted PSP headquarters and asked to speak with their lab expert on radar gun performance .
Enter Tim Shingara .
Shingara was the local expert identified by the State Police for Sheldon to interview .
Sheldon quickly discovered that he hit a legal jackpot .
Shingara openly admitted that State Police radar guns are unreliable .
Internal memos noted problems with the radar guns , especially the Genesis model guns , as early as 2002 .
On August 2 , 2003 , Corporal William LaTorre officially filed a memo to his superior noting that everything he aimed the gun at was registering seventy - eight miles per hour — including inanimate objects .
A tree , rock , road , sky and moving car all registered seventy - eight .
Six months later , Sergeant Thomas Decker reported a similar problem to his commanding officer .
According to Sgt. Decker , the Genesis gun would suddenly jump from the mid-fifties to the low - eighties without cause .
Later , even after Radargate broke in Philadelphia and Harrisburg newspapers , field officers were reporting problems with the Genesis guns .
Shingara was subpoenaed as an expert witness in Hanlin ’s case .
According to Shingara ’s testimony , the Genesis radar gun registered an “ alternator whining ” when plugged into a Trooper ’s vehicle .
Under intense electrical strain , such as the use of a radar gun , the alternator runs constantly in an effort to recharge the car battery .
The constant running of the alternator produces an electrical disturbance that is captured by the Genesis gun .
Out of the alternator whining , Radargate was born .
Institutional Failure
Radargate was potentially explosive for PSP .
The costs would be extraordinary , both in public - image and sheer economic terms .
The State Police own nearly one thousand radar guns , more than half of which are the Genesis model , produced by Decatur Electronics .
Internal records show that State Troopers use radar guns in roughly eighty - seven percent of speeding tickets .
Records , do not , however , indicate which radar gun was used for issuance of each ticket .
Thus , no one truly knows how many of the PA State Police issued tickets might be invalidated if the Genesis model is proven inaccurate .
Since the first internal memos filed by Troopers in late 2002 , motorists have been issued approximately two hundred thousand tickets — incurring total fines of more than fifteen million dollars .
The contracting arrangements between Decatur and the State Police are baffling at best .
Decatur was chosen and the Genesis model selected because Decatur was the lowest - bidder for the radar contract .
This is hardly atypical , as it is normal for state government agencies to award contracts to the lowest bidders .
Shingara ’s attorney Don Bailey thinks the problem is that government agencies such as PSP have budgetary pressures in conflict with public safety concerns .
Bailey bluntly stated in an interview , “ The Genesis II gun was a cheap gun . ”
At the same time as Decatur ’s radar gun bid , Ford Motors was contracted in early 2002 to supply new squadron cars for PSP .
The “ cost - effective ” Crown Vic model was chosen , in spite of its low battery power .
The Governor ’s Office was thrilled with Ford ’s Crown Vic bid , as PSP was saving the state thousands of dollars .
For most cars , battery drain is a relatively minor problem , but squadron cars generally run a radio unit , laptop , lights , A/C , cell phone charger , and radar gun simultaneously .
Drain on the battery can have dangerous consequences , such as stalling in the middle of traffic .
The government mismanagement of Radargate goes even deeper .
Decatur Electronics acknowledged the problems in the Genesis model and recommended an easy solution to State Police brass .
Decatur offered to fix all of the Genesis guns for free , absorbing a loss of thirty thousand dollars .
Decatur was hoping to avoid public embarrassment and loss of reputation in the market .
They could offer a solution and save face , as no one would blame Decatur for not predicting how the Genesis model would interact with future car models .
PSP , however , turned down Decatur ’s offer to fix all of the units for free .
According to Shingara ’s lawyer , Don Bailey , the higher - ups of the State Police wanted to cover up any wrongdoing .
If the State Police were found guilty of using faulty radar , the “ implications [ would be ] enormous and quite significant cost wise , ” said Bailey .
The Governor ’s office would inevitably respond by distancing themselves from the top officials in the Police Department .
In all likelihood , the administrative officials at the helm of the State Police would lose their jobs — and potentially jeopardize their mandatory service for the State pension plan .
Bailey , never a man to mince words , candidly asserts , “ The reason for any kind of a cover - up of a bureaucratic mistake of any kind is very simple : careers are on the line … gotta get my career , my pension , gotta get outta here sorta thing …
They were willing to let bad tickets be written … Probably the leadership at the top of the State Police does n’t want to write bad tickets .
It ’s not that they want to do that or get any pleasure out of it .
But the issue is , ‘ How is my career going to be affected ? ’ ”
According to Bailey , the institutional pressure of budget politics and lack of government oversight created circumstances that lead to the organizational panic in which the police turned down Decatur ’s simple , free , and easy solution in favor of a cover-up .
Part of the cover - up , in Bailey ’s eyes , was a phony study on the accuracy of the Genesis radar gun .
In response to Shingara ’s testimony in the Hanlin case , the State Police commissioned a study on Genesis radar guns performed through a lab at the University of Pittsburgh .
After the study was concluded , the State Police issued multiple press releases indicating that the radar guns had proven consistent and trustworthy beyond a shadow of a doubt .
This seemed to assuage the public , as most citizens and media outlets were willing to accept these conclusions .
Unfortunately , it appears that State Police leaders were fudging the truth .
Professor Marlin Mickle , the lead experimenter at the University of Pittsburgh , was unavailable for comment in this article , but has elsewhere claimed that the tests conducted in his department were neither conclusive nor aimed at gauging radar accuracy under field conditions .
Mickle says that the tests reflect Genesis radar performance in the laboratory , but the accuracy results do not necessarily transfer to the real world .
When subpoenaed by Bailey , Mickle claimed that the State Police had not provided him any background on the on - going legal battle , nor suggested a field test versus a laboratory test .
At any rate , police officials could breath a sigh of relief , as the momentary scandal of Radargate had passed .
PSP Retaliation
When the dust had cleared from the Mickle study and the public was placated , PSP turned its sights on Shingara , according to Bailey .
Shingara was removed from radar detail , which was both a financial blow and a slap in the face professionally .
Shingara was denied additional assignments at work , meaning that he went to work for months with absolutely nothing to do .
In Bailey ’s experience , this is a common tactic of PSP officials to isolated and control whistleblowers ( public employees who speak out against corruption or malpractice from within the department ) .
Over the next several months , it became increasingly clear to Shingara that he needed legal representation , prompting him to hire Bailey to sue PSP for unlawful retribution .
In addition to being removed from radar detail and assigned no work , Shingara complained of other retaliatory measures , such as withheld promotions and subjugation to “ an unfair internal investigation , ” according to the lawsuit .
Ultimately , Shingara claimed that the police were looking for an opportunity to fire him .
Bailey built a case focused on First Amendment violations by the State Police , which was subsequently filed in the U.S. Third Circuit .
According to Bailey , Shingara ’s case is a clear - cut example of First Amendment violation in the workplace .
Shingara observed a problem in PSP that defrauded the public and compromised the integrity of the State Police .
When J. Michael Shelton subpoenaed him , Shingara testified to problems within PSP .
In an interview , Bailey was quick to point out that Shingara had no economic motive for testifying against PSP .
Shingara was not guilty of libel , as both internal memorandums and independent studies have vindicated his version of Radargate .
While Radargate was being argued at the Third Circuit ( spring 2005 ) , a related civil rights battle raged in the U.S. Supreme Court .
Garcetti v Ceballos worked its way through the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and was finally argued by the Supreme Court in October 2005 .
The majority opinion by Justice Anthony Kennedy ( joined by Roberts , Scalia , Thomas , and Alito ) ruled , “ Statements made by public employees pursuant to their official duties are not protected by the First Amendment from employer discipline . ”
Richard Ceballos , the defendant in Garcetti , had a very simple analysis : “ I think government employees will be more inclined to keep quiet [ about corruption ] . ”
New Dilemma of State Employees
In lieu of Radargate and the Garcetti ruling , police officers in PSP ( and government employees in general ) are caught in a bind .
In Radargate , for instance , Shingara ’s initial report to his superiors was co-authored or verified by at least nine other communications specialists .
None of these nine men and women , however , have come forward to corroborate Shingara ’s testimony .
That is hardly surprising given the financial and professional repercussions reaped by Shingara .
The State Police have made an example of Shingara — “ This is what happens to those who break rank and speak out against the State Police . ”
As if that were not incentive enough to keep quiet about government corruption or malpractice , the Supreme Court has removed even whistleblower protection from state employees .
In the case of Shingara v Skiles et al , the State Police holds all the cards .
Institutionally , not many people testify against the State Police because of its reputation and power .
PSP is a powerful and influential lobby in Pennsylvania , as evidenced by their Commissioner ’s seat on the Governor ’s cabinet .
The sheer disparity of power and funds for waging expensive legal battles creates a strong disincentive for insiders to exposure government corruption .
PSP officials have virtually unlimited resources in terms of legal counsel .
They have a special task force that specializes in handling the legal defense of PSP .
Should these lawyers not have enough time or expertise to handle a specific case , it is not uncommon for the State Police to hire outside law firms to run the case .
Conversely , Tim Shingara , although not a poor man , is severely limited in his funds to pay for lawyers .
Ironically , his salary as a lab technician was slashed by virtue of his removal from the radar detail and from other special assignments , the very sort of retributive action that led him to sue PSP .
Fortunately for Shingara , he has enough money to put up a fight as a radio - telecommunications specialist , unlike many of the young Troopers in the force .
Bailey claims that PSP also has an advantage in terms of public perception .
Shingara is fighting against image of the State Police .
There is , according to Bailey , a tendency among the general public to view the law enforcement in almost binary terms .
The police are the good guys and the accused are the bad guys .
It would be impossible for individuals in the State Police , especially high - ranking officers , to be guilty of a systematic cover - up , even in a situation like faulty radar guns .
Looking Ahead
In the grand scheme of things , malfunctioning radar guns are not that important .
After all , the cover - up could be for something much greater , like murder , money laundering , drug running , political corruption , or the like .
The troubling fact is that , if Shingara and Bailey are correct , the State Police officials had the desire , ability , and organization to pull a cover - up , even on a relatively minor issue .
According to Bailey , the current legal climate ( especially post - Garcetti ) provides further incentive for public officials to keep silence .
The question raised by Bailey is this :
Who will speak out against government abuse if not government insiders ?
As a State Police officer , Shingara is legally forbidden to speak with any member of the media under the threat of being fired .
PSP was unavailable for comment on this article .
The University of Pittsburgh also refused to given comment on their study of the Genesis II gun and PSP interpretation of the study .
Decatur likewise declined to comment on the accuracy of the Genesis II radar guns .
Radargate thus moves quietly toward its undecided , but impending legal conclusion .
In July 2005 , the U.S. Third Circuit Court ruled against Shingara .
The Third Circuit determined that there was not enough evidence of retribution by PSP .
Shingara and Bailey are currently fighting through the appeal process .
The Third Circuit Court of Appeals will soon decide whether or not they will hear the case .
Regardless of the decision in the Court of Appeals , the losing side will inevitably appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court for final mediation .
Shingara v Skiles et al would be an opportunity for the Court to revisit Garcetti .
In light of the outcry by civil rights groups and Congress alike , it is conceivable that the Court will vote to reverse Garcetti .
The fates of Tim Shingara , PSP officials , and potentially millions of future whistleblowers thus await judgment .

The New York Times , which claims to draw a clear distinction between its news articles and its commentary articles , dropped any pretense of such a distinction in its minimalist " coverage " of yesterday 's dramatic effort by Rep. Dennis Kucinich to force the House to consider the impeachment of Vice President Dick Cheney .
In a small 230 - word piece on Kucinich 's privilege motion , and the subsequent vote to send his H Res. 333 , now called H. Res. 799 , to the House Judiciary Committee , after it has been consigned to limbo for over 6 months by the House leadership , the Times succeeded in dissing both Kucinich and the notion of impeaching the vice president .
As the anonymous Times reporter wrote in the lead of this hit piece :
It is hard to know which effort has longer odds , the bid by Representative Dennis J. Kucinich , Democrat of Ohio , to become president of the United State , or his bid to unseat Vice President Dick Cheney by impeaching him .
The rest of the article , which made no attempt to lay out Kucinich 's blistering expose of the vice president 's criminal role in presenting false evidence to the Congress and American people to justify an invasion of Iraq , and his condemnation of the vice president for the international crime of threatening war against Iran , is spent describing how House Democratic leaders and Republicans sparred over Kucinich 's bill , with Republicans helping to defeat a Democratic effort to table it , and with Democrats then pushing it off the floor and over to the Judiciary Committee .
On 9/11 anniversary , Fox ' debunks conspiracy theories once and for all '

On the morning of the sixth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks , Fox News Channel 's Fox and Friends sought to ' debunk ' conspiracy theories about the tragedy with the help of guest James Meigs , editor - in - chief of Popular Mechanics magazine .
" Still many crazy conspiracy theories , " said host Steve Doocy , adding that Meigs was there to " debunk all of those 9/11 myths once and for all . "
Doocy later yelled out " Rosie ! " as co-host Alisyn Camerota led into a question about theories endorsed by celebrities such as former View castmember O'Donnell , actor Charlie Sheen , and director David Lynch .
" Rosie [ O ' Donnell ] is one that pops in mind , " said Camerota , summarizing one conspiracy position about the World Trade Center 's collapse as " fire ca n't melt steel so the towers must not have fallen just because planes flew into them . "
" What we 've done in three years at Popular Mechanics of looking into these theories is try to find the facts that the conspiracy theorists themselves cite as evidence of their claims , " said Meigs .
" In this case they say that because steel melts at about 2,700 degrees and jet fuel only burns at about 1,500 degrees ... but when you talk to engineers , what you see is that steel does n't have to melt to fail . "
" So there you go , Rosie , " Doocy said .
" Hope you 're watching . "
Meigs also weighed in on other disputed events of that day , saying that WTC 7 , a building that some say was the target of a purposeful demolition on Sept. 11 , collapsed only after sustaining serious damage from the falling towers .
As for United Flight 93 , which crashed in Pennsylvania , Meigs says there is no evidence the plane was shot down , as others have theorized .
" Everybody has the right to be skeptical , " Meigs said , [ But ] there 's a lot of people with political agendas who 've driven some of these things and provided a lot of these theories in the first place . "
Meigs has been previously criticized as someone " whose scientific expertise stretches as far as being the editor of Video Review and Entertainment Weekly , " by controversial documentary filmmaker and radio host Alex Jones .
The following video is from Fox 's Fox & Friends , broadcast on September 11 .

One of the most critical matters facing Congress is the need to enact long - term legislation updating our nation ’s foreign intelligence surveillance laws .
Intercepting the communications of terrorists and other intelligence targets has given us crucial insights into the intentions of our adversaries and has helped us to detect and prevent terrorist attacks .
Until recently , our surveillance efforts were hampered by the unintended consequences of an outdated law , the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , which was enacted in 1978 to establish a system of judicial approval for certain intelligence surveillance activities in the United States .
The requirement that a judge issue an order before communications can be intercepted serves important purposes when the target of the surveillance is a person in our country , where constitutional privacy interests are most significant .
The problem , however , was that FISA increasingly had come to apply to the interception of communications of terrorists and other intelligence targets located overseas .
In FISA , Congress had embedded the crucial distinction between whether targets are inside or outside our country , but did so using terms based on the technology as it existed then .
However , revolutionary changes in communications technology in the intervening years have resulted in FISA applying more frequently to surveillance directed at targets overseas .
The increased volume of applications for judicial orders under FISA impaired our ability to collect critical intelligence , with little if any corresponding benefit to the privacy of people in the U.S .
This summer , Congress responded by passing the Protect America Act .
That law , passed with significant bipartisan support , authorized intelligence agencies to conduct surveillance targeting people overseas without court approval , but it retained FISA ’s requirement that a court order be obtained to conduct electronic surveillance directed at people in the United States .
As J. Michael McConnell , the director of national intelligence , stated , the new law closed dangerous gaps that had developed in our intelligence collection .
Congress , however , set the act to expire on Feb. 1 , 2008 .
It therefore is vital that Congress put surveillance of terrorists and other intelligence targets located overseas on surer institutional footing .
The Senate Intelligence Committee has crafted a bill that would largely accomplish that objective .
Recognizing the uncommon complexity of this area of the law , the committee held numerous hearings on the need to modernize FISA , received classified briefings on how various options would affect intelligence operations and discussed key provisions with intelligence professionals and with national security lawyers inside and outside government .
This thorough process produced a balanced bill approved by an overwhelming , and bipartisan , 13 - 2 vote .
The Senate Intelligence Committee ’s bill is not perfect , and it contains provisions that I hope will be improved .
However , it would achieve two important objectives .
First , it would keep the intelligence gaps closed by ensuring that individual court orders are not required to direct surveillance at foreign targets overseas .
Second , it would provide protections from lawsuits for telecommunications companies that have been sued simply because they are believed to have assisted our intelligence agencies after the 9/11 attacks .
The bill does not , as some have suggested , provide blanket immunity for those companies .
Instead , a lawsuit would be dismissed only in cases in which the attorney general certified to the court either that a company did not provide assistance to the government or that a company had received a written request indicating that the activity was authorized by the president and determined to be lawful .
It is unfair to force such companies to face the possibility of massive judgments and litigation costs , and allowing these lawsuits to proceed also risks disclosure of our country ’s intelligence capabilities to our enemies .
Moreover , in the future we will need the full - hearted help of private companies in our intelligence activities ; we cannot expect such cooperation to be forthcoming if we do not support companies that have helped us in the past .
The bill that came out of the Senate Intelligence Committee was carefully crafted and is a good starting point for legislation .
Unfortunately , there are two other versions of the bill being considered that do not accomplish the two key objectives .
The House of Representatives recently passed a version that would significantly weaken the Protect America
Act by , among other things , requiring individual court orders to target people overseas in order to acquire certain types of foreign intelligence information .
Similarly , the Senate Judiciary Committee made significant amendments to the Senate Intelligence Committee ’s bill that would have the collective effect of weakening the government ’s ability to effectively surveil intelligence targets abroad .
Moreover , neither the House bill nor the Senate Judiciary Committee ’s version addresses protection for companies that face massive liability .
Both the Senate Judiciary Committee amendments and the House bill passed largely on party lines , and the full Senate will be debating this issue shortly .
Congress must choose how to correct critical shortcomings in our foreign intelligence surveillance laws .
It is a time for urgency : The Protect America
Act expires in just two months , and we cannot afford to allow dangerous gaps in our intelligence capabilities to reopen .
But this is also a time of opportunity , when we can set aside political differences to develop a long - term , bipartisan solution to widely recognized deficiencies in our national security laws .
When Congress returns to this challenge , it should continue on the course charted by the Senate Intelligence Committee .

Two - thirds of NYU students polled said that they would give up their right to vote for a year ’s tuition and twenty percent would sell for an IPod .
According to the Politico :
66 percent said they ’d forfeit their vote for a free ride to NYU .
And half said they ’d give up the right to vote forever for $ 1 million .
But they also overwhelmingly lauded the importance of voting .
Ninety percent of the students who said they ’d give up their vote for the money also said they consider voting “ very important ” or “ somewhat important ” ; only 10 percent said it was “ not important . ”
I have found the same response around the country when I speak to colleges .
I often ask college audiences whether they would sell me their first amendment rights for $ 100,000 — they overwhelmingly say that they would take the offer .
Constitutional rights are an abstraction to most Americans while the monetary offer is concrete and tangible .
This is why running for office on fear is always better than civil liberties .
Fear is more tangible in terms of a terrorist attack on a city or a plane .
Civil liberties are a mere abstraction .
Votings is even more difficult for students to value since few elections turn on a small number of votes , particularly in national elections .
A rational actor can easily conclude that tuition is a far greater value than a vote that will only contribute to the often large margin of victory or loss in a given election .
The reason for voting is not that it actually makes a difference , but because it constitutes a civic duty regardless of its impact .
Public schools have largely abandoned civil values as a subject , however .
Students today are raised as citizens in a largely market and consumer driven mentality .
It is no surprise therefore that they would make the efficient , wealth maximizing choice over the civic - oriented , collective choice .

NEW YORK , United States —
The bulldozing of a Baha 'i cemetery in Iran last week is the latest in a series of incidents in a government - led campaign of hatred against Baha 'is .
The destruction of the cemetery by individuals using heavy equipment occurred between 9 September and 10 September near Najafabad , on the outskirts of Isfahan .
What happened there is nearly identical to what happened in July in Yazd , where another Baha 'i cemetery was extensively damaged by earth - moving equipment .
The list of anti-Baha 'i incidents is growing , as are human rights violations against other groups in Iran .
In Najafabad , a few days before the destruction of more than 100 Baha 'i graves , threatening letters were delivered to some 30 Baha 'i families .
In May , in Mazandaran province , the unoccupied homes of six Iranian Baha 'is were set on fire .
In June , in Abadeh , vandals wrote hateful graffiti on Baha 'i houses and shops .
Since May , Baha 'is in at least 17 towns have been detained for interrogation .
Six new arrests have been reported .
In Kermanshah , a 70 - year - old man was sentenced to 70 lashes and a year in prison for " propagating and spreading Bahaism and the defamation of the pure Imams . "
In Mazandaran , a court has once again ruled against three women and a man who are charged with " propagation on behalf of an organization which is anti-Islamic . "
All these events are results of the Iranian government 's long campaign to incite hatred against Baha 'is , a spokeswoman for the Baha'i International Community said today .
" This should be a cause for concern among human rights activists everywhere , " said Diane Ala'i , the representative of the Baha'i International Community to the United Nations in Geneva .
She appealed to the world to hold the Iranian government accountable for its actions and to help prevent the situation from deteriorating into further violence .
Baha 'is in Iran number about 300,000 and represent the largest religious minority in the country .
" Put in a historical context , these kinds of attacks too often have been a prelude to campaigns of oppression and violence that are far worse .
" While some of these incidents may seem to be minor , the fact that such events are increasingly commonplace and reported as occurring in virtually every region of Iran shows that the persecution of Baha 'is remains official government policy , and therefore is something for which Iran must be held accountable , " she said .
" The graffiti in Abadeh included slogans such as ' Death to Baha 'is , the mercenaries of America and England , ' ' Hezbollah despises the Baha'is , ' ' Baha 'is - mercenaries of Israel ' and ' Baha 'is are unclean ' - phrases that relate directly to government propaganda that has been disseminated in Iranian news media in recent years , " Ms. Ala 'i said .
She noted that other groups in Iran are also suffering human - rights violations .
" In recent months , the Iranian authorities have been carrying out a widespread crackdown on civil society , targeting academics , women 's rights activists , students , and journalists , " said Ms. Ala'i .
Among the anti-Baha 'i incidents reported in recent months are the following :
-- On 19 June 2007 , a report was received that a 70 - year - old man of limited means had been arrested in April 2007 in Kermanshah .
Authorities charged him with the possession of three Baha'i CDs .
He was tried on 23 April 2007 and charged with " propagating and spreading Bahaism and the defamation of the pure Imams . "
His lawyer was given only 10 minutes to prepare a defense .
Although the verdict has not been published , the judge orally sentenced him to one year in prison , which he is currently serving , and 70 lashes .
The latter part of the sentence has not yet been carried out .
-- On 18 June 2007 , a 34 - year - old man was arrested at a hardware store in Tabriz where he worked and taken to an unknown location .
Two days later , he succeeded in phoning his family to let them know he was alive .
A police security agent contacted Baha 'is in Tabriz and said some of the man 's neighbors who are members of the Basiji morality squads had alleged that he had insulted Islam .
His family managed to visit him and reported that he had been subjected to a two - day interrogation .
He remains in custody .
-- On 28 May 2007 , a husband and wife in Abadeh , near Shiraz , were arrested in their home by agents of the Information Ministry .
The agents seized books , family videos , photographs , CDs , telephone directories , documents , a cellular phone , a computer , and minutes of the meetings of the small group of Baha 'is that coordinates the affairs of the local community on an ad hoc basis .
The couple were interrogated about the activities of the Baha'is .
The wife was released after eight hours ; the husband was transferred to Shiraz , where he was held in prison until 29 June 2007 and released on bail .
He is charged with teaching the Baha'i Faith .
-- On 8 May 2007 , the provincial court of appeal of Mazandaran denied the appeal of three women and one man who were arrested in 2005 in Ghaem Shahr and charged with " propagation on behalf of an organization which is anti-Islamic . "
The case has been referred to the Supreme Court .
All are out on bail .
( Original court document in Persian ; English translation . )
-- On 25 April 2007 , the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Sari sentenced a Baha'i to a year in prison and four years of exile to the town of Bijar .
The individual was charged with " teaching activities against the system of the Islamic Republic of Iran for the benefit of groups and various organizations opposing the system . "
-- During April and May 2007 , a number of Baha 'is were summoned for interrogation or were questioned by telephone by officials of the Ministry of Information or the police in various localities , including in Babolsar , Bandar Abbas , Bandar Torkman , Bojourd , Gilavand , Damavand , Hamedan , Karaj , Lahijan , Shahinshar , Tehran , and Yaftabad .
The questioning focused on seeking information about Baha'i activities and about the Baha 'is themselves .
A report has been received that a bank in central Jiruft in the province of Fars had been ordered to produce a printout of all accounts held by Baha 'is .
-- The Baha'i International Community received a copy of a letter from the government agency responsible for providing veteran 's benefits stating that an individual Baha'i , who suffered extensive disability following his incarceration as a prisoner of war in the Iran - Iraq conflict , was not eligible to pension benefits because he belongs " to the Bahaist sect . "
( Original government letter in Persian ; English translation . )
-- Attacks on the Baha'i Faith continue in the mass media , including on the Internet .
Newspapers in Khorasan and Mazandaran have recently published items maligning Baha'is , while anti-Baha 'i pamphlets and tracts have been distributed in Shiraz and in the schools in Shahinshar , Ahvazk , and Babol Sar .
-- Reports have been received of banks refusing to grant loans and officials refusing to issue or renew business licenses solely on the grounds that the applicants were Baha'is .
In Sanandaj , a bank official stated that the bank had received 14 loan applications from Baha 'is , all of which will be rejected .
Bank staff in Sari informed Baha 'is who had applied for a loan , " It has been asked of us not to provide loans and other services to Baha 'is . "
-- In Hamadan , the owner of a grocery store that had been operated by his family for 48 years tried to have the business license transferred to his name after the death of his father .
He was told by a government official that business licenses for grocery stores would not be issued to Baha 'is .
He was told : " Wherever you go , even to the United Nations , you will end up here , where you will get the same clear answer . "
WASHINGTON — Astonishingly , 26 Republican senators broke with President Bush ’s Iraq policy last week .
But you may not have noticed this , and it ’s not your fault .
Sen .
Joe Biden ’s resolution calling for a federal solution to the Iraq mess — sometimes known as “ soft partition ” — got almost no attention even though it passed 75 - 23 .
There seems to be far more interest in how fundraising is going for Hillary Clinton , Barack Obama and John Edwards .
The vote on Biden ’s proposal to devolve power to Iraq ’s regions and three major groups could turn out to be a milestone in the effort to end the war .
It was also a reflection of how much Republican frustration there is with the Iraqi government and the direction of President Bush ’s policy .
From the beginning , Bush has insisted that Iraq ’s current crop of politicians could broker peace among Shiites , Sunnis and Kurds , and make a strong central government work .
But that idea is increasingly implausible .
The administration ’s deeds ( as opposed to its words ) are a tacit admission of failure .
Bush ’s claims for the success of his troop surge rest in large part on the alliance between American troops and Sunni sheiks in Anbar province in the battle against al - Qaida in Iraq .
Yet this bottom - up side deal has nothing to do with a strong central government , and may actually work against it .
In an interview , Biden said he was not surprised that so many Republicans backed his nonbinding resolution .
He believes that there are “ not a dozen Republicans ” who still think privately that “ an American presence in Iraq will maintain a strong central government . ”
The biggest problem with federalism — Biden rejects the term “ partition , ” believing that a weaker central government is the only way to maintain even a semblance of unity in Iraq — is that Iraqis themselves have not yet come around to the idea .
Over the weekend the Iraqi government forcefully condemned the Senate ’s action .
Partition or decentralization will not easily be imposed by the United States , or even by a concert of allies .
This does not deter Biden , who on Monday joined his co-sponsor , Sen. Sam Brownback , R - Kan. , in asking for a meeting with Bush on the resolution .
Biden insists that the logic of decentralization is gaining ground among Iraqis , despite what their government is saying , and cites an encounter with a prominent Sunni leader during a recent visit to Iraq .
Shortly after publicly criticizing Biden ’s decentralization proposals , this leader told Biden privately : “ My heart is at war with my head . ”
Biden said the Iraqi saw decentralization as the only practical way out of the current chaos .
The official added : “ I need time to convince my people . ”
Biden ’s clarity stands as a challenge not only to Bush , but also to Clinton , Obama and Edwards .
At a debate last week , each of them refused to pledge that American troops would be out of Iraq even by the end of her or his first term .
If the troops will still be there , what strategy would they be advancing ?
If not federalism or “ soft partition , ” what ?
Clinton , by the way , voted for the Biden resolution , while Obama missed the vote .
Will federalism be Clinton ’s approach , too ?
And if Biden is creating pressure on the front - runners from one direction , Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico is beginning to gain traction on the left with his commitment to withdrawing all troops “ in six to eight months , ” as he wrote last month in The Washington Post .
It ’s surprising that Richardson , whose domestic views are by most conventional reckonings to the “ right ” of much of the field , could ever become the left ’s favorite .
But he has risen in the polls in Iowa and New Hampshire , partly because of effective early advertising , and may now have a chance to catch on with anti-war voters .
John Nichols , one of the left ’s shrewdest electoral analysts , argued in the Oct. 8 issue of The Nation that “ The Richardson Surge ” would make it difficult for the front - runners “ to continue dancing around the core questions of the war . ”
The leading Democratic candidates might well argue that Bush has made such a mess of Iraq that the seemingly crisp and clean solutions on offer from Biden and Richardson simply are n’t workable .
But there is no getting around how important Iraq is to so many Democratic primary voters .
They are looking for well - defined alternatives to Bush ’s recipe for troop commitments as far as the eye can see .
Biden and Richardson are trying to fight their way into contention by offering very different visions of a future that might allow us to leave .

Did Unbudging Texas Bureaucrats Kill a Man ? Court Told Condemned Man : Sorry , We 're Closing
The state of Texas executed death row inmate Michael Richard because the court responsible for his sentence was unwilling to remain open an additional 20 minutes to receive a petition for a stay on his execution .
Business hours were to be respected , and Richard was killed , on schedule , by lethal injection .
This is becoming a serious problem ( and it ’s also quite an interesting national news story , for any reporters out there ) .
I ’ve gotten reports over the years that our blog has been blocked in numerous locations around the country ( O’ Hare ) and world ( China ) because we are , supposedly , a porn site .
This has happened in numerous airports , to me and my readers , and the most recent report is from a Marriott hotel in Park Ridge , New Jersey .
In that instance , the hotel computer in the business center reportedly blocked access to AMERICAblog , explaining that the site contained the word “ lesbian . ”
Andrew Sullivan ’s blog , which contained the word “ gay , ” was not blocked , per my reader .
( I also received a report the other day that a DOD computer was blocking AMERICAblog as well ) .
[ Let ’s put aside for a moment that for years Marriott has had no problem selling porn to its hotel customers .
Maybe they think we ’re competition . ]
In some cases , I suspect that these Internet filters at workplaces may be blocking blogs in general by blocking the Google Blogger address ( blogspot.com ) that many blogs use .
But in our case , I know for a fact that we ’re being banned by some of these filters because we report on gay issues – I personally witnessed one computer in an airport tell me that our site was a “ porn ” site and thus banned .
Other than gay issues , what political issue do we write about that could be perceived as “ porn ” ?
As an aside , I wonder to what degree these filters are still banning discussions of breast cancer ( they have before ) and other topics that should be totally acceptable at a Marriott or an airport .
Or to what degree they ’re banning one political party more than the other ?
This is the kind of issue that our gay groups should be jumping on .
It ’s the kind of issue that does n’t just affect our blog , it affects every Web site that every writes about gays and lesbians .
And it does so in a way that most of will never even know that it ’s being done , and in a way that we can never even hope to resolve since the services are so veiled in how they do what they do , and since there are so many of them .
Kind of begs for federal regulation to guarantee free speech .
It ’s also an issue that could adversely affect the discussion of Democratic politics online , to the extent that these companies have any political allegiances .
Democrats , are you listening ?
Girl Born With 4 Arms , 4 Legs Has Successful Surgery More than 30 surgeons successfully removed Lakshmi Tatma 's extra arms and legs .
NEW DELHI , India , Nov. 7 , 2007  --
In the desperately poor corner of Bihar , India , she was a miracle .
Tiny Lakshmi Tatma was born two years ago with four arms and four legs .
The local population considered her the manifestation of a goddess .
Her parents named her after the four - armed Hindu goddess of wealth .
A local circus even tried to buy her , but her parents chose health over fame and asked a team of doctors to remove her extra limbs .
The surgery , conducted in Bangalore , ended successfully this afternoon .
" The child has withstood the procedure in an excellent manner , " Dr. Sharan Patil , the team leader who planned the surgery for more than a month , told reporters outside the Sparsh Hospital .
" This girl can now lead as good a life as anyone else . "
It took more than 30 surgeons 27 hours to not only remove two of Lakshmi 's arms and two of her legs but also to rebuild much of her body and save her organs .
They say the chances of death were as high as 25 percent .
The cost of such a complex procedure would have been $ 625,000 , far too great for the Lakshmi 's family to afford .
The hospital 's foundation paid .
" We are very grateful to all the doctors for seeing our plight and deciding to help us , " Tatma 's father , Shambhu , told The Associated Press .
The doctors " worked relentlessly through the night to make the operation successful , " Patil said , adding there had been " no setback at any stage of the surgery . "
Half a Twin
Lakshmi is essentially one half of a conjoined twin without a living sibling .
Her condition is called ischiopagus .
In the womb , a " parasitic twin " stopped developing , but Lakshmi absorbed its arms and legs , its kidneys , its stomach and chest cavities as well as a series of nerves .
The surgery removed the extra body parts and unfused Lakshmi 's spine from her twin's .
To rebuild her pelvis , surgeons used tissue from the twin .
And to save her kidney , doctors said , they had to remove it from the " parasitic abdomen " and move it into Lakshmi 's own abdomen .
She may still need more surgeries .
Conjoined twins occur in about one in every 200,000 births , and their survival rate can be as low as 5 percent .
Lakshmi could not stand up or walk , but her doctors say that may now change .
" There 's no reason why we cannot rehabilitate her , get her back on her feet as soon as possible , " Patil told ABC News via phone from Bangalore .
She immediately won the hospital staff over .
" She 's a very cute girl , " spokeswoman Dr. Patil Mamatha told the AP .
" She 's very playful and gets along well with others . "
Lakshmi will stay in the hospital under a ventilator for at least the next two days .
As for how she will be treated after that , she may no longer be considered divine .
" All this expenditure , " her father told the AP , " has happened to make her normal . "
Now , he said , " it will be great to see our daughter have a normal body . "
And he hopes Lakshmi will soon have a healthy sibling .
Her mother is pregnant .
He said if Wright lost " it might mean the end of criticising companies ' products and services online " , as " any company will be able to demand that people 's criticisms of them be deleted off websites , and if they do n't comply they 'll sue " .
Amanda Stickley , a senior law lecturer at the Queensland University of Technology , said if 2 Clix won there would be severe consequences for website operators as they would have to be " very vigilant in checking material on the website and remove anything that could cause injury to someone 's business reputation " .
In a statement of claim filed with the Supreme Court of Queensland , 2 Clix said the comments , published in two threads between between late last year and July this year , led it to sustain " a severe downturn in monthly sales " .
It specifically referenced more than 30 comments by Whirlpool users , many strongly advising people to avoid the software at all costs and complaining that advertised features were not actually available in the product .
One of the comments cited by 2 Clix read : " The software became such a problem that we threw it out recently ...
We stuck with it for over two years but in the end the many hundreds of lost hours of work and high stress levels was not worth it . "
2 Clix claimed the statements were both false and malicious , and said it contacted Whirlpool about the matter this year but Whirlpool refused to take the forum threads down .
Wright did not respond to requests for comment , while a 2 Clix spokesman this morning declined to comment .
But Stickley said it would be very difficult for 2 Clix to successfully sue Wright for injurious falsehood over comments made by Whirlpool users .
It would have to prove the statements were false , that they were made in malice , that 2 Clix actually suffered damage in the form of monetary loss and , critically , that Wright had intended to cause 2 Clix monetary loss by allowing the material to remain on the website .
" I do n't think you could actually prove that for a web operator , that they personally intended the damage because of their malicious intention , especially when it 's posted by a third party that they 've got no relationship to , " Stickley said .
But Whirlpool is n't taking any chances , asking its users in a statement published on the website to " refrain from doing anything that might expose Simon to contempt of court such as making statements that prejudge the outcome of the case " .
The statement said Whirlpool , which has more than 180,000 registered users , believed the case was without merit and that it would " defend the matter vigorously , despite being a community website with little resources " .
Whirlpool users have already begun donating money to the site to help Wright cover any legal costs .
Some claim to have donated more than $ 1000 through Paypal .

Congressional efforts to take care of sick Ground Zero workers hit a snag Tuesday when a powerful Republican insisted it ’s New York ’s problem alone .
California Rep. Darrell Issa , in refusing to send more money New York ’s way , insisted the planes that struck the twin towers were n’t weapons .
" It simply was an aircraft , residue of two aircraft , and residue from the materials used to build this building , " Issa said during a hearing into whether a new 9/11 victims ’ compensation fund should be launched .
An astounded Michael Cardozo , Mayor Bloomberg ’s corporation counsel , who was testifying before the panel said : " This was an attack , I believe , on the United States of America . "
" It was located at Ground Zero , but it was an attack on America , " Cardozo repeated .
Rep. Anthony Weiner ( D - Brooklyn / Queens ) rushed to note that Issa backed original 9/11 funding .
" The gentleman voted for it because we had the national sense that this was not an attack on New York City , this was an attack on our country , " Weiner barked .

Venezuela 's student opposition confounds Chavez Most do n't oppose the president , just his constitutional reforms on Sunday 's national ballot

CARACAS , VENEZUELA — Eschewing revolutionary rhetoric and wearing Gap and Tommy Hilfiger T - shirts to their protests , members of Venezuela 's student opposition hardly fit the stereotype of campus rabble - rousers .
But in the run-up to Sunday 's referendum on constitutional changes , tens of thousands of university students have taken to the streets and emerged as the oil - rich country 's leading voices of dissent .
Claiming that the 69 amendments on the ballot would give too much power to President Hugo Chavez — who is accelerating his efforts to turn Venezuela socialist — the students have led nationwide marches urging voters to reject the referendum .
Along the way , they have given a boost to the political opposition , which is on an eight - year losing streak at the ballot box .
" The students will be a huge help in building an alternative , " said Leopoldo Lopez , the opposition mayor of the wealthy Caracas municipality of Chacao .
" This is a revolutionary government , but one that does n't have the students on its side . "
But just how far the movement can go is unclear , said Carlos Correa , a leading human rights activist in Caracas .
The students can't replace political parties in the task of organizing communities and grooming candidates , he said , and the breaks between college semesters can halt their momentum .
What 's more , students , like the rest of Venezuelans , are deeply divided over Chavez .
' We now have rights '
His government has spent huge sums of petrodollars on literacy campaigns , adult education classes and so - called " Bolivarian ' ' universities that have opened their doors to people who can't pay the tuition at traditional colleges .
These newly minted working - class scholars vigorously support Chavez and the referendum .
" Before , we lived in darkness , but under Chavez we now have rights , " said Isaur Mota , 48 , a janitor and father of five who studies law at a Bolivarian university .
The opposition students , he said , live in a bubble .
On several occasions in the past month , pro- and anti-government students have clashed in the streets of Caracas and other cities , leaving several people injured .
Yon Goicoechea , one of the main leaders of the opposition students , said he has received death threats on his cell phone .
Student rebelliousness
For the most part , however , the marches have been peaceful .
After nearly nine years in office , Chavez and his allies have managed to control or co-opt most of Venezuela 's institutions , according to many analysts .
Two major exceptions are the Roman Catholic Church and the universities .
Students have consistently elected anti-Chavez or independent representatives in their internal university elections .
Antonio Cova , a sociology professor at the sprawling Central University of Venezuela in Caracas , attributes this resistance to " the innate rebellion of students who never want to be aligned with any government . "
University students have a long history of protesting against the government , but were largely dormant during the early Chavez years .
That changed this spring when thousands took to the streets to protest the government 's decision to cancel the broadcast license of RCTV , the nation 's most popular independent television station , whose newscasts were sharply critical of the president .
Chavez accused the station of supporting a 2002 coup that briefly removed him from office .
But the government 's action against the station was widely criticized as a blow to press freedom .
Although the constitutional changes on Sunday 's ballot would have relatively little impact on universities , they would open the door for Chavez to run for re-election indefinitely and would expand his powers over the economy , the military and the political system .
" I'm a journalism student , " said Freddy Ramos , as he led a protest march through an upper - class Caracas neighborhood .
" It 's my future that they 're playing with . "
Chavez has described the student protesters as spoiled rich kids doing the bidding of their reactionary parents .
In fact , the opposition students come from a wide variety of backgrounds , and they are hardly dupes of Venezuela 's much - maligned and sometimes disloyal political opposition .
Students on sidelines
For years , anti-Chavez politicians bickered among themselves , supported coups and strikes designed to bring him down and boycotted elections .
But the students were not involved in these events .
They recognized Chavez as Venezuela 's legitimate leader and even praised some of his welfare programs .
" We have no plans to try to bring down Chavez , " said Goicoechea , 23 , a law student who heads Venezuela 's student parliament .
" We 're just protecting our rights . "

The Kaloko dam in Hawaii stood 116 years – until last year when it collapsed after heavy rains , killing seven .
Potential disaster was averted in April in Hollis , N.H. , when a dozen families were evacuated and engineers made a controlled breach of an old pond dam to keep it from failing .
Such incidents are warning signs that many of the nation 's more than 87,000 dams are in need of repair .
Last month 's high - profile collapse of the I - 35 bridge in Minneapolis focused America 's attention on bridge problems .
The nation 's dams are worse off .
In 2005 , the last time the American Society of Civil Engineers rated America 's infrastructure , bridges received a " C " grade ; dams earned a " D . "
Even that rating may be generous , a Monitor analysis of dam - inspection data shows .
Since 1999 , the number of " high - hazard " dams rated " deficient " has more than doubled , according to data from the Association of State Dam Safety Officials ( ASDSO ) in Lexington , Ky. High - hazard dams are those whose failures could cause fatalities .
In 1999 , the US had 546 such dams rated deficient .
By last year , it had 1,333 .
A second category of " significant - hazard " dams ( so - called because they threaten substantial property loss ) saw a rise from 339 to 949 deficient dams over the same period .
In all , 2.6 percent of the nation 's dams are deficient , according to the ASDSO .
" The growth of deficient high - hazard dams in this country is a major issue , " says Brad Larossi , legislative chairman for the ASDSO , which represents dam - safety inspectors in all states .
" The trend is rising at such a steep slope , much faster than states can do [ dam ] rehabilitation .
Without question the overall trends are clear . "
Several factors are behind the rise .
Old dams continue to deteriorate or may fail suddenly because of inadequate spillways and trees growing on dams .
Many states do n't have enough dam engineers to keep up proper maintenance , causing the repair backlog to grow .
And as more homes and businesses are built closer to dams , the hazards increase , a phenomenon dam - safety experts call " hazard creep . "
Some experts claim that some of the rise is due to better reporting , an encouraging sign .
" To be frank , there 's been in the past a reluctance in some quarters to identify too many dams as deficient , " says Mark Ogden , administrator for dam - safety engineering at the Ohio Department of Natural Resources in Columbus .
" But there 's also been a strong effort by our association to increase awareness of this problem .
We all are realizing we need an honest assessment . "
Some states are seeing a faster rise in deficient dams than others .
Pennsylvania leads the pack with 215 deficient high - hazard dams , 172 more than in 1999 .
Not far behind is Ohio , with an increase of 158 .
Other states , such as Colorado , New Jersey , and California have seen declines .
Some of that is due to better funding , experts say .
All three have boosted dam budgets by a third or more since 1999 .
Those increases are in contrast to federal dam spending .
The nation 's dam - safety program , which helps fund safety inspector and engineer training , has not been fully funded in at least five years , Mr. Larossi says .
Actual funding is about $ 5.9 million , well below the $ 9 million budgeted , he says .
As a result , the number of full - time inspectors has not increased since 1997 ( excluding Florida , which claims to have hired 45 inspectors ) .
That leaves each inspector responsible for about 195 dams on average ; the ASDSO recommends no more than 50 .
" We have seen increased awareness over the importance of adequate funding for state inspectors , but these offices are still understaffed , " says Stephanie Lindloff , of American Rivers , an environmental group .
Well , I ’ve gotten a dismissive review in the NYT .
It ’s sort of a tradition .
After all , The Great Unraveling received an equally dismissive review from Peter Beinart , in which he portrayed my conclusion that the Bush administration deliberately misled us into war as a crazy conspiracy theory , and contained this immortal pronouncement :
But most Americans do not consider the Bush administration corrupt , and Paul Krugman cannot convincingly prove it is .
I think David Kennedy ’s review will hold up about as well as Peter Beinart ’s .
I presented facts on voting behavior , which point to the centrality of race — he ignores them .
I presented polling evidence about the timing and role of the perception that Democrats are weak on national security ; he just waves it away .
Oh , and when Kennedy says , to illustrate my alleged factual problems , that
Kansas , whatever its other crimes and misdemeanors , is not customarily regarded as the birthplace of Prohibition
you have to ask who ’s got the factual problems .
I do n’t know what “ customarily regarded ” means , but Carrie Nation wielded her ax in Kansas – and Kansas was the first state to ban alcohol in its constitution .

From WikiLeaks
“ The use of chemical weapons by US forces was explicitly banned by President Gerald Ford in 1975 after CS gas [ tear gas ] had been repeatedly used in Vietnam to smoke out enemy soldiers and then kill them as they ran away .
Britain would be in a particularly sensitive position if the US used the weapons as it drafted the convention and is still seen internationally as its most important guardian .
The [ UK ] Foreign Office [ Minister of State , Mike O'Brien ] said : " All state parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention have undertaken not to use any toxic chemical or its precursor , including riot - control agents .
This applies in any armed conflict . " [ 1 ]
„ — US Prepares to Use Toxic Gases in Iraq , The Independent ( London ) , March 2 , 2003
The M33A1 bulk CS chemical dispenser , 21 of which appear together with their M254 high pressure loading kits in the leaked U.S weapons list for Iraq
JULIAN ASSANGE ( julian@wikileaks.org , investigations editor )
November 8 , 2007
The United States has at least 2,386 " non-lethal " chemical weapons deployed in Iraq .
The items appear in a spectacular 2,000 page battle planning leak obtained by government transparency group Wikileaks .
The items are labeled under the military 's own NATO supply classification Chemical weapons and equipment .
In the weeks prior to the March 19 , 2003 commencement of the Iraq war , the United States received a widely reported rebuke from its primary coalition partner , the United Kingdom , over statements by the then Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld suggesting that the US would use CS gas for " flush out " operations in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Subsequently Washington has been quiet about whether it has deployed CS gas and other chemical weapons or not . [ 2 ]
The use of chemical weapons such as CS gas for military operations is illegal .
The Chemical Weapons Convention of 1997 , drafted by the United Kingdom and ratified by the United States , declares “ Each State Party undertakes not to use riot control agents as a method of warfare ” .
Permissible uses are restricted to " law enforcement including domestic riot control . "
Riot control agents , according to former Clinton Administration National Security Council analyst Elisa D. Harris , speaking to the New York Times , are cited explicitly because they have a history of escalating misuse leading into uncontrolled chemical warfare .
They are given special treatment under the convention in a number of ways .
They are uniquely and explicitly :
defined ( Art. II.7 ) , prohibited for use as a method of warfare ( Art. I.5 ) , required to be declared ( Art. III. 1 ( e ) ) , cited in Art. X.8 ( b ) on investigation and assistance if used against a State Party , and permitted for a purpose not prohibited by the Convention , namely , “ law enforcement including domestic riot control purposes ” ( Art. II.9 ( d ) )
[ 3 ]
Most items on the Chemical weapons and equipment list were registered via the US Army Soldier and Biological Chemical Command Edgewood Chemical Biological Center , 5183 Blackhawk Rd , Gunpowder , Maryland . [ 4 ]
There is the M33A1 , as pictured above , a high pressure backpack CS / CR gas or liquid dispenser and the M254 , its high pressure loading kit .
On April 11 , 2003 the US military TACOM contracting office put out a tender solicitation for 75 to 225 units . [ 5 ]
The most numerous item on the chemical weapons equipment list is a vehicle mounted gas canister launcher , the " DISCHARGER GRSCL XM7 " , used to launch 66 mm smoke and CS gas grenades .
The split between smoke and CS gas usage cannot be determined as the list does not cover expendables such as munitions . [ 6 ]
Similarly regular field artillery or grenade launchers may be used to launch CS gas or other chemical weapons shells , and there are references to items as the L96A1 CS grenade in training literature on US Army websites [ 7 ] , but the list would not cover these cases .
Prior to the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention , the US produced a GB ( sarin ) binary nerve agent weapon , the M687 projectile ( a 155 - mm artillery shell ) , and was in the late stages of development of two other binary weapons when its known offensive chemical warfare program was terminated . [ 8 ]
N otable units with purely chemical weapons
The most commonly deployed weapon classified under 1040 - Chemical weapons and equipment is the " DISCHARGER GRSL XM7 " a vehicle mounted grenade launcher .
Since this can be used with smoke or CS gas grenades we consider those units carrying purely CS gas weapons .
M ilitary Police ( MP )
It is of interest that US MP units carry large quantities of pure CS gas weapons .
For instance , the 144th carries 13 pure CS gas dispensers , not including its 34 XM7 smoke / CS gas grenade launchers .
If these weapons are used to disperse gatherings of Iraqi civilians then we must ask to what extent US soldiers in Iraq are suppressing legitimate political dissent or undermining the just purview of the national government of Iraq .
If CS gas weapons are not being used to suppress protests or other gatherings ( " riot control " , but clearly not domestic ) then we must ask what purpose these weapons are for given that riot control agents are prohibited for use as a method of warfare under the Chemical Weapons Convention ( 1997 ) .
N on -policing units using purely CS gas weapons
If we exclude military police units and " dual use " weapons like the XM7 & FN303 , we are left with a number of combat units equipped with purely CS gas weapons .
The following information suggests that the United States has breached the Chemical Weapons Convention by employing riot control agents not only for non-domestic riot control , but as a method of warfare .
In particular , the M33A1 , pictured at the start of this article , is ideally suited to offensive urban " flush out " operations but with its full body suit has limited defensive application .
C onclusion
The extensive provisioning of CS gas by the United State to troops in Iraq appears appears to undermine the Chemical Weapons Convention .
S tory development notes for journalists
The attention given to the US chemical weapons interpretation grab in 2003 a indicates strong public interest .
In summary , the US via Rumsfeld -- a long term opponent of the CWC -- made noises about wanting to use CW in combat operations and was quickly smacked down to boldness only on border cases surrounding the ' law enforcement ' exception ( using it for extraordinary rendition flights and other detainee operations ) .
The US has since been conspicuously quiet , probably in - order not to inflame the UK , who drew up the CWC .
The situation was left " up in the air " as far as the public record is concerned , not , as far as I can determine , because of a lack of public interest , but because the war intervened before there was a settled public position .
How the story unfolds will be largely dependent on what mistakes the state department and the mod make in their public responses and how much the story is the leaking itself ( " digital mutiny by whistleblower soldiers " ) .
The 2005 white phosphorus allegations , Italian media ones at that , over the 2004 Fallujah assault saw extended public response that was a combination of reporting of a J'accuse against a liberal enemy and public sensitivity to chemical weapons hypocrisy after protracted US WMD hype ( weak in the white phosphorus case , since it was used to burn , rather than poison people , which is not covered by the CWC , but the potential for CW violating uses of white phosphorus was enough get interest ) but most of all an official denial .. later followed by a qualified recant .
For the CS gas CW weapons , the leak and a few commentators quotes can be framed , psychologically , as the J'accuse event .
The US and the MoD are in a difficult position in making public statements .
MoD is either going to have to go with its earlier statements , in which case the US is giving it the finger , or look like it is prevaricating or submissive .
The CWC is black and white about CS / OC use in combat -- it is absolutely illegal .
The weapons deployments revealed by the leak and 2003 statements are indicative of the US attempting to smash a truck through the spirit , and many say the letter of the CWC CS gas exemption provisions ( " law enforcement and ' domestic ' riot control " ) .
These and other complexities in the CWC make any US response torturous and liable to gaffs .
There are three possible replies :
1 ) " Yes -- using it in combat " .
Clear criminality .
I do n't think they 'll admit this , but there is a chance of a screw up .
Regardless , there are plenty of notables who will hammer them for an allegation of combat use and say it is illegal , including under domestic US law .
Easy to start a fight here and report it .
2 ) " No -- not using CW at all " .
A reversal of the 2003 position , unsustainable and likely to result in an embarrassing retraction .
There is a possibility of ' We equipped troops with CS / OC weapons , but deny ever employing them ' .
I doubt this statement will be made , since a single use falsifies it .
The CWC also requires that use and possession is reported to the OPWC
3 ) " Use only for ' law enforcement and riot control ' operations in Iraq and Afghanistan " .
This is the most probable reply , but is a huge can of worms .
Let us look in detail at this last , most probable , unfolding :
The leak reveals CS only weapons in the hands of combat units .
The CWC gives provision for governments to possess CWCs for ' law enforcement and DOMESTIC riot control ' .
Elsewhere the CWC outlaws military use of ' toxic ' chemicals entirely , preventing the military using CS / OC for military law enforcement , and although the US dissents from this interpretation , there are plenty of quotable sources who say the US is incorrect .
Following earlier statements by Rumsfeld , the US will likely state that it is only using CS / OC in iraq on prisoners and transporting prisoners on airplanes .
Torturous prevarication is needed to prevent the following claims :
a ) planned illegality -- leak shows several combat troops have the weapons
b ) deviousness and giving the finger to the UK -- ' law enforcement and domestic riot control ' is clearly aimed at home - country use .
c ) crushing political dissent -- what riots are they suppressing in iraq ?
d ) undermining the just preserve of the Iraqi national government .
" law enforcement and domestic riot control " is the Iraqi government 's function .
So either the iraqi government is not functional ( a US failure ) or it is being undermined in its policing activities .
e ) earlier US claims about ( wanting to ) use CS gas in prisons and transportation of can be put to Washington .
Either they will claim to have aborted this policy ( why ? more news .. ) , knocking out an excuse for possession , or they 'll agree or prevaricate .
The latter cases are a PR disaster , because they combine public resonances of previous prevarications about chemical weapons with extraordinary rendition and the conduct of the US military in running prisons such as Abu Grahib and Camp Delta at Guantanamo Bay ( GTMO ) aka ' Gitmo ' ...
C omment from Edmond Hammond , Director of the sunshine - project.org
The US has an idiosyncratic interpretation of the CWC as it apples to RCAs .
It also has an idiosyncratic definition of RCA , different tha the CWC's
The governing rules are in Executive Order 11850 , which was signed by Gerald Ford in the backlash from US use of CS in Vietnam ( as a lethal force multiplier ) .
EO11850 is not consistent with the CWC but was nevertheless reaffirmed at the time of US ratification of the CWC .
EO11850 restricts US military use of RCAs and essentially requires the authorization of the President or , in certain circumstances , the Secretary of Defense .
I actually FOIAed for any such authorizations a few years ago .
Surprise .... no response !
The kinds of uses foreseen in EO11850 were to protect nuclear weapons ( this is 70s ... image protesting Filipinos getting unruly at Subic Bay , or some crazy hardcore West German protestors trying an unarmed assault on a US nuke ) and downed pilot rescue ; but the language is squishy .
http://www.sunshine-project.org/publications/pr/pr070203.html
It 's up for argument about how sensitive the US CS data is ( I would say there is no reason for it to be secret ) ; but it would likely be held in close proximity to stuff that truly is extremely sensitive .
OPCW has all sorts of data on location and quantity and security measures for undestroyed Russian , US , South Korean , and other chemical munitions ( VX , Sarin , et cet . ) .
As well as all sorts of commercial data .
They would take information security extremely seriously .
I have no sympathy for the companies ; but OPCW does know some things that are probably best left in as few hands as possible .
Also , leaks from OPCW might provide ammunition for the bad guys who would like to weaken the treaty regime .
The US declarations to the OPCW , however , would not only be in The Hague .
They would of course be in Washington too ...

Women who have children later
in life make better mothers ,
according to a study .
They are more likely than younger
counterparts to be financially secure
and in stable relationships .
They are also happier to put their jobs
on hold because they have already
achieved many career goals .
Older mothers also tend to enjoy better
health and live longer .
The findings , which appear in a book by
Professor Elizabeth Gregory , will be welcomed
by the growing numbers of women
who are choosing to delay motherhood
until well into their 30s .
The average age at which women in
Britain are giving birth has slowly risen to
29 while there has been a much sharper
increase in the numbers choosing to start
families in their late 30s and early 40s .
More than 22,000 women over 40 had
babies here last year , a quarter of them
for the first time .
And ten times as many
women have their first child between 35
and 39 nowadays than in 1975 , with 13
times as many between 40 and 44 .
The trend is typified by high - profile
mothers such as Jennifer Lopez , who is
pregnant at 38 , Halle Berry , who is
expecting at 41 and Desperate Housewives
actress Marcia Cross , who had
twins at 44 .
Professor Gregory , who is director of
women 's studies at the University of
Houston in Texas , said : " I have found an
overwhelming number and range of reasons
why what I call the ' new later mothers '
are absolutely right to delay motherhood .
" For one thing , they have a stronger family
focus rather than trying to juggle priorities
because they have achieved many of their personal
and career goals .
" They also have more financial power
because new later mothers have established
careers and higher salaries .
And they they have more career experience and
their management skills often translate
directly into managing a household and
advocating for their children . "
Not only are they more likely to be married ,
they also tend to have a stronger
network of close friends , she added .
Professor John Mirowsky , an expert on
the issue from Texas University in Austin ,
believes the prime age for childbearing to
maximise maternal health and longevity
is between 34 and 40 .
He said : " While younger women are
more fertile and biologically fit , older
mothers tend to be more mature and less
likely to engage in risky behaviour , and
they are more settled educationally ,
financially and emotionally . "
The American claims are unlikely to end
the age debate , however .
As well as the possibility of growing infertile , older mothers
are said to face an increased risk of
health complications during pregnancy ,
while their babies are more likely to have
conditions such as Down 's Syndrome .

Ireland ( TGW ) – Ireland ’s environment minister announced plans to ban traditional lightbulbs starting in 2009 and to penalize high - emission vehicles , starting July 2008 .
Ireland has had a tax on plastic bags for several years .
Lightbulbs
The new standard , announced by Environment Minister John Gormley , is intended to promote energy saving cars and lightbulbs .
" The aim of such a move will be to end the use of incandescent light bulbs in Ireland , " Gormley , who is leader of the Irish Green Party , told fellow lawmakers .
" These bulbs use technology invented during the age of the steam engine . "
The move to end the use of conventional lightbulbs reduce CO2 emissions by 700,000 tonnes a year save $ 296.3 million on household electricity bills .
Cars
Starting in July , all cars registered in Ireland will be taxed based on their greenhouse gas emissions : 100 euros for the greenest , 2000 for the worst .
Cars that are already registered will be taxed based on engine size .
Finance Minister Brian Cowen admitted that even with the new regulations , it will be hard to meet the standards of the EU .
" An even greater effort will be needed to achieve up to a 30 percent cut envisaged by the EU for 2020 , " he said .

Factory prices have risen strongly led by higher energy bills
Prices paid to US producers rose 3.2 % in November , the highest monthly gain since 1973 , said the Labor Department .
Most of the rise was caused by food and energy price increases , which would normally lead to higher interest rates .
Yet earlier this week , the Federal Reserve cut rates by a quarter - point to ease the housing and credit slump .
It reduced rates from 4.5 % to 4.25 % , its third cut in as many months .
The Fed said that despite the latest reduction , it would " continue to monitor inflation developments " .
' Intensifying inflation '
Excluding food and energy bills , core factory prices rose 0.4 % in November , the highest rise since February .
In terms of the retail sales , these numbers should put some of the fears to rest that consumers are going to stay at home this holiday season
Mark Vitner , economist at Wachovia Securities
Separate official data on Thursday , showing stronger - than - expected US retail sales in November , also suggested the Fed might not have had to cut rates so extensively .
Retail sales rose 1.2 % last month , twice as much as market forecasts , said the Commerce Department .
It was the biggest monthly gain in retail sales since January 2006 , indicating that US consumer confidence remains resilient despite continuing woes in the housing and credit markets .
" Excluding food and energy prices , we are still seeing intensifying inflationary pressures , " said Mark Vitner , economist at Wachovia Securities .
" And that 's one of the reasons why the Fed is having to be as cautious as it has been , in terms of not cutting by half a percentage point every time , like the financial markets seem to want it to .
" In terms of the retail sales , these numbers should put some of the fears to rest that consumers are going to stay at home this holiday season . "
Market concerns
The latest figures appeared to do little to cheer investors , with all three main US share indexes falling in morning trading in New York .
Wall Street 's main Dow Jones index was down 60 points to 13,414 .
" Concerns about the economic environment have not gone away , " said Stephen Briggs , economist at SGCIB .
" The figures at lunchtime suggest there is an inflation problem and Fed 's got a difficult job . "

I tried something new in this class .
Instead of running through the slides in a pre-determined order , I made up a master menu of class sections , and had the audience members raise their hands to express interest in each section .
Then I tried to do the sections more or less in order by what was considered interesting .
Master Menu
But it also works to read the slides in order , starting from slide # 1 , in which case what you will see is :

Gen Musharraf said the army was the saviour of Pakistan
Gen Musharraf passed a ceremonial baton to Gen Ashfaq Pervez Kayani at the army 's headquarters .
In his farewell address , Gen Musharraf said the army was his " life " and he was proud to have been the commander of this " great force " .
He had been under huge pressure to quit as army chief and is due to be sworn in as civilian president on Thursday .
Opposition leader Benazir Bhutto welcomed President Musharraf quitting his army post but said her party was in no hurry to accept him as a civilian leader .
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said President Musharraf 's stepping down was a good first step but called for a state of emergency to be lifted ahead of January elections .
President Musharraf has led Pakistan 's military for nine turbulent years .
As a civilian leader he will have to work out a relationship with a new army chief and an elected prime minister .
The BBC's M Ilyas Khan in Karachi says President Musharraf has shown great resilience over the years , often bouncing back when seemingly on the ropes .
His legacy as a military leader on the front line of the " war on terror " is a country beset by militancy .
Despite his having preached " enlightened moderation " , President Musharraf is a reluctant democrat whose policies have provided political space for religious conservatives to the exclusion of moderates and liberals , our correspondent says .
' Half a century '
Dressed in full military uniform , Gen Musharraf arrived at the ceremony with a baton under his left arm .
On his arrival , he was greeted by Gen Kayani and inspected a guard of honour .
A military band played Pakistan 's national anthem and the ceremony began with a recitation from the Koran .
The colourful ceremony was shown live on national television .
" I am bidding farewell to the army after having been in uniform for 46 years , " Gen Musharraf said in his address .
He became army chief in October 1998 .
" This army is my life , my passion .
I love this army , and this relationship will continue , although I will not be in uniform , " he said .
Gen Musharraf added :
" I am fortunate to have commanded the best army in the world .
This army is an integrating force , the saviour of Pakistan .
" Without this army , the entity of Pakistan cannot exist . "
' Excellent soldier '
Gen Musharraf expressed full faith in the ability of his successor , Gen Kayani , to lead the force .
People in Pakistan give their rections as Musharraf quits as head of the army
In pictures
" He 's an excellent soldier and I can say with full confidence that under his command , the armed forces will achieve great heights , " Gen Musharraf said .
He had designated Gen Kayani , a former head of the intelligence services , as his successor in October .
The most serious pressure on the president to give up his uniform had come from the United States , his main international backer .
Washington has grown concerned in recent months at the army 's inability to rein in pro-Taleban militants and by Gen Musharraf 's growing unpopularity .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The issue is not the individual , Pervez Musharraf .
The real issue is the stranglehold that Pakistan Army has over every sphere of life .
Nausherwan Lahori , Lahore
Send us your comments
As a civilian leader , President Musharraf will still have considerable powers , including the ability to sack a civilian government .
He imposed emergency rule on 3 November in order , he said , to control an unruly judiciary and deal with the growing threat from Islamist militants .
General elections are to be held on 8 January .
President Musharraf 's critics in Pakistan and allies in the West say they cannot be free and fair unless the emergency is lifted .
One of the most common ways to guard yourself against credit card misuse is to sign the back of your card , so that merchants can check the signature on your card with that on your ID .
Right ?
Well , maybe not .
According to financial blog The Tao of Making Money , the best practice is not to sign it .
Here 's our official advice on signing the strip on the back : Do n't sign it .
It 's useless as a deterrent , as anyone who takes your card then has a sample of your signature which they can not only use on any charge slip , but on your checks as well .
However , do not leave the white strip blank .
In that space , write : " Ask For Picture ID , " and be prepared to back that up someday when you 're in a hurry and the clerk wants to see a driver 's license as well as the card .
It makes the charge transaction a little longer , but a lot safer .

I 've been doing this for years and while it's not a perfect solution , it certainly is better than nothing .
Let 's hear your thoughts on this : signing , or not signing ?
You know what to do .

DALY CITY , Calif . --
One of the biggest sources of political donations to Hillary Rodham Clinton is a tiny , lime - green bungalow that lies under the flight path from San Francisco International Airport .
Six members of the Paw family , each listing the house at 41 Shelbourne Ave. as their residence , have donated a combined $ 45,000 to the Democratic senator from New York since 2005 , for her presidential campaign , her Senate re-election last year and her political action committee .
In all , the six Paws have donated a total of $ 200,000 ...
Provigil , a " wakefulness promoting agent , " is banned at the Olympics , even though , probably , it has no effect on physical performance .
Despite what the Olympics says , it is n't a stimulant .
If Provigil has any effect on a specific athlete 's physical performance beyond keeping them awake , I 'd argue it was placebo effect .
So a drug with a placebo effect is illegal .
Fine .
But what about the reverse situation : what about giving an actual placebo to an athlete , and telling them it's oh , I do n't know , growth hormone ?
Or Ritalin ?
One woman was on her second career and married to a man who already had children .
She was certain she did n’t want a child of her own .
Then she hit 45 , and suddenly having a baby was the only thing that mattered .
Other women were busy with medical , law or graduate school and then long hours at the office .
Their 40s just seemed to sneak up on them .
Some of them spent years looking for a partner before choosing to become a single mother , or needed time to get used to the idea of a lesbian couple having a child .
Dr. Ingrid A. Rodi , a Santa Monica fertility specialist , understands why many of her patients have delayed childbearing until their 40s .
At 53 , she has lived through the social and medical revolutions fueling today ’s over - 40 baby boom .
Advertisement
“ Egg donation and fertility treatments make having children in your 40s more possible , ” she said .
“ But you start getting into progressive difficulties for mother and child . ”
The advice Rodi dispenses has n’t changed that much from that given to her own mother more than 50 years ago :
If you ’re in your early 30s and want to have children , it ’s best to get the show on the road .
Not everyone , she said , welcomes the warning .
Although they make up only about 5 % of overall births in California , births for U.S. - born women ages 40 to 44 have increased threefold since 1982 , according to a recently published analysis from the Public Policy Institute of California , a nonpartisan think tank .
Societal changes such as better educational and career opportunities for women are common reasons for delaying childbearing , said demographer Hans P. Johnson , the report ’s author .

But with those births comes greater risk .
Older mothers are more likely to develop high blood pressure and gestational diabetes and to give birth to premature and low - birth - weight babies .
Even the use of donor eggs does not guarantee a healthy child -- or pregnancy itself .
Women begin to have fertility problems about 10 to 15 years before they experience menopause , Rodi said .
The average age of menopause is 50 to 52 , but it can range from 40 to 60 .
Women have no way of knowing for sure at what point in the spectrum they ’ll fall .
A string of well - publicized celebrity post - 40 pregnancies makes it look easy :
In February , “ Desperate Housewives ” star Marcia Cross gave birth to twins ; actress Holly Hunter became a mother of twins last year ; and Geena Davis had her twins in 2004 .
Advertisement
But even in vitro fertilization rates decline with age when older women use their own eggs .
( The newest fertility breakthrough , announced this year , may allow younger women to freeze eggs for use later . )
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the average chance for a 40 - year - old woman undergoing assisted reproductive therapy to become pregnant using her own eggs was 23 % , and to successfully carry the pregnancy through to birth , about 16 % .
Both rates dropped steadily with each one - year increase in age .
Using donor eggs , however , raises the chances for a successful live birth to 51 % for women over 40 , according to the CDC .
“ Because it ’s so reliable , the number of women getting egg donation is going up every year , ” Rodi said .
“ And that is contributing significantly to the number of pregnancies in women in their 40s . ”
Donor eggs also eliminate some of the risks associated with older childbearing , said Dr. Richard Paulson , chief of the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility at USC ’s Keck School of Medicine and a pioneer of egg donation .
Aging eggs not only contribute to infertility and miscarriages but are more likely to have chromosomal abnormalities .

Despite the advantages of using donor eggs , admitting to doing so is one of the few remaining reproductive taboos -- among celebrity and regular moms alike .
And donor eggs are n’t foolproof -- nor are they cheap .
Treatment can cost from $ 10,000 to more than $ 25,000 per attempt , with high - demand donors such as Ivy League graduates and models commanding higher fees .
What ’s more , “ virtually every complication associated with obstetrics is increased with increased maternal age , if you look at it statistically , ” Paulson said .
“ But most of us believe that if women get good prenatal care and are carefully followed , the outcome is very good . ”

Dr. Alan R. Fleischman , medical director for the March of Dimes , an organization primarily concerned with the eradication of birth defects , is less optimistic .
“ All of the complications of pregnancy -- high blood pressure , preeclampsia [ a rapidly progressing hypertension that affects mother and fetus ] , fetal death , prematurity , low birth weight -- occur at higher rates in older women than in younger women , ” he said .
“ That ’s true with or without assisted reproductive technologies . ”
A 2004 study of Swedish women found the rate of premature births for women ages 40 to 44 to be 150 % higher than for women 20 to 29 , Fleischman said .
Prematurity is the leading cause of infant mortality in the United States , accounting for more than a third of all infant deaths , according to the CDC .
Even those born just a few weeks early -- from 34 to 36 weeks -- are six times more likely than full - term babies to die during their first week , according to a study by the March of Dimes published in the November Journal of Pediatrics .
Advertisement
These babies are also at greater risk of breathing problems , feeding difficulties and trouble regulating body temperatures , Fleischman said .
Extremely premature babies are more likely to have developmental problems , from minor to severe retardation , and to be disabled .
Among the complications that concern Fleischman most are those posed by multiple births .
Older women are more likely to conceive twins or triplets naturally as well as to use fertility treatments that result in multiple births , he said .
And multiple births -- twins , triplets and higher - order multiples -- in turn increase all the other complications of pregnancy .
According to the CDC , among all women using assisted reproductive technology , 15 % of single births , 64 % of twins and 98 % of triplets or higher - order multiples were premature .
“ I do n’t think [ women ] believe it ’s going to happen to them , ” Fleischman said .
“ I do n’t believe they are well - informed sometimes by their obstetricians and their general physicians about the risk . ”
Advertisement
The March of Dimes strongly recommends pre-conception counseling for older women , and if they decide to proceed with pregnancy , to have their obstetrician assess their risk of diabetes and high blood pressure .
Before trying to conceive , the agency recommends that women get in the best physical shape they can and take daily vitamins , including folic acid , which has been shown to prevent birth defects .
If they are planning to use reproductive technology , they need to understand the risks involved with multiple births .
Some fertility experts believe that awareness of the risks is already rising -- and that the boom in over - 40s births may have peaked .
“ What I ’m curious about is whether this trend is going to continue or whether it is in fact going to reverse , ” said Paulson , who directs the USC Fertility Clinic .
“ We ’ve raised the consciousness of the population to the fact that the biological clock is a reality . ”
Rodi agrees .
She had her two children at 32 and 34 , earlier than many of her contemporaries .
But then , she was a fertility specialist .
Advertisement
“ I remember having to think very clearly , ‘ It ’s time to get married , ’ ” she said .
Even so , she and her husband , who is also a physician , waited to begin a family for five years , until they had completed their medical training .
That ’s not the case for many fledgling doctors today .
“ Women in residency programs are having children today , ” Rodi said , “ once it became clear that you could n’t postpone having children forever . ”

You can read the machine translated English article here .
The author of the state 's immigration bill said Wednesday he will file legislation seeking to make English the official language in Oklahoma and to give law officers the right to seize assets , such as a vehicle or a home , when used to transport or house illegal immigrants .
Rep. Randy Terrill said the measure , which he dubbed " son of 1804 bill ” in reference to his House Bill 1804 that won overwhelming approval in both chambers of the Legislature this year , also would require school districts to provide a more accurate accounting of how many children who are here illegally attend their schools .
Estimates are children who are here illegally cost the state 's schools about $ 160 million a year , he said .
He thinks the cost is much higher .
Charging ahead
Terrill , R - Moore , said he wants to crack down on so - called anchor babies , children whose mothers come to the United States to give birth .
The U.S. Constitution states children born in this country are U.S. citizens .
About 30 states have passed legislation making English the official language , and the timing is right in Oklahoma , he said .
" That is some unfinished business that we need to take care of here with regard to an overall real meaningful immigration reform package , ” Terrill said as he announced his ideas to members of the Oklahoma Conservative Political Action Committee .
" You have my commitment on this , ” Terrill said .
" I 'm never going to give up on this issue .
We 're going to continue to charge ahead . ”
His idea to deal with babies born to illegal immigrants would be for Oklahoma to refuse to issue a birth certificate , he said .
Instead , the state would send an acknowledgement of birth to the U.S. embassy or consulate of the parents ' nation of origin requesting a birth certificate .
" That would set up the legal challenge because you would have unlawfully present , foreign national parents who would be suing the state of Oklahoma to try to get a birth certificate for a child who they would be claiming is a U.S. citizen , ” he said .
Law enforcement changes
Terrill 's legislation also calls for providing financial incentives to local police and sheriff departments to send officers to get federal training on immigration issues , he said .
Tulsa County is the only county in the state that has a partnership with the U.S. Immigration , Customs and Enforcement to track the immigration status of people arrested for crimes .
That office " is the model for how our other state and local law enforcement agencies in Oklahoma ought to be enforcing federal immigration law , ” he said .
Terrill said he has received calls from legislators in about 12 states interested in writing similar legislation to HB 1804 , which makes it criminal to transport , hire , harbor , house or conceal illegal immigrants .
It also requires local law enforcement agencies to check immigration status .
The law , which went into effect last week , effectively ends state - sponsored benefits for those who cannot prove they are legally in the United States .
He predicted as many as 30 states will consider similar legislation during the next few months .
Terrill said he also wants to introduce legislation to reverse a policy that allows illegal immigrant mothers to receive state and federally subsidized prenatal care in Oklahoma .
" I'm a conservative pro-life Republican , I believe that life begins in conceptions , ” Terrill said .
" And I believe that there are certain basic human rights that come in with personhood , the biggest one being the protection of your right to life .
But that is a much different concept than being a legal U.S. citizen . ”

Madeleine Albright , who quipped that the deaths of half a million Iraqi children were “ worth it , ” infamously called America the “ indispensable nation . ”
Max
Boot echoes her saying that “ we guarantee the security of the world , protect our allies , keep critical seal - lanes open and lead the war on terror . ”
Madeleine and Max and their neoliberal and neoconservative interventionist ilk would be wise to give ear to this parable told by the Chinese Taoist Chuang Tzu , translated here by Lin Yutang :
Tsech ’i of Nan-po was traveling on the hill of Shang when he saw a large tree which astonished him very much .
A thousand chariot teams of four horses could find shelter under its shade .
“ What tree is this ? ” cried Tsech ’i .
“ Surely it must be unusually fine timber . ”
Then looking up , he saw that its branches were too crooked for rafters ; and looking down he saw that the trunk ’s twisting loose grain made it valueless for coffins .
He tasted a leaf , but it took the skin off his lips ; and its odor was so strong that it would make a man intoxicated for three days together .
“ Ah ! ” said Tsech ’i , “ this tree is really good for nothing , and that is how it has attained this size .
A spiritual man might well follow its example of uselessness . ”
The moral of the story : make yourself indispensable and you are likely to get cut down .
Earlier in the text , our sage also contemplates a useless tree and draws a lesson from which interventionists of all stripes would be wise to learn :
Hueitse said to Chuangtse , “ I have a large tree , called the ailanthus .
Its trunk is so irregular and knotty that it cannot be measured out for planks ; while its branches are so twisted that they can not be cut out into discs or squares .
It stands by the roadside , but no carpenter will look at it .
Your words are like that tree  big and useless , of no concern to the world . ”
“ Have you never seen a wild cat , ” rejoined Chuangtse , “ crouching down in wait for its prey ?
Right and left and high and low , it springs about , until it gets caught in a trap or dies in a snare .
On the other hand , there is the yak with its great huge body .
It is big enough in all conscience , but it can not catch mice .
Now if you have a big tree and are at a loss what to do with it , why not plant it in the Village of Nowhere , in the great wilds , where you might loiter idly by its side , and lie down in blissful repose beneath its shade ?
There it would be safe from the ax and from all other injury .
For being of no use to others , what could worry its mind ? ”
America ’s geography has been her greatest blessing .
Like “ the yak with its great huge body , ” her land is large and bountiful , protected on either side by vast seas .
She is far away from the rest of the world , in the “ Village of Nowhere ” if you will .
She has no need to imitate the “ wild cat ” that “ springs about , until it gets caught in a trap or dies in a snare . ”
Let her rather remain contentedly at home “ in the great wilds ” to “ loiter idly ” and “ lie down in blissful repose . ”
Our Founding Fathers understood this without ever having read Chinese philosophy .
George Washington and Thomas Jefferson warned us of “ foreign entanglements ” and “ entangling alliances . ”
The original Taoist , Lao Tzu , would agree .
In the Tao Te Ching , translated here by James Legge , the sage reminds us that “ [ w ] herever a host is stationed , briars and thorns spring . ”
Yet America has had troops stationed in Germany , Japan , and Korea for more than six decades !
Lao
Tzu might laugh , but the founders would be appalled .
John Quincy Adams said of America that “ she goes not abroad , in search of monsters to destroy . ”
But what has America been doing since 1898 if not “ go[ing ] … abroad , in search of monsters to destroy . ”
After 105 years of “ spring[ing ] about , ” America was duped into the biggest foreign policy blunder in her history .
Like Chuang
Tzu’s “ wild cat , ” she has been “ caught in a trap . ”
There is a time for legitimate military action when attacked , but prudence and restraint is always called for .
America would have been spared the quagmire that followed the justifiable pursuit of terrorists in Afghanistan and the unjustifiable invasion of Iraq had her leaders followed the advice of Lao Tzu :
A skilful ( commander ) strikes a decisive blow , and stops .
He does not dare ( by continuing his operations ) to assert and complete his mastery .
He will strike the blow , but will be on his guard against being vain or boastful or arrogant in consequence of it .
He strikes it as a matter of necessity ; he strikes it , but not from a wish for mastery .
“ Now arms , however beautiful , are instruments of evil omen , hateful , it may be said , to all creatures , ” Lao Tzu continues .
“ Therefore they who have the Tao do not like to employ them . ”
Not so our chickenhawks .
The imbroglio in the Middle East and the resulting isolation of America can only be turned around by America returning to her founding principle of non-interventionism .
And there is only one presidential candidate who is suggesting this sagely course , the author of this brilliant essay : The Original Foreign Policy .

The Best of Joshua Snyder
Police deployed aircraft with heat - seeking equipment in the search A canoeist who went missing , presumed drowned , more than five years ago , has walked into a London police station .
The shattered remains of John Darwin 's red canoe were found washed up on a beach in Seaton Carew , near Hartlepool , in March 2002 .
An extensive search was launched but no trace was ever found of Mr Darwin , who was then aged 51 .
" It is not known at this time where he has spent the last five - and - a - half years , " said a police spokesman .
Cleveland Police said that Mr Darwin , a married father - of - two , walked into the West End Central Police Station in London at 17.30 GMT last night .
The spokesman added : " Mr Darwin is fit and well and relatives have been informed of his whereabouts . "
' Limbo ' Mr Darwin 's disappearance sparked agony for his family .
John Darwin , 51 , was seen entering the sea in the Seaton Carew area with his kayak at 0800 GMT on Thursday 21 March 2002 .
At the time Mr Darwin was working as a prison officer , and the alarm was not raised until 21.30 when it was reported he had failed to arrive for a night shift .
Police and coastguard officers searched the coastline from Hartlepool down to Staithes , North Yorkshire , deploying five RNLI lifeboats , two coastguard rescue teams and a police fixed - wing aircraft with heat - seeking equipment - to no avail .
His wife Anne , a doctor 's receptionist , said six months after her husband vanished : " People die , have a funeral , they have a headstone , there is something to mark the fact they existed on this earth .
" But without a body , I do n't know how we can mark John 's life .
" All I want is to bury his body .
It would enable me to move on .
It 's difficult to grieve without bringing things to a close , but as it is I 'm in limbo and there 's nothing I can do . "

What are these ?
Recent probes inside comets show it is overwhelmingly likely that life began in space , according to a new paper by Cardiff University scientists .
Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe and colleagues at the University 's Centre for Astrobiology have long argued the case for panspermia - the theory that life began inside comets and then spread to habitable planets across the galaxy .
A recent BBC Horizon documentary traced the development of the theory .
Now the team claims that findings from space probes sent to investigate passing comets reveal how the first organisms could have formed .
The 2005 Deep Impact mission to Comet Tempel 1 discovered a mixture of organic and clay particles inside the comet .
One theory for the origins of life proposes that clay particles acted as a catalyst , converting simple organic molecules into more complex structures .
The 2004 Stardust Mission to Comet Wild 2 found a range of complex hydrocarbon molecules - potential building blocks for life .
The Cardiff team suggests that radioactive elements can keep water in liquid form in comet interiors for millions of years , making them potentially ideal " incubators " for early life .
They also point out that the billions of comets in our solar system and across the galaxy contain far more clay than the early Earth did .
The researchers calculate the odds of life starting on Earth rather than inside a comet at one trillion trillion ( 10 to the power of 24 ) to one against .
Professor Wickramasinghe said : " The findings of the comet missions , which surprised many , strengthen the argument for panspermia .
We now have a mechanism for how it could have happened .
All the necessary elements - clay , organic molecules and water - are there .
The longer time scale and the greater mass of comets make it overwhelmingly more likely that life began in space than on earth . "
The new paper , The Origin of Life in Comets , by Professor Wickramasinghe , Professor Bill Napier and Dr Janaki Wickramasinghe is to be published shortly by the International Journal of Astrobiology .
In my dissertation , I addressed the issue of transformed identity in virtual environments .
Below is the abstract and link to a PDF of the full text .
Abstract
Digital media allows us to make both dramatic and subtle changes to our self - representations with an ease not available elsewhere .
These changes can greatly affect how we interact with others in virtual environments .
For example , facial and behavioral mimicry can make us more likeable and persuasive .
In addition to gaining social advantages , our avatars ( digital representations of ourselves ) can also change how we behave .
This occurs via conforming to expected behaviors of the avatar - a process referred to as the Proteus Effect .
I conducted a series of four pilot studies that explore the Proteus Effect .
In the first study , I found that participants in attractive avatars walked closer to and disclosed more information to a stranger than participants in unattractive avatars .
In the second study , I found that participants in taller avatars negotiated more aggressively in a bargaining task than participants in shorter avatars .
In the third study , I demonstrated that the Proteus Effect occurs in an actual online community .
And in the final study , I showed that the Proteus Effect persists outside of the virtual environment .
Placing someone in a taller avatar changes how they consequently negotiate in a face - to - face setting .
The two dissertation studies extended these pilot studies by attempting to clarify the underlying process that leads to the Proteus Effect .
In the first dissertation study , I isolated and teased out the unique contribution of the Proteus Effect from an alternative explanation - priming .
Priming is a process whereby visual stimulus ( such as words or photographs ) leads someone to behave in a semantically - consistent manner .
In the second dissertation study , I extrapolated from existing theories of stereotype formation to examine the consequences of placing users in implausible bodies that fall outside the range of normal human variation ( such as a very short or very tall body ) .
Demonstrators descended on Ottawa today to protest against a summit meeting between the leaders of Canada , Mexico and the US .
The main issues being discussed at the summit are water and potential exports to the US .
Since Canada first negotiated a free trade deal with the US in 1988 , many in Canada have thought one thing about US motives : America wants Canada 's water .
The often parched US south - west , the fastest growing part of that country , has a enormous thirst for water and Canada has a quarter of all the world 's fresh water .
The summit does not even begin until tomorrow , but 5,000 people turned out in Ottawa to protest .
Concerns grew when a leading opposition politician accused Prime Minister Stephen Harper last week of having secret negotiations with the US over the export of Canadian water .
WASHINGTON , Oct. 30 — Congress authorized spending of $ 43.5 billion over the past year to operate spy satellites , remote surveillance stations and C.I.A. outposts overseas , according to a budget figure released Tuesday by Mike McConnell , director of national intelligence .
Government officials have refused for years to disclose the intelligence budget , citing risks to national security if the United States ’ adversaries learned what it spent annually on spy services .
But lawmakers , acting on a recommendation by the Sept. 11 commission , pushed a law through Congress this summer requiring that the director of national intelligence reveal the spending authorization figure within 30 days after the close of the fiscal year , which ended Sept. 30 .
The number released Tuesday does not include the billions of dollars that military services spend annually on intelligence operations .
The total spying budget for the last fiscal year , including this Pentagon spending , is said to have been in excess of $ 50 billion .

Mozilla said Thursday it has launched version 2.0.0.9 of its Thunderbird email application , recommending users upgrade to the new software and saying it fixed some security issues .
Automated notifications of the update will start to push out to clients within 24 to 48 hours , the organization said in a posting .
The most recent release of Thunderbird was version 2.0.0.6 , but Mozilla said it " skipped a few numbers in order to catch up with Firefox , " the web browser it puts out .
According to a list of Mozilla security advisories , the update fixes some issues Thunderbird had in working on the Windows platform , and also " Crashes with evidence of memory corruption . "
The latter issue was announced as an advisory last month , Mozilla said that after looking at evidence of memory corruption in certain circumstances , " we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code . "
It added that because Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox , it could be vulnerable if Javascript were enabled in mail .
The update addresses those issues .
The latest update is available for Windows , Mac and Linux platforms , Mozilla said .

D - Ed Reckoning notes that standardized test scores have been going up recently .
But why ?
Is it due to The No Child Left Behind Law or is there another reason ?
Will the trend continue ?
And is there an " I.Q Achievement Gap " in our kids ' future ?
Reckoning College student Margaret Paynich links to ( and comments upon ) a piece by Julia Steiny that posits an interesting idea : " Do adults who ask the right questions help teens make the right choices ? "
There 's some Food for thought there ...

Over at HUNBlog , they take a look at the issue
and present their case
.
Here 's a sample :
Paradigms for education must be found that take social inequities into consideration .
( Granted , whereas I agree that this approach too often leads to negative results due to a lowering of expectations , it does not need to .
With the discipline to hold all students to the same standards while at the same time recognizing the additional needs of challenged students , we should be able to identify ways to provide the additional help needed to succeed . )
In California , voters said " no " recently to Universal Preschool .

We liked what we read
when RedKudu said
,
Teachers are never fully prepared for what they will encounter in the classroom .
There are not enough student - teaching hours in a lifetime to ready one for the constant daily exposure to a clientele so reluctant and resistant as a student .
The daunting arrival of new initiatives for education , poorly supported by equal financial enthusiasm , make public school teaching in this day and age a strange , almost apocalyptic landscape , the survivors of which are those who learn how to dumpster dive for useful left - overs , convince students to keep the caps on markers so they do n't dry out , and turn a sheet of black poster paper into a working chalkboard .
